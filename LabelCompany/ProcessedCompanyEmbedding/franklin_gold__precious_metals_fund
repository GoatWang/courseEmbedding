investment officer us global investors today i want to discuss reports that global debt levels are at alltime highs and what this means for your investment decisions going forward but first a few comments about this past week i recently returned from the oxford club’s private wealth seminar held at the historic grand hotel on michigan’s mackinac island the hotel which some of you might remember as the setting for the  film “somewhere in time” starring christopher reeve and jane seymour took a mere  days to build in the s—impossible by today’s standards especially when you consider that it boasts the world’s largest front porch at  feet while there i had the privilege of catching up with some old friends and contacts including alex green the oxford club’s chief investment strategist you might have read some of his wonderful work for investment u the group’s educational arm alex reminded me over lunch that the difference between democrats and republicans in his view is that democrats are for personal freedom and some economic restrictions while republicans are for economic freedom and some personal restrictions i prefer to focus on policies instead of partisan politics but alex has a point i’m convinced that donald trump a republican won the presidential election because his pledge to reform the tax code and deregulate resonated with both whitecollar and bluecollar americans who felt as if the us economy was no longer working for them us corporate taxes are among the highest in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd spurring large multinationals to move operations overseas and outofcontrol regulations threaten to strangle business growth but just as green insinuated the trump administration has enacted or has hinted at enacting policies that rankle americans of all political stripes precisely because they could be used to encroach upon personal liberties take attorney general jeff sessions’ recent decision to strengthen the government’s ability to seize private property from suspected criminals the operative word here is “suspected” many now are arguing this directive could be abused by police and other officials it could in fact violate the fourth amendment which of course protects americans against “unreasonable searches and seizures” this is just one among numerous policymaking decisions that have members of both political parties as well as independents scratching their heads trump was elected to reform taxes slash regulations and generally make business and capital formation run more smoothly it’s unclear how privateasset seizures fit into that picture if this administration resolved to stay on message and on course and worked to bring fiscal relief to everyday americans it might receive greater support from those who voted for trump—and perhaps even from those who didn’t us dollar in bear market a boon for gold since the start of the year the fiveyear treasury yield adjusted for inflation has risen about  percent normally this would put remarkable pressure on the price of gold—higher yields raise the opportunity cost of buying gold—but over the same period the us dollar has steadily weakened and is now officially in a bear market because gold is priced in dollars this has been supportive for prices yeartodate the yellow metal is up more than  percent click to enlarge as i said the greenback’s been on the decline for most of the year so far but it slumped to a month low against the euro this week following european central bank ecb president mario draghi’s remark that “monetary accommodation” would continue in the european union eu until at least the end of the year “we need to be persistent and patient and prudent because we’re not there yet” draghi said referring to the fact that eu inflation and wage growth have been disappointingly slow despite the bloc’s economic recovery since the financial crisis indeed the june purchasing manager’s indexes for emerging european markets were all above the key  mark for the first time in recent memory ubs we’re still constructive on gold that gold is still holding at its current level—despite rising rates despite a stock market that continues to rally—is “encouraging” that’s one of the key takeaways from a ubs note this week in which the swiss financial services firm maintains its constructive view of the yellow metal investor demand this year has been slower than expected but ubs analyst joni teves makes the case that expectations of a good monsoon season in india this summer could help push consumption in the world’s secondlargest importer of gold to a new record high by the end of the year with india having imported a phenomenal  metric tons in the first half of  alone teves writes that “we expect gold demand in india this year to be around historic averages” which would be very supportive for prices etps attracted a record  billion in the first half of  exchangetraded products etps also had a knockout first half as deutsche bank reports this week etps attracted a record  billion in the first six months of  in what has historically been the weaker half of the year to put into perspective just how impressive this figure is  billion would be the secondlargest fullyear record amount following ’s  billion we could see etp inflows climb as high as  billion by the end of this year deutsche estimates click to enlarge of course runaway demand for etps and other risk assets has contributed to muted interest in gold having said that though bullionvault—the world’s number one online precious metals market—reported last week that private gold holdings among its users leaped to a record  metric tons as of the beginning of july that’s enough gold to make more than  million carat wedding rings bullionvault says or to supply the microchips for  billion iphones the site points out that investor demand has lately been driven by lower prices following three months of “light liquidation” global debt on alert all of what i’ve said so far pertains to the nearterm gold’s medium to longterm investment case i believe looks even brighter many unsettling risks loom on the horizon—not least of which is a record amount of global debt—that could potentially spell trouble for the investor who hasn’t adequately prepared with some allocation in a “safe haven” according to the highlyrespected institute of international finance iif global debt levels reached an astronomical  trillion in the first quarter of —that’s  percent of world gross domestic product gdp notice that before the financial crisis global debt was “only” around  trillion meaning we’ve added close to  trillion in as little as a decade much of the leveraging occurred in emerging markets specifically china which is spending big on international infrastructure projects click to enlarge it goes without saying that this is a huge risk some are calling this mountain of debt “the mother of all bubbles” and we all remember how the last two bubbles ended in  the tech or dotcom bubble and  the housing bubble paying down this debt will not be easy as scotiabank mentions in a note this week “higher interest rates are going to make the burden of refinancing the debt considerably heavier and as more money goes into servicing the debt it means less money is available to spend on other things which could lead to less infrastructure spending and increased austerity” add to this the fact that global pension levels are also sharply on the rise with people living longer and population growth—and therefore workforce growth—slowing in many advanced economies in may the world economic forum wef estimated that by  the size of the retirement savings gap—unfunded pensions in other words—could be as much as  trillion an unimaginably large number the us alone adds about  trillion every year to the pension deficit i shared with you earlier in the month that the state of illinois’s unfunded pensions could be as high as  billion putting each illinoisan on the hook for  central banks’ efforts to promote economic growth through monetary easing haven’t exactly been a raging success nor can they continue forever plus nearzero interest rates are precisely what encouraged such inflated levels of borrowing in the first place you can probably tell where i’m headed with all of this another crisis could be in the works savvy investors and savers might very well see this as a sign to allocate a part of their portfolios in “safe haven” assets that have historically held their value in times of economic contraction gold is one such asset that’s been a good store of value in such times and gold stocks have tended to outperform the yellow metal as production costs have fallen according to seabridge

visit the appropriate fund performance page “mother of all bubbles” keeps gold in focus july     by frank holmes ceo and chief investment officer us global investors today i want to discuss reports that global debt levels are at alltime highs and what this means for your investment decisions going forward but first a few comments about this past week i recently returned from the oxford club’s private wealth seminar held at the historic grand hotel on michigan’s mackinac island the hotel which some of you might remember as the setting for the  film “somewhere in time” starring christopher reeve and jane seymour took a mere  days to build in the s—impossible by today’s standards especially when you consider that it boasts the world’s largest front porch at  feet while there i had the privilege of catching up with some old friends and contacts including alex green the oxford club’s chief investment strategist you might have read some of his wonderful work for investment u the group’s educational arm alex reminded me over lunch that the difference between democrats and republicans in his view is that democrats are for personal freedom and some economic restrictions while republicans are for economic freedom and some personal restrictions i prefer to focus on policies instead of partisan politics but alex has a point i’m convinced that donald trump a republican won the presidential election because his pledge to reform the tax code and deregulate resonated with both whitecollar and bluecollar americans who felt as if the us economy was no longer working for them us corporate taxes are among the highest in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd spurring large multinationals to move operations overseas and outofcontrol regulations threaten to strangle business growth but just as green insinuated the trump administration has enacted or has hinted at enacting policies that rankle americans of all political stripes precisely because they could be used to encroach upon personal liberties take attorney general jeff sessions’ recent decision to strengthen the government’s ability to seize private property from suspected criminals the operative word here is “suspected” many now are arguing this directive could be abused by police and other officials it could in fact violate the fourth amendment which of course protects americans against “unreasonable searches and seizures” this is just one among numerous policymaking decisions that have members of both political parties as well as independents scratching their heads trump was elected to reform taxes slash regulations and generally make business and capital formation run more smoothly it’s unclear how privateasset seizures fit into that picture if this administration resolved to stay on message and on course and worked to bring fiscal relief to everyday americans it might receive greater support from those who voted for trump—and perhaps even from those who didn’t us dollar in bear market a boon for gold since the start of the year the fiveyear treasury yield adjusted for inflation has risen about  percent normally this would put remarkable pressure on the price of gold—higher yields raise the opportunity cost of buying gold—but over the same period the us dollar has steadily weakened and is now officially in a bear market because gold is priced in dollars this has been supportive for prices yeartodate the yellow metal is up more than  percent click to enlarge as i said the greenback’s been on the decline for most of the year so far but it slumped to a month low against the euro this week following european central bank ecb president mario draghi’s remark that “monetary accommodation” would continue in the european union eu until at least the end of the year “we need to be persistent and patient and prudent because we’re not there yet” draghi said referring to the fact that eu inflation and wage growth have been disappointingly slow despite the bloc’s economic recovery since the financial crisis indeed the june purchasing manager’s indexes for emerging european markets were all above the key  mark for the first time in recent memory ubs we’re still constructive on gold that gold is still holding at its current level—despite rising rates despite a stock market that continues to rally—is “encouraging” that’s one of the key takeaways from a ubs note this week in which the swiss financial services firm maintains its constructive view of the yellow metal investor demand this year has been slower than expected but ubs analyst joni teves makes the case that expectations of a good monsoon season in india this summer could help push consumption in the world’s secondlargest importer of gold to a new record high by the end of the year with india having imported a phenomenal  metric tons in the first half of  alone teves writes that “we expect gold demand in india this year to be around historic averages” which would be very supportive for prices etps attracted a record  billion in the first half of  exchangetraded products etps also had a knockout first half as deutsche bank reports this week etps attracted a record  billion in the first six months of  in what has historically been the weaker half of the year to put into perspective just how impressive this figure is  billion would be the secondlargest fullyear record amount following ’s  billion we could see etp inflows climb as high as  billion by the end of this year deutsche estimates click to enlarge of course runaway demand for etps and other risk assets has contributed to muted interest in gold having said that though bullionvault—the world’s number one online precious metals market—reported last week that private gold holdings among its users leaped to a record  metric tons as of the beginning of july that’s enough gold to make more than  million carat wedding rings bullionvault says or to supply the microchips for  billion iphones the site points out that investor demand has lately been driven by lower prices following three months of “light liquidation” global debt on alert all of what i’ve said so far pertains to the nearterm gold’s medium to longterm investment case i believe looks even brighter many unsettling risks loom on the horizon—not least of which is a record amount of global debt—that could potentially spell trouble for the investor who hasn’t adequately prepared with some allocation in a “safe haven” according to the highlyrespected institute of international finance iif global debt levels reached an astronomical  trillion in the first quarter of —that’s  percent of world gross domestic product gdp notice that before the financial crisis global debt was “only” around  trillion meaning we’ve added close to  trillion in as little as a decade much of the leveraging occurred in emerging markets specifically china which is spending big on international infrastructure projects click to enlarge it goes without saying that this is a huge risk some are calling this mountain of debt “the mother of all bubbles” and we all remember how the last two bubbles ended in  the tech or dotcom bubble and  the housing bubble paying down this debt will not be easy as scotiabank mentions in a note this week “higher interest rates are going to make the burden of refinancing the debt considerably heavier and as more money goes into servicing the debt it means less money is available to spend on other things which could lead to less infrastructure spending and increased austerity” add to this the fact that global pension levels are also sharply on the rise with people living longer and population growth—and therefore workforce growth—slowing in many advanced economies in may the world economic forum wef estimated that by  the size of the retirement savings gap—unfunded pensions in other words—could be as much as  trillion an unimaginably large number the us alone adds about  trillion every year to the pension deficit i shared with you earlier in the month that the state of illinois’s unfunded pensions could be as high as  billion putting each illinoisan on the hook for  central banks’ efforts to promote economic growth through monetary easing haven’t exactly been a raging success nor can they continue forever plus nearzero interest rates are precisely what encouraged such inflated levels of borrowing in the first place you can probably tell where i’m headed with all of this another crisis could be in the works savvy investors and savers might very well see this as a sign to allocate a part of their portfolios in “safe haven” assets that have historically held their value in times of economic contraction gold is one such asset that’s been a good store of value in such times and gold stocks have tended to outperform the yellow metal as production costs have fallen according to seabridge gold i always recommend a  percent weighting in gold— percent in bars and coins

bubbles” keeps gold in focus july   today i want to discuss reports that global debt levels are at alltime highs and what this means for your investment decisions going forward but first a few comments about last week i recently returned from the oxford club’s private wealth seminar held at the historic grand hotel on michigan’s mackinac island the hotel which some of you might remember as the setting for the  film “somewhere in time” starring christopher reeve and jane seymour took a mere  days to build in the s—impossible by today’s standards especially when you consider that it boasts the world’s largest front porch at  feet while there i had the privilege of catching up with some old friends and contacts including alex green the oxford club’s chief investment strategist you might have read some of his wonderful work for investment u the group’s educational arm alex reminded me over lunch that the difference between democrats and republicans in his view is that democrats are for personal freedom and some economic restrictions while republicans are for economic freedom and some personal restrictions i prefer to focus on policies instead of partisan politics but alex has a point i’m convinced that donald trump a republican won the presidential election because his pledge to reform the tax code and deregulate resonated with both whitecollar and bluecollar americans who felt as if the us economy was no longer working for them us corporate taxes are among the highest in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd spurring large multinationals to move operations overseas and outofcontrol regulations threaten to strangle business growth but just as green insinuated the trump administration has enacted or has hinted at enacting policies that rankle americans of all political stripes precisely because they could be used to encroach upon personal liberties take attorney general jeff sessions’ recent decision to strengthen the government’s ability to seize private property from suspected criminals the operative word here is “suspected” many now are arguing this directive could be abused by police and other officials it could in fact violate the fourth amendment which of course protects americans against “unreasonable searches and seizures” this is just one among numerous policymaking decisions that have members of both political parties as well as independents scratching their heads trump was elected to reform taxes slash regulations and generally make business and capital formation run more smoothly it’s unclear how privateasset seizures fit into that picture if this administration resolved to stay on message and on course and worked to bring fiscal relief to everyday americans it might receive greater support from those who voted for trump—and perhaps even from those who didn’t us dollar in bear market a boon for gold since the start of the year the fiveyear treasury yield adjusted for inflation has risen about  percent normally this would put remarkable pressure on the price of gold—higher yields raise the opportunity cost of buying gold—but over the same period the us dollar has steadily weakened and is now officially in a bear market because gold is priced in dollars this has been supportive for prices yeartodate the yellow metal is up more than  percent click to enlarge as i said the greenback’s been on the decline for most of the year so far but it slumped to a month low against the euro last week following european central bank ecb president mario draghi’s remark that “monetary accommodation” would continue in the european union eu until at least the end of the year “we need to be persistent and patient and prudent because we’re not there yet” draghi said referring to the fact that eu inflation and wage growth have been disappointingly slow despite the bloc’s economic recovery since the financial crisis indeed the june purchasing manager’s indexes for emerging european markets were all above the key  mark for the first time in recent memory ubs we’re still constructive on gold that gold is still holding at its current level—despite rising rates despite a stock market that continues to rally—is “encouraging” that’s one of the key takeaways from a ubs note last week in which the swiss financial services firm maintains its constructive view of the yellow metal investor demand this year has been slower than expected but ubs analyst joni teves makes the case that expectations of a good monsoon season in india this summer could help push consumption in the world’s secondlargest importer of gold to a new record high by the end of the year with india having imported a phenomenal  metric tons in the first half of  alone teves writes that “we expect gold demand in india this year to be around historic averages” which would be very supportive for prices etps attracted a record  billion in the first half of  like gold in india exchangetraded products etps also had a knockout first half as deutsche bank reports etps attracted a record  billion in the first six months of  in what has historically been the weaker half of the year to put into perspective just how impressive this figure is  billion would be the secondlargest fullyear record amount following ’s  billion we could see etp inflows climb as high as  billion by the end of this year deutsche estimates click to enlarge of course runaway demand for etps and other risk assets has contributed to muted interest in gold having said that though bullionvault—the world’s number one online precious metals market—reported recently that private gold holdings among its users leaped to a record  metric tons as of the beginning of july that’s enough gold to make more than  million carat wedding rings bullionvault says or to supply the microchips for  billion iphones the site points out that investor demand has lately been driven by lower prices following three months of “light liquidation” global debt on alert all of what i’ve said so far pertains to the nearterm gold’s medium to longterm investment case i believe looks even brighter many unsettling risks loom on the horizon—not least of which is a record amount of global debt—that could potentially spell trouble for the investor who hasn’t adequately prepared with some allocation in a “safe haven” according to the highlyrespected institute of international finance iif global debt levels reached an astronomical  trillion in the first quarter of —that’s  percent of world gross domestic product gdp notice that before the financial crisis global debt was “only” around  trillion meaning we’ve added close to  trillion in as little as a decade much of the leveraging occurred in emerging markets specifically china which is spending big on international infrastructure projects click to enlarge it goes without saying that this is a huge risk some are calling this mountain of debt “the mother of all bubbles” and we all remember how the last two bubbles ended in  the tech or dotcom bubble and  the housing bubble paying down this debt will not be easy as scotiabank mentioned in a note last week “higher interest rates are going to make the burden of refinancing the debt considerably heavier and as more money goes into servicing the debt it means less money is available to spend on other things which could lead to less infrastructure spending and increased austerity” add to this the fact that global pension levels are also sharply on the rise with people living longer and population growth—and therefore workforce growth—slowing in many advanced economies in may the world economic forum wef estimated that by  the size of the retirement savings gap—unfunded pensions in other words—could be as much as  trillion an unimaginably large number the us alone adds about  trillion every year to the pension deficit i shared with you earlier in the month that the state of illinois’s unfunded pensions could be as high as  billion putting each illinoisan on the hook for  central banks’ efforts to promote economic growth through monetary easing haven’t exactly been a raging success nor can they continue forever plus nearzero interest rates are precisely what encouraged such inflated levels of borrowing in the first place you can probably tell where i’m headed with all of this another crisis could be in the works savvy investors and savers might very well see this as a sign to allocate a part of their portfolios in “safe haven” assets that have historically held their value in times of economic contraction gold is one such asset that’s been a good store of value in such times and gold stocks have tended to outperform the yellow metal as production costs have fallen according to

to democracy during that period it hasn’t had a single down year amazingly enough the polish economy continued to grow at an annual rate of nearly  percent in the second quarter as suggested by the may retail sales and industrial output data according to mbank analysts fiscalyear growth will slightly exceed  percent driven by public investments recovery and persistently strong consumption the real retail sales growth in the second quarter held close to the priorquarter level which means that consumption growth should remain at around  percent mbank estimates poland’s impressive ascent should only help strengthen other cee countries both economically and politically its president andrzej duda seems fully aware of this and has taken several important strides to improve not just poland’s economy but the region’s as well the three seas initiative spearheaded last year by duda and croatian president kolinda grabarkitarovi seeks to connect the economies and infrastructure of  cee countries between the adriatic baltic and black seas a number of eu officials see the initiative as a threat to the eu bloc’s unity which might be partially why president trump agreed to meet with

the russia collusion story took a new twist with emails surfacing showing that donald trump jr jared kushner the president’s soninlaw and nowsenior advisor and former trump campaign manager paul manafort all agreed to meet with a russian lawyer last summer under the pretext that she had dirt on hillary clinton whether or not this meeting is “collusion” is not for me to say but the optics of it certainly look bad and it threatens to undermine the president’s agenda even more for the first time last week an article of impeachment was formally introduced on the house floor that accuses trump of obstructing justice the article is unlikely to go very far in the republicancontrolled house but it adds further uncertainty to trump’s ability to achieve some of his goals including tax

year its fastest pace since  “indeed the early months of  have seen china become easily the biggest single country driver of asian trade growth” writes eric fishwick head of economic research at clsa a lot of this growth can be attributed to beijing’s monumental one belt one road infrastructure project which i’ve highlighted many times before but according to alexious lee clsa’s head of china industrial research a “more nationalist america” in the first six months of the year has likely given china more leverage to assume “a larger global and especially regional leadership role” this comports with what i said back in january in a frank talk titled “china sets the stage to replace the us as global trade leader” with president donald trump having already withdrawn the us from the transpacific partnership tpp and promising to renegotiate or tear up other trade agreements—he recently tweeted that the us has “made some of the worst trade deals in world history”—china has emerged

this one from capital economics shows that the investment case for emerging europe remains strong in  russia is expected to strengthen over the next  months while poland hungary the czech republic and slovakia are likely to remain attractive “russia’s economy has pulled out of recession and growth in the coming quarters will be stronger than most anticipate” the research firm writes adding that its central bank’s loosening of monetary policy should support the recovery even further to be sure the region faces strong headwinds including a rapidly aging population and the loss of an estimated  million skilled workers to foreign markets over the past  years according to a july  presentation from the international monetary fund imf but i believe that as conditions in central emerging europe countries continue to improve many of those workers will be returning home life in the region is not the same as it was  or  years ago when good jobs might have been scarce firms are now growing at a

media right now is against president trump for a number of reasons—some of them deserved some of them not markets however seem not to care what the media or polls have to say the dow jones industrial average continues to hit new alltime highs even though it’s stalled a few times the “trump rally” appears to be in fullspeedahead mode more than eight months after the election back in november i wrote about one of my favorite books james surowiecki’s the wisdom of crowds which argues that large groups of people will nearly always be smarter and better at making predictions than an “elite” few surowiecki’s ideas were vindicated last year when investors accurately predicted trump’s election with markets turning negative between july  and october  for the same reason i think it’s important we pay close attention to what markets are forecasting today the white house is under siege on multiple fronts which as i said has been positive for gold’s fear trade but equity investors also seem to like the direction trump is taking whether it’s pushing for tax reform and deregulation or shaking up the “beltway party” composed of deeply entrenched dc lobbyists and career bureaucrats just last week the president made waves for firing a number of bureaucrats at the department of veteran affairs va long plagued by scandal and controversy since he took office in january trump has told more than  va workers “you’re fired”    the fundamentals of “quantamental” of course we look at so much more than government policy when making investment decisions we take a blended approach of not only assessing fundamentals such as market share and returns on capital but also conducting quantitative analysis it’s this combination that some in the industry are calling “quantamental” investing at first glance “quantamental” might sound like nothing more than cute wordplay—not unlike “labsky” “bullmation” and other clever names we give mixedbreed dogs—but it’s rapidly replacing traditional investment strategies at the institutional level business insider puts it in simple terms “quantamental managers combine the bottomup stockpicking skills of fundamental investors with the use of computing power and bigdata sets to test their hypotheses” see my vancouver investment conference presentation “what’s driving gold the invasion of the quants” to learn more about how we use quantitative analysis machine learning and data mining wall street the birthplace of american capitalism and government the concept of quantamentals helps explain our entry into smartfactor etfs as most of you already know members of my team and i visited the new york stock exchange nyse three weeks ago to mark the launch of our latest etf while there doug yones head of exchangetraded products at the nyse gave us a short history lesson about the exchange and surrounding area most investors are aware that the nyse which is celebrating its th anniversary this year is the epicenter of capitalism—not just in the us but also globally what many people might not realize is that on the site where the exchange now stands alexander hamilton the first us treasury secretary floated bonds to replace the debt the nascent country had incurred during the revolutionary war right next door to the nyse is federal hall where george washington took his first oath of office in april  the building today serves as a museum and memorial to the first us president whose statue now looks out over wall street and its passersby in this one single block of wall street therefore american capitalism and government were born here you can find the essential dna of the american experiment which over the many years has fostered our entrepreneurial spirit to form capital and to create new businesses and jobs growth innovation and competition run through our veins and that’s largely because of the events that unfolded centuries ago at the nyse and federal hall for more insight and commentary like this

during his visit to europe last week his speech in warsaw sought to strengthen ties between america and poland which the new york times just named the “next economic powerhouse” trump drew attention to a danger that’s “invisible” yet every bit as dangerous as terrorism and extremism—namely “the steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and wealth of the people” the us and poland “became great not because of paperwork and regulations” the president said “but because people were allowed to chase their dreams and pursue their destinies” this is the trump i believe voters elected last november if he were only able to stay on message and give his twitter account a rest he might more easily help engender and inspire an environment that better reflects the vision he

whose weak currency gave the eastern european country a competitive advantage we might soon slip to second place yet again for two primary reasons  low us wheat plantings and  severe droughts and unexpectedly hot weather conditions in the northern plains according to a march report from the us department of agriculture usda american farmers just aren’t planting wheat like they used to not only are we seeing shrinkage in the acreage devoted to the amber grain—more and more farmers are switching to soybeans—but wheat seedings are down for a second straight year the usda in fact estimates them to be at their lowest level ever since records began nearly  years ago in  as to the second point severe to extreme hot and dry weather conditions in the northern plains—specifically in areas of montana and the dakotas—are putting wheat and corn on the defensive according to the us drought monitor parts of montana just experienced their driest may and june in  years and the driest january

ahead of the government’s goods and services tax gst in effect since july  which levies a  percent tax on gold the impact of the country’s demonetization in december is also still being felt with indians’ confidence in fiat currencies tested i believe prime minister narendra modi’s scheme to combat black money and public corruption while admirable has only reinforced indians’ faith in the

report separating the wheat from the chaff” email investor beware what does the illinois budget crisis mean for your bond fund july   a recent capital economics ce report shines an unforgiving light on illinois’ ongoing budget woes—and what it finds isn’t pretty the crisis which has affected every level of government in the state is a cautionary tale for not only public spending run amok but also independent investors taking too large of a risk by seeking high yields the land of lincoln’s credit is already the lowestrated in the union and until recently its debt came precariously close to being downgraded to “junk” were this to happen it would become the first state ever to receive such an ignoble rating the state’s year bond yield has soared in recent months which might attract certain unwary speculators it’s our belief however that such debt should generally be avoided as the risks are especially high click to enlarge as i write this a state budget could possibly be successfully negotiated making it the first time in over two years that illinois has operated with a budget republican gov bruce rauner already vetoed the first bill that reached his desk which includes tax hikes but the veto was immediately overridden by the state senate and is now headed for the house no matter the outcome the point here is that political dysfunction is unfavorable—to put it lightly—and muni investors should remain cautious illinois isn’t the only state facing problems connecticut delaware maine massachusetts new jersey oregon rhode island and wisconsin are all or were mired in similar budgetary impasses new jersey public beaches reopened just in time for july  celebrations after a highprofile government shutdown closed them down for many muni investors navigating around these numerous pitfalls might seem overwhelming that’s why i believe an activelymanaged municipal bond fund such as our nearterm tax free fund nearx could be the solution more than  percent of nearx is invested in munis that hold between an a and aaa investmentgrade rating as of march  what this means is we’ve historically avoided exposure to debt issued by poorlymanaged municipalities we also like to stay on the short end of the yield curve especially now that the federal reserve has begun a new interest rate cycle when rates rise bond prices fall and short and intermediateterm munis are less sensitive to rate increases than longerterm munis whose maturities are further out to learn more about how rates affect municipal bonds read our whitepaper on the brink of bankruptcy illinois’ total debt currently stands at about  billion according to capital economics which is above detroit’s  billion bankruptcy in  and just below puerto rico’s  billion debt the state’s unfunded pensions—for teachers professors state employees judges emergency personnel and more—could be as high as  billion that puts each illinoisan on the hook for an estimated  political dysfunction and mismanagement are bad enough but the state’s adverse demographics make matters even worse illinois is one of only four states whose populations shrank over the past five years the others being connecticut vermont and west virginia ce estimates that over the next decade the state’s population could grow only  percent far below the national average the number of retirees meanwhile could surge  percent click to enlarge that means fewer workingage illinoisans are expected to be counted on to support retirees in the coming years driving up the amount of unfunded pensions even higher so even if the illinois government can resolve its budget soon we see this as only a shortterm fix the state has even larger obstacles emerging on the horizon our solution again this is why i think an activelymanaged muni fund like nearx is an attractive solution whereas other muni funds might accumulate illinois debt based on its high yield regardless of risk we generally have stuck to investmentgrade munis it must be said that if you look at nearx’s holdings today you’ll see that illinois is one of its top issuers the bonds were purchased at an earlier time before the state’s budgetary problems really began to worsen we haven’t accumulated any more since it became clear to us that the risks were too great we continue to hold the debt because we’re confident the state’s government can successfully unravel the political gridlock and arrive at a shortterm resolution it’s the state’s longterm demographic risks that investors should especially worry about our longest illinois bonds mature in  and as long as the state doesn’t default in the next four years—which in our opinion is highly unlikely—we should get a good return on the bonds based on their yield when

bubbles” keeps gold in focus july   today i want to discuss reports that global debt levels are at alltime highs and what this means for your investment decisions going forward but first a few comments about last week i recently returned from the oxford club’s private wealth seminar held at the historic grand hotel on michigan’s mackinac island the hotel which some of you might remember as the setting for the  film “somewhere in time” starring christopher reeve and jane seymour took a mere  days to build in the s—impossible by today’s standards especially when you consider that it boasts the world’s largest front porch at  feet while there i had the privilege of catching up with some old friends and contacts including alex green the oxford club’s chief investment strategist you might have read some of his wonderful work for investment u the group’s educational arm alex reminded me over lunch that the difference between democrats and republicans in his view is that democrats are for personal freedom and some economic restrictions while republicans are for economic freedom and some personal restrictions i prefer to focus on policies instead of partisan politics but alex has a point i’m convinced that donald trump a republican won the presidential election because his pledge to reform the tax code and deregulate resonated with both whitecollar and bluecollar americans who felt as if the us economy was no longer working for them us corporate taxes are among the highest in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd spurring large multinationals to move operations overseas and outofcontrol regulations threaten to strangle business growth but just as green insinuated the trump administration has enacted or has hinted at enacting policies that rankle americans of all political stripes precisely because they could be used to encroach upon personal liberties take attorney general jeff sessions’ recent decision to strengthen the government’s ability to seize private property from suspected criminals the operative word here is “suspected” many now are arguing this directive could be abused by police and other officials it could in fact violate the fourth amendment which of course protects americans against “unreasonable searches and seizures” this is just one among numerous policymaking decisions that have members of both political parties as well as independents scratching their heads trump was elected to reform taxes slash regulations and generally make business and capital formation run more smoothly it’s unclear how privateasset seizures fit into that picture if this administration resolved to stay on message and on course and worked to bring fiscal relief to everyday americans it might receive greater support from those who voted for trump—and perhaps even from those who didn’t us dollar in bear market a boon for gold since the start of the year the fiveyear treasury yield adjusted for inflation has risen about  percent normally this would put remarkable pressure on the price of gold—higher yields raise the opportunity cost of buying gold—but over the same period the us dollar has steadily weakened and is now officially in a bear market because gold is priced in dollars this has been supportive for prices yeartodate the yellow metal is up more than  percent click to enlarge as i said the greenback’s been on the decline for most of the year so far but it slumped to a month low against the euro last week following european central bank ecb president mario draghi’s remark that “monetary accommodation” would continue in the european union eu until at least the end of the year “we need to be persistent and patient and prudent because we’re not there yet” draghi said referring to the fact that eu inflation and wage growth have been disappointingly slow despite the bloc’s economic recovery since the financial crisis indeed the june purchasing manager’s indexes for emerging european markets were all above the key  mark for the first time in recent memory ubs we’re still constructive on gold that gold is still holding at its current level—despite rising rates despite a stock market that continues to rally—is “encouraging” that’s one of the key takeaways from a ubs note last week in which the swiss financial services firm maintains its constructive view of the yellow metal investor demand this year has been slower than expected but ubs analyst joni teves makes the case that expectations of a good monsoon season in india this summer could help push consumption in the world’s secondlargest importer of gold to a new record high by the end of the year with india having imported a phenomenal  metric tons in the first half of  alone teves writes that “we expect gold demand in india this year to be around historic averages” which would be very supportive for prices etps attracted a record  billion in the first half of  like gold in india exchangetraded products etps also had a knockout first half as deutsche bank reports etps attracted a record  billion in the first six months of  in what has historically been the weaker half of the year to put into perspective just how impressive this figure is  billion would be the secondlargest fullyear record amount following ’s  billion we could see etp inflows climb as high as  billion by the end of this year deutsche estimates click to enlarge of course runaway demand for etps and other risk assets has contributed to muted interest in gold having said that though bullionvault—the world’s number one online precious metals market—reported recently that private gold holdings among its users leaped to a record  metric tons as of the beginning of july that’s enough gold to make more than  million carat wedding rings bullionvault says or to supply the microchips for  billion iphones the site points out that investor demand has lately been driven by lower prices following three months of “light liquidation” global debt on alert all of what i’ve said so far pertains to the nearterm gold’s medium to longterm investment case i believe looks even brighter many unsettling risks loom on the horizon—not least of which is a record amount of global debt—that could potentially spell trouble for the investor who hasn’t adequately prepared with some allocation in a “safe haven” according to the highlyrespected institute of international finance iif global debt levels reached an astronomical  trillion in the first quarter of —that’s  percent of world gross domestic product gdp notice that before the financial crisis global debt was “only” around  trillion meaning we’ve added close to  trillion in as little as a decade much of the leveraging occurred in emerging markets specifically china which is spending big on international infrastructure projects click to enlarge it goes without saying that this is a huge risk some are calling this mountain of debt “the mother of all bubbles” and we all remember how the last two bubbles ended in  the tech or dotcom bubble and  the housing bubble paying down this debt will not be easy as scotiabank mentioned in a note last week “higher interest rates are going to make the burden of refinancing the debt considerably heavier and as more money goes into servicing the debt it means less money is available to spend on other things which could lead to less infrastructure spending and increased austerity” add to this the fact that global pension levels are also sharply on the rise with people living longer and population growth—and therefore workforce growth—slowing in many advanced economies in may the world economic forum wef estimated that by  the size of the retirement savings gap—unfunded pensions in other words—could be as much as  trillion an unimaginably large number the us alone adds about  trillion every year to the pension deficit i shared with you earlier in the month that the state of illinois’s unfunded pensions could be as high as  billion putting each illinoisan on the hook for  central banks’ efforts to promote economic growth through monetary easing haven’t exactly been a raging success nor can they

manafort all agreed to meet with a russian lawyer last summer under the pretext that she had dirt on hillary clinton whether or not this meeting is “collusion” is not for me to say but the optics of it certainly look bad and it threatens to undermine the president’s agenda even more for the first time last week an article of impeachment was formally introduced on the house floor that accuses trump of obstructing justice the article is unlikely to go very far in the republicancontrolled house but it adds further uncertainty to trump’s ability to achieve some of his goals including tax

a lot of this growth can be attributed to beijing’s monumental one belt one road infrastructure project which i’ve highlighted many times before but according to alexious lee clsa’s head of china industrial research a “more nationalist america” in the first six months of the year has likely given china more leverage to assume “a larger global and especially regional leadership role” this comports with what i said back in january in a frank talk titled “china sets the stage to replace the us as global trade leader” with president donald trump having already withdrawn the us from the transpacific partnership tpp and promising to renegotiate or tear up other trade agreements—he recently tweeted that the us has “made some of the worst trade deals in world history”—china has emerged

central bank’s loosening of monetary policy should support the recovery even further to be sure the region faces strong headwinds including a rapidly aging population and the loss of an estimated

media right now is against president trump for a number of reasons—some of them deserved some of them not markets however seem not to care what the media or polls have to say the dow jones industrial average continues to hit new alltime highs even though it’s stalled a few times the “trump rally” appears to be in fullspeedahead mode more than eight months after the election back in november i wrote about one of my favorite books james surowiecki’s the wisdom of crowds which argues that large groups of people will nearly always be smarter and better at making predictions than an “elite” few surowiecki’s ideas were vindicated last year when investors accurately predicted trump’s election with markets turning negative between july  and october  for the same reason i think it’s important we pay close attention to what markets are forecasting today the white house is under siege on multiple fronts which as i said has been positive for gold’s fear trade but equity investors also seem to like the direction trump is taking whether it’s pushing for tax reform and deregulation or shaking up the “beltway party” composed of deeply entrenched dc lobbyists and career bureaucrats just last week the president made waves for firing a number of bureaucrats at the department of veteran affairs va long plagued by scandal and controversy since he took office in january trump has told more than  va workers “you’re fired”    the fundamentals of “quantamental” of course we look at so much more than government policy when making investment decisions we take a blended approach of not only assessing fundamentals such as market share and returns on capital but also conducting quantitative analysis it’s this combination that some in the industry are calling “quantamental” investing at first glance “quantamental” might sound like nothing more than cute wordplay—not unlike “labsky” “bullmation” and other clever names we give mixedbreed dogs—but it’s rapidly replacing traditional investment strategies at the institutional level business insider puts it in simple terms “quantamental managers combine the bottomup stockpicking skills of fundamental investors with the use of computing power and bigdata sets to test their hypotheses” see my vancouver investment conference presentation “what’s driving gold the invasion of the quants” to learn more about how we use quantitative analysis machine learning and data mining wall street the birthplace of american capitalism and government the concept of quantamentals helps explain our entry into smartfactor etfs as most of you already know members of my team and i visited the new york stock exchange nyse three weeks ago to mark the launch of our latest etf while there doug yones head of exchangetraded products at the nyse gave us a short history lesson about the exchange and surrounding area most investors are aware that the nyse which is celebrating its th anniversary this year is the epicenter of capitalism—not just in the us but also globally what many people might not realize is that on the site where the exchange now stands alexander hamilton the first us treasury secretary floated bonds to replace the debt the nascent country had incurred during the revolutionary war right next door to the nyse is federal hall where george washington took his first oath of office in april  the building today serves as a museum and memorial to the first us president whose statue now looks out over wall street and its passersby in this one single block of wall street therefore american capitalism and government were born here you can find the essential dna of the american experiment which over the many years has fostered our entrepreneurial spirit to form capital and to create new businesses and jobs growth innovation and competition run through our veins and that’s largely because of the events that unfolded centuries ago at the nyse and federal hall for more insight and commentary like this

during his visit to europe last week his speech in warsaw sought to strengthen ties between america and poland which the new york times just named the “next economic powerhouse” trump drew attention to a danger that’s “invisible” yet every bit as dangerous as terrorism and extremism—namely “the steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and wealth of the people” the us and poland “became great not because of paperwork and regulations” the president said “but because people were allowed to chase their dreams and pursue their destinies” this is the trump i believe voters elected last november if he were only able to stay on message and give his twitter account a rest he might more easily help engender and inspire an environment that better reflects the vision he described to his polish audience i’m also encouraged by his first oneonone meeting with russian president vladimir putin from what i’ve read it sounds as if the two leaders managed to make some

whose weak currency gave the eastern european country a competitive advantage we might soon slip to second place yet again for two primary reasons  low us wheat plantings and  severe droughts and unexpectedly hot weather conditions in the northern plains according to a march report from the us department of agriculture usda american farmers just aren’t planting wheat like they used to not only are we seeing shrinkage in the acreage devoted to the amber grain—more and more farmers are switching to soybeans—but wheat seedings are down for a second straight year the usda in fact estimates them to be at their lowest level ever since records began nearly  years ago in  as to the second point severe to extreme hot and dry weather conditions in the northern plains—specifically in areas of montana and the dakotas—are putting wheat and corn on the defensive according to the us drought monitor parts of montana just experienced their driest may and june in  years and the driest january

driving palladium’s rally this year though are bets that european car buyers will soon be switching from dieselburning to gasburning cars because of emissions concerns palladium—one of the rarest elements on earth and mined almost exclusively in russia and south africa—is the smallest precious metals market making its prices particularly vulnerable to such speculative trading it’s achieved

ahead of the government’s goods and services tax gst in effect since july  which levies a  percent tax on gold the impact of the country’s demonetization in december is also still being felt with indians’ confidence in fiat currencies tested i believe prime minister narendra modi’s scheme to combat black money and public corruption while admirable has only reinforced indians’ faith in the

on illinois’ ongoing budget woes—and what it finds isn’t pretty the crisis which has affected every level of government in the state is a cautionary tale for not only public spending run amok but also independent investors taking too large of a risk by seeking high yields the land of lincoln’s credit is already the lowestrated in the union and until recently its debt came precariously close to being downgraded to “junk” were this to happen it would become the first state ever to receive such an ignoble rating the state’s year bond yield has soared in recent months which might attract certain unwary speculators it’s our belief however that such debt should generally be avoided as the risks are especially high click to enlarge as i write this a state budget could possibly be successfully negotiated making it the first time in over two years that illinois has operated with a budget republican gov bruce rauner already vetoed the first bill that reached his desk which includes tax hikes but the veto was immediately overridden by the state senate and is now headed for the house no matter the outcome the point here is that political dysfunction is unfavorable—to put it lightly—and muni investors should remain cautious illinois isn’t the only state facing problems connecticut delaware maine massachusetts new jersey oregon rhode island and wisconsin are all or were mired in similar budgetary impasses new jersey public beaches reopened just in time for july  celebrations after a highprofile government shutdown closed them down for many muni investors navigating around these numerous pitfalls might seem overwhelming that’s why i believe an activelymanaged municipal bond fund such as our nearterm tax free fund nearx could be the solution more than  percent of nearx is invested in munis that hold between an a and aaa investmentgrade rating as of march  what this means is we’ve historically avoided exposure to debt issued by poorlymanaged municipalities we also like to stay on the short end of the yield curve especially now that the federal reserve has begun a new interest rate cycle when rates rise bond prices fall and short and intermediateterm munis are less sensitive to rate increases than longerterm munis whose maturities are further out to learn more about how rates affect municipal bonds read our whitepaper on the brink of bankruptcy illinois’ total debt currently stands at about  billion according to capital economics which is above detroit’s  billion bankruptcy in  and just below puerto rico’s  billion debt the state’s unfunded pensions—for teachers professors state employees judges emergency personnel and more—could be as high as  billion that puts each illinoisan on the hook for an estimated  political dysfunction and mismanagement are bad enough but the state’s adverse demographics make matters even worse illinois is one of only four states whose populations shrank over the past five years the others being connecticut vermont and west virginia ce estimates that over the next decade the state’s population could grow only  percent far below the national average the number of retirees meanwhile could surge  percent click to enlarge that means fewer workingage illinoisans are expected to be counted on to support retirees in the coming years driving up the amount of unfunded pensions even higher so even if the illinois government can resolve its budget soon we see this as only a shortterm fix the state has even larger obstacles emerging on the horizon our solution again this is why i think an activelymanaged muni fund like nearx is an attractive solution whereas other muni funds might accumulate illinois debt based on its high yield regardless of risk we generally have stuck to investmentgrade munis it must be said that if you look at nearx’s holdings today you’ll see that illinois is one of its top issuers the bonds were purchased at an earlier time before the state’s budgetary problems really began to worsen we haven’t accumulated any more since it became clear to us that the risks were too great we continue to hold the debt because we’re confident the state’s government can successfully unravel the political gridlock and arrive at a shortterm resolution it’s the state’s longterm demographic risks that investors should especially worry about our longest illinois bonds mature in  and as long as the state doesn’t default in the next four years—which in our opinion is highly unlikely—we should get a good return on the bonds based on their yield when
