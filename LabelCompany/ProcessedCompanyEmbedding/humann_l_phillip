perhaps that has meant an increase in milage by about  what the extra time has really been critical for is to learn to utilize recovery to help me be prepared to workout harder and gain those small improvements at this stage the hope is to improve by seconds percentage points not leaps and bounds thankfully i have been so lucky to learn about and be supported by a few amazing brands that deserve a shout – out here roll recovery made my runners and athletes these tools are fantastic as a means of self maintenance and massage before and after runs and especially hard efforts the r roller is fabulous for plantar a problem i struggled with in a major way all last year in addition the r roller is perfect for getting those muscles that stick like it bands and calves for me to loosen up a bit and relax after you put them through a hard effort moreover they are killing it with this classy mat that makes pre and post run stretching and prep a lot more stylish and comfy cheribundi i love tart cherry juice and have become obsessed with this brand for a few years now these perfect sized bottles come in three types regular recovery and relax personally i use the recovery post workout to have some quick protein and have the relax at night as it helps me get to bed it is even replaced my favorite red wine at times  now that is a high compliment enduropacks made my triathletes who understand the rigors of intense training this product has been a new addition to my line up and made a huge difference in my opinion i truly feel more recovered than ever first off their pack consists of a daily multivitamin in the morning an electrolyte spray that i can spritz right into my water bottle or even just straight into my mouth to gain some quick electrolytes and then a recovery patch with amino acids i use after hard workout days there are also glutamine pills for the evening that just aid in sleep in recovery there is nothing better that products created by people who have been there and saw the need for something i highly recommend giving them a shot especially if you like me need a one stop shop for the vitamins and right stuff an athlete’s body needs beet elite i started trying beet elite powder with a bit of water right before my hardest sessions and have not stopped since as someone who hates beets the new runner food to many this product helps give me the boost and nitric oxide that is so good for runners but in a tastier form that i can enjoy mainly it helps me feel ready to take on those hard fast lactic acid inducing sessions without fear in addition usatf has partnered with other companies who have made a big difference in the little things that are really big things first hellofresh has helped make healthy good meals affordable for my budget eating the right stuff shouldn’t be excusable for any reason it is also fun to have so many new exciting recipes second getting my very own normatec has been amazing not only is it so fun for my nonrunner friends and family to watch it work but it really helps my legs feel as if i have gotten a message or ice bath after  minutes in the boots for me having an attachment for my hips has also really

log out login contact find us in store physicians reseller info privacy policy terms and conditions copy  human power of n co all rights reserved how no works why levels fall how to replenish no impacts no verified nitric oxide is essential to all life so it’s essential that we all know about it what is nitric oxide no nitric oxide is critical in our bodies without it we can’t live in fact the loss of nitric oxide has been linked to cardiovascular health and has been called the greatest discovery in cardiovascular medicine no signals our blood vessels to relax helping to dilate the arteries and increase circulation it is essential to our very existence and while it’s abundant in our body’s systems it’s unstable and depletes requiring it to be replenished nitric oxide no is a gas composed of one atom of nitrogen bonded to one atom of oxygen it serves as a critical signaling molecule in the cardiovascular and circulatory system that means it affects absolutely every function in our bodies—it’s at the foundational core because without circulation none of our body’s other systems can work as intended dubbed the “miracle molecule” the discovery of nitric oxide the first gas to be identified as such won the nobel prize in  this discovery is what humann is built on we’re not just providing functional nutrition and supplements we aspire to bring knowledge and understanding of the importance of no to the world     nitric oxide and the body   our cardiovascular system relies on nitric oxide so no matter your age or stage of life no is critical to your health this is especially poignant when you consider that millions of americans have blood pressure in the higher range of normal this essential molecule signals our blood vessels to relax and expand creating greater efficiency in the body greater nutrient delivery greater oxygenation and so on to every system organ and tissue in the body it also supports healthy blood pressure the point is that no is truly linked to everything we do and every breath we take if we dive even deeper we’ll see that nitric oxide is tied closely to endothelial function the endothelium is the tissue that forms a single layer of cells lining our blood vessels and heart growing evidence suggests that promoting optimal endothelial function is associated with increased cardiovascular health no helps keep the endothelium healthy a healthy endothelium helps produce more no maintaining the proper functioning of this cycle is important for those who want to achieve their personal best at any age     although nitric oxide research began in the s continued advancements have led to a fuller understanding of its impact on supporting healthy blood pressure levels increasing circulation throughout the body promoting cardiovascular and heart health aiding normal healthy circulation and arterial function dilating arteries for healthy blood flow why no levels drop may surprise you age we already know our bodies change as we age this is true for nitric oxide levels in the body as well by the time we reach  studies have shown that we only produce about half or less of the nitric oxide we did at age  and it continues to decline as we age there’s also a difference when it comes to gender by  men produce about  of the no they did in their teens and twenties and women only produce about  of what they did in their twenties at age  yet our ability to produce and generate no within the body is a key element of a healthy body which means having an effective strategy to maintain optimal levels is critical because it affects how every cell in our body communicates with each other   diet a diet rich in green leafy vegetables is known to be cardio healthy for decades nutritionists and scientists thought these effects were from the antioxidants found in those foods now we know that it’s due to the dietary nitrates found in green leafy vegetables and beets nitrates are metabolized into nitric oxide in the human body by oral nitratereducing bacteria if we don’t consume enough high nitrate vegetables then we become no deficient and our no levels begin to fall additionally people who use antiseptic mouthwash can destroy all the good bacteria in the mouth that are responsible for reducing dietary nitrate into nitrite and nitric oxide  as a result even though these individuals may eat sufficient amounts of high nitrate vegetables they may become no deficient because they don’t have the right bacteria necessary for metabolizing dietary nitrate exercise  physical exercise is the most potent stimulator of nitric oxide production and is considered one of the top strategies for supporting overall cardiovascular health  however when we don’t exercise we lose that important signal that tells our body to make more no as a result the enzyme that makes no in response to exercise becomes dysfunctional this usually leads to no insufficiency just as in the aging process the problem is the inability to utilize larginine to make nitric oxide the good news however is that once we begin to exercise we may regain the functionality of that enzyme and begin to stimulate more no production you ask a lot of your body replenish no every day much like with our overall health diet and exercise play a large role in stimulating the natural production of no including more no stimulating foods or foods that are high in dietary nitrates like spinach and beetroot is a good start regular exercise which also helps to promote no production is a smart addition as well unfortunately in today’s world of refined foods these options may not be enough especially for those over  that’s where functional foods like our superbeets beetelite and supplements like our neo come in neo is a patented nitric oxide delivery system that generates authentic no gas that helps stimulate the production of no from the enzyme in the blood vessels similar to exercise superbeets is a dietary nitratebased food that provides the body with optimal levels of dietary nitrate and nitrite that can help make up for a diet insufficient in dietary nitrate intake finally beetelite is our super concentrated preworkout formula that helps deliver a quick boost in nitric oxide production curious as to whether your current diet contains enough dietary nitrate to support healthy nitric oxide levels scientists at humann developed nitric oxide diagnostics® indicator strips the first noninvasive salivary nitric oxide indicator strip to give you insight into your current dietary regimen and whether supplementation is needed how no impacts the body how no impacts heart health the discovery of nitric oxide’s effect on our cardiovascular systems was awarded a nobel prize in  and before that it was named the molecule of the year in  by researchers no has been given high praise with good reason this miracle molecule is able to carry messages at the cellular level because of its gaseous state and in doing so relaxes blood vessels in our bodies promoting arterial dilation and increased blood flow by helping regulate and finetune cardiac function nitric oxide isn’t just important it’s indispensable it is intrinsically tied to our ability to function as we were intended how no impacts circulation it makes sense that as nitric oxide relaxes the body’s blood vessels and dilates arteries it would promote increased blood flow throughout our bodies but how does it do so the short answer is that nitric oxide and our endothelial system have a direct relationship more specifically the inner lining of our blood vessels that come in contact with blood are called endothelium and endothelial cells help produce no that no penetrates the muscles in our arteries not only relaxing them but also reducing inflammation and oxidative stress and with that comes improved circulation and all the benefits associated including the support of a healthy blood pressure increased energy and more how no impacts healthy blood pressure levels we’ve already covered the no and endothelial relationship if we take it a step further it’s easy to understand how nitric oxide levels are crucial to healthy blood pressure levels when arteries are dilated and circulation is increased it can help regulate blood pressure in our bodies how no impacts energy with nitric oxide’s ability to increase circulation and oxygenation of the blood comes the added benefits of improved natural energy and stamina that’s why so many professional athletes look to nitric oxide whether through dietary nitrates in whole foods or through functional nutrition like our beetelite because when our blood carries more oxygen to our muscles our body becomes more efficient delivering key nutrients and carrying away toxins and if our body is more efficient and circulation is improved endurance improves as well however whether you’re an athlete or not doesn’t matter most of us seek more energy and stamina throughout our day whether we’re exercising or simply staying alert and focused at work and while that may mean reaching for caffeine or an energy drink it doesn’t have to because increasing your nitric oxide levels promotes the energy and stamina you’re looking for we developed superbeets and beetelite for exactly those reasons   nitric oxide verified we verify the nitric oxide potential in every humann product there are many products on the market that claim to promote nitric oxide production in the body at humann we don’t make claims we invest in clinical research we’ve conducted seven clinical trials to date on our actual products which have been published and peerreviewed in medical journals this level of commitment isn’t typical in the world of no functional foods and supplements—many only test their ingredients  but not the final product and most don’t do clinical trials at all but we think it should be which is why we’ll continue to research innovate test and bring the most effective no activators to humans everywhere in fact we continually test our products to ensure there is sufficient nitrates in the products to support optimal no function a leading nitric oxide researcher and our chief science officer at humann dr nathan bryan has conducted ongoing studies on the effects of nitric oxide on circulation and heart health in fact his research inspired the formulation of our neo supplement the first and only product shown to produce authentic nitric oxide gas in the body numerous clinical trials on our actual product formulations have also been conducted by independent third parties including leading cardiologists like dr ernst schwarz from cedars sinai and dr mark houston at vanderbilt university something fairly uncommon in the world of functional foods and supplements and certainly uncommon amongst our competitors we are driven to bring nitric oxide to the world—to educate to inspire and to provide the highest quality functional nutrition and supplements possible

to the terms and conditions sign up close × recovery tools of the trade « ashleyhigz ashleyhigz peace love  water barriers recovery tools of the trade   this year i have had a little more time then i used to while perhaps that has meant an increase in milage by about  what the extra time has really been critical for is to learn to utilize recovery to help me be prepared to workout harder and gain those small improvements at this stage the hope is to improve by seconds percentage points not leaps and bounds thankfully i have been so lucky to learn about and be supported by a few amazing brands that deserve a shout – out here roll recovery made my runners and athletes these tools are fantastic as a means of self maintenance and massage before and after runs and especially hard efforts the r roller is fabulous for plantar a problem i struggled with in a major way all last year in addition the r roller is perfect for getting those muscles that stick like it bands and calves for me to loosen up a bit and relax after you put them through a hard effort moreover they are killing it with this classy mat that makes pre and post run stretching and prep a lot more stylish and comfy cheribundi i love tart cherry juice and have become obsessed with this brand for a few years now these perfect sized bottles come in three types regular recovery and relax personally i use the recovery post workout to have some quick protein and have the relax at night as it helps me get to bed it is even replaced my favorite red wine at times  now that is a high compliment enduropacks made my triathletes who understand the rigors of intense training this product has been a new addition to my line up and made a huge difference in my opinion i truly feel more recovered than ever first off their pack consists of a daily multivitamin in the morning an electrolyte spray that i can spritz right into my water bottle or even just straight into my mouth to gain some quick electrolytes and then a recovery patch with amino acids i use after hard workout days there are also glutamine pills for the evening that just aid in sleep in recovery there is nothing better that products created by people who have been there and saw the need for something i highly recommend giving them a shot especially if you like me need a one stop shop for the vitamins and right stuff an athlete’s body needs beet elite i started trying beet elite powder with a bit of water right before my hardest sessions and have not stopped since as someone who hates beets the new runner food to many this product helps give me the boost and nitric oxide that is so good for runners but in a tastier form that i can enjoy mainly it helps me feel ready to take on those hard fast lactic acid inducing sessions without fear in addition usatf has partnered with other companies who have made a big difference in the little things that are really big things first hellofresh has helped make healthy good meals affordable for my budget eating the right stuff shouldn’t be excusable for any reason it is also fun to have so many new exciting recipes second getting my very own normatec has been amazing not only is it so fun for my nonrunner friends and family to watch it work but it really helps my legs feel as if i have gotten a message or ice bath after  minutes in the boots for me having an attachment for my hips has also really helped me with hurdle workouts and soreness so – thank you guys for helping me be a better athlete and more prepared for the tough races ahead   advertisements share
