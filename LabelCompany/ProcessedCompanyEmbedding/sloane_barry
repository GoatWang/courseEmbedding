have a questionandanswer session and instructions will be given at that time operator instructions as a reminder this conference call is being recorded i would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference mr barry sloane president chief executive officer sir you may begin barry sloane thank you very much and everyone welcome to our first quarter  financial results conference call presenting here today with me is jennifer eddelson evp and chief accounting officer i’d like to welcome all of you to please follow along on our newly launched website newtekonecom and if you go to the investor relations section under events  presentation you’ll be able to see our powerpoint presentation from that presentation i’d like you to turn to slide number one on the note regarding forwardlooking statements i’d like everybody to have an opportunity to read through that we’re not going to recite that we’ve done it for about  years and hopefully could read through that for themselves i’d like to ask everybody to go to slide number two in the presentation and talk about our stocks performance newtek’s total return on its equity for the first quarter of  including reinvested dividends was  our one year return for the last year was  you could see the returns over time five years three years and in  quite stellar going to slide number three the financial highlights looking at the first quarter of  our nav increased approximately  and that percentage increase is primarily on the gross dollars we had a  increase in nav of  million and that’s versus december   number our net investment loss of  million or  per share for the three months ended march   a lot of that net investment loss is based upon the fact that for gaap reporting there are no capital gains for most bdcs that is relevant we’ve had capital gains for over  years – the reoccurring nature of selling government guaranteed sba a loans into the marketplace therefore we do report an adjusted net investment income of  million or  a share for three months that was an increase of  over the  million for the three months march   we had an increase in total investment income of  our debttoequity ratio at the end of the quarter was  and total investment portfolio increased by  from march   from december   on slide number four our dividend activity we paid our first quarter  dividend of  on march  and our board recently declared and we announced that this morning a second quarter  cash dividend of  per share the  per share declaration represents a  increase over the prior quarter in the prior year if you look at the first six months of the year we paid out  per share that’s an  increase for the first six months of the year over the full year we’re forecasting a  increase there are some oneitem events that we experienced in the first quarter that jenny will allude to we also tried to be extremely conservative in our forecasting and feel very good about our forecasted annual cash dividend which we’re maintaining at  we also want to note that approximately  of our cash dividends paid qualify for preferential tax treatment because those are cash flow and income coming up for the portfolio companies that are already taxed jenny will talk about that from a forecast for the full year it’s important to note obviously that almost  of the dividend that we paid to shareholders is not taxed at ordinary income rates but is taxed at qualified rates that makes our dividend income we think more valuable than a typical bdc go to slide number five we had some sba lending highlights funding for the first quarter up   million in the first quarter of  newtek business credit our controlled portfolio company funded  million of sba  loans our servicing portfolio was approximately little over  billion an increase of  over the three months ended march   our referrals coming in through the first quarter  billion a  increase over the three months throughout the company’s  year lending history we’ve approved over  sba a loans totaling over  billion we anticipate  million in a and  loans now represent a  increase in total sba loan funding over  moving to slide number six we think it’s important to sort of note we’re clearly a different bdc and while we believe our business model is better when we look at our business model versus our competitors we think we offer attractive returns without excessive amount of risks inherent in the assets or an excessive amount of leverage on the portfolio first off we do not pay a   we call it a  external management fee many bdcs are externally managed we’re internally managed so we don’t pay  fee to an external manager we’re primarily investing in senior secured loans that are actually originated through the bdc so we’re not purchasing other people’s package products from wall street or intermediaries we’re actually originating loans we believe that our portfolio companies do have potential net asset value upside as the portfolio companies grow we move towards private valuations to larger public company valuations looking at our average loan size  that is the average of the uninsured unguaranteed piece that remain in our books so we have a fairly large portfolio of geographically diversified industry diversified and credit diversified loans that are floating rates without a cap rising rate environment obviously that will benefit us because we only have maximum one to one leverage you can see a lot of that portfolio doesn’t have any debt against it as soon as those rates rise that will accrue and be beneficial to our shareholders from the alignment of interest standpoint on approximately  million outstanding shares i do think this benefits all the shareholders my interest very much aligned with all shareholders we typically are not putting our capital into loans that are  to  rate of interest with equity kicker we don’t have any sbic leverage there is no derivative securities in our bdc and is a very unlevered asset it is a senior secured loan portfolio we have our nav invested in businesses that we owned operated and managed through the portfolio companies for over  audio gap equity to get the types of return that we have experienced in the market that benefit our shareholders on slide number seven we wanted to talk a little bit about our capital markets activity we did a capital raise in the first quarter in january  kbw raymond james and ubs our book running mangers important to note many of you are aware of the fact that we do have an active atm at the money ability to pull down shares off of their shelf we execute none of their shelf in the first quarter and on the lending side newtek’s small business finance has entered into an agreement with capital one bank increase our facility from  million to  million the sba has given us verbal approval i think we are probably a week away from finally consummating this deal and announcing it officially we will also have a rate reduction of  on the government guarantee spread and  on the uninsured spread so i think it’s important to note that we are raising capital on the equity side the premium to nav stocks trading at premium to nav our debt costs are coming down we’ve also negotiated an increase at our goldman sachs credit facility for  million to  million and there will be a rate reduction on that as well approximately  when the deal gets consummated and then further rate reduction if we go to lower leverage amounts which could be up to  the current goldman sachs line is  million there’s about  million currently available if we up it to  million we’ll have  million of availability under that line on slide number eight we always look to compare ourselves to other internally managed bdcs as of may  we’re trading at a  premium the primary internally managed bdc’s triangle main street hercules and kcap they average  obviously we think we traded at discount because we’re different or a little smaller and we’re newer i also think some of the complexities for example when we report our net income it comes as negative because of the capital gains there are certain things that our ratios don’t match up for stand up against some of the other internally managed bdcs so we’re a little less known i think that’s just the function of time but obviously there’s clearly value in looking at our nav to the other internally managed bdcs particularly when you look at our returns and we believe the level of inherent risk that compromise and make up our nav when you go to slide number nine one of our strategies in addition to small business lending is our investments and growth in our controlled portfolio companies on july   we acquired payments for a little over  million six times ebitda purchase on june   we acquired banks or partners little over four times ebitda purchase we acquired its and indiscernible data small acquisition primarily of clients’ accounts a little bit under one time gross revenues and on april   we completed an investment in ipm an information technology consulting company that is a new wholly owned controlled portfolio company we are very excited about the ipm acquisition we acquired  it professions that will help companies out in the marketplace very large enterprise companies and smbs craft a more competitive cloud computing strategy ipm in addition with newtek managed technology solutions will be able to go into large and small enterprises and consult meaning work with the client to map out what they have two strategize what they need to do going forward particularly in the new area of new hardware new software and technological innovations particularly the movement to cloud three sell them the new hardware and software four deploy and implement these software on their hardware and work with the organization to get it ready five manage service provider be a longterm managed service provider x help desk disaster recovery and use the capability that we’ve established in our phoenix facility when you look at our strategy of making acquisitions obviously we’re looking to continue to grow the size of our portfolio companies expand to more publicly traded market multiples we’re obviously looking at continued growth in loan originations which we’ve clearly evidenced that in the first quarter of this year and last year and obviously make strategic investments within the business solutions footprint on slide number  you can take a look at our pipeline we’re currently looking at an iso with about  billion of annualized payment processing volume we’re looking at a peo professional employment organization with approximately  million of ebitda by the way iso an independent selling organization that’s a merchant service company for those who aren’t familiar with the term iso and three we’re looking at a cloud computing host in company with  million of ebitda these are the ones that we’re a little bit deeper into the process and as i mentioned we just closed on ipm on slide number  we get a lot of questions particularly with the new president the new administration what is going on in washington that could affect bdcs in general and also could affect our bdc i wanted to point out that there has been talk for several years about changing the cap of leverage on bdcs bdcs are currently limited to onetoone leverage we closed our last quarter at about  there is discussion in the house and in the senate particularly around jeb hensarling and him sponsoring the bill to potentially increase the leverage ratio to two to one given the change of the sec chair and the fact that lending and small business lending in particular happens to be a bipartisan opportunity which is kind of rare in washington other industry participants and various research firms have pointed out that there is a potential likelihood of increase in the leverage bill from one to one to two to one it’s possible this might come under the financial choice act and there’s also broader capital formation bills that are being discussed in the house and in the senate some of this activity could happen in the second half of ‘ maybe in early ‘ i think the important aspect to note here is that the leverage has increased from onetoone to twotoone or even one and a half to one but on onetoone and twotoone in our case rather than issue equity for the next  million or  million we maybe actually able to issue debt that would be we think beneficial to shareholders obviously issuing debt takes on more risk but we think that that would be viewed as a positive aspect to all bdcs particularly our bdc i would like to note that if this happened today and it’s not but if this happened today we have certain covenants in our baby bonds that would need to be addressed i’ll also add the fact that our big baby bond issue newtl is currently callable to current moments i don’t really view the opportunity that might present itself with additional leverage to be constraining upon us but i didn’t want to point that out that we would need to make some changes in some of our capital structure however if this occurred we would embrace it and we’ll have to take on some more debt which would really be beneficial to shareholders second item acquired funds and expenses aafe this is primarily an sec issue for those of you who are bdc followers in the summer of  many bdcs were thrown out of the sp  and the russell  index there is no bdc that sits in that index today primarily because of how the sec counts the term acquired funds and expenses as a key issue it is reasonable to conclude that a more favorable sec chairman might look to enforce this issue differently and if that is the case then it is conceivable bdcs will get put back into the russell  and possibly the sp  we think that could be very beneficial we actually had a large mutual fund that owned our stockbroker  years after converting to a bdc they actually had to divest because of how our expense ratio is calculated in our fund current administration’s tax reform initiative i think the biggest issue here number one is that the trump plan if it ever went through in part or whole would be viewed as constructive for small businesses in addition  of our historic dividend has been paid out of our portfolio companies those controlled portfolio companies are currently taxed at  to  if in fact trump’s bill pass the corporate tax rate is lowered to  to  number one that would improve internal cash flow improve our dividend number two it would also change our valuation process because our after tax cash flow yields will be significantly higher that would be particularly bullish for us linda mcmahon is now the main small business administration chief i was actually at a naggl conference yesterday national association of government guaranteed lenders in indiana i was fortunate enough to hear administrator mcmahon address the crowd and audience very constructive on the a program she actually has been speaking to the chair of the household business committee and was indicated that he would like to give her the ability to  provided that the program remains a zero subsidy to be able to increase the amount of guarantee that’s available by  at her discretion she actually went in and testified and asked for  nydia velázquez who’s one of the senior members of that committee went back to her and suggested  in a memo so very constructive for small business things that are happening in washington dc slide number  i’d like to point out we continue to add to our senior management team upgrade staff we have made a hire who’ll be joining us on monday jesse davis will be joining us as director of information technology jesse has over  years of experience in this particular area he’s a cofounder and president of creative mobile technology so for those of you that are taxi cab riders many taxi cabs in new york and major metropolitan areas have got this technology in the backseat that has a tv screen back there and connects the front end of the cab meter to the back and to be able to make payments this was a product that jesse created we welcome him joining us i think he’s going to be really important and instrumental to our ability to take our basic business processes and enhance the customer experience directly with enhanced technological solutions and make our inhouse processing for our clients in terms of booking and bonding in customer service significantly more efficient tom wesner joined us this week as chief operating officer of newtek technology solutions working with john raven out in arizona over  years of experience managing technology engineers and development professionals came – from the xerox corporation we are very excited to have tom working for us out of our phoenix office slide number  many of you are obviously familiar with our expertise in the sba a market we’re the largest nonbank government guaranteed lender in the united states looking at banks for the – banking th largest lender we’ve been doing this for over  years we’ve got a terrific track record of default history and severity we have average loan size which we talked about earlier of  there’s not a bdc in the marketplace that has an average loan size that low with that type of diversification that has all floating rate without any caps we’ve issued seven sp rated securitizations we recently announced two of our deals in the markets on sp credit watch for an upgrade looking at slide number  it’s just to give you a feel for our business is growing our funded loans in the first quarter up  our pipeline going forward up  we looked at  billion of loan referrals in q of  regarding pricing on slide number  the topic of conversation for the last  months has been what are you going to do if rates rise well guess what rates have risen matter of fact they have risen about  basis points on the short end in the last four or five months and lo behold prices are still holing as i’ve had many conversations with analyst investors the pricing function is a function of prepayment speedsph yes rates are a part of that meaning that rates going higher indicates greater amount of economic activity which might increase greater prepayment speeds what i’m telling the market today our first quarter gain on sale  you can see on this chart it’s fairly steady over the course of five years these are floating rate instruments that are government guaranteed without a cap and they yield investors approximately plus  to plus  over libor it’s an attractive investment if the concept of voluntary or involuntary prepayments are going to change that will affect the price another important aspect of the price is supply and demand prices do tend to sack in the fourth quarter and tend to elevate in the first quarter because a lot of banking institutions that participate in this market are bigger sellers in q but when the pipeline is blown out there tends to be less supply and prices rise up in q we’re very pleased with the prices that we’ve been able to get on our securities looking at our credit quality on slide number  nonperforming loans as a percentage of the portfolio  on slide number  chargeoffs for the first quarter as a percentage of the outstanding portfolio  basis points slide number  and  kind of depict the cash flow aspects and revenue recognition of a a loan most of our listeners are fairly well attuned to these slides i’ll go right through them on slide number  we talk about the  program obviously we’ve been looking to build this business we hope to fund  million of  loans we are hopeful that you will see some gain on sale from  loans that we have funded that are sitting in our pipeline we have bids ranging from  to  on these loans we’re in the process of closing them out and we have a really nice pipeline going forward of sba  loans approximately  million that are sitting there in the pipeline slide number  gives you the typical math of what a  loan looks like it is a loan that is used to acquire realestate or refinance realestate it’s a  loantovalue the government takes out the  second debenture we’re left with over  conventional first that we sell into the marketplace and on slide number  that’s the income and cash flow aspect of making an sba  loan very attractive return on equity of approximately  moving to slide number  our payments business continues to track very nicely it’s a great business for us we’ve been in this business over  years our revenue for the three months ended march   versus march   up by  our adjusted ebitda up almost  this business is valued on our book at approximately  million that’s a multiple of  times ebitda you can see the public comps significantly higher to the right with comps ranging from  times to  times adjusted ebitda lot of good opportunity in the payment space obviously we believe that the payments opportunity over a course of time is going to lead more towards ecommerce solutions our ability to host website design websites use our own payment gateway and obviously our own merchant services entity very attractive this is a business we’ve been in for a long time got a great operating team we’re happy with our growth and look to propel it further on slide number  this is managed tech solutions business i believe what you will see for us in the next quarter is this segment will be a combined look at our managed tech solutions business in arizona and ipm together we believe these businesses over the course of time will intersect very nicely we have no plan on merging them in the near future or the foreseeable future however the customer base that is acquiring hardware and software that is acquiring professional services also has to their hardware and software somewhere they could put it in amazon’s cloud or azure’s cloud they can put it onprem or they can put it into a private cloud with us and our data center footprint in singapore the uk new jersey scottsdale or denver here’s the important aspect we could manage our clients hardware and software and do x remotely in any location anywhere at any time this is the move of the future smallmedium sized businesses large businesses and enterprise businesses are going to find over the course of time it is much more cost effective to outsource the management of their services and that is how we are positioned the acquisition of ipm to have the upfront intellect to coach consult strategize deploy implement is an outstanding acquisition for us it’s an acquisition we brought it four times part of that is earned out over the next  months we’re excited about the acquisition of ipm to add to our technology strategy fast forwarding to ‘ as a summation newtek business service corp a differentiated business model we don’t pay  management fees out the door therefore the things that we invest in are able to generate their types of return to shareholders without separating a  fee we are internally managed fully expensed we’ve owned and operated our portfolio companies for most part over  years we have forecasted  per share dividend in  this is a company with a proven track record that was established in ‘ and publicly traded since september of  we have a  year history in making loans to small and medium sized businesses that  year history gives us history of the full frequency and severity our loans are primarily floating rate which is extremely attractive in a rate environment particularly given that we have less than onetoone leverage on that portfolio management’s interest very much aligned with shareholders myself and the board and the managers probably a little under  at this point in time i myself have a  but the outstanding shares very much aligned with shareholders and with that i’d like to turn the rest of the presentation over to jenny eddelson jenny eddelson thanks barry good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining today’s call please turn to slide  to review our first quarter results in total investment income was  million a  increase over  million from q  the majority of this increase was from the growth of interest and servicing yearoveryear interest income increased by  million period over period and was attributable to few factors including an increase in the primary and the average outstanding performance portfolio of sba loans increasing to  million as of march   from  million for the quarter ended march   in addition interest was favorably impacted in q  by  of interest income related to accrued nonperforming interest owed by one borrower that paid their balance in full our total servicing asset value at quarter end was approximately  million as compared to  million at december   servicing income increased by  quarteroverquarter as the total portfolio that we earned servicing income fund increased from  million to  million yearoveryear sba guaranteed loans sales totaled  million in the first quarter of  as compared to  million during the first quarter of  the net realized gain on sale was  million compared to  million for the three months ended march   and  respective a  increase the weighted average premiums declined slightly to  versus  quarteroverquarter looking at the credit quality on our sba loan portfolio realized losses or chargeoffs as a percentage of the average outstanding loan portfolio was  a four basis points reduction from december  total nonperforming sba loans totaled  million representing  of the total unguaranteed sba loan portfolio by quarter end as compared to  million or  of the total loan portfolio as of yearend  dividend income in q  was  million or flat in total versus the same quarter of  and represented  million from newtek merchant solutions  from premier payments and  from small business lending as a reminder approximately  of our  dividends we generated dividends from our portfolio companies which are taxed that qualify tax rates we expect similar results this year for the  tax year total expenses increased by  million yearoveryear salaries and benefits increased by  million  of this increase was attributable to stockbased compensation incurred in q  related to the issuance of restricted stock awards to employees beginning in the latter half of  the remaining increase in salaries and benefits of approximately  quarteroverquarter primarily represented increases in headcount and payroll expenses at the lending division and is commensurate with the increases in loan originations underwriting closing and servicing activities required to manage the growing portfolio interest expense increased by approximately  million quarteroverquarter the increase was due primarily to  increase in interest on note due  as those notes were issued in april  and  increase in interest from issuance of securitization notes in the fourth quarter of  interest expense on a warehouse line of credit declined by  quarteroverquarter as we utilized excess liquidity to keep our borrowing cost low other ga expenses increased approximately  quarteroverquarter primarily due to increases in referral fees and loan processing costs commensurate with increase in loan originations yearoveryear in addition q of  benefitted from a realestate tax refund of approximately  overall we had a net increase in net asset of  million to the quarter as compared to  million from q  or a  increase back to you barry barry sloane thank you jenny operator we’d like to open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of leslie vandegrift of raymond james your line is open leslie vandegrift thank you good afternoon barry sloane hi good afternoon leslie vandegrift thank you quick question on the sba volume originated in the quarter obviously this is the same quarter in the row where you’ve had high volume for that in the a program obviously that’s a good thing but looking for an outlook there for the year are we adding new higher steady state or just a bit of hyperactivity in the first quarter barry sloane leslie we’re forecasting still   growth obviously we’re a little higher in q we just feel more comfortable at lower levels although to be honest with you we have the funding we have the capital and we’re getting pretty good opportunities just came from a naggl conference national association of government guaranteed lenders and one of the interesting things that’s come out of the conference is without naming names but the big banks of the united states and there’s four of them two of them are actually significant sba lenders their sba volume is down yearoveryear and a lot of that has to do with some of the problems they’ve had in not wanting to do loans for their branches because of the problems that have shown up at the wall street journal so we may be seeing more and more of that the industry average right now for sba business is up  or  so we feel pretty good about where we are we just like staying at these conservative numbers and that’s probably what we’ll stick to for the time being leslie vandegrift okay and then on to that point if there’s a bit of bank hesitation from i guess like said stories in the journal etcetera for regulation reasons do you see an issue with premium them not from repayment activities just that from banks just wanted to get off with that a bit barry sloane well i think overall loan volume for a is higher it’s up  and there definitely appears to be an interest in the program we’re not seeing it from a competitive perspective we’ll try and push two and three quarters we don’t have to cut our rate we’re not losing deals at the approval level i think it’s a strange market i mean you’ve got talking washington about breaking up big banks glasssteagall i think that from our standpoint i’d like the marketplace to look at what we do as different unique i think the acquisition of bancserv very valuable so we’re now able to go into smaller community banks and say hey we can assemble underwrite and service and we can  a lot of these community banks they have loans that are outside of their footprint that are outside of their size limitations they may not like a particular category they’re referring those loans to us then our indiscernible bank service getting the fees from those businesses so we’re doing things in the marketplace that are totally different than any of our competitors in the particular space we signed up some new alliance partners raymond james was one of those so we’re getting more leaves in we like the model that we’re involved with we’re seeing really good credits lot of opportunities and as a target we say  now the reality is if we see really good credits that are coming in and we see it looks like we’re on a  billion or  billion referral pace for the year that’s up from  billion last year we may wind up beating these numbers but it’s not because we’re cutting credit it’s not because we’re paying bigger brokerage fees to third parties it’s because the business model is very leverageable and we’re accelerating into it leslie vandegrift okay so you’re not seeing a pull back on the sale side though because of that so you’re not having issue with banks who wants to purchase these off you barry sloane no leslie vandegrift okay barry sloane no that’s why the referral volume continues to go in the right direction we’re not seeing banks saying i don’t want to refer you i want to do it myself we’re not seeing that leslie vandegrift okay all right and then last question on one of your slides you obviously have the slide about why our model is better the top bullet on that slide is about you’ve been an internally managed bdc obviously another bdc in the space last night suggested going over to an external structure i’m curious if that would ever fit your structure barry sloane no leslie vandegrift okay short and sweet barry sloane very happy my team is happy we’re all good no leslie vandegrift okay well thank you for answering my questions barry sloane okay operator our next question comes from the line of arren cyganovich of da davidson arren cyganovich thank you the referrals into the new tracker system continue to come in at a very high level is that from new alliance partners that you’re adding is it coming from penetration of the existing partners some thoughts around that barry sloane i would say the bigger growth was probably from new participants we’ll be a little bit careful there because sometimes new participants aren’t necessarily the best but i think we’re getting more from the core book from new and it’s a good mix and it’s a good blend part of it is to work with the existing alliance partners to get more out of them we do that on a regular basis in addition to signing up new arren cyganovich do you have a lot of repeat from the same referring sources after they have the successful – i mean do you track the repeat business from your existing referrals barry sloane we do and we work those relationships we have  regional vice presidents in all the major markets texas california florida new york that go out and meet with alliance relationships whether it’s branches whether it’s bankers whether it’s working with call centers whether it’s tomb stoning various participants that can give us deals we do that on a regular basis arren cyganovich thanks and in terms of the payments processing business i think i saw a fairly large expectation and increase of volume what’s driving i mean it was  billion to  billion what’s driving that expectation barry sloane well the potential acquisition without the acquisition that’s not happening arren cyganovich okay and then just lastly there operating costs have kind of come up a bit with your high growth can you frame the amount of growth in operating expenses you’re expecting for the next year barry sloane i would say and i would let jenny elaborate on this i think it’s modest i say that right now this stuff comes and goes couple of things right now we’ve got i’ll say duplicative rent i’ve got  square feet here – success that square footage is being used up i think i’ll be full in june our brownsville facility will go away at the end of june our facility in wisconsin will go from  to  square feet i’m losing some rent i think in november in great neck which went along with the premier deal so i look at rent obviously as one area i would say that’s the biggest area of increase in expense jenny i don’t know if there’s anything else jenny eddelson yeah i mean the other increases would be in relation to loan volume so we’ve got our referral fees origination costs those types of expenses barry sloane so i think it’s important to note arren on part of that and maybe we need to try to break that out a lot of that sga if we do more loans we’re paying more referrals fees so it’s variable so it’s not a bad thing but to be honest with you we really are cost conscious we keep an eye on those costs and i don’t really think our fixed costs have gone up that much the only thing that has gone up this year is somewhat of the duplicative rent which i think will begin to go away towards the second half of this year arren cyganovich okay so the salary and benefit line you talked about it a little bit part being some stock comp and also headcount increase is that also partially variable cost in the salaries and benefits as well barry sloane i think that we have added certain amount of senior staff to be able to lever the business to higher highs particularly in the lending area i think you’ll see greater contribution from a portfolio company newtek business credit i think we’ve added some technology resources as well but i don’t see a real explosion in compensation at all arren cyganovich okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of lisa springer of singular research your line is open lisa springer thank you hi barry my question concerns the  pipeline i’m not clear is the referral sources for  do they overlay up with the a or do you have to build a completely separate referral source area for that for the  barry sloane it’s a great question so i’m going to give you a weird answer i’ll say it’s the same but it’s different so this is what’s important the traditional  lender in the market goes out to i’ll call it the usual spend suspects which are cdcs community development corps or banks or brokers that really know that market well the sba rates have changed to where you can now do a  loan to refinance an existing loan and it’s a  ltv so there’s a tremendous opportunity for us we don’t have a broker driven model but we have to do a better job getting out to our rvps to get to our alliance partners that hey we now have a  product as a matter of fact we have a buyer like  year fully amortizing fixed rate  loans that’s great for us so i can go out and quote   rates depending upon the credit for  ltv loan to a business backed by commercial realestate that’s powerful but i’ve got to get sales people focused sales people have to get alliance partners focused alliance partners have to get their customers focused now when the leaf blow comes in part of our job is to work with borrowers now there are many times a loan can qualify for a loan and a  loan at the same time so we have to make that value judgment what’s best for the client in that case i would say it is generally a work in process and it would lean toward a new message and the same distribution channel but a different message lisa springer okay well thank you for all the color appreciate it barry sloane thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of scott sullivan of merrill lynch your line is open scott sullivan good afternoon and thanks for taking my call barry sloane good evening scott scott sullivan congratulations on a great quarter obviously humming along here wondering if you could expand a little bit in terms of what percentage of sales ebitda that technology solutions and consulting might be in the future barry sloane i would say it probably represents  today and we look at studies from gartner forrester every research the growth of it spending in the us it’s going to double or triple in the next five years it’s just off the charts in addition to that the churn people are going from different software different hardware and moving to the cloud and so i would certainly would like to get our technology business it’s not going to happen overnight but i would like to get it up to  or  of the total earnings or dividends at some point of time we have a lot of wood to chop there we got to develop the channels we have to develop the intersections get the portfolio companies to work well with each other but i’m pretty bullish about it and optimistic it can be a very significant opportunity for us scott sullivan terrific and could you speak to the potential leverage you have using your existing lending customer list and sort of crossselling to these technology solution area barry sloane i think that this is an area where if my lending executives and management team were listening we need to do a lot better job in addition to that the new director of it jesse davis is being brought been to help me build the tools to make that easier and a little effortless i think we have done an okay job at it but not anywhere near where it can be and i look at intellectual property for businesses and ewe should have that we should have leans on it now obviously you got to be careful you don’t want to get into the area of tying which is fairly sensitive which is fairly sensitive to lending professionals nor would we ever force somebody or tie things together but i think the ability to really work with business owners particularly with our lending clientele and offer them stateoftheart it solutions is extremely important it’s money that’s being left on the table and we got to push – i got to push all my divisions do a better job in this area scott sullivan but there’s good upside obviously barry sloane big upside that’s why we’re here that’s why we do all these things scott sullivan terrific terrific thank you very much barry sloane thank you scott operator and ladies and gentlemen i’m showing no further questions in the queue at this time i’d like to turn the call back to you sir for closing remarks barry sloane great i appreciate everybody participating in the call today and we look forward to reporting our second quarter we the board declared a  dividend it was a little early we’re little early than usual but we feel really confident about where we are and wanted to get that out to the marketplace as soon as possible so we look forward to reporting our second quarter results in the near future and thank you all for attending today and your questions thank you operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for your

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
