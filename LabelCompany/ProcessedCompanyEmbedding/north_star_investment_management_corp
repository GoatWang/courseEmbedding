services print brochures code of ethics custodian links contactmap form adv k plans our approach our equity investment approach investing for the longterm in a diversified portfolio of fundamentally sound consistent growth companies at a reasonable price  we focus on identifying consistent growth companies offering aboveaverage return potential regardless of their size or geographic location  those companies typically possess the following characteristics   sustainable competitive advantage  a sustainable competitive advantage is what differentiates a company from its competitors  this includes such things as providing a superior product or service having the leading market share being the lowcost producer possessing a superior distribution system utilizing better technology having superior research and development technology or offering the best customer service  trademarks trade names and patents also provide compelling competitive advantages   superior management that acts in the shareholders’ interest   management should have a defined business objective and strategy  it must use the company’s assets wisely and invest to generate superior levels of profit and growth  they must be innovative and able to anticipate and act on change  in addition management must apply high standards of corporate governance and truly think of shareholders as owners of the business a high level of management ownership in the company better aligns management with shareholders and is viewed positively    longterm track record of revenue and eps growth  the company should have reported consistent revenue and eps growth over the past  years or more  to continue such a record demand for its products or services must be growing as cost containment and margin improvement will not last forever  the consistency of reported eps also demonstrates recurring and predictable demand for the company’s products or services  a company that exhibits this consistency will most likely have below average vulnerability to a downturn in the economy    leader in a growing industry  the company’s endmarkets should be growing faster than the overall economy  the company should be a leader and innovator not necessarily the largest  the rate of internal growth as opposed to growth from acquisitions is important because it will provide a sustainable annual return and increase the value of the company over the longterm     strong balance sheet  a company with a strong balance sheet low net debttocapital should have the capacity to finance its growth a company’s operating income should provide a very secure level of interest coverage under varied economic conditions  a solid balance sheet will help reduce volatility in reported earnings during an economic recession as well as reduce the risk of charges from writedowns   generation of free cash flow – the best businesses tend to be relatively less capital intensive and generate significant free cash flow  free cash flow can benefit shareholders in many ways such as share repurchases debt reduction or strategic acquisitions    attractive valuation  after finding a company that meets most if not all of the above criteria it is critical to investment success to have the discipline to wait for the appropriate purchase price  key valuation determinants include a company’s probable longterm earnings per share growth rate consistency and stability of estimated growth profitability financial condition projected cash flow and quality of management  our valuation methodology incorporates the use of a dividend discount model as well as relative pricetoearnings ratio pe and pricetoearnings relative to expected growth ratio peg analysis   our fixed income approach a focus on high quality securities and duration management  our bond investment approach emphasizes the generation of longterm consistent returns within the parameters of individual client objectives   our staff has experience in a variety of fixed income disciplines from emphasizing income and principal stability for conservative clients to applying active duration management techniques for dedicated institutional portfolios   our strength lies in our ability to customize a fixed income portfolio to meet the specific needs of each client  however several aspects of our philosophy will apply to all fixed income portfolios under our management  focus on investment grade securities     avoid excessive interest rate risk   maintain adequate liquidity to ensure maximum flexibility permissible investments include us treasury securities government agency issues corporate securities preferred stocks municipal bonds mortgage and assetbacked issues certificates of deposit fixed income mutual funds exchange traded funds etfs

north star asset management tailors each portfolio to meet the specific needs and objectives of our clients primarily through a combination of high quality consistent growth companies and investment grade fixed income securities  though each portfolio is unique the majority of the investments are consistent with a model portfolio developed by our team of investment professionals  we customize the risk of each portfolio primarily by adjusting the level of stocks and bonds rather than changing the mix of individual securities although each portfolio manager has the flexibility to invest in securities that are appropriate for each clients risk tolerance  by limiting the ratio of clients per portfolio manager we ensure that our portfolio managers have the time necessary for properly assessing client objectives and developing and implementing a portfolio strategy to meet those needs    we utilize a team approach with eleven investment professionals working together to provide personalized portfolio management services by researching and investing in consistent growth companies and appropriate fixed income securities each portfolio is guided by a veteran manager with the resources and experience of the entire team in support all portfolios are reviewed regularly by the entire investment team   our team of investment professionals evaluates investment opportunities through proprietary fundamental analysis involving company visits input from wall street and the utilization of a dividend discount valuation model  our equity portfolios are invested in a select number of stocks representing  industries  holdings of individual securities are generally limited to no more than  of an equity portfolio  this provides sufficient diversification while permitting us to leverage our internal research  by diversifying between large medium and small stocks along with growth value and international stocks nsam provides broad diversification for its clients  this flexibility allows us to invest in the most attractive companies regardless of their size or geographic location   north star asset management believes in longterm investing  we have relatively low portfolio turnover thereby avoiding excessive trading costs  our equity portfolio turnover is approximately  annually resulting in an average holding period of approximately  years  this turnover is significantly below industry averages  in addition to minimizing trading expenses the low turnover reduces potential tax liabilities   while the firm utilizes a low portfolio turnover approach it also recognizes the need to be flexible and take action when the fundamentals warrant the sale of an investment  other key elements of our sell discipline include disposing of investments when they materially exceed fair value when holdings can be modified to enhance returns or when prudence dictates portfolio diversification   although our dividend discount valuation model and fundamental research provide valuable input and our investment philosophy adds discipline there are no substitutes for knowledge and experience when making investment decisions  to that end our investment professionals continuously review current holdings security recommendations and portfolio strategy for each account   north star asset management tailors each portfolio to meet the specific needs and

investments before you invest in alternative investments you should consider your overall financial situation how much money you have to invest your need for liquidity and your tolerance for risk
