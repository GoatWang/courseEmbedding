uncovering of the arlington national cemetery mismanagement controversy mr meyer has been a consistent critic of promanagement judicial and administrative interpretations of the whistleblower protection act of  noting their corrosive effect on the intent of the united states congress in passing the act in his role as director of dwt and cri mr meyer has been described as     pretty fearless he has the knowledge and technical acumen to determine what is right in  meyer cautioned whistleblowers that despite the fact that the whistleblower protection act of     says that federal workers should be protected not punished    whistleblowing remains an often risky and difficult path     dan meyer is credited within overcoming some senior leadership reticence to protecting whistleblowers within the intelligence and counterintelligence communities when addressing whistleblower issues mr meyer focuses on the fact that whistleblowing plays an important role in improving government performance and accountability he considers whistleblowing to be     all about transparency we shouldnt run from letting the people know what we federal employees are doing in fact if we had more transparency we would have fewer problems more government transparency allows more senior executive and congressional oversight and oversight allows for the correction of government failures when describing the inspector generals reprisal investigations mr meyer stated we just call them as they are i have no concerns at all for protecting the wrongdoer at the end of the day the business of government is the peoples business not the wrongdoers business congressional testimonyedit in testimony before the united states congress in  mr meyer advanced a theory stating that there is a false dichotomy between defense readiness and environmental compliance national security and environmental security are two components of the common defense central to the theory is the concept that national security achieved at the expense of the environment undermines the purpose for which a common defense is maintained in his  testimony before house resources mr meyer distanced himself raymond f dubois deputy undersecretary of defense for installations and environment department of defense mr meyer advised the committee that environmental laws were to be read together each successive act of congress forming an evolving set of mandates on federal agencies all of which were to be organized as a whole under an integrated natural resources management plan meyer also used the hearing as an opportunity to warn the congress about the impact of the us court of appeals for the federal circuits decision in the huffman case  fundamentally changing the protections afforded to federal whistleblowers and the dangers of further delegations of statutory responsibilities to the states unless a concurrent delegation of the whistleblower protection provisions was matched by a waiver of sovereign immunity while at peer mr meyer was moving this theory into a deconfliction of environmental and mercantile policies as well this is evident in his pleading regarding installing and maintaining commercial submarine cables in national marine sanctuaries  fed reg  dkt no aug   reference to the peer environmental security work during mr meyers tenure can be found in rita floyds security and the environment securitisation theory and us environmental security policy  during the winter of  meyer appeared in congressional testimony with mr thomas f gimble acting inspector general of the us department of defense and ms jane deese director of military reprisal investigations before the us house of representatives committee on government reform subcommittee on national security emerging threats and international relations the hearing was called by congressman chris shays rct in the testimony the office of the inspector general stated that it had the authority to investigate adverse security clearance and access decisions as part of its broad responsibility for investigating allegations that individuals suffered reprisal for making disclosures of fraud waste and abuse to certain authorities meyers february  testimony discussed the importance of whistleblowerinitiated complaints driving the investigative process so that the offices of inspectors general are not used to target whistleblowers the issue arose in an exchange with ohio congressman dennis kucinich dohio and related to the experience of sgt samuel provance in his congressional testimony meyers positions have typically supported the independence of discrete constitutional actions this concern for the independence of government decisionmaking is also present in his first appearance in
