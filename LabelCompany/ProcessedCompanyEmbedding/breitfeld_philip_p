danafarber cancer institute dana   binney street boston massachusetts usa abstractthe human asialoglycoprotein receptor is a kda membrane glycoprotein it is initially synthesized as a kda precursor species possessing two nlinked highmannose oligosaccharides which is subsequently converted to the kda mature product upon modification of its oligosaccharides of the complex form schwartz a l  rup d  j biol chem  – to investigate further the biosynthesis of the human asialoglycoprotein receptor we have utilized a cellfree wheat germ translation system supplemented with dog pancreatic microsomal membranes and programmed with hepg and human liver rna the primary translation product of the human receptor is a single kda species and this species is expressed throughout human fetal and adult development the primary translation product possesses no cleavable signal peptide and is cotranslationally glycosylated to form the kda precursor species in addition the human asialoglycoprotein receptor is cotranslationally inserted into microsomal membranes such that a kda cytoplasmic tail is susceptible to trypsin digestionenhanced pdfstandard pdf  kb abbreviationsasgprasialoglycoprotein
