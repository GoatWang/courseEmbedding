ship your final package for arrival on the second business day day trial of attorney advice speak with an independent attorney on an unlimited number of new legal matters  off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation

whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many

environmental record  notes  references  further reading  external links historyedit early yearsedit in  frank c and edmund b ball two of the five ball brothers borrowed  from their uncle george harvey ball founder and first president of keuka college to buy the wooden jacket can company a small manufacturing business in buffalo new york soon the three other brothers william lucius and george joined frank and edmund in buffalo years later the brothers reciprocated their uncles early assistance by providing financial support to keuka college the ball brothers company made tin cans encased in wooden jackets to hold kerosene paints or varnishes because the acid used to refine kerosene caused corrosion in tin the brothers decided to use glass for the inserts of the woodjacketed canscitation needed initially they bought the glass containers from a factory in poughkeepsie new york around  a group of belgian glassblowers who were passing through buffalo encouraged the ball brothers to build their own factory the ball brothers purchased land in east buffalo where they built a twostory brick building for the stamping works and a onestory frame factory for the glass works although a fire destroyed an early glass factory in buffalo the brothers rebuilt and expanded the business to keep the new factorys furnace operating at full capacity the company introduced new products and made improvements to its glass and metal manufacturing processes around  when the brothers discovered that the patent covering the mason improved fruit jar had expired their company began manufacturing canning jars in their glassworks the ball brothers buffalo jars which ranged in size from halfgallon to pint and midget manufactured during a part of   and  jar lids were produced in their metal fabricating factory the ball companys logo was embossed onto the surface of the jars which were made of either amber or aqua bluegreen glass on february   the company incorporated as ball brothers manufacturing company about the same time the factory in buffalo was destroyed by fire in  the brothers began to consider relocating their business closer to natural gas supplies while on a business trip in cleveland ohio frank heard about the natural gas boom in findlay ohio after visiting the town he told edmund about the economic advantages of using natural gas instead of coal for manufacturing glass edmund visited several towns in the gas fields including muncie indiana the two brothers decided to make a more extensive trip to investigate the possibility of establishing a glass factory closer to an abundant supply of natural gas they briefly had doubts about extending beyond buffalo but decided to explore the use of natural gas as a means of expanding their glassmaking business frank and edmund first visited in fostoria ohio where they were enthusiastically welcomed the next stop was bowling green ohio after a night in town edmund returned to buffalo but frank remained after frank had been in bowling green for about a week he received a telegram from james boyce a muncie businessman frank who had become weary of bowling green was ready for a change and decided to run down to muncie and see what they had to offer as frank recalled his early discussions with muncies town leaders there was nothing about the town that particularly appealed to me but the men were all courteous kind and businesslike frank agreed to a proposal that offered the ball brothers  acres  hectares of land for a factory site a gas well and  in cash to encourage the move to muncie in addition city officials agreed to provide a railroad connection to the brothers new facilities by september  construction had begun on the muncie factory and the ball brothers began plans to relocate their glass manufacturing operations from new york frank remained in muncie to get the factory up and running while edmund closed the glass factory in buffalo then moved to muncie to join frank their brothers william and george remained in buffalo to operate the stamping works and a factory in bath new york in  the company opened its first glass manufacturing facility in muncie on february  fires were started in the new factorys furnace on march  its first glass products were made the first products to be manufactured in the new factory in muncie were oil containers and lamp chimneys not fruit jars by  the ball companys headquarters and its glass and metal manufacturing operations had relocated to muncie the other ball brothers moved to indiana in the s george relocated to muncie in  william arrived in  and lucius a company shareholder and a physician moved to muncie in  in the late nineteenth century the company continued to grow and prosper but not without experiencing some challenges fires at its muncie factories and warehouses in  and  damaged its facilities but they were rebuilt despite the economic panic of  the company was able to produce  million fruit jars for the year beginning in september  and  million jars by  when natural gas supplies in the area began to diminish the ball brothers installed gas converters to use indiana coal in their factories and continued manufacturing operations the companys f c ball machine patented in  introduced mass production into its glassblowing process and gave it a competitive market advantage by  the company was producing  million canning jars per year and had acquired other glass manufacturers expanding its operations to include seven factories in addition to its main facilities at muncie in a continuation of the companys difficulties in muncie workers organized with local  glass workers of the industrial workers of the world iww at the main facility went on strike in march  with the strikers demanding wage increases a settlement was quickly reached on march  but company management reneged on the agreement and threatened to declare a lockout the strike continued but was weakened by the refusal of machinists affiliated with the american federation of labor to join the strike by the end of april the strike was lost diversificationedit ball remained a familyowned business for more than ninety years renamed the ball brothers company in  it is best known for manufacturing fruit jars lids and related products for home canning the company also entered into other business ventures because the four main components of their core product line of canning jars included glass zinc rubber and paper the ball company acquired a zinc strip rolling mill to produce metal lids for their glass jars manufactured rubber sealing rings for the jars and acquired a paper mill to fabricate the packaging used in shipping their products the company also acquired tin steel and later plastic companies the ball company faced additional challenges and opportunities during the great depression and world war ii prior to  ball was the largest domestic manufacturer of home canning jars in  it manufactured  percent of all the canning jars made in the united states however a drop in demand for the jars during the s led the ball brothers to begin manufacturing other types of jars and bottles for commercial use and expand into other lines of business during world war ii the companys operations were converted to produce shells and machine parts for the military after the war balls glassmaking business was hindered by an antitrust case in which the company was one of several defendants the legal case was appealed to the us supreme court the final decision which was handed down in  restricted balls ability to acquire other glass manufacturers and other businesses producing glassmaking machinery without prior court approval in  the decreasing demand for canning jars caused the company to suffer its first net operating loss with legal restrictions on the companys ability to expand its glassmaking business and declining demand for its canning jars ball company executives decided that in order to grow it had to further diversity its holdings in the s the ball company entered the aerospace industry laboratories for the ball brothers research corporation were established at boulder colorado and in muncie the company began manufacturing aerospace equipment in  its oso orbiting solar observatory satellite designed and built for the national aeronautics and space

some losses an explosion killed three workers and damaged the companys oso satellite in  the company continued to expand into other areas such as avionics aerospace systems and metal beverage and food containers renamed the ball corporation in  it acquired jeffco manufacturing company a maker of recyclable aluminum beverage cans and became the largest producer of recyclable beverage cans in the

uncle george harvey ball founder and first president of keuka college to buy the wooden jacket can company a small manufacturing business in buffalo new york soon the three other brothers william lucius and george joined frank and edmund in buffalo years later the brothers reciprocated their uncles early assistance by providing financial support to keuka college the ball brothers company made tin cans encased in wooden jackets to hold kerosene paints or varnishes because the acid used to refine kerosene caused corrosion in tin the brothers decided to use glass for the inserts of the woodjacketed canscitation needed initially they bought the glass containers from a factory in poughkeepsie new york around  a group of belgian glassblowers who were passing through buffalo encouraged the ball brothers to build their own factory the ball brothers purchased land in east buffalo where they built a twostory brick building for the stamping works and a onestory frame factory for the glass works although a fire destroyed an early glass factory in buffalo the brothers rebuilt and expanded the business to keep the new factorys furnace operating at full capacity the company introduced new products and made improvements to its glass and metal manufacturing processes around  when the brothers discovered that the patent covering the mason improved fruit jar had expired their company began manufacturing canning jars in their glassworks the ball brothers buffalo jars which ranged in size from halfgallon to pint and midget manufactured during a part of   and  jar lids were produced in their metal fabricating factory the ball companys logo was embossed onto the surface of the jars which were made of either amber or aqua bluegreen glass on february   the company incorporated as ball brothers manufacturing company about the same time the factory in buffalo was destroyed by fire in  the brothers began to consider relocating their business closer to natural gas supplies while on a business trip in cleveland ohio frank heard about the natural gas boom in findlay ohio after visiting the town he told edmund about the economic advantages of using natural gas instead of coal for manufacturing glass edmund visited several towns in the gas fields including muncie indiana the two brothers decided to make a more extensive trip to investigate the possibility of establishing a glass factory closer to an abundant supply of natural gas they briefly had doubts about extending beyond buffalo but decided to explore the use of natural gas as a means of expanding their glassmaking business frank and edmund first visited in fostoria ohio where they were enthusiastically welcomed the next stop was bowling green ohio after a night in town edmund returned to buffalo but frank remained after frank had been in bowling green for about a week he received a telegram from james boyce a muncie businessman frank who had become weary of bowling green was ready for a change and decided to run down to muncie and see what they had to offer as frank recalled his early discussions with muncies town leaders there was nothing about the town that particularly appealed to me but the men were all courteous kind and businesslike frank agreed to a proposal that offered the ball brothers  acres  hectares of land for a factory site a gas well and  in cash to encourage the move to muncie in addition city officials agreed to provide a railroad connection to the brothers new facilities by september  construction had begun on the muncie factory and the ball brothers began plans to relocate their glass manufacturing operations from new york frank remained in muncie to get the factory up and running while edmund closed the glass factory in buffalo then moved to muncie to join frank their brothers william and george remained in buffalo to operate the stamping works and a factory in bath new york in  the company opened its first glass manufacturing facility in muncie on february  fires were started in the new factorys furnace on march  its first glass products were made the first products to be manufactured in the new factory in muncie were oil containers and lamp chimneys not fruit jars by  the ball companys headquarters and its glass and metal manufacturing operations had relocated to muncie the other ball brothers moved to indiana in the s george

without experiencing some challenges fires at its muncie factories and warehouses in  and  damaged its facilities but they were rebuilt despite the economic panic of  the company was able to produce  million fruit jars for the year beginning in september  and  million jars by  when natural gas supplies in the area began to diminish the ball brothers installed gas converters to use indiana coal in their factories and continued manufacturing operations the companys f c ball machine patented in  introduced mass production into its glassblowing process and gave it a competitive market advantage by  the company was producing  million canning jars per year and had acquired other glass manufacturers expanding its operations to include seven factories in addition to its main facilities at muncie in a continuation of the companys difficulties in muncie workers organized with local  glass workers of the industrial workers of the world iww at the main facility went on strike in march  with the strikers demanding wage increases a settlement was quickly reached on march  but company management reneged on the agreement and threatened to declare a lockout the strike continued but was weakened

subsidiaries  environmental record  notes  references  further reading  external links historyedit early yearsedit in  frank c and edmund b ball two of the five ball brothers borrowed  from their uncle george harvey ball founder and first president of keuka college to buy the wooden jacket can company a small manufacturing business in buffalo new york soon the three other brothers william lucius and george joined frank and edmund in buffalo years later the brothers reciprocated their uncles early assistance by providing financial support to keuka college the ball brothers company made tin cans encased in wooden jackets to hold kerosene paints or varnishes because the acid used to refine kerosene caused corrosion in tin the brothers decided to use glass for the inserts of the woodjacketed canscitation needed initially they bought the glass containers from a factory in poughkeepsie new york around  a group of belgian glassblowers who were passing through buffalo encouraged the ball brothers to build their own factory the ball brothers purchased land in east buffalo where they built a twostory brick building for the stamping works and a onestory frame factory for the glass works although a fire destroyed an early glass factory in buffalo the brothers rebuilt and expanded the business to keep the new factorys furnace operating at full capacity the company introduced new products and made improvements to its glass and metal manufacturing processes around  when the brothers discovered that the patent covering the mason improved fruit jar had expired their company began manufacturing canning jars in their glassworks the ball brothers buffalo jars which ranged in size from halfgallon to pint and midget manufactured during a part of   and  jar lids were produced in their metal fabricating factory the ball companys logo was embossed onto the surface of the jars which were made of either amber or aqua bluegreen glass on february   the company incorporated as ball brothers manufacturing company about the same time the factory in buffalo was destroyed by fire in  the brothers began to consider relocating their business closer to natural gas supplies while on a business trip in cleveland ohio frank heard about the natural gas boom in findlay ohio after visiting the town he told edmund about the economic advantages of using natural gas instead of coal for manufacturing glass edmund visited several towns in the gas fields including muncie indiana the two brothers decided to make a more extensive trip to investigate the possibility of establishing a glass factory closer to an abundant supply of natural gas they briefly had doubts about extending beyond buffalo but decided to explore the use of natural gas as a means of expanding their glassmaking business frank and edmund first visited in fostoria ohio where they were enthusiastically welcomed the next stop was bowling green ohio after a night in town edmund returned to buffalo but frank remained after frank had been in bowling green for about a week he received a telegram from james boyce a muncie businessman frank who had become weary of bowling green was ready for a change and decided to run down to muncie and see what they had to offer as frank recalled his early discussions with muncies town leaders there was nothing about the town that particularly appealed to me but the men were all courteous kind and businesslike frank agreed to a proposal that offered the ball brothers  acres  hectares of land for a factory site a gas well and  in cash to encourage the move to muncie in addition city officials agreed to provide a railroad connection to the brothers new facilities by september  construction had begun on the muncie factory and the ball brothers began plans to relocate their glass manufacturing operations from new york frank remained in muncie to get the factory up and running while edmund closed the glass factory in buffalo then moved to muncie to join frank their brothers william and george remained in buffalo to operate the stamping works and a factory in bath new york in  the company opened its first glass manufacturing facility in muncie on february  fires were started in the new factorys furnace on march  its first glass products were made the first products to be manufactured in the new factory in muncie were oil containers and lamp chimneys not fruit jars by  the ball companys headquarters and its glass and metal manufacturing operations had relocated to muncie the other ball brothers moved to indiana in the s george relocated to muncie in  william arrived in  and lucius a company shareholder and a physician moved to muncie in  in the late nineteenth century the company continued to grow and prosper but not without experiencing some challenges fires at its muncie factories and warehouses in  and  damaged its facilities but they were rebuilt despite the economic panic of  the company was able to produce  million fruit jars for the year beginning in september  and  million jars by  when natural gas supplies in the area began to diminish the ball brothers installed gas converters to use indiana coal in their factories and continued manufacturing operations the companys f c ball machine patented in  introduced mass production into its glassblowing process and gave it a competitive market advantage by  the company was producing  million canning jars per year and had acquired other glass manufacturers expanding its operations to include seven factories in addition to its main facilities at muncie in a continuation of the companys difficulties in muncie workers organized with local  glass workers of the industrial workers of the world iww at the main facility went on strike in march  with the strikers demanding wage increases a settlement was quickly reached on march  but company management reneged on the agreement and threatened to declare a lockout the strike continued but was weakened by the refusal of machinists affiliated with the american federation of labor to join the strike by the end of april the strike was lost diversificationedit ball remained a familyowned business for more than ninety years renamed the ball brothers company in  it is best known for manufacturing fruit jars lids and related products for home canning the company also entered into other business ventures because the four main components of their core product line of canning jars included glass zinc rubber and paper the ball company acquired a zinc strip rolling mill to produce metal lids for their glass jars manufactured rubber sealing rings for the jars and acquired a paper mill to fabricate the packaging used in shipping their products the company also acquired tin steel and later plastic companies the ball company faced additional challenges and opportunities during the great depression and world war ii prior to  ball was the largest domestic manufacturer of home canning jars in  it manufactured  percent of all the canning jars made in the united states however a drop in demand for the jars during the s led the ball brothers to begin manufacturing other types of jars and bottles for commercial use and expand into other lines of business during world war ii the companys operations were converted to produce shells and machine parts for the military after the war balls glassmaking business was hindered by an antitrust case in which the company was one of several defendants the legal case was appealed to the us supreme court the final decision which was handed down in  restricted balls ability to acquire other glass manufacturers and other businesses producing glassmaking machinery without prior court approval in  the decreasing demand for canning jars caused the company to suffer its first net operating loss with legal restrictions on the companys ability to expand its glassmaking business and declining demand for its canning jars ball company executives decided that in order to grow it had to further diversity its holdings in the s the ball company entered the aerospace industry laboratories for the ball brothers research corporation were established

more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation

would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an
