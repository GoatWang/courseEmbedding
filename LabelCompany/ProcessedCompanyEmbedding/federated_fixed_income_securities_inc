such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or “turns over” its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the funds performance during the most recent fiscal year the funds portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio  riskreturn summary investments risks and performance what are the funds main investment strategies the fund allocates the portfolio among three categories of fixedincome investments domestic investmentgrade including but not limited to us government mortgagebacked and corporate domestic noninvestmentgrade corporate also known as junk bonds and leveraged loans and foreign investments both investmentgrade and noninvestment grade including but not limited to government and corporate investments traded in both emerging and developed markets and trade finance based upon historical returns the funds investment adviser “adviser” expects the three categories of investments to have different returns and risks under similar market conditions the adviser relies on the differences in the expected performance of each category to manage risks by allocating the funds portfolio among the three categories the adviser seeks to enhance the funds performance by allocating more of its portfolio to the category that the adviser expects to offer the best balance between risk and return while the funds portfolio usually includes securities from all three categories the fund limits the amount it may invest in a single category to  of its assets in addition  when the adviser considers the riskreturn prospects of equity securities to be attractive the fund may also opportunistically invest up to  of its assets in equity securities including common stocks preferred stocks warrants convertible securities and pooled investment vehicles such as exchangetraded funds etfs or other investment companies pooled vehicles are utilized in order to gain broad exposure to the equity market the fund may also invest in derivative contracts or hybrid instruments such as for example futures contracts option contracts and swap contracts to implement its investment strategies as more fully described herein the adviser may invest in bonds of any maturity the fund may at times use derivative securities to take a position on interest rate moves certain of the government securities in which the fund invests are not backed by the full faith and credit of the us government such as those issued by the federal home loan mortgage corporation “freddie mac” the federal national mortgage association “fannie mae” and the federal home loan bank system these entities are however supported through federal subsidies loans or other benefits the fund may also invest in government securities that are supported by the full faith and credit of the us government such as those issued by the government national mortgage association “ginnie mae” finally the fund may invest in a few government securities that have no explicit financial support but which are regarded as having implied support because the federal government sponsors their activities because the fund refers to fixedincome investments in its name it will notify shareholders at least  days in advance of any change in its investment policies that would enable the fund to normally invest less than  of its assets in fixedincome investments  what are the main risks of investing in the fund all mutual funds take investment risks therefore it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund the primary factors that may reduce the funds returns include ■  interest rate risk prices of fixedincome securities generally fall when interest rates rise interest rate changes have a greater effect on the price of fixedincome securities with longer durations duration measures the price sensitivity of a fixedincome security to changes in interest rates ■  prepayment risk  when homeowners prepay their mortgages in response to lower interest rates the fund will be required to reinvest the proceeds at the lower interest rates available also when interest rates fall the price of mortgagebacked securities may not rise to as great an extent as that of other fixedincome securities ■  call risk  an issuer may redeem a fixedincome security before maturity a call at a price below its current market price ■  credit risk  it is possible that interest or principal on securities will not be paid when due noninvestmentgrade securities generally have a higher default risk than investmentgrade securities such nonpayments or default may reduce the value of the funds portfolio holdings its share price and its performance ■  risk associated with noninvestmentgrade securities the fund may invest a portion of its assets in securities rated below investment grade which may be subject to greater interest rate credit and liquidity risks than investmentgrade securities ■  risk related to the economy the value of the funds portfolio may decline in tandem with a drop in the overall value of the stock market economic and financial conditions may from time to time and for varying periods of time cause volatility illiquidity shareholder redemptions political andor other potentially adverse effects in the financial markets among other investments lowergrade corporate bond returns are sensitive to changes in the economy ■  currency risk exchange rates for currencies fluctuate daily accordingly the fund may experience increased volatility with respect to the value of its shares and its returns as a result of its exposure to foreign currencies through direct holding of such currencies or holding of nonus dollar denominated securities ■  eurozone related risk a number of countries in the european union eu have experienced and may continue to experience severe economic and financial difficulties additional eu member countries may also fall subject to such difficulties these events could negatively affect the value and liquidity of the funds investments in eurodenominated securities and derivatives contracts securities of issuers located in the eu or with significant exposure to eu issuers or countries  ■  risk of foreign investing because the fund invests in securities issued by foreign companies the funds share price may be more affected by foreign economic and political conditions taxation policies and accounting and auditing standards than would otherwise be the case ■  risk of investing in emerging market countries  securities issued or traded in emerging markets generally entail greater risks than securities issued or traded in developed markets emerging market economies may also experience more severe downturns with corresponding currency devaluations than developed economies ■  liquidity risk the fixedincome securities in which the fund invests may be less readily marketable and may be subject to greater fluctuation in price than other securities liquidity risk also refers to the possibility that the fund may not be able to sell a security or close out a derivative contract when it wants to if this happens the fund could incur losses ■  leverage risk leverage risk is created when an investment exposes the fund to a level of risk that exceeds the amount invested changes in the value of such an investment magnify the funds risk of loss and potential for gain ■  risk of investing in derivative contracts and hybrid instruments derivative contracts and hybrid instruments involve risks different from or possibly greater than risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments specific risk issues related to the use of such contracts and instruments include valuation and tax issues increased potential for losses andor costs to the fund and a potential reduction in gains to the fund each of these issues is described in greater detail in this prospectus derivative contracts and hybrid instruments may also involve other risks described in this prospectus or the funds statement of additional information sai such as interest rate credit currency liquidity and leverage risks ■  exchangetraded funds risk an investment in an exchangetraded fund etf generally presents the same primary risks as an investment in a conventional fund ie one that is not exchangetraded that has the same investment objectives strategies and policies the price of an etf can fluctuate up or down and the fund could lose money investing in an etf if the prices of the securities owned by the etf go down ■  risk of loss after redemption the fund may also invest in trade finance loan instruments primarily by investing in other investment companies which are not available for general investment by the public that owns those instruments and that are advised by an affiliate of the adviser and is structured as an extended payment fund epf in the epf the fund as shareholder will bear the risk of investment loss during the period between when shares of such epf are presented to the transfer agent of the epf for redemption and when the net asset value of the epf is determined for payment of the redeemed epf shares the “redemption pricing date”  ■  sector risk companies with similar characteristics may be grouped together in broad categories called sectors sector risk is the possibility that a certain sector may underperform other sectors or the market as a whole as the adviser allocates more of the funds portfolio holdings to a particular sector the funds performance will be more susceptible to any economic business or other developments which generally affect that sector ■  stock market risk the value of equity securities in the funds portfolio will fluctuate and as a result the funds share price may decline suddenly or over a sustained period of time information publicly available about a company whether from the companys financial statements or other disclosures or from third parties or information available to some but not all market participants can affect the price of a companys shares in the market ■  small cap company risk the fund may invest in small capitalization or “smallcap” companies smallcap companies may have less liquid stock a more volatile share price unproven track records a limited product or service base and limited access to capital the above factors could make smallcap companies more likely to fail than larger companies and increase the volatility of the funds portfolio performance and share price ■  risk related to investing for growth due to their relatively high valuations growth stocks are typically more volatile than value stocks for instance the price of a growth stock may experience a larger decline on a forecast of lower earnings a negative fundamental development or an adverse market development further growth stocks may not pay dividends or may pay lower dividends than value stocks this means they depend more on price changes for returns and may be more adversely affected in a down market compared to value stocks that pay higher dividends ■  risk related to investing for value due to their relatively low valuations value stocks are typically less volatile than growth stocks for instance the price of a value stock may experience a smaller increase on a forecast of higher earnings a positive fundamental development or positive market development further value stocks tend to have higher dividends than growth stocks this means they depend less on price changes for returns and may lag behind growth stocks in an up market ■  technology risk the adviser uses various technologies in managing the fund consistent with its investment objective and strategy described in this prospectus for example proprietary and thirdparty data and systems are utilized to support decision making for the fund data imprecision software or other technology malfunctions programming inaccuracies and similar circumstances may impair the performance of these systems which may negatively affect fund performance the shares offered by this prospectus are not deposits or obligations of any bank are not endorsed or guaranteed by any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the
