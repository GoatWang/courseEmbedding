brokerage firms have setup their own managed futures funds and recommended thousands of investors place their assets in these funds however a bloomberg article has raised questions concerning the suitability of managed futures funds according to the article from  to   of the futures fund trading profits and interest for  secregistered funds were consumed by fees and commissions leaving investors with little profit for their investment in the wake of the article’s revelations the commodity futures trading commission cftc has opened an investigation into the high fees charged to investorsas a background the expected gross return to a fully collateralized futures position equals the return to a cash investment plus compensation for the risk borne in the collateral investment for stocks and stock index futures the compensation is the expected return on the stock market for other underlying investments the expected returns is often less thus a managed futures fund investment with  to  annual expenses on average will earn much less than stocks and bonds over the same period of time due to the commissions and fees taken from the fund by the managers and the brokerage firm each year that would otherwise be available to the investorsthe failure of managed futures funds is also backed up by empirical research from january  through the end of  the bloomberg article found that morgan stanley had  customers to invest  million into a managedfutures fund called morgan stanley smith barney spectrum technical lp the prospectus for spectrum technical fund stated that the fund was potentially profitable “when traditional markets are experiencing losses” and recommended the fund as a way to diversify an investor’s holdings beyond traditional stocks and bonds the prospectus also allegedly boasted that over a twentythree year period investors who placed ten percent of their assets in managed futures outperformed portfolios comprised only of stocks and bondsthe spectrum technical fund earned  million in trading gains and income from  through  according to the article nonetheless investors who remained in the fund during this period did not receive any of the returns because the manager’s and morgan stanley’s commissions expenses and fees paid totaled  million thus spectrum technical investors lost  million for no other reason than the fees charged to the fund were greater than the gainsbelow are some managed futures funds we are currently investigatingthe morgan stanleyceres managedfutures fundsmorgan stanley smith barney spectrum

bloomberg’s david evans raised this question in his recent fleeced by fees david found that  of the futures trading profits and interest on collateral in  secregistered managed futures funds from  to  were consumed by fees and commissions david’s story shines a light on the abusive fees charged by the managed futures partnerships his story quotes a spokesperson for the national futures association selfregulatory organization  trade group as saying that “we can’t just give investors all the answers” thankfully his follow up story last week reports that the cftc has opened an investigation into the high fees and so more useful information might be on the way to investors soon we’ve been working on this story ourselves for a while now and find substantially the same results as david the table below lists the investment income including futures profits and interest income in  secregistered managed futures funds from  to  this sample is a little larger than david’s primarily because it includes some funds that didn’t survive to the end of  our  filers reported  billion in interest income and  billion in futures trading profits for a total of  billion in investment returns from  to  the firms deducted  billion in fees and commissions  of the investment returns and distributed only  billion  to investors as if that wasn’t evidence enough that the registered managed futures funds are robbing investors consider this the interest on the collateral was  billion that is the registered managed futures funds on average paid out none of the  billion in futures trading profits and only twothirds of the interest earned on the low risk collateral purchased with investors capital investors would be far better to have invested in a diversified bond portfolio than to invest in a

investment returns but deducted  billion in fees and commissions leaving investors with only  of the returns for bearing the risk of the futures trading on the collateral purchased the campbell strategic allocation fund collateral alone earned  million and so investors received only about  of the returns on the fixed income collateral and none of the profits from the futures trading there are other great examples of what is a ubiquitous pattern of excessive fees the  registered managed futures partnerships managed by morgan stanley’s affiliate ceres had gross returns of  billion but net returns of only  billion after  billion in fees were deducted over the  years from  to  annualized gross returns to the ceres funds were  expenses were  and net returns only  during the same period sp stocks annual return was  beating the ceres managed futures partnerships  out of  years municipal bonds during the same period had an annual tax free return of  and taxable bonds  ceres managed futures partnership returns  in millions the expected gross return to a fully collateralized futures position is the return to a cash investment plus whatever compensation is required for the risk borne in the collateral investment for stocks and stock index futures this is the expected return on the stock market for other underlying investments the expected returns are less the expected gross return to actively managed futures is also equal to the expected returns to actively managed cash investments given this simple arithmetic a managed futures investment with  to  annual expenses on average will earn much less than combinations of stocks and bonds over time because of the extraordinary withdrawals taken by the industry each year from investors’ capital the clear answer to the

managed future funds fees  expenses class action lawsuit in november  bloomberg published a startling report about the fees and expenses some fund managers charge investors in “managedfutures” funds  the conclusion was that in dozens and dozens of managed futures funds the managers charged fees and expenses that totaled  of all the profit of that given fund a managedfutures fund  is an alternative investment which is often defined as an investment other than cash stocks or bonds  typically these investments are sold to investors through brokers and many large brokerage houses have there own proprietary managed futures investments  barcalyhedge estimates that over  billion was invested in managed accounts in mid  sec reporting requirements  one difference between managed futures funds and say typical stocks and bonds is that in general managed futures funds are not required to file with the united states securities and exchange commission the “sec” the sec does however require that all managed futures funds with more than  investors and more than  million in assets file financial reports within  days of their fiscal year’s end  bloomberg as part of its investigation concluded that there are currently  managedfutures funds that fit into this category the vast majority of managedfutures funds therefore have no reporting requirement as they are not subject to the  investor rule bloomberg’s big ciscovery regarding managed futures funds fees and expenses bloomberg concluded that managedfutures funds can charge clients  to  each year of the investment amount in the fund plus  percent of the funds’ profits  hedge funds typically only charge a  management fee plus  of investor profits bloomberg next concluded that for the period from jan   to dec   a stunning  of the  billion of gains in these  managedfutures funds went to fees commissions and expenses collected by the fund managers—not to investors  one example morgan stanley smith barney spectrum

are both owned and controlled by mssb market and manage the sale of the morgan stanley spectrum series of managed futures funds morgan stanley smith barney and ceres managed futures llc acting as sponsor general partner manager investment manager and investment advisor to pooled investment vehicles with portfolios of managed futures funds are marketed and sold to institutional and highnetworth hnw investors through the mssb spectrum series of managed futures funds the rationale provided by morgan stanley’s financial advisors used to support its recommendation that investors allocate a portion of their portfolio in managed futures contracts is to generate portfolio returns with greater returns on a riskadjusted basis the purported low correlation of managed futures funds with the overall securities markets provides superior results for an investment portfolio during “down markets” which smooth portfolio returns over time morgan stanley financial advisors caution investors that they cannot “markettime” when to invest in managed futures funds which they argue makes investments in managed futures funds a permanent part of a buyhold asset allocation strategy the morgan stanley spectrum series of managed futures funds invest in asset classes that include trading futures contracts in equity indices ie developed and emerging markets interest rates ie us bonds eurodollar bonds eurobund commodities ie energy agriculture and metals and currencies ie dollar euro pound yen through investments in managed futures funds investors are allegedly able to access invests in nontraditional asset classes that have a low correlation with traditional equity and fixed income securities markets resulting an overall increase in investment returns on a riskadjusted basis at issue for investors is the performance of morgan stanley’s managed futures funds after the management fees have been deducted from the account in most instances investment advisors are compensated by a flat management fee based on assets under management additionally an “incentivebased” fee is deducted based on profits in “up” years this “performancebased” fee is usually paid net of all fees in addition to management and performance fees a managed futures account has deducted from the balance expenses for transactions costs and commissions the net result for investors has been the loss of trading profits from a poorlyexplained regime of excessive fees and conflicts of interest designed to enrich morgan stanley the morgan stanley spectrum series of managed futures funds are
