securitization settlement standing strategic default tila tila audit trustee wall street weisband wells fargo wrongful foreclosure leslie seidman lighting up a dark room at the fasb posted on december   by neil garfield leslie f seidman chairman fasb editor’s comment you probably don’t know the name seidman much less  leslie seidman but back in the ’s when the accounting rules were first being changed causing briloff to write the book unaccountable accounting the seidman accounting firm was one of the few who understood the significance and moral hazard of what was being laid at the foundation of required disclosure and certification of financial statements neither seidman nor briloff got the attention they deserved because they were bearing messages that nobody wanted to hear the usual excuses of apparent “transparency” and facilitating free flow of capital and commerce were used to justify giving management the right to basically tell you what you wanted to hear if you were holding the stock or bond or to induce you to buy if you were a prospective investor the eventual changes were monumental in scope misleading in nature and essentially legitimized fraud on the securities exchanges which had a catalytic effect on the fringe shadow markets where regulation was already spotty at best now through a fluke of circumstance leslie seidman has become chairman of the financial accounting standards board and stands in a position similar to elizabeth warren to change the way business is reported on wall street — a fact making many people nervous all over the world of finance the fasb makes the rules on generally accepted accounting practices gaap she has no incentive that we know of to do anything but the job to which she was appointed without favoritism to wall street business or anyone else and she stands a good chance of reappointment when her term runs out after the previous chairman suddenly stepped down this time there is a light at the end of the tunnel and it’s name is seidman — a longstanding reputable name in the field of accounting let’s hope she is able to push through the reforms required to bring us back to days when we could actually know the condition of companies cities states and the federal government maybe we could even bring to light “selling forward” and price earnings ratios on “forward earnings” the possibilities are endless you may not know the name leslie seidman but if the us regains respect in the world of finance it will be because of people like seidman shapiro at the sec and warren at the consumer

offbalance sheet financing securitization joyce louise on december   at  am said this is great of course and will be very well accepted i believe now by all concerned takes me back though in the days when all of a sudden the internal auditors the state auditors the fed auditors all called us to let us know when they would be there and what files to pull i knew then we were in trouble it goes without saying that “surprise” audits are still very key to well run operations and those that run a tight ship are going to have it made can you imagine calling in to let us know which files to pull for audit like i said i knew it was the beginning of the end leave a reply cancel reply enter your comment here fill in your details below or click an icon to log in email required address never made
