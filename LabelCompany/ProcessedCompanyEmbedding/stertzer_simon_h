had distinctive technical requirements to achieve success including high pressure balloon inflation    atm and the need for unconventional right coronary guide catheters technical factors that account

success of the procedure and has compromised to some extent the attractiveness of the technique in the treatment of ischemic heart disease assessment of recurrence predictors has been problematic due to lack of coordination of angioplasty recurrence research and includes incomplete angiographic documentation variations in definitions of restenosis anatomically and the results of restenosis physiologically ie myocardial ischemia the dirth of morphologic specifications of subsets under investigation and late outcome pathology limitations in statistical analyses used and minimal efforts to classify the available data on recurrence a review of the literature suggests that all findings regarding recurrence after angioplasty can be organized in four categories clinical morphologic technical or procedural and pharmacologic the reported findings with high concordance as risk factors for recurrence after angioplasty include the clinical factors of diabetes mellitus hyperlipidemia and angina of short duration or unstable presentation morphologic factors which have been corroborated visàvis recurrence include stenoses with diameter reduction of greater than  before and greater than  after angioplasty residual transstenotic pressure gradients of greater than  mmhg after angioplasty and lesions that are diffuse long eccentric or calcified technical factors associated with recurrence include lower balloonvessel or graft ratios and the absence of uncomplicated intimal dissection the category most deficient in research regarding recurrence after angioplasty is pharmacologic since there are statistically documented and reproducible factors predictive of restenosis to ignore or minimize these findings or resist further evaluation because of the ease and safety of performing repeat angioplasty is to deny the opportunity to understand the mechanisms and favorably affect the incidence of recurrence this review concludes with two major implications of the restenosis research certain clinical technical and pharmacologic factors if addressed may predictably decrease the rate of restenosis and certain clinical and morphologic factors may increase the risk of restenosis these factors may be less readily modified eg diabetes lesion calcification and thus must be considered in the decision for angioplastyabstract truncated at  words view details for
