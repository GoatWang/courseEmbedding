organized on february   as a blank check or shell company under the laws of the state of delaware the company does not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow from inception the primary activity of the company has been directed towards organizational efforts compliance matters and locating potential merger or acquisition candidates       the company has registered its common stock on a form  registration statement filed pursuant to the securities exchange act of  the exchange act and rule g thereof the company files with the us securities and exchange commission periodic reports under rule a of the exchange act including quarterly reports on form q and annual reports on form k   the company was formed to engage in a merger with or acquisition of an unidentified private company which desires to become a reporting public company whose securities are qualified for trading in the united states secondary market the company meets the definition of a blank check company contained in section b of the securities act of  as amended   the company believes that there are perceived benefits to being a reporting company with a class of publiclytraded securities which may be attractive to foreign and domestic private companies   these benefits are commonly thought to include    the ability to use registered shares to make acquisition of assets or businesses     increased visibility in the financial community    the facilitation of borrowing from financial institutions    improved trading efficiency    shareholder liquidity    greater ease in subsequently raising capital    compensation of key employees through options for stock for which there is a public market    enhanced corporate image and    a presence in the united states capital market   a private company which may be interested in a business combination with the company may include the following    a company for which a primary purpose of becoming public is the use of its securities for the acquisition of assets or businesses    a company which is unable to find an underwriter of its securities or is unable to find an underwriter of securities on terms acceptable to it        a company which wishes to become public with less dilution of its common stock than would occur normally upon an underwriting    a company which believes that it will be able to obtain investment capital on more favorable terms after it has become public    a foreign company which may wish an initial entry into the united states securities market    a special situation company such as a company seeking a public market to satisfy redemption requirements under a qualified employee stock option plan and    a company seeking one or more of the other benefits believed to attach to a public company   the company is authorized to enter into a definitive agreement with a wide variety of private businesses without limitation as to their industry or revenues it is not possible at this time to predict with which private company if any the company will enter into a definitive agreement or what will be the industry operating history revenues future prospects or other characteristics of that company   as of the date hereof management of the company has not made any final decision for a business combination with any private corporations partnerships or sole proprietorships when any such agreement is reached or other material fact occurs the company will file notice of such agreement or fact with the us securities and exchange commission on form k persons reading this financial statement are advised to see if the company has subsequently filed a form k   there is presently no trading market for the companys common stock and no market may ever exist for the companys common stock the company plans to apply for a corporate cusip  for its common stock and to assist brokerdealers in complying with rule c of the securities exchange act of  as amended so that such brokers can quote the price of the companys common stock in the overthecounter bulletin board the otc bulletin board or “otcbb” after the company is no longer classified as a blank check or shell company as defined by the us securities and exchange commission there can be no assurance to investors that any brokerdealer will actually file the materials required in order for such otc bulletin board trading to proceed   the us securities and exchange commission has adopted a rule rule  which defines a blankcheck company as i a development stage company that is ii offering penny stock as defined by rule a and iii that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies   business combination       the company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with the company the combination will normally take the form of a merger stockforstock exchange or stockforassets exchange the business combination in most instances the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a taxfree reorganization under section  or section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target business   the company has not restricted its search for any specific kind of businesses and it may acquire a business which is in its preliminary or development stage which is already in operation or in essentially any stage of its business life it is impossible to predict the status of any business in which the company may become engaged in that such business may need to seek additional capital may desire to have its shares publicly traded or may seek other perceived advantages which the company may offer   in implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition the company may become a party to a merger consolidation reorganization joint venture or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity   it is anticipated that any securities issued in any such business combination would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws in some circumstances however as a negotiated element of its transaction the company may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter if such registration occurs it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after the company has entered into an agreement for a business combination or has consummated a business combination the issuance of additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in the companys securities may depress the market value of the companys securities in the future if such a market develops of which there is no assurance   the company will participate in a business combination only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements negotiations with a target company will likely focus on the percentage of the combined companys shares which the target company shareholders would acquire in exchange for their shareholdings   although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted generally such agreements will require certain representations and warranties of the parties thereto will specify certain events of default will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing and will include miscellaneous other terms any merger or acquisition effected by the company can be expected to have a significant dilution effect on the percentage of shares held by the companys shareholders at such time   operational results       the company has no current operating history and does not have any revenues or earnings from operations the company has no assets or financial resources we will in all likelihood sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues at least until the consummation of a business combination this may result in the company incurring a net operating loss that will increase continuously until the company can consummate a business combination with a profitable business opportunity there is no assurance that we can identify such a business opportunity and consummate such a business combination   liquidity and capital resources   on december   the company had no cash and no other assets we are dependent upon our officers to meet any minimum costs that may occur mr zhong fang president of the company has agreed to provide the necessary funds without interest for the company to comply with the securities
