ms beverly knotts principal pobox  newark de  fax  bbb of delaware  reads way new castle de   infodelawarebbborg fax  msdeborah platt majorus chairperson federal trade commission  pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc  on october   after numerous attempts to call their cs number that is printed on the billing statement which makes it very difficult to reach a live cs person i inquired about the “late payment charges” for the october billing cycle i was told that the late payment charges were due to late receipt of my payment my payments to them are always made  weeks in advance to assure that payments are received on time but in the last two months it seems that the checks are delayed or processed late in order to charge a late fee of  when the customer service rep told me that they were not responsible for the usps mail being delivered late i decided that this was a good indication of their business practices and it would be best for me to close this account out i asked the cs rep to close the account out and asked for a payoff that included the  late fees she indicated it was  and that amount was minus a credit for disputed charges by digicom i advised her that i would be sending out the check to pay off the account and she acknowledged that she would be indicating this in her notes today november   i received a statement for total due   annual fee and account maintenance fee when i tried to reach their cs i spend more than an hour trying the different options and three different numbers in order to talk to a cs rep the  tells you to call  and this number does not give you an option to talk to a live cs no matter what option you select after going online and doing a general search for cfc i found a local  number the first cs rep that i spoke to said this account was never closed out and that i had to pay the fees i then asked to speak to his supervisor and they basically told me the same thing i then asked to speak to his supervisor or manager and was transferred to a manager named mark after approx  min of pleading my case and trying to remain calm which i have to admit there was a few times i failed due to the collective frustration of trying to contact someone and resolving this issue i was told that the account was never closed as there were no comments or notes and that the best he would do is “halve” the charges and the account would be settled write a review for continental finance company llc rate it       review title you review image type the numbers shown recently updated reviews mmocs fast efficient simple mmovipnet

much do you really know about credit scores though your credit score affects everything from your ability to rent an apartment to how much you’ll pay every month on your car loan many people aren’t sure how scores are calculated don’t know what the scores are used for and believe common credit score lies and myths that cause them to make dumb money decisions so what’s the truth behind this allimportant number “your credit score plays a pivotal role in your financial journey as far as numbers go it’s one of the most important that will ever be attached to your name” julie pukas head of us bankcard and merchant services at td bank told the cheat sheet the majority of people understand that mortgage lenders and credit card companies use credit scores when making lending decisions a recent survey by the consumer federation of america cfa and vantagescore found most also know that declaring bankruptcy or making late payments will hurt your score but beyond those basics misinformation and credit score lies abound only  of people surveyed by the cfa were aware that a low credit score could increase the cost of a car loan by  and more than half didn’t realize landlords utility companies cellphone companies and insurers sometimes check credit scores “many people scorn credit but the simple fact of the matter is that in most situations your credit score is a deciding factor in whether you’ll be approved for a mortgage car loan credit card or another type of loan” pukas said “if you’re looking for an apartment your score may impact your probability of getting approved the size of your security deposit and how much you pay in fees it can also impact how much you pay for home and auto insurance and might even decide whether you’re approved for a new cell

familiarizing yourself with the truth behind these seven big credit score lies continue reading  credit score lies you shouldn’t believe comments closed unsecured loans vs secured published january   there are two basic categories that most loan types fall into – unsecured and secured unsecured loan on the other hand unsecured loans are the opposite of secured loans and include things like credit card purchases education loans or personal signature loans lenders take more of a risk by making such a loan with no property or assets to recover in case of default which is why the interest rates are considerably higher if you have been turned down for unsecured credit you may still be able to obtain secured loans as long as you have something of value or if the purchase you wish to make can be used as collateral when you apply for a loan that is unsecured the lender believes that you can repay the loan on the basis of your financial resources you will be judged based on the five  c’s of credit — character capacity capital collateral and conditions – these are all criteria used to assess a borrower’s creditworthiness character capacity capital and collateral refer to the borrower’s willingness and ability to repay the debt conditions include the borrower’s situation as well as general economic factors   continue reading unsecured loans vs secured comments closed  reasons why good credit matters published january   society is becoming increasingly dependent on using credit to make purchases and decisions these days good credit is used for more than just getting a credit card or a loan more and more businesses are making the case that you must have good credit before they extend products or services to you it affects where you live and how much you pay before you can buy a house mortgage lenders want to know that you won’t default on your mortgage if you don’t have good credit the lender will consider it risky to give you a mortgage loan if you’re approved for a mortgage your credit affects your interest rate which directly impacts your monthly mortgage payment bad credit could mean a higher mortgage payment worse than that your mortgage application could be

security compromised even more so to have one’s identity stolen as much as we want to be exempted from identity theft there is just no guarantee that we won’t be targeted by those culprits this doesn’t mean that you should take the security of your identity lightly on the contrary you have to be even more alert and vigilant if a time will come that you think you may fall prey to credit card fraud or identity theft don’t hesitate to take the necessary actions to prevent it from happening for example if you have lost your wallet with your credit cards and social security card in it don’t delay in contacting your creditor and have the card cancelled then immediately have a fraud alert placed on your credit report to help prevent a possible identity theft fraud alert the name itself
