welltower keith speights tmffishbiz jun   at pm any way you look at it welltower inc nysehcn is an outstanding dividend stock the healthcare real estate investment trust reit pays out a solid dividend that currently yields  it has a great overall track record of increasing its dividend and the stock itself has performed quite well also but as good as welltower is there are better dividend stocks heres why att nyset enterprise products partners nyseepd and medical properties trust nysempw look like smarter picks right now image source getty images att the stock chart of telecommunications giant att appears to be almost a mirror image of welltower so far this year atts share price has dropped almost as much as welltowers share price has climbed however att easily tops welltower when it comes to dividends for one thing att holds the elite status of dividend aristocrat the company has increased its dividend for  consecutive years atts yield of  is well above welltowers and although the telecommunications company is using  of its earnings to fund the dividend thats still better than welltower which is spending more on its dividend than it has earned what about atts recent history of spotty revenue and earnings growth its no secret that the company operates in an intensely competitive industry however atts pending acquisition of time warner nysetwx gives it something that the company has lacked in filling out its lineup of products and services content assuming the deal goes through att should be in a nice position to launch its own wireless cable service in the future  enterprise products partners enterprise products partners hasnt experienced as tough of a year in  as att has however the midstream energy companys yeartodate stock performance doesnt match up to welltowers i wouldnt worry too much about these shortterm results though steady dividends from enterprise have likely kept shareholders fairly happy the yield currently stands at  enterprise has increased its dividend for  years in a row the company is spending nearly  of earnings to pay out those dividends but enterprises strong cash flow allows it to keep the dividends flowing anyway over the long run enterprise products partners has a lot to offer investors beyond its dividend most of its business is feebased so the company isnt as vulnerable to fluctuations in oil and gas prices enterprise is also investing in the future with  billion worth of major capital projects in the works medical properties trust medical properties trust has several things in common with welltower both are reits both focus on healthcare although medical properties trust focuses primarily on hospitals while welltower has more exposure to senior housing both also have really attractive dividends  except medical properties trust appears to have an advantage in that area welltower does claim a better record of dividend increases since medical properties trust only has a threeyear streak of consecutive annual dividend increases however medical properties trusts dividend yield of  is simply outstanding the company also has a payout ratio similar to that of welltower there are a couple of other reasons investors might prefer medical properties trust first its significantly cheaper than welltower with shares trading at only  times expected earnings versus a forward earnings multiple of  for welltower second medical properties trust appears poised for higher earnings growth over the next few years than welltower is   keith speights has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley

generally accepted accounting principles us gaap are the most appropriate earnings measurements however we consider funds from operations ffo net operating income noi same store net operating income ssnoi same store revenues per occupied room ss revpor and adjusted ebitda aebitda to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance excluding aebitda these supplemental measures are disclosed on our pro rata ownership basis pro rata amounts are derived by reducing consolidated amounts for minority partners noncontrolling ownership interests and adding our minority ownership share of unconsolidated amounts we do not control unconsolidated investments while we consider pro rata disclosures useful they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with us gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient in response the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income ffo attributable to common stockholders as defined by nareit means net income attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with us gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate and impairments of depreciable assets plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests   normalized ffo attributable to common stockholders represents ffo attributable to common stockholders adjusted for certain items detailed in exhibit   we believe that normalized ffo attributable to common stockholders is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use this measure to compare the operating performance of the company between periods or as compared to other reits or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated andor incalculable items we define noi as total revenues including tenant reimbursements less property operating expenses  property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing maintaining and servicing tenants for our seniors housing operating and outpatient medical properties  these expenses include but are not limited to propertyrelated payroll and benefits property management fees paid to operators marketing housekeeping food service maintenance utilities property taxes and insurance  general and administrative expenses represent costs unrelated to property operations or transaction costs  these expenses include but are not limited to payroll and benefits professional services office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets ssnoi is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties under a consistent population which eliminates changes in the composition of our portfolio  as used herein same store is generally defined as those revenuegenerating properties in the portfolio for the relevant yearoveryear reporting periods  land parcels loans and subleases as well as any properties acquired developedredeveloped transitioned sold or classified as held for sale during that period are excluded from the same store amounts  normalizers include adjustments that in managements opinion are appropriate in considering ssnoi a supplemental nongaap performance measure  none of these adjustments which may increase or decrease ssnoi are reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap  significant normalizers defined as any that individually exceed  of ssnoi growth per property type are separately disclosed and explained in the relevant supplemental information package we believe ssnoi provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis no reconciliation of the forecasted range for ssnoi on a combined or segment basis for fiscal year  is included in this release because we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the comparable gaap financial measure without unreasonable efforts and we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that could be confusing or misleading to investors revpor represents the average revenues generated per occupied room per month at our seniors housing operating properties  it is calculated as the pro rata version of resident fees and services revenues per the income statement divided by average monthly occupied room days  ss revpor is used to evaluate the revpor performance of our properties under a consistent population which eliminates changes in the composition of our portfolio it is based on the same pool of properties used for ssnoi and includes any revenue normalizations used for ssnoi we use revpor and ss revpor to evaluate the revenuegenerating capacity and profit potential of our seniors housing operating portfolio independent of fluctuating occupancy rates they are also used in comparison against industry and competitor statistics if known to evaluate the quality of our seniors housing operating portfolio we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to longterm debt net of cash and irc section  deposits we expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile the coverage ratios are based on ebitda which stands for earnings net income per income statement before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization covenants in our senior unsecured notes contain financial ratios based on a definition of ebitda that is specific to those agreements  failure to satisfy these covenants could result in an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition  due to the materiality of these debt agreements and the financial covenants we have defined aebitda to exclude unconsolidated entities and to include adjustments for stockbased compensation expense provision for loan losses gainslosses on extinguishment of debt transactions costs gainslossesimpairments on properties gainslosses on derivatives and other nonrecurring andor noncash incomecharges we believe that aebitda along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations our leverage ratios include net debt to undepreciated book capitalization and net debt to aebitda undepreciated book capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization book capitalization represents the sum of net debt defined as total longterm debt less cash and cash equivalents and any irc section  deposits total equity and redeemable noncontrolling interests our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors equity and debt analysts and ratings agencies in the valuation comparison rating and investment recommendations of companies  our management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions  additionally they are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management  the supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity  finally the supplemental reporting measures as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies  please see the exhibits for reconciliations of supplemental reporting measures and the supplemental information package for the quarter ended june   which is available on the companys website wwwwelltowercom for information and reconciliations of additional supplemental reporting measures about welltower welltower inc nyse hcn an sp  company
