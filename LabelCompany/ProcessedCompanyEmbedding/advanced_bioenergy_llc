commoditiescareers contact industry resources what is fuel ethanol how is ethanol produced ethanol factshome how is ethanol produced ethanol production process  dry milling in dry milling the entire corn kernel is first processed into flour which is referred to in the industry as meal this meal is then slurried with water to form a mash enzymes are added to the mash to convert the starch to dextrose a simple sugar ammonia is added for ph control and as a nutrient to the yeast the mash is processed in a hightemperature cooker at approximately  degrees celsius to reduce bacteria levels ahead of fermentation the mash is cooled to around  degrees celsius and transferred to fermenters where yeast is added and the transformation of sugar to ethanol and carbon dioxide co begins the fermentation process takes approximately  to  hours at this point of the process the mash is agitated and kept cool to facilitate the activity of the yeast after fermentation is completed the resulting beer is transferred to distillation columns where the ethanol is separated from the remaining stillage the ethanol is concentrated to  proof using conventional distillation and then is further dehydrated to approximately  proof often this is done in a molecular sieve system the anhydrous pure ethanol is then blended with about  denaturant such as natural gasoline to render it undrinkable so that it is not subject to beverage alcohol tax the finished product can then be shipped to gasoline terminals or retailers coproducts ddgs corn oil  co the stillage is sent through a centrifuge that separates the coarse grain from the solubles the solubles are then concentrated to about  solids by evaporation resulting in condensed distillers solubles cds or syrup syrup is sent through a centrifuge to remove corn oil corn oil is used for livestock feed or biodiesel production the coarse grain and the remaining syrup are then dried together to produce dried distillers grains with solubles ddgs a high quality livestock feed the co released during fermentation can be captured and sold for use in carbonating soft drinks and beverages and the manufacture of dry ice for more
