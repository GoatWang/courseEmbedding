follows at the turn of the nineteenth century obtaining a bank charter required an act of the state legislature this of course injected a powerful element of politics into the process and invited what today would be called corruption but then was regarded as business as usual hamiltons political enemy—and eventual murderer—aaron burr was able to create a bank by sneaking a clause into a charter for a company called the manhattan company to provide clean water to new york city the innocuouslooking clause allowed the company to invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise within six months of the companys creation and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe the company opened a bank the bank of the manhattan company still in existence it is today j p morgan chase the largest

a company called the manhattan company to provide clean water to new york city the innocuouslooking clause allowed the company to invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise within six months of the companys creation and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe the company opened a bank the bank of the manhattan company still in existence it is today j p morgan chase the largest
