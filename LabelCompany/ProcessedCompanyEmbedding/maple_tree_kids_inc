generate losses over the next  months due to an anticipated increase in its general and administrative expenses due to the above mentioned business activities and not having sufficient cash to fund its current and future operations therefore there is no assurance that future operations will result in any profit if the company cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably in  the company may need to cease its operations in  if the business operations expand operating expenses will increase and the profit margins may not be able to cover this increase and as a result the

cash equivalents  we classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities   use of estimates  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from those estimates there were no significant estimates at september   and december     fair value of financial instruments the book values of cash prepaid expenses and accounts payable approximate their respective fair values due to the shortterm nature of these instruments the fair value hierarchy under gaap distinguishes between assumptions based on market data observable inputs and an entity’s own assumptions unobservable inputs   the hierarchy consists of three levels      · level one — quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities         · level two — inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable and         · level three — unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use   determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment we evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter   segments and related information the company operates primarily in one principal business segment infant and toddler products    amortization of website the accompanying balance sheet reflects our websites at cost less accumulated amortization the estimated useful life is  years and these websites were developed in  and amortized using the straight line method over its useful life our website is wwwpolkadotpatchcom the cost and accumulated amortization of the

consumers are recorded when the price is fixed or determinable and goods are shipped to the customers sales are reported net of allowances for estimated returns and allowances in the accompanying statements of income allowances for returns are estimated based on historical customer return rates customers prepay for orders through our website with their credit cards prior to the shipment of the goods which takes place within a few days after the order is placed the company does not carry inventory and all orders are dropshipped by our vendors and shipped directly by them to our customers   the company evaluates the criteria outlined in fasb asc subtopic  revenue recognition—principal agent considerations  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when the company is primarily obligated in a transaction is subject to inventory risk has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers or has several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded gross if the company is not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage a fixedpayment schedule or a combination of the two the company generally records the net amounts as commissions earned the company records revenue as a principal pursuant to above mentioned factors establishing that the revenue be recorded as a principal      table of contents    allowances against accounts receivable  the company did not have any accounts receivable at september   and december   the company will record allowances against accounts receivable based upon contractually agreedupon deductions for items such as customer returns these deductions are recorded throughout the year commensurate with sales activity and historical product returns all such allowances are recorded as direct offsets to sales the company gives all its customers a  day product return policy on all sales the allowances are reduced to reflect such payments or credits issued against the customer’s account balance after  days there are no returns but the company may issue an optional store credit to the customer for up to  of the sale amount there are no returns for sales of products that are personalized for its customers the company analyzes the components of the allowances for customer deductions monthly and adjusts the allowances to the appropriate levels there was no sales returns allowance recorded at september   and december   the historical sales return rate for the company in relation to its total sales have not been significant   income taxes  income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that the recoverability of the asset is unlikely to be recognized we did not provide any current or deferred income tax provision or benefit for any periods presented to date because we have continued to experience a net operating loss since inception and therefore provide a  valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets   the company adopted the fasb asc accounting guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions as defined in the fasb asc topic “income taxes” this guidance prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefits of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements this guidance also provides accounting guidance on derecognizing classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions the company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses the company has not recognized any interest and penalties in  or    earnings per share basic and diluted earnings per share are computed based on the weightedaverage common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the period the merger with maple tree kids llc took place on september   and prior periods have been restated to reflect the change in the capitalization of the company at the merger date   advertising costs advertising costs are expensed as incurred advertising costs for the three and nine months ended september   and  were  and  respectively these expenses when incurred are recorded under general and administrative expenses   shipping and handling fees charged to customers and reported as revenue shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified on the statements of income under the caption selling general and administrative expenses    gift cards the company will collect the proceeds from gift cards issued and record a liability for the full amount sold this liability will be reduced when the company honors redemptions of the gift cards as a form of tender as a result the company will maintain a liability equivalent to  of the proceeds from unredeemed gift cards less estimated unredeemed gift cards for the three and nine months ended september   and  there were no significant gift cards sales therefore the “unredeemed gift certificates” liability was  at september   and december     in recognizing the unredeemed gift card income above the company considered the guidance under asc  liabilitiesextinguishments of liabilitiesderecognition paragraph  that states “a debtor shall derecognize a liability if and only if it has been extinguished a liability under this standard has been extinguished if either of the following conditions is met a the debtor pays the creditor and is relieved of its obligation for the liability or b the debtor is legally released from being the primary obligor under the liability either judicially or by the creditor” the recognition of unredeemed gift card income is not expected to be material in future reporting periods if we have future sales of gift cards we will review historical gift card redemption information at each reporting period to assess the continued appropriateness of the gift card breakage rates and pattern of redemption      table of contents    contingencies certain conditions may exist which may result in a loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur the company’s management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein   if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated the estimated liability would be accrued in the company’s financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed   loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they arise from guarantees in which case the guarantees would be disclosed   recentlyissued accounting standards   in may  the fasb issued guidance on the accounting for revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most existing revenue recognition guidance including industryspecific guidance the core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in addition the guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december   entities can choose to apply the guidance using either the full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements   asu  – “presentation of financial statements—going concern—disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern “asu ”” in august  the fasb issued asu  requiring management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances asu  is effective for annual periods

those forward looking statements   overview   we are a webbased retailer of clothing accessories and other personalized gifts for children we currently sell our products through our website wwwpolkadotpatchcom we do not have any stores or outlets we are in the process of rebranding our business under the name maple tree kids we are devoting a substantial amount of our efforts promoting our personalized children products creating a new logo marketing and sales collateral and creating a new website wwwmapletreekidscom   we acquire our products from approximately  wholesale vendors all located in the united states who will also dropship the inventory we purchase from them to our customers we do not manufacture any of our own products we have not entered into any formal supply agreements with these vendors we are required to pay in full for products purchased from these vendors upon delivery if the prices charged by these vendors increase and we are not able to pass on the increased price to our customers then our margins will be reduced and this will affect our potential for future profitability   principal factors affecting our financial performance   our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors   · our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next  months   · our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon   · our ability to develop and continually update our websites   · our ability to procure and maintain on commercially reasonable terms relationships with third parties from whom we acquire inventory   · our ability to identify and pursue mediums through which we will be able to market our products   · our ability to attract new customers to our websites who are interested in purchasing our products and   · our ability to manage our costs and maintain low overhead     · based upon current plans we expect to incur operating losses in future periods because we will continue to be developing our maple tree kids website to sell personalized children products that will be located at wwwmapletreekidscom and will be incurring expenses and not generating significant revenues      table of contents   · we are dependent upon our relationship with our major customer this customer accounted for approximately  and  of our total revenues for the nine months ended september   and  respectively this major customer is not contractually obligated to purchase any minimum amount of products from us and can discontinue buying products from us at any time if we fail to maintain this relationship our sales will be significantly diminished any change in the terms of our sales to our major customer could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations   · our sales are dependent on our ability to attract retail customers to our website on costeffective terms our strategy to attract customers to our website includes viral marketing the practice of placing advertisements and offering giveaways on various highly rated baby weblogs or blogs online journals that are updated frequently and available to the public postings on online communities such as facebook myspace yahoor groups and amateur websites such as youtubecom and other methods of getting internet users to refer others to our website by email or word of mouth search engine optimization marketing our website via search engines by purchasing sponsored placement in search results and entering into affiliate marketing relationships with website providers to increase our access to internet consumers we expect to rely on word of mouth marketing as the primary source of traffic to our website with search engine optimization and affiliate marketing as secondary sources    results of operations for the three months and nine months ended september   and    revenues   our revenue was  and  for the three months ended september   and  respectively and  and  for the nine months ended september   and  respectively this decrease in revenue in  is due to a decrease in the volume of items sold through our current website to our major customer and other customers   our ability to generate a significant level of revenues however is very uncertain we continue to be devoting substantially all of our efforts to rebranding our company under the name maple tree kids to sell more personalized children products to the market and creating related marketing and sales collateral a new logo and new website among other things   cost of sales   our cost of sales was  and  for the three months ended september   and  respectively and  and  for the nine months ended september   and  respectively the decrease in the cost of sales for  was due to our decrease in revenue in  as we sold less merchandise to our major customer and fewer retail customers in    gross profit   we generated gross profit of  and  for the three months ended september   and  respectively and  and  for the nine months ended september   and  respectively the decrease in the gross profit for the three months and nine months ended september   was due to the decrease in revenue in  versus    operating expenses   our operating expenses were  and  for the three months ended september   and  respectively and  and  for the nine months ended september   and  respectively the decrease in our operating expenses in  was due primarily to the decrease in expenses related to our public company listing   net loss   our net loss for the three months ended september   and  was  and  respectively and for the nine months ended september   and  was  and  respectively the decrease in net loss in  was due to the reasons stated above      table of contents    impact of potential loss of our major customer on our liquidity   currently sales to our major customer constitute approximately  and  of our total revenue for the nine months ended september  and  respectively and revenue from them has decreased from prior periods any further decrease in selling our products to them will substantially affect our future operating results and future liquidity although we currently have a satisfactory relationship with our major customer if they were to terminate their relationship or stop ordering products from us these events would currently result in a loss of substantially all of our revenue which would have a material impact on the liquidity and future of our company it is uncertain how long our major customer will continue to order products from us as we do not have any assurances from them as to how long they will continue ordering products from us we do not have an exclusive agreement with them for selling our type of products to them   in the event that the company is not able to retain our major customer or obtain new customers we will incur increased operating losses and we will need to raise additional capital to maintain our current operations or cease operations we presently do not have sufficient working capital to advertise in order to increase our webbased sales by attracting new customers to our websites we are not presently negotiating any agreements with any new customers   liquidity and capital resources

whether collectability is reasonably assured pursuant to our credit review policy all credit card payments are approved and processed through our website   we evaluate the criteria outlined in fasb asc subtopic  revenue recognition—principal agent considerations in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as

have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded gross if we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage a fixedpayment schedule or a combination of the two we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned   based on the above facts we recognize all revenue as a principal not an agent      table of contents    use of

company will be attracting customers to its websites by viral marketing including placing advertisements and offering promotions on various baby weblogs or “blogs” online journals that are updated frequently and postings to other online communities there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in distributing personalized baby products through its maple tree kids website into the retail market   sales of the company’s products are made to retail consumers the company buys all of its products from various manufacturers located in the united states and all products are marketed and sold under these manufacturers’ trademarks the company presently sells all of its products over the internet through its website polkadotpatchcom   the company’s product sales into the infant and toddler retail market are subject to numerous contingencies some of which are beyond management’s control these contingencies include general and regional economic conditions prices for the company’s products competition and changes in regulation various additional political economic and other uncertainties   going concern   the company generated a net loss of  for the nine months ended september   and expects to generate losses over the next  months due to an anticipated increase in its general and administrative expenses due to the above mentioned business activities and not having sufficient cash to fund its current and future operations therefore there is no assurance that future operations will result in any profit if the company cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably in  the company may need to cease its operations in  if the business operations expand operating expenses will increase and the profit margins may not be able to cover this increase and as a result the company may not be able to develop into a profitable business in the future   management’s plans for the company include raising additional capital through either debt or equity issuances management estimates the minimum amount of additional funding necessary to enable the company to remain viable and continue its operations for at least the twelve months following the date of the financial statements is approximately  in september  and october  we raised  in our registered offering this registered offering was closed on november   we also obtained a total of  and  of shareholder advances during the nine months september   and  respectively the total balance due to this principal shareholder was  and  as of september   and december   respectively   no assurance can be given that management will be successful in its efforts to raise additional capital from present or future shareholders or from its principal shareholder the failure to raise additional capital needed to achieve its business plans will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations and ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   managements plans due to the lack of sufficient financial resources and the continuing negative operating results for the company include securing a suitable merger partner or acquiring private companies to create investment value for the company however no assurance can be given that management will be successful in these efforts              table of contents      note  – summary of significant accounting policies   fiscal year the companys fiscal year ends december     cash and cash equivalents  we classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities   use of estimates  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from those estimates there were no significant estimates at september   and december     fair value of financial instruments the book values of cash prepaid expenses and accounts payable approximate their respective fair values due to the shortterm nature of these instruments the fair value hierarchy under gaap distinguishes between assumptions based on market data observable inputs and an entity’s own assumptions unobservable inputs   the hierarchy consists of three levels        · level one — quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities         · level two — inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable and         · level three — unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use     determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment we evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter   segments and related information the company operates primarily in one principal business segment infant and toddler products    amortization of website the accompanying balance sheet reflects our websites at cost less accumulated amortization the estimated useful life is  years and these websites were developed in  and amortized using the straight line method over its useful life our website is wwwpolkadotpatchcom the cost and accumulated amortization of the websites for the nine months ended september   and for the year ended december   were both  as these websites were fully amortized at september   and december     revenue recognition sales to consumers are recorded when the price is fixed or determinable and goods are shipped to the customers sales are reported net of allowances for estimated returns and allowances in the accompanying statements of income allowances for returns are estimated based on historical customer return rates customers prepay for orders through our website with their credit cards prior to the shipment of the goods which takes place within a few days after the order is placed the company does not carry inventory and all orders are dropshipped by our vendors and shipped directly by them to our customers   the company evaluates the criteria outlined in fasb asc subtopic  revenue recognition—principal agent considerations  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when the company is primarily obligated in a transaction is subject to inventory risk has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers or has several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded gross if the company is not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage a fixedpayment schedule or a combination of the two the company generally records the net amounts as commissions earned the company records revenue as a principal pursuant to above mentioned factors establishing that the revenue be recorded as a principal              table of contents      allowances against accounts receivable  the company did not have any accounts receivable at september   and december   the company will record allowances against accounts receivable based upon contractually agreedupon deductions for items such as customer returns these deductions are recorded throughout the year commensurate with sales activity and historical product returns all such allowances are recorded as direct offsets to sales the company gives all its customers a  day product return policy on all sales the allowances are reduced to reflect such payments or credits issued against the customer’s account balance after  days there are no returns but the company may issue an optional store credit to the customer for up to  of the sale amount there are no returns for sales of products that are personalized for its customers the company analyzes the components of the allowances for customer deductions monthly and adjusts the allowances to the appropriate levels there was no sales returns allowance recorded at september   and december   the historical sales return rate for the company in relation to its total sales have not been significant   income taxes  income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that the recoverability of the asset is unlikely to be recognized we did not provide any current or deferred income tax provision or benefit for any periods presented to date because we have continued to experience a net operating loss since inception and therefore provide a  valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets   the company adopted the fasb asc accounting guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions as defined in the fasb asc topic “income taxes” this guidance prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefits of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements this guidance also provides accounting guidance on derecognizing classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions the company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses the company has not recognized any interest and pe q maple tree kids inc  marketwatch latest news dow    nasdaq    sp

discussion and analysis of financial conditions of operations the following managements discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report in addition to historical information the following discussion contains certain forwardlooking information see special note regarding forward looking statements above for certain information concerning those forward looking statements overview we are a webbased retailer of clothing accessories and other personalized gifts for children we currently sell our products through our website wwwpolkadotpatchcom we do not have any stores or outlets we are in the process of rebranding our business under the name maple tree kids we are devoting a substantial amount of our efforts promoting our personalized children products creating a new logo marketing and sales collateral and creating a new website wwwmapletreekidscom we acquire our products from  wholesale vendors all located in the united states who will also dropship the inventory we purchase from them to our customers we do not manufacture any of our own products we have not entered into any formal supply agreements with these vendors we are required to pay in full for products purchased from these vendors upon delivery if the prices charged by these vendors increase and we are not able to pass on the increased price to our customers then our margins will be reduced and this will affect our potential for future profitability principal factors affecting our financial performance our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors � our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next  months � our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon � our ability to develop and continually update our websites � our ability to procure and maintain on commercially reasonable terms relationships with third parties from whom we acquire inventory � our ability to identify and pursue mediums through which we will be able to market our products � our ability to attract new customers to our websites who are interested in purchasing our products and � our ability to manage our costs and maintain low overhead � based upon current plans we expect to incur operating losses in future periods because we will continue to be developing our maple tree kids website to sell personalized children products that will be located at wwwmapletreekidscom and will be incurring expenses and not generating significant revenues � we are dependent upon our relationship with our major customer this customer accounted for approximately  of our total revenues for the six months ended june   and  this major customer is not contractually obligated to purchase any minimum amount of products from us and can discontinue buying products from us at any time if we fail to maintain this relationship our sales will be significantly diminished any change in the terms of our sales to our major customer could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations � our sales are dependent on our ability to attract retail customers to our website on costeffective terms our strategy to attract customers to our website includes viral marketing the practice of placing advertisements and offering giveaways on various highly rated baby weblogs or blogs online journals that are updated frequently and available to the public postings on online communities such as facebook myspace yahoor groups and amateur websites such as youtubecom and other methods of getting internet users to refer others to our website by email or word of mouth search engine optimization marketing our website via search engines by purchasing sponsored placement in search results and entering into affiliate marketing relationships with website providers to increase our access to internet consumers we expect to rely on word of mouth marketing as the primary source of traffic to our website with search engine optimization and affiliate marketing as secondary sources results of operations for the three months and six months ended june   and june   revenues we generated revenues of  and  for the three months ended june   and  respectively and  and  for the six months ended june   and  respectively this decrease in revenue in  is due to a decrease in the volume of items sold through our current website to our major customer our ability to generate a significant level of revenues however is very uncertain we continue to be devoting substantially all of our efforts to rebranding our company under the name maple tree kids to sell more personalized children products to the market and creating related marketing and sales collateral a new logo and new website among other things cost of sales our cost of sales was  and  for the three months ended june   and  respectively and  and  for the six months ended june   and  respectively the decrease in the cost of sales for  was due to our decrease in revenue in  as we sold less merchandise to our major customer and fewer retail customers in  gross profit we generated gross profit of  and  for the three months ended june   and  respectively and  and  for the six months ended june   and  respectively the decrease in the gross profit for the three months and six months ended june   was due to the decrease in revenue in  versus  operating expenses our operating expenses were  and  for the three months ended june   and  respectively and  and  for the six months ended june   and  respectively the increase in our operating expenses for the three month periods in  and  was due primarily to the increase in fees in order for our stock to be listed on the otcqb marketplace stock exchange  paid and dues paid for our stock to be eligible for electronic trading using the depository trust company of  net loss our net loss for the three months ended june   and  was  and  respectively and for the six months ended june   and  was  and  respectively the increase in net losses in  was due to the reasons stated above impact of potential loss of our major customer on our liquidity currently sales to our major customer constitute approximately  of our total revenue any substantial decrease in selling our products to them will substantially affect our operating results and liquidity although we currently have a satisfactory relationship with our major customer if they were to terminate their relationship or stop ordering products from us these events would currently result in a loss of substantially all of our revenue which would have a material impact on the liquidity of our company it is uncertain how long our major customer will continue to order products from us as we do not have any assurances from them as to how long they will continue ordering products from us we do not have an exclusive agreement with them for selling our type of products to them in the event that the company is not able to retain our major customer or obtain new customers we will incur increased operating losses and we will need to raise additional capital to maintain our current operations or cease operations we presently are seeking to increase our webbased sales by attracting new customers to our websites we are not presently negotiating any agreements with any new major customers liquidity and capital

that affect companies conducting business on the internet in addition laws and regulations relating to user privacy freedom of expression content advertising information security and intellectual property rights are being debated and considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world we face risks from some of the proposed legislation that could be passed in the future�in the us laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims which include actions for libel slander invasion of privacy and other tort claims unlawful activity copyright and trademark infringement and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched the ads posted or the content generated by users certain foreign jurisdictions are also testing the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties any court ruling that imposes liability on providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties could harm our business�a range of other laws and new interpretations of existing laws could have an impact on our business for example the digital millennium copyright act has provisions that limit but do not necessarily eliminate our liability for listing linking or hosting thirdparty content that includes materials that infringe copyrights in the area of data protection many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data such as californias information practices act the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation furthermore any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities�employees�we currently have one officer our president irina goldman ms goldman is not compensated for the services she provides to the company

condition as well as other information included in this annual report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones our company faces additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected�risks related to our business�we generate a significant amount of our present revenues from one major customer and if our relationship with this major customer deteriorates in any way our ability to generate future revenues consistent with prior revenues may be severely hampered and we may have to wind down our business and cease operations�one major customer a federally chartered credit union who buys gifts for each of their customers who have a newborn child accounted for approximately  of our total revenues for the years ended december   and december   this major customer is not contractually obligated to purchase any minimum amount of products from us and can discontinue buying products from us at any time it is likely that our competitors will pursue a relationship with this major customer and threaten our business relationship with this major customer if we fail to maintain this relationship our sales will be significantly diminished any change in the terms of our sales to our major customer would have a material impact on our operations and financial position �we do not have sufficient working capital to meet our cash requirements for the next  months and we are not certain that we will be able to secure the financing we need to meet those requirements if we do not obtain the financing we need to satisfy our financial requirements we will have to wind down our business and you may lose your entire investment�as of december   we had  of cash we intend to meet our projected ongoing cash requirements of approximately  for the next  months by utilizing existing working capital and by raising the shortfall through a combination of the proceeds of this offering and of equity and debt financing from either our principal shareholder irina goldman who is also our director president and principal stockholder or other investors if we are able to identify other investors willing to purchase our securities or loan funds to us we may not be able to secure financing from other investors and our principal shareholder has not committed through any agreement to provide any additional financing to us if financing is available it may involve issuing securities that could be dilutive to holders of our capital stock if we do not raise additional capital from conventional sources such as our principal stockholder or new investors or commercial banks it is likely that our growth will be restricted and we may be forced to scale back or curtail implementing our business plan and our business may fail and you may lose your entire investment if we borrow money to raise capital or sell debt securities we may become subject to affirmative and negative covenants that may limit our ability to operate our business or impose other restrictions that may affect our financial condition and growth strategy furthermore if we cannot make required payments of interest or principal on loans that we may obtain or debt securities that we may issue then the lender or note holder may declare a default that may result in our bankruptcy or a situation where the lender or note holder otherwise takes over our business and your investment would be entirely lost�because our auditors have issued a going concern opinion there is substantial uncertainty we will continue operations in which case you could lose your entire investment�our auditors have issued a going concern opinion in their report on our financial statements for the fiscal years ended december   and  this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next  months the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business as such we may have to cease our operations and you could lose your entire investment�the company generated a net loss of  for the year ended december   and we expect to generate losses into the future as our general and administrative expenses increase as a result of paying professional fees related to becoming a public reporting company as we attempt to raise money to expand our current business there is no assurance our future operations will result in any profit if we cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably we will cease operations and you will lose your investment if our business operations expand and our operating expenses increase our profit margins may decrease and we may not be able to develop into a profitable business in the future� ���our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon� �our ability to develop and continually update our website� �our ability to procure and maintain on commercially reasonable terms relationships with third parties that drop ship our products for us� �our ability to identify and pursue mediums through which we will be able to market our products� �our ability to attract new customers to our websites who are interested in purchasing our products and� �our ability to keep managing our costs and maintain low overhead�based upon current plans we expect to incur operating losses in future periods because we will continue to be developing our business and will be incurring expenses and not generating significant revenues we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating significant revenues in the future to pay for all our operating expenses failure to generate revenues that are greater than our expenses will result in the loss of all or a portion of your investment�changing consumer preferences will require periodic new product introduction if we are unable to continually satisfy new consumer preferences we may not generate any material level of revenues�as a result of changing consumer preferences many internet websites are successfully marketed for a limited period of time even if our products become popular there can be no assurance that any of our products will continue to be popular for a sustained period of time our success will be dependent upon our ability to introduce new and improved product lines our failure to introduce new product lines and to achieve and sustain market acceptance could result in us being unable to continually meet consumer preferences and generate any material level of revenues�we face intense competition now and if we are unable to successfully compete with our competitors we will not be able to achieve profitability�the childrens clothing accessories and products industry is highly competitive most of our competitors have longer operating histories greater brand recognition broader product lines and greater financial resources and advertising budgets than we do many of our competitors offer similar products or alternatives to our products we may not be able to develop a more appealing online website than our competitors and we may not be able to otherwise compete effectively against our competitors�further our competitors may be able to develop their markets more effectively have significantly more products than us may be able to sell their products on more favorable terms and may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing than us they may have longer operating histories greater brand name recognition larger customer bases and significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources in the event that we are unable to successfully compete with our competitors we will not be able to achieve profitability�we face a difficult current retail environment and changing economic conditions that may further adversely affect consumer demand and spending and as a result adversely affect our financial condition�historically childrens clothing accessories and related products have been subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects such uncertainty as well as other variations in global economic conditions such as consumer confidence rising fuel costs and slowing housing starts may continue to cause inconsistent and unpredictable consumer spending habits many industry analysts believe the internet sale of childrens clothing accessories and related products business segment is a very difficult business segment to operate in successfully should consumer demand for our products continue at these current low levels for an extended period of time or deteriorate it will be difficult to achieve our financial goals and plans� ���if we do not attract customers to our website on costeffective terms we will not make a profit which ultimately will result in a cessation of operations�our success depends on our ability to attract retail customers to our website on costeffective terms our strategy to attract customers to our website includes viral marketing the practice of generating buzz among internet users in our products through placing advertisements and

strategy may not be enough to attract sufficient traffic to our website if we do not attract customers to our website on costeffective terms we will not make a profit which ultimately will result in a cessation of operations additional marketing efforts include participating in promotional events run through groupon bitsy bug and similar programs however sufficient additional purchase volume by each individual customer redeeming the coupons is required in order to generate profit�our success depends on the continuing efforts of president and the loss of her services could result in a disruption of operations that could result in reduced revenues�we have no employees and our future success depends heavily upon the continuing services of our president and principal stockholder irina goldman if ms goldman is unable or unwilling to continue in her present positions we may not be able to replace her easily or at all and our business may be disrupted and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected we do not currently maintain key person insurance on our president the loss of the services of our president could result in a disruption of operations that could result in reduced revenues�because our president owns more than  of our outstanding shares she controls our company and is able to designate our directors and officers and control all major decisions and corporate actions and so long as our president retains ownership of a majority of our outstanding common stock you will not be able to elect any directors or have a meaningful say in any major decisions or corporate actions which could decrease the price and marketability of our shares�our president is the sole officer and director of our company she owns  shares of our common stock constituting  of our outstanding common stock as of the date of this annual report and will own a majority of the common shares outstanding if all shares are sold in this offering as a result our president is able to elect all of our directors appoint all of our officers control the shareholder vote on any major decision or corporate action and control our operations our president can unilaterally decide major corporate actions such as mergers acquisitions future securities offerings amendments to our charter and bylaws and other significant corporate events our presidents unilateral control over us could decrease the price and marketability of our shares�our business depends on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage generally as well as the level of usage of our services and reduce our revenues�the success of our services will depend largely on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure this includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed data capacity and security as well as timely development of complementary products for providing reliable internet access and services the internet has experienced and is likely to continue to experience significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic the internet infrastructure may be unable to support such demands in addition increasing numbers of users increasing bandwidth requirements or problems caused by viruses worms and similar programs may harm the performance of the internet the backbone computers of the internet have been the targets of such programs the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure and it could face outages and delays in the future these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage generally as well as the level of usage of our services and reduce our revenues�interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair our ability to effectively provide our products which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results�our ability to provide our products depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems any damage to or failure of our systems could interrupt our service service interruptions could reduce our revenues and profits and damage our name if our system is perceived to be unreliable our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption as a result of terrorist attacks war earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses interruptions in access to our websites through the use of denial of service or similar attacks hacking or other attempts to harm our systems and similar events some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning does not account for all possible scenarios the occurrence of a natural disaster or a closure of an internet data center by a thirdparty provider without adequate notice could result in lengthy service interruptions interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair our ability to effectively provide our products which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results� ���if our website contains undetected errors we could lose the confidence of users resulting in loss of customers and a reduction of revenue�our websites could contain undetected errors or bugs that could adversely affect the ability of our customers to order products through our website the occurrence of errors may cause us to lose market share damage our reputation and brand name and reduce our revenues�if the security measures that we use to protect our users personal information such as credit card numbers are ineffective our customers may lose their confidence in our websites and stop visiting it this may result in a reduction in revenues and increase our operating expenses which would prevent us from achieving profitability�we use wwwyahoocom paypal for our website

technology licensed from third parties to provide secure transmission of confidential information as a result of advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments a compromise or breach of our security precautions may occur a compromise in our proposed security could severely harm our business a party who is able to circumvent our proposed security measures could misappropriate proprietary information including customer credit card information or cause interruptions in the operation of our website we may be required to spend significant funds and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches however protection may not be available at a reasonable price or at all concerns regarding the security of ecommerce and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions this may result in a reduction in revenues and increase our operating expenses which would prevent us from achieving profitability�as an emerging growth company under the jobs act we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements�we qualify as an emerging growth company under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to� �have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act� �comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis� �submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as sayonpay and sayonfrequency and� �disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executives compensation to median employee compensation�in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards�we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in rule b under the exchange act which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period�until such time however we cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and our share price may be more volatile� ���risks related to the ownership of our stock�our stock has not been listed on any public exchange and no prediction can be made as to when if ever a public market for our common stock would develop�to date there has been no public market for our common stock no prediction can be made as to when if ever a public market for our common stock will develop there is no liquidity for shares distributed in this offering and investors may have difficulty in selling any shares acquired in the offering at prices they want or at all if a public market for the common stock does develop at a future time sales of shares by stockholders of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could reduce the prevailing market price and could impair our future ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities the company is not listed on any public exchange and there are no market makers currently applying to handle the companys stock�we will likely conduct offerings of our equity securities in the future in which case your proportionate interest will be diluted�since our inception we have relied on stock sales to our principal stockholder even if this equity offering is successful we will likely be required to undertake additional equity offerings in the future to finance our current business if common stock is issued in return for additional funds the price per share could be lower than that you pay in this offering we anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to fund our business operations if we issue additional stock your percentage interest in us will be diluted�penny stock regulations under us federal securities laws may adversely affect the ability of investors to resell their shares�we anticipate that our common stock will be subject to the penny stock rules under the securities exchange act of  these rules regulate brokerdealer practices for transactions in penny stocks penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than  per share the penny stock rules require brokerdealers that derive more than five percent of their customer transaction revenues from transactions in penny stocks to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market to any noninstitutional customer to whom the brokerdealer recommends a penny stock transaction the brokerdealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account the bid and offer quotations and the brokerdealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to completing the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customers confirmation in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction the broker andor dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction the transaction costs associated with penny stocks are high reducing the number of brokerdealers who may be willing to engage in the trading of our shares these additional penny stock disclosure requirements are burdensome and may reduce all the trading activity in the market for our common stock as long as the common stock is subject to the penny stock rules holders of our common stock may find it more difficult to sell their shares�reporting requirements under the exchange act and compliance with the sarbanesoxley act of  including establishing and maintaining acceptable internal controls over financial reporting are costly�we presently do not have a business that produces significant revenues however the rules and regulations pursuant to the exchange act require a public company to provide periodic reports which will require that we engage legal accounting and auditing services the engagement of such services can be costly and we are likely to incur losses that may adversely affect our ability to continue as a going concern additionally the sarbanesoxley act of  will require that our company establish and maintain adequate internal controls and procedures over financial reporting the costs of complying with the sarbanesoxley act of  and the limited time that management will devote to our company may make it difficult for us to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting in the event that we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls we may not be able to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud which may harm our financial condition and result in loss of investor confidence and a decline in our share price� ���our security holders may face significant restrictions on the resale of our securities due to state blue sky laws�each state has its own securities laws often called blue sky laws which  limit sales of securities to a states residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration and  govern the reporting requirements for brokerdealers and stock brokers doing business directly or indirectly in the state before a security is sold in a state there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction or it must be exempt from registration also the broker must be registered in that state we do not know whether our securities will be registered or exempt under the laws of any states a determination regarding registration will be made by the brokerdealers if any who agree to serve as the marketmakers for our securities there may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell and on purchasers to buy our securities investors should consider the resale market for our securities to be limited security holders may be unable to resell their securities or they may be unable to resell them without the

going concern�note �� summary of significant accounting policies�fiscal year the companys fiscal year ends december ��cash and cash equivalents�we classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities�use of estimates�the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from those estimates there were no significant estimates at december   and december  � �f��fair value of financial instruments�the book values of cash prepaid expenses and accounts payable approximate their respective fair values due to the shortterm nature of these instruments the fair value hierarchy under gaap distinguishes between assumptions based on market data observable inputs and an entitys own assumptions unobservable inputs�the hierarchy consists of three levels�� �level one�� quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities�level two�� inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable�and�level three�� unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use�determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment we evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter�segments and related information the company operates primarily in one principal business segment infant and toddler products��amortization of website the accompanying balance sheet reflects our websites at cost less accumulated amortization the estimated useful life is  years and these websites were developed in  and amortized using the straight line method over its useful life our website is wwwpolkadotpatchcom�the cost and accumulated amortization of the websites for the years ended december   and december   were both  as these websites were fully amortized at december   and december  �revenue recognition sales to consumers are recorded when the price is fixed or determinable and goods are shipped to the customers sales are reported net of allowances for estimated returns and allowances in the accompanying statements of income allowances for returns are estimated based on historical customer return rates customers prepay for orders through our website with their credit cards prior to the shipment of the goods which takes place within a few days after the order is placed the company does not carry inventory and all orders are dropshipped by our vendors and shipped directly by them to our customers�the company evaluates the criteria outlined in fasb asc subtopic  revenue recognition�principal agent considerations  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when the company is primarily obligated in a transaction is subject to inventory risk has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers or has several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded gross if the company is not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage a fixedpayment schedule or a combination of the two the company generally records the net amounts as commissions earned the company records revenue as a principal pursuant to above mentioned factors establishing that the revenue be recorded as a principal�allowances against accounts receivable�the company did not have any accounts receivable at december   and  the company will record allowances against accounts receivable based upon contractually agreedupon deductions for items such as customer returns these deductions are recorded throughout the year commensurate with sales activity and historical product returns all such allowances are recorded as direct offsets to sales the company gives all its customers a  day product return policy on all sales the allowances are reduced to reflect such payments or credits issued against the customers account balance after  days there are no returns but the company may issue an optional store credit to the customer for up to  of the sale amount there are no returns for sales of products that are personalized for its customers the company analyzes the components of the allowances for customer deductions monthly and adjusts the allowances to the appropriate levels there was no sales returns allowance recorded at december   and december   the historical sales return rate for the company in relation to its total sales have not been significant�income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that the recoverability of the asset is unlikely to be recognized we did not provide any current or deferred income tax provision or benefit for any periods presented to date because we have continued to experience a net operating loss since inception and therefore provide a  valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets� �f��the company adopted the fasb asc accounting guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions as defined in the fasb asc topic income taxes this guidance prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefits of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements this guidance also provides accounting guidance on derecognizing classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions the company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses the company has not recognized any interest and penalties in  or �the company has no deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities they have a net operating loss carryforward for federal and state tax purposes of approximately  at december   that is available to offset future taxable income which will begin to expire in the year  the company took a  valuation allowance against the net operating loss deferred tax asset�earnings per share basic and diluted earnings per share are computed based on the weightedaverage common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the period the merger with maple tree kids llc took place on september   and prior periods have been restated to reflect the change in the capitalization of the company at the merger date�advertising costs advertising costs are expensed as incurred advertising costs for the years ended december   and  were  and  respectively these expenses are recorded under general and administrative expenses�shipping and handling fees charged to customers and reported as revenue shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified on the statements of income under the caption selling general and administrative expenses��gift cards the company will collect the proceeds from gift cards issued and record a liability for the full amount sold this liability will be reduced when the company honors redemptions of the gift cards as a form of tender as a result the company will maintain a liability equivalent to  of the proceeds from unredeemed gift cards less estimated unredeemed gift cards for the years ended december   and  there were no significant gift cards sales therefore the unredeemed gift certificates liability was  at december   and december  �in recognizing the unredeemed gift card income above the company considered the guidance under asc  liabilitiesextinguishments of liabilitiesderecognition paragraph  that states a debtor shall derecognize a liability if and only if it has been extinguished a liability under this standard has been extinguished if either of the following conditions is met a the debtor pays the creditor and is relieved of its obligation for the liability or b the debtor is legally released from being the primary obligor under the liability either judicially or by the creditor the recognition of unredeemed gift card income is not expected to be material in future reporting periods if we have future sales of gift cards we will review historical gift card redemption information at each reporting period to assess the continued appropriateness of the gift card breakage rates and pattern of redemption�contingencies certain conditions may exist which may result in a loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur the companys management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the companys legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein�if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated the estimated liability would be accrued in the companys financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed�loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they arise from guarantees in which case the guarantees would be disclosed� �f��recentlyissued accounting standards�in may  the fasb issued guidance on the accounting for revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most existing revenue recognition guidance including industryspecific guidance the core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in addition the guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december   entities can choose to apply the guidance using either the full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements�in june  the fasb issued guidance that clarifies the accounting for sharebased payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period in this case the performance target would be required to be treated as a performance condition and should not be reflected in estimating the grantdate fair value of the award the guidance also addresses when to recognize the related compensation cost this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements�in june  accounting standards update  removed the definition of a development stage entity from the master glossary of the accounting standards codification thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from us gaap in addition the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to  present inceptiontodate information in the statements of income cash flows and shareholder equity  label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity  disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and  disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage this asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods therein early adoption is permitted the company has elected to adopt this asu effective with the december   annual report on form k and its adoption resulted in the removal of previously required development stage financial information �asu  � presentation of financial statements�going concern�disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern asu  in august  the fasb issued asu  requiring management to assess an entitys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances asu  is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods starting december   the companys first quarter of fiscal �note  ��major customer�the company has one major customer which represents approximately  of total sales for the years ended december   and  respectively�note  � shareholder advances and related party transactions�during the second quarter of  the principal shareholder sold baby products inventory that she held personally

partial sun and moist or well drained soil for your crimson king maple first dig each hole so that it is just shallower than the root ball and at least twice the width then loosen the soil in the planting hole so the roots can easily break through use your shovel or try dragging the points of a pitch fork along the sides and bottom of the hole step  place your plant next separate the roots of your crimson king maple gently with your fingers and position them downward in the hole the top of the root flare where the roots end and the trunk begins should be about an inch above the surrounding soil then make sure the plant is exactly vertical in the hole to make it just right use a level step  backfill your hole as you backfill the hole apply water to remove air pockets remove debris like stones and grass and completely break up any dirt clumps water your crimson king maple again after the transplant is complete questions  answers powered by turnto questions that need answers  my posts
