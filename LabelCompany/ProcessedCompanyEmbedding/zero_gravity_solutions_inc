product manufactured and marketed by zgsi’s wholly owned subsidiary bam agricultural solutions is a solution of special ionic minerals which can not only correct nutrient deficiencies but may also increase yield quality and nutrition with less inputs byproducts and waste the patented platform technology was originally developed as a way to promote growth of strong plants for astronauts on long duration space missions but has shown dramatic results when applied to the agricultural industry here on earth the principal aim of the bamfx experiment on the iss is to investigate the possibility to improve nutraceutical crop plant growth at zero gravity and produce large quantities of high quality zinc biofortified broccoli on a space station thereby ensuring astronauts on long mission a continuous supply of zinc enriched fresh anticarcinogenic cruciferous vegetables zinc is important not just for plants to cope with several environmental stresses but also for human immune system function and cancer inhibitionthe vpo project supported by basf is a student research project on space farming which will research the effects of microgravity in growing plantlet cuttings with the objective of seeing if vegetative propagation of plants is possible in space to generate fresh food for space missions without having to carry large amounts of seedvpo and bamfx will share two
