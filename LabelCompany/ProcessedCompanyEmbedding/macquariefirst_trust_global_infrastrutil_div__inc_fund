common shares outstanding  fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value nav which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than nav premium or less than nav discount  most recent distribution paid or declared to todays date subject to change in the future there is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends  distribution rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through todays date and then dividing by the most recent market price the distribution consists of the sum of net investment income net realized shortterm capital gains net realized longterm capital gains and return of capital distribution rates may vary any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration date for the next distribution see the funds a notices if any located under the news  literature section of the website for estimates of distribution sources final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in the current year will be made after yearend  total return is the combination of reinvested dividend income and reinvested capital gains distributions at prices obtained by the dividend reinvestment plan if any and changes in the nav and share price the nav total return takes into account the funds total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load past performance is not indicative of future results  leverage is a technique where a closedend funds manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate seeking to increase yield and total return use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses  market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions which can differ from regulatory financial reports forms ncsr and nq that are based on trade date recording of security transactions holdings are subject to change risk considerations investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost the fund principally invests in a global portfolio of infrastructure stocks in a range of currencies and senior secured loans accordingly the funds nav will fluctuate with changes in the value of the fund’s holdings investment in infrastructure and utilities issuers are subject to various risks including governmental regulations high interest costs associated with capital construction programs costs associated with environmental regulation the effects of economic slowdown and surplus capacity competition from other providers of services and other factors investment in nonus securities is subject to the risk of currency fluctuations and to economic and political risks associated with such foreign countries the senior loans in which the fund invests are generally considered to be highyield securities high yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings the funds portfolio is also subject to credit risk and interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that fixedincome securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates credit risk is the risk of nonpayment of scheduled contractual repayments whether interest andor principal payments or payments for services and that the value of a security may decline as a result use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses there can be no assurance as to what portion of the distributions paid to the funds common shareholders will consist of taxadvantaged qualified

unaudited  valuation and investment practices portfolio valuation the net asset value nav of the common shares of the fund is computed based upon the value of the funds portfolio and other assets the nav is determined as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange nyse normally  pm eastern time on each day the nyse is open for trading domestic debt securities and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of the principal markets for those securities the nav is computed by dividing the value of all assets of the fund including accrued interest and dividends less all liabilities including accrued expenses and dividends declared but unpaid by the total number of shares outstanding the funds investments are valued daily at market value or in the absence of market value with respect to any portfolio securities at fair value in accordance with valuation procedures adopted by the board of trustees a majority of the funds assets are valued using market information supplied by third parties in the event that market quotations are not readily available the pricing service does not provide a valuation for a particular asset or the valuations are deemed unreliable or if events occurring after the close of the principal markets for particular securities eg domestic debt and foreign securities but before the fund values its assets would materially affect nav first trust advisors lp first trust may use a fair value method in good faith to value the funds securities and investments the use of fair value pricing by the fund is governed by valuation procedures approved by the funds board of trustees and in accordance with the provisions of the  act foreign securities traded outside the united states are generally valued as of the time their trading is complete which is usually different from the close of the nyse occasionally events affecting the value of such securities may occur between such times and the close of the nyse that will not be reflected in the computation of a funds nav if events materially affecting the value of such securities occur during such period these securities will be valued at their fair value according to procedures decided upon in good faith by the funds board of trustees all securities and other assets of the fund initially expressed in foreign currencies will be converted to us dollars using exchange rates in effect at the time of valuation portfolio securities listed on any exchange other than the nasdaq national market nasdaq are valued at the last sale price on the business day of which such value is being determined if there has been no sale on such day the securities are valued at the mean of the most recent bid and asked prices on such day securities trading on the nasdaq are valued at the nasdaq official closing price as determined by nasdaq portfolio securities traded in the overthecounter market but excluding securities trading on the nasdaq are valued at the closing bid prices shortterm investments that mature in  days or less are valued at amortized cost the senior floating rate interests senior loans in which the fund invests are not listed on any securities exchange or board of trade senior loans are typically bought and sold by institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions that function in many respects like an overthecounter secondary market although typically no formal marketmakers exist this market while having substantially grown in the past several years generally has fewer trades and less liquidity than the secondary market for other types of securities some senior loans have few or no trades or trade infrequently and information regarding a specific senior loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete accordingly determinations of the market value of senior loans may be based on infrequent and dated information because there is less reliable objective data available elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of senior loans than for other types of securities typically senior loans are valued using information provided by an independent third

valuation for a particular senior loan or such valuation is deemed unreliable first trust may value such senior loan at a fair value as determined in good faith under procedures approved by the funds board of trustees and in accordance with the provisions of the  act repurchase agreement the fund engages in repurchase agreement transactions under the terms of a typical repurchase agreement the fund takes possession of an underlying debt obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase and the fund to resell the obligation at an agreedupon price and time thereby determining the yield during the funds holding period this arrangement results in a fixed rate of return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the funds holding period the value of the collateral is at all times at least equal to the total amount of the repurchase obligations including interest in the event of counterparty default the fund has the right to use the collateral to offset losses incurred there is potential loss to the fund in the event the fund is delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral securities including the risk of a possible decline in the value of the underlying securities during the period while the fund seeks to assert its rights the fund reviews the value of the collateral and the creditworthiness of those banks and dealers with which the fund enters into repurchase agreements to evaluate potential risks securities transactions securities transactions are recorded as of the trade date realized gains and losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis securities purchased or sold on a whenissued or delayeddelivery basis may be settled a month or more after the trade date interest income is not accrued until settlement date the fund instructs the custodian to segregate assets of the fund with a current value at least equal to the amount of its whenissued purchase commitments
