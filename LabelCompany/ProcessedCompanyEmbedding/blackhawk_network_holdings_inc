lessons on managing money prepaid cards such as retail gift cards prepaid reloadable cards and telecom cards are a tool that parents are using to teach their kids responsible spending habits when shopping for backtoschool clothes and supplies many parents are giving their children gift cards instead of cash or credit cards to get what they need “giving gift cards instead of cash empowers children to make their own decisions about what to buy and teaches them valuable lessons about responsibility and budgeting” says teri llach group vice president of blackhawk network the leading thirdparty prepaid card program in the united states  “but because gift cards must be used at particular stores and they are for a limited amount parents have still some control over what their child purchases” parents are also opting to give their children reloadable telecom cards and mobile phones on payasyougo plans so no one will be surprised by unexpected large phone bills gift cards prepaid
