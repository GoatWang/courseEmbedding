mcig and a rival the choice is easy  mcig inc otcmktsmcig  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»mcig and a rival the choice is easymay  about mcig inc mcig david butler value eventdriven etf investing commoditiessummarythe us marijuana space is still a dicey subjectwithin this penny stock market it pays to at least buy the companies with profitsmcig inc has been doing well at shifting its business into a diverse approach while avoiding debtdespite a ton of press on their south american operations medical marijuana inc hasnt gained any real ground in terms of making a profitable businessplease keep in mind these stocks are not for regular portfolios these are trading plays for the most part it is reckless in my opinion to keep these kinds of equities in a riskaverse portfolio four years ago my cousin and i both took positions in reckless marijuana penny stocks am i proud of it no but hey never look back youre not going that way he purchased mcig inc otcqbmcig i bought into medical marijuana inc otcpkmjna i took big flak from some over my stance on mcig inc after they posted positive earnings through the end of  due to new developments i might have been very wrong here the company has expanded from simply making ecigarettes a competitive space with multiple players to various avenues for growth and expansion there might be a business here the profits havent come from what was their core business assuming their numbers are honest the mcig ecigarette amounts to the smallest profitable portion of their business the company has been shifted to what seems to be a construction firm with its grow contractors division theyre basically using knowledgeable contractors to build greenhousescannabis cultivation sites for marijuana dispensaries and collectives this amounted to  million of total business the largest source of sales for the company the most profitable part of the business lies under the cbd segment these cbd products cannabis derived oils that are promoted to have health benefits only had  million in sales but definitely carried the best margins net income on the segment was k i have to say on paper this is good stuff revenues for mcig grew  year over year to  million net income is also nothing but gold as the company went from losses of  million to net income of  million for fiscal year  id also argue the company has a good cash blanket for its activities cashequivalents increased  year over year to  million the balance sheet also looks good with no long term debt on the books thats probably mcigs biggest redeeming virtue its not making big debt payments on the flip side it has drastically diluted its stock to do so that  in profit amounts to nothing for shareholders considering the  million shares outstanding before anyone could really call this intelligent investing we need to see a few more quarters proving this profitability to not be a onetime affair id particularly like to see diluted earnings per share that actually contributed more than a penny to shareholders medical marijuana inc i bought mjna back in  when i was a naïve idiot it was the height of weed mania when all the profitless debt ridden penny stocks were blowing up sigh the foolishness of my actions still gets to me though i only took a very small position in mjna it was a total waste of cash id like to point out that at the time of writing this they actually have their q results mislabeled at  on their website…come on management it eventually took a loss to move on to other things through the years the tide hasnt really changed in mjnas favor revenues have actually declined for the company annually this has finally be countered as of late with some strong quarterly revenue growth that revenue growth however has done nothing in terms of producing profits a decidedly large amount of mjnas assets now lie in brazilian operations mjna has had such a tough time profiting from its business in the united states that it has moved some of its sales to south america in the brazilian market some of their products can be prescribed by doctors for  approved conditions a weak product the firms biggest claim to fame is cbd enriched chewing gum frankly in an age where nations are progressively moving toward legalized cannabis this seems like an unnecessary product the fact that they had to get it to brazil to obtain prescription relevance says it all if youre investing in this space mcig is clearly the more appealing option their shares are far less diluted with over  billion basic shares mjnas diluted losses are always low per shareholders as will be any profits there would also have to be some profits for this to be a viable investment mjna was the first publicly traded marijuana stock its been around a while in that time it hasnt found a niche the fourth quarter of  was the only real time of high net income with over  million and it certainly didnt come from revenues of  million with a loss of a little over  million in the first quarter of  mjna managed to drastically improve itself over last years q loss of  million nevertheless negative income is negative income mcig has profits and far less in debt will they keep having profits thats the question thats the price you pay for getting involved in this space for those intent on buying in mcig has the clear advantage disclosure iwe have no positions
