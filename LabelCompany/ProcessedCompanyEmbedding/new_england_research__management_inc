surprises in recent quarters   credit suisse group analysts commented given signs of a bottoming in the latter and pnrs latecycle sales mix we think this outgrowth is unlikely to accelerate while its

continue to record strong margin growth while its operating margins have increased by about bps over the past three yearsrelated link cowen  company downgrades pentair to underperformwe view five business units  percent of sales as underearning today in that they offer bps of margin expansion opportunity we assume that twothirds of this opportunity equating to – of eps is indeed realized in

apparently found too highnotably the main aim behind the sale of vc was to reduce the leveragethere is a risk that pnr uses the proceeds from selling assets that may be close to a cyclical trough vc
