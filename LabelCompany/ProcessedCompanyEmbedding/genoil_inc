world accounting for approximately – of energy consumed in the world and is the basic building block for a large number of chemical products consumed globally in early  global crude petroleum demand was slowly recovering after the first decline in growth since the early ’s demand growth in the us japan and western europe will be slow as domestic economies start to improve in regions such as south and central america africa middle east and eastern europe where domestic demand is slowly on the rise growth will be more robust as markets give way to exports  asia continues to experience the greatest demand growth and a focus on domestic development world oil demand is forecast to increase steadily  through  and rise to  for  “the easy oil is coming to an end” says alex munton a middle east analyst for the scottish energy consulting firm wood mackenzie as of january   the estimated world proved reserves of crude petroleum were  billion barrels opec currently accounts for  of total world oil reserves saudi arabia holds the single largest share of the world’s petroleum reserves at  of the total on a regional basis the middle east accounts for nearly  of the world’s reserves north america is second with  and central and south america is third with  following recent reserves identified in brazil and venezuela the international energy agency iea estimates that  of the world’s remaining oil reserves consist of heavy high sulfur “sour” crude  oil companies must either seek new sources of lighter easier to extract and refine crude oil or find new methodologies to utilize the world’s existing heavy oil reserves  since the cost for exploration production and processing continues to climb the focus should be on the maximum utilization of known reserves by recovering more of the original oilinplace “ooip” and producing more usable consumer products during refining the average sulfur content of us crude oil imports increased from  in  to  in  and the slate of imports is expected to continue to sour in coming years crude oils are also becoming heavier and more corrosive than they were in the past largely because fields with higher quality varieties were the first to be developed and refiners’ preference for quality crude oil has led to the depletion of those reserves over the past  years reducing the market share of light sweet crude that remains published reports indicated that at yearend  there were  major refineries located around the world  these refineries process a total of  million barrels of oil per day  as the sources of premium lightsweet crude oil are depleted opec and other global oil producers will be forced to use increasing amounts of existing heavysour crude oil to supply world demand  not only will additional refining capacity be required to process the increase supply of crude oil but refineries will need to be designed to process heavier lower quality crude oil in order to yield the same amount of transportation fuel for example premium crude oils yield almost  of their volume as light highvalue products gasoline diesel jet fuel kerosene whereas heavier crude oils yield only about  of their volume as light products so in order to produce the same amount of refined product from heavy sour feedstock a refinery has to have  times as much capacity  divided by  there would need to be  refineries built  more in order to supply the world with the equivalent amount of transportation fuel in  as of january   the us had a reserve to production ratio of approximately ten years while russia had a reserve production ratio of seventeen years opec nations have a reserve ratio of  years while oil producing nations in the middle east has an average of over  years    ghu® technology development history starting in may  genoil formerly ce technologies inc canadian environmental equipment and engineering technologies inc researched innovative processes for the upgrading of heavy crude oils because heavy oil reserves account for the majority of total world oil reserves including nonconventional oils genoil had realized that highly efficient processes were required to economically upgrade these heavy oils to lighter products to deliver the heavy oil to the market heavy oil producers blend it with lighter oils called condensates or diluents this requires the implementation of an extensive infrastructure to produce the light oils and to deliver them to the heavy oil field locations further this concentrated demand for light oils for blending could results in shortages and high prices our concept is to upgrade onsite heavy oils to lighter oils meeting pipeline specifications eliminating the need for blending increasing the value of the heavy oils and having a process with economically viable capital and operating costs even for a smallscale field unit of  bpd of equal or greater importance was the development of a hydroconversion upgrader technology for refineries for raising the api gravity of crude oils to refinery specifications and for recovering the refinery’s heavy residuals reduction of sulphur nitrogen and metals was also a similarly critical goal global consumption of fossil fuels is increasing every year and the demand for crude oil is expected to exceed  million barrels per day within the next fourteen years  meanwhile no new refineries have been built in the united states since  but the race to add refining capacity around the world has already started  although existing refineries can process most types of crude oil produced today the yield of transportation fuel is reduced and waste byproducts increased due to the high sulfur and metal composition of the feedstock  for example it takes nearly three barrels of heavy crude oil to produce the same amount of transportation fuel that is refined from one barrel of light sweet crude  by  the amount of heavy oil produced could be as high as  of the total supply based on current trends in new oil discoveries ie limited replacement of depleted oil reserves and the opec basket “blend” of crude oils according to usgs statistics the supply of heavy crude oil to be produced from conventional reservoirs in the north america alone is estimated to be  billion barrels using a conservative recovery factor of only   based on ooip calculations an additional  billion barrels of oil could be produced from existing us fields using enhanced oil recovery methods  comparable estimates are available for proven oil basins in south america and the middle east  the upstream optimization process including advanced waterflood solutions offers oil producers an efficient costeffective approach to enhanced oil recovery next page  board of directorsgenoil inc usa   salesgenoilnet select page board of directors the

water treatment technology developed by genoil recently its aim is to treat slop oil and sludge recovered from bilge water or collected directly from ships however the system has numerous other applications where treatment of slop oilsludge is to be attained in the most efficient fashion refineries around the world produce nearly ten million barrels of unusable oil each year add to that the annual worldwide well production of “tank bottomssludge” which is a by product of the oil fields tank bottoms may also accumulate in tanks used for storage of fuels such as gasoline fuel oil or diesel and jet fuel there is no tank in the world without bottoms this environmental problems associated present a severe costly disposal and treatment problem traditional methods use costly chemicals to treat this problem most oil goes untreated and is disposed of in waste pits scattered around the world some of these waste pits are extremely large and can exceed  barrels waste pits are known to contaminate local groundwater and cause unwanted health problems if found to contain arsenic barium cadium chromium lead selenium and benzene all attempts to treat these tank bottoms use either chemical or thermal treatments resulting in a more unwanted water solid mixture left behind this “dead oil” presents an even more difficult challenge genoil’s environmental rehab actually pays for itself genoil has the most profitable and sophisticated s genoil has the most profitable and sophisticated self supporting slop oil treatment process in the world treating slop oil solves dangerous pollution and storage problems all slop oils can be upgraded and mixed with crude oil to be processed in the refinery currently slop is an enormous burden to oil companies local communities and governments genoil’s r  d team has come up with a proprietary process which utilizes many new technologies working in conjunction with the crystal separator our process ensures efficient slop oil treatment and can upgrade many different types slop oil from oil fields tanks ponds refineries and industry into valuable marketable product genoil guarantees an immediate payback slop oils have tremendous variation in composition both chemical and physically a common thread is that they contain both water and solid impurities large and small often the oil and water form a very tight emulsion our process produces drinkable water and clean oil the first requirement of a profitable slop oil recovery system is the speed and efficiently that it can separate the three phases the second is that it is works well enough to sever the closely bound emulsion and separate the smallest particles the main characteristic trait of slop oil is that oil and water form an emulsion stabilized by ultrafine solids extremely difficult to separate slopoil or waste oil must go through purification in order to be used as fuel in waste oil fired boilers or incinerators or be sold to refineries purification is carried out in several steps involving the removal of solids and water with reference to the block diagram contaminated hydrocarbons of low value undergo treatment in truly innovative ways for obtaining a valuable product that can be sold as fuel or converted into naphta lube oil and fuel oil in refineries   the system features a preliminary step capable of separating oil water and solids from slop oil or emulsified sludge for example sludge having the following content preliminary threephase separation is followed by  preliminary threephase separation is followed by further treatment of the resulting phases in order to enhance product quality purify the water and safely dispose of solid impurities  thus filtration occurs in two stages devised to reduce solids to  and  microns respectively with specially designed filters periodic filter media replacement is eliminated with obvious advantages in terms of costs downtime and maintenance  when superior oil dryness is required the system also includes an optional stage that dehydrates hydrocarbons to  mgl water content furthermore this stage is capable of reducing the particle count to iso  cleanliness levels without utilizing any filters water exiting the first stage contains about  oil which is then completely removed in two separation steps they employ genoil’s crystal and crystalline units respectively technologies developed by genoil after sustained efforts and research as recent certifications attest crystal oilywater separator is capable of exceeding us coast coastimo mepc   requirements without filters a unique feature of this technology in order to reduce the oil content to  mgl in the most exacting conditions the system comprises a polishing unit that also operates without filters this arrangement is the only one capable of such outstanding performance in oilwater separation worldwide  after complete oil elimination water is processed in another stage for removing heavy metals typically contained by sludge an additional benefit of this step is the destruction of pathogens as a result the effluent exiting the water treatment plant is remarkably clean and can be disposed of without restrictions  solid residues resulted from threestage separation are dehydrated and rendered chemically inert for costeffective disposal unique energysaving solutions have been devised throughout the process in order to obtain the final product at the lowest price possible  as a result of this combination of innovative solutions performance and cost effectiveness genoil’s technology is unparalleled  for ease of transportation and installation a standard plant of up to  mh capacity is accommodated in an acclimatized container the system can be custom built to meet specific

about us oil reserve  demand analysis   overview crude petroleum is the largest single source of energy in the world accounting for approximately – of energy consumed in the world and is the basic building block for a large number of chemical products consumed globally in early  global crude petroleum demand was slowly recovering after the first decline in growth since the early ’s demand growth in the us japan and western europe will be slow as domestic economies start to improve in regions such as south and central america africa middle east and eastern europe where domestic demand is slowly on the rise growth will be more robust as markets give way to exports  asia continues to experience the greatest demand growth and a focus on domestic development world oil demand is forecast to increase steadily  through  and rise to  for  “the easy oil is coming to an end” says alex munton a middle east analyst for the scottish energy consulting firm wood mackenzie as of january   the estimated world proved reserves of crude petroleum were  billion barrels opec currently accounts for  of total world oil reserves saudi arabia holds the single largest share of the world’s petroleum reserves at  of the total on a regional basis the middle east accounts for nearly  of the world’s reserves north america is second with  and central and south america is third with  following recent reserves identified in brazil and venezuela the international energy agency iea estimates that  of the world’s remaining oil reserves consist of heavy high sulfur “sour” crude  oil companies must either seek new sources of lighter easier to extract and refine crude oil or find new methodologies to utilize the world’s existing heavy oil reserves  since the cost for exploration production and processing continues to climb the focus should be on the maximum utilization of known reserves by recovering more of the original oilinplace “ooip” and producing more usable consumer products during refining the average sulfur content of us crude oil imports increased from  in  to  in  and the slate of imports is expected to continue to sour in coming years crude oils are also becoming heavier and more corrosive than they were in the past largely because fields with higher quality varieties were the first to be developed and refiners’ preference for quality crude oil has led to the depletion of those reserves over the past  years reducing the market share of light sweet crude that remains published reports indicated that at yearend  there were  major refineries located around the world  these refineries process a total of  million barrels of oil per day  as the sources of premium lightsweet crude oil are depleted opec and other global oil producers will be forced to use increasing amounts of existing heavysour crude oil to supply world demand  not only will additional refining capacity be required to process the increase supply of crude oil but refineries will need to be designed to process heavier lower quality crude oil in order to yield the same amount of transportation fuel for example premium crude oils yield almost  of their volume as light highvalue products gasoline diesel jet fuel kerosene whereas heavier crude oils yield only about  of their volume as light products so in order to produce the same amount of refined product from heavy sour feedstock a refinery has to have  times as much capacity  divided by  there would need to be  refineries built  more in order to supply the world with the equivalent amount of transportation fuel in  as of january   the us had a reserve to production ratio of approximately ten years while russia had a reserve production ratio of seventeen years opec nations have a reserve ratio of  years while oil producing nations in the middle east has an average of over  years    ghu® technology development history starting in may  genoil formerly ce technologies inc canadian environmental equipment and engineering technologies inc researched innovative processes for the upgrading of heavy crude oils because heavy oil reserves account for the majority of total world oil reserves including nonconventional oils genoil had realized that highly efficient processes were required to economically upgrade these heavy oils to lighter products to deliver the heavy oil to the market heavy oil producers blend it with lighter oils called condensates or diluents this requires the implementation of an extensive infrastructure to produce the light oils and to deliver them to the heavy oil field locations further this concentrated demand for light oils for blending could results in shortages and high prices our concept is to upgrade onsite heavy oils to lighter oils meeting pipeline specifications eliminating the need for blending increasing the value of the heavy oils and having a process with economically viable capital and operating costs even for a smallscale field unit of  bpd of equal or greater importance was the development of a hydroconversion upgrader technology for refineries for raising the api gravity of crude oils to refinery specifications and for recovering the refinery’s heavy residuals reduction of sulphur nitrogen and metals was also a similarly critical goal global consumption of fossil fuels is increasing every year and the demand for crude oil is expected to exceed  million barrels per day within the next fourteen years  meanwhile no new refineries have been built in the united states since  but the race to add refining capacity around the world has already started  although existing refineries can process most types of crude oil produced today the yield of transportation fuel is reduced and waste byproducts increased due to the high sulfur and metal composition of the feedstock  for example it takes nearly three barrels of heavy crude oil to produce the same amount of transportation fuel that is refined from one barrel of light sweet crude  by  the amount of heavy oil produced could be as high as  of the total supply based on current trends in new oil discoveries ie limited replacement of depleted oil reserves and the opec basket “blend” of crude oils according to usgs statistics the supply of heavy crude oil to be produced from conventional reservoirs in the north america alone is estimated to be  billion barrels using a conservative recovery factor of only   based on ooip calculations an additional  billion barrels of oil could be produced from existing us fields using enhanced oil recovery methods  comparable estimates are available for proven oil basins in south america and the middle east  the upstream optimization process including advanced waterflood solutions offers oil producers an efficient costeffective approach to enhanced oil recovery next page  gnolf stock price  genoil inc stock quote us otc  marketwatch sections watchlist signup • login search bulletin us europe asia fx
