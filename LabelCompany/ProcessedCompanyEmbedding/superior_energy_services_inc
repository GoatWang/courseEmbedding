call todays conference is being recorded after todays prepared remarks youll have an opportunity to ask questions at this time id like to turn the conference over to mr paul vincent vice president investor relations please go ahead sir paul vincent  superior energy services inc good morning and thank you for joining superior energys second quarter  conference call with me today are superior energys president and ceo dave dunlap and our cfo robert taylor during this conference call management may make forwardlooking statements regarding future expectations about the companys business managements plans for future operations or similar matters the companys actual results could differ materially due to several important factors including those described in the companys filings with the securities and exchange commission management will refer to nongaap financial measures during this call in accordance with regulation g the company provides a reconciliation of these measures on its website with that ill turn the call over to dave dunlap david d dunlap  superior energy services inc thank you paul and good morning to everyone listening to our call today well begin with a brief review of our second quarter activity robert will discuss segment results and ill wrap up with some thoughts on strategy and an outlook before turning the call over to ga – or qa for the second quarter of  superior energy generated revenue of  million ebitda of  million and a loss from continuing operations of  million or  per share these results are meaningful improvement from the first quarter the primary driver of our second quarter results was the continued recovery of us land markets almost all product and service lines in us land markets experienced higher utilization levels and improved prices much of the improvement in us land is being driven by a more rapid increase in drilling rig count than many expected including us although the acceleration of activity was surprising we were prepared for the increased demand caused by elevated activity levels due to our efforts to activate equipment and add staff ahead of the recovery the natural lag in completions activity relative to rig count creates additional demand on an already stressed pressure pumping supply resulting in continued price momentum we are very wellpositioned with our fullystaffed and reactivated  horsepower to continue to provide for our customers the highest level of execution in this improving environment the greatest beneficiary of increased customer activity during the quarter was pressure pumping where revenue grew  sequentially prices migrated higher more quickly and with less resistance than anticipated during the quarter resulting in a good starting point for the third quarter we did have approximately  million of reactivation expense associated with deployment of idle horsepower during the quarter given the current pricing trajectory in pressure pumping current customer demand and visibility on activity through the end of the year we have decided to rebuild an additional  horsepower this additional spending will be capitalized and will result in capex for the year of  million to  million up from approximately  million bottom hole assemblies premium drill pipe rentals and coiled tubing are other business lines that performed very well in us land markets during the quarter and are all benefiting from escalating rig count and higher intensity completions in the gulf of mexico revenue grew during the quarter primarily as a result of continued growth in sand control completion services we expect this business to continue to grow throughout the third quarter as several projects reach a peak in revenue elsewhere in the gulf activity levels were improved in hydraulic workover and snubbing eline and coiled tubing all of these are encouraging signs that operators with high value offshore assets are identifying projects with acceptable returns in the current commodity price environment internationally offshore drilling activity remained weak during the quarter while this impacted our drilling products and services segment a recovery in hydraulic workover and snubbing more than offset the impact of lower drilling activity we believe our international revenue reached floor during the first half of  and expect results to improve gradually through the end of the year international customer activity generally tends to lag the us and while we have modest expectations for growth internationally over the nearterm well be monitoring customer plans closely for indications of a change in sentiment towards higher spending levels in  it is important to emphasize that the gulf of mexico and particularly international markets are essential to our future growth plans we remain committed to these regions and believe the competitive landscape of both markets favor superior energys product lines and service expertise over the longterm ill now turn the call over to robert for our second quarter financial review robert s taylor  superior energy services inc thank you david in discussing our operating segments all sequential comparisons are being made to our first quarter  results drilling products and services segment revenue increased  to  million with a loss from operations of  million compared to loss from operations of  million in the first quarter of  us land revenue increased  to  million as the rig count continued to grow throughout the quarter and demand for bottom hole assemblies premium drill pipe and drill site accommodations increased gulf of mexico revenue decreased  to  million and international revenue decreased  to  million as the deepwater floating rig count continued to decline in the onshore completion and workover services segment which is comprised of product lines that exclusively serve us land markets revenue increased  million to  million the segment recorded a loss from operations of  million compared to a loss from operations of  million in the first quarter pressure pumping led the revenue growth in this segment as it increased by approximately  and accounted for approximately  of consolidated revenue fluid management and well services both grew sequentially due to higher utilization rate our production services segment revenue increased  to  million which resulted in a loss from operations of  million compared to a loss from operations of  million in the first quarter us land revenue increased  to  million as our coiled tubing business performed extremely well gulf of mexico revenue increased  to  million as hydraulic workover and snubbing activity bounced back during the quarter international revenue increased  to  million as hydraulic workover and snubbing activity increased sharply in the technical solutions segment revenue increased  to  million reducing the loss from operations to  million compared to a loss from operations of  million in the first quarter us land revenue decreased  to  million and international revenue decreased  to  million due to lower completion tools activity and lower well control activity respectively gulf of mexico revenue increased  to  million on higher completion tools activity turning to the balance sheet our debttocapital ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately  and our debt – total debt at quarterend remained at  billion we ended the quarter with one  million in cash capex during the quarter was approximate  million for the year we expect capex to be between  million and  million before turning back the call to dave there are a few modelingrelated items ga for the quarter was  million and we expect third quarter ga to be in the range of  million to  million we expect dda to increase slightly to between  million and  million as our capital expenditures add assets with slightly lower depreciable log third quarter interest expense is expected to be in the range of  million to  million our effective income tax rate for the second quarter  was  and we expect the rate for  to remain in the range of  to  thank you and ill now turn the call back over to dave for closing comments david d dunlap  superior energy services inc okay thanks robert despite a strong second quarter and better visibility for the remainder of the year there is still a great deal of uncertainty around oil prices and ep spending levels in  were therefore extremely cautious about incremental investment and well likely limit our interest in growth investment in us land markets however this doesnt mean we dont believe there is a great opportunity ahead of us it just means we will emphasize returns and profitability through this cycle we expect cycles to be shorter and believe the business needs to be managed accordingly we have a significant investment in assets in us land markets that are available during this cycle and any cost we add will be variable in nature and associated with higher levels of utilization over time low levels of capital expenditures and emphasis on free cash flow and divestitures of noncore assets that arent generating adequate returns will put us on a path to profitability we believe will be rewarded by investors we also believe that we will be able to reduce debt from current levels over this cycle this isnt a new strategy for superior weve been paying down debt and reducing capital expenditure levels since  the outlook is a bit more defined for the remainder of  on the back of a strong second quarter we see activity and pricing trending higher in q with much of our startup and reactivation of equipment occurring in q of last year and q of this year we expect to fully benefit from an improved us land market and continue to deliver strong incremental margins the best opportunity to secure margins and returns in this cycle will be early and we are exactly where we want to be from an asset perspective to capture our share we are also recognizing opportunities to pursue growth by applying technical innovation as our customers continue to drill longer laterals this trend is increasing the demand for our automated well service rigs known as cats rigs which are padoptimized and have the ability to reach the toes on the longest laterals our customers are drilling originally designed for the enhanced safety an automated process provides these service rigs are now becoming preferred completion options and are capable of generating compelling day rates other product lines in us land markets such as premium drill pipe bottom hole assemblies coiled tubing and well service rigs are all performing nicely and we expect continued strong performance through the remainder of the year in the gulf of mexico we are very excited by the sand control completion services work that weve been doing in the deepwater this is technically challenging work that our team has met headon and has done an excellent job with this work continues during q before slowing down in the fourth quarter at the same time our subsea intervention technology is expected to deploy later in the third quarter andor early in the fourth quarter offsetting the slowdown of completion activity as often happens with project work like plug and abandonment customer scheduling and vessel availability determines when our work begins internationally for the remainder of the year we expect activity to be rather quiet but we see signs that may change as we head into  areas of the world that we believe have opportunity for growth over the next  months include the middle east with our well services business potential stimulation work in india and in argentina where the vaca muerta shale continues to garner attention as a worldclass asset before qa some highlights from our results and call revenue growth of  million and ebitda growth of  million a  overall ebitda incremental  increase in pressure pumping revenue primarily due to higher utilization and pricing with  horsepower working at june  an increase in capex to between  million and  million up from  million with this increase funding the rebuild of our remaining horsepower this will result in approximately  horsepower being potentially deployed early in  a conservative outlook on growth investment in us markets we will prioritize utilization of existing assets to meet growing demand while keeping fixed cost from growing ultimately generating free cash and reducing debt we worked extremely hard for a number of years to get the company to the position it is in today our culture and core values have produced an exceptional team of management and field level professionals who are running premium businesses and service lines in the best markets globally this business is never easy but our shared experience gives us the conviction that we can outperform anyone we compete with that concludes our prepared remarks well now – operator open the lineup for qa questionandanswer session operator thanks and well go first to scott gruber with citi scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc yes good morning david d dunlap  superior energy services inc good morning scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc good quarter i want to start with the frac spread rebuild so capex goes up  million to  million how much of that is for the rebuilding of the idle frac fleets and will there be additional capex early next year im trying to think about the total expenditure for the effort now that you have  quotes from the vendors david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah i would expect that  of the rebuild of that  horsepower is completed in the third and fourth quarter of this year and it accounts for the bulk of the increase in capital spending that we mentioned scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc and do you have a line of sight in terms of customer commitments on the incremental spreads david d dunlap  superior energy services inc in all likelihood it will be equipment thats deployed with customers that we are working for today scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc great and then just on the completion and workover segment great quarter huge incrementals can you just frame for us expectations for q in terms of both revenue growth potential and incrementals david d dunlap  superior energy services inc well i think that in general you think about frac revenue being up in that weve got a total of  horsepower that well be working for the full quarter i think you can also assume that pricing will be up we saw pricing move up during the course of the second quarter it set a good starting point for us in the third quarter and my expectation would be that there is further price momentum that we experience during the third quarter i think outside of hydraulic fracturing the remainder of the us service lines will have about the same amount of capacity available and so it should be more kind of in line with rig count or slightly better than rig count i do think that our incrementals will continue to be strong and i would expect that we deliver incrementals on a us revenue increase that are kind in the  range scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc and just a final one on the pricing commentary is that spot pricing continue to move higher or is it just moving more spreads to current leadingedge david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah i mean if youre speaking exclusively of fracturing prices i mean i think that fracturing prices with all of our fracturing customers has been migrating upwards so were not in the spot market on a daytoday basis so i kind of hesitate to use that phrase leading edge prices but i think what weve seen is all of our fleets migrate upwards at a fairly similar pace scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc excellent ill turn it back good quarter david d dunlap  superior energy services inc thank you operator well go next to chase mulvehill with wolfe research chase mulvehill  wolfe research llc hey good morning dave a big war eagle to you today nice quarter david d dunlap  superior energy services inc thanks chase chase mulvehill  wolfe research llc i guess ill keep on the pressure pumping theme could you talk about pressure pumping margins in q and maybe kind of where they are on a ebitda level and then how much of your fleet is actually earning kind of leadingedge pricing right now david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah so as ive said in the other – in answering the prior question were not in the spot market on a daytoday basis and so i kind of hate to use that phrase leadingedge all of our – we migrated prices up during the course of the second quarter with all of our customers and i cant say that there is a huge spread on prices with any of those customers today weve continued to have conversations during the second quarter about where prices need to be in q and where we would like for prices to migrate to as we exit q and enter q and thats kind of what gives me confidence that well continue to see those prices migrate upwards chase mulvehill  wolfe research llc okay and it sounds like the  horsepower none of thats going to be active by the end of this year is that correct david d dunlap  superior energy services inc well i mean i think that its possible that we get some of it active at some point during the fourth quarter but i think what wed be most comfortable planning on is having the optionality to activate that horsepower more like in early part of q of  and i want to emphasize optionality we believe that we will continue to see pricing migrate upwards and tightness in the market the market is very tight from a supplydemand standpoint with fracturing today i think at the same time were going to be cautious about deployment of that equipment and in the same way that we would resist any investment and growth in hydraulic fracturing if for whatever reason we begin to see activity or price momentum begin to stall out having the equipment rebuilt gives us optionality to put it in the marketplace or not at some point in time that equipment is going to be rebuilt so i think about the cash investment that goes into it is being a pretty safe investment for the company to make but i do want to make clear to everyone that if for whatever reason we begin to see utilization levels or price momentum begin to stall well always got the optionality to keep that rebuilt equipment parked on the fence chase mulvehill  wolfe research llc okay last one and ill turn it back over looking into q are you seeing any issues with sourcing sand i know that i think only about  of your fleets use source of sand for so – but any issues there when we think about sourcing sand for the third quarter david d dunlap  superior energy services inc not in the way of bottlenecks i mean i think that sand is – sand and logistics in this business are always a challenge and im sure theyll be a challenge in q as they were in the first or second quarter but i dont think that we are in anyway thinking about bottlenecks that would hold us back in the third quarter as a result of sand chase mulvehill  wolfe research llc all right thanks dave war eagle again operator well now go next to sean meakim with jpmorgan sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning david d dunlap  superior energy services inc good morning sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc dave i heard you i think you talked about frac activity completion activity maybe at or above the rig count in the third quarter how do you see the duc inventory playing out have you seen ducs continue to build in the first half of the year as you been – you and along with your peers activating a lot of horsepower at some point shouldnt we see completions growth outstrip rig count by a fairly large amount how you see that interplay in the third quarter maybe just for the rest of the year david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah well my comment was actually related to the service lines other than fracturing i mean i think that in general fracturing is going – fracturing – the pace of revenue growth in fracturing is going to be a function of how much equipment we have activated and how much price increases so i mean there is a point in time where it could get disconnected from the rig count but – and wed kind of outpace the rig count from the first to second quarter as well so my comments about revenue outpacing or being at close to the rig count was really about product lines other than frac to supply and demand i mean listen from – all signs are that the market is extremely tight for capacity i personally believe that some of the capacity that industry has activated in the first half of  is capacity that did not have a whole lot of useful life of remaining to it so i think even in a flattish demand market for hydraulic fracturing services that we continue to see tightness in the market weve got fracturing fleets now that with the types of hours that they operate are only good for four to five years so you think about the amount of equipment that we have working today and the amount that should be rebuilt or replaced during  i dont think we have that much capital rebuild and replacement going on today so that leads me to believe that we continue to see tightness in that market for quite some time sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you for that clarification and then you mentioned during the quarter you sort out a standard drill pipe in lower  just curious if that adoption of inch has been slower than you anticipated kind of whats the way to stock in terms of the opportunity there relative to perhaps putting incremental capital into that business to add inventory to standard pipe david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah i mean i think when you refer to standard pipe i think youre thinking of inch premium drill pipe which is sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc correct david d dunlap  superior energy services inc certainly seeing the highest level of demand and it is an area where weve got very little additional capacity to put to work we do have additional inch drill pipe which is a higher priced premium  pipe that we could rent to our customers the uptake of that has been somewhat slow its more expensive pipe to use we think its the better technical solution and over time on the longest of laterals more operators migrate to that but i think the point you bring up is a good one and that is that with demand for inch drill pipe where it is there may be some opportunities for growth as we look out to the future and well monitor that keep an eye on it and see when we want to take advantage of that sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc fair enough okay thanks dave operator well go next to jim wicklund with credit suisse james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc good morning guys good quarter thank you david d dunlap  superior energy services inc thanks jim james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc mr chases question about sand and you provided about  of your own weve been looking at the disaggregation of pressure pumping as a business over the last several years before there were sand stacks that any of us covered or knew about and it just strikes me that with more and more ep companies buying their own chemicals direct from ecolab and their own sand direct from hicrush that – thats a passthrough item that you dont get to see as much of anymore and while you did a very little markup im sure on it in the past the returns were good can you talk a little bit about how thats going to be different in this recovery not sourcing all those different things and just providing the pumping services to a larger extent versus the last cycle we were in david d dunlap  superior energy services inc look jim you may recall that our pressure pumping business has been built around a model which was specifically geared towards some of the most efficient horizontal well operators that we see in the marketplace for quite some time our customers a number of our customers have sourced their own sand theyve sourced their own chemicals and so we are very accustomed to a pricing model and an efficiency delivery model in the field thats geared towards customers that choose to supply their own chemicals and proppant so i dont think this is any switch for us i think there are others in the marketplace that have traditionally lived off of margins created by markups on sand and markups on chemicals that may be having to learn the pricing things in a little bit different way but the market is migrating to a point where we have been for quite some time james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc okay thank you sir thats helpful and you mentioned your automated well service rigs and im a fan of service rigs  rigs used in completions and im just curious how many of these do you have and is that a point of incremental capex kind of seans question david d dunlap  superior energy services inc so we have built four of these service rigs all delivered prior to the end of  and you may recall that this was a bit of a stepout program for us from a technology standpoint to begin in about  or  were seeing very high demand for those four service rigs today and yes it is only four service rigs that being said those four service rigs generated substantially higher day rate than any other service rigs that we have in our fleet demand for those service rigs is at a point where were being to evaluate whether or not that is a unique technology that we would put some incremental growth capital to in  and  its a very well suited tool for the very longest laterals and as we speak to many of our customers that are planning laterals that are well beyond two miles its a very very important tool for them from an efficiency standpoint so i think at this point i would tell you its an opportunity for us with the unique growth investment one that well be talking to you a bit more as the year progresses and well tell you specifically what were going to do from a growth standpoint in that product line when we get to telling you about our  capital spending plan james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc okay okay david thanks a lot thanks guys david d dunlap  superior energy services inc thanks jim operator well take our next question from vebs vaishnav with cowen vaibhav vaishnav  cowen  co llc hey good morning and thanks for taking the question very good quarter dave i guess sticking with pressure pumping can you speak – like it sounds like the q pressure pumping revenue was helped by addition of  horsepower and does not sound like you are any fleets in q but obviously youll get some fullquarter impact from the fleet addition and some higher pricing can that drive the  revenue growth in q that we saw in q or would you need additional horsepower to get that kind of revenue growth david d dunlap  superior energy services inc i mean for – to match the  revenue growth we probably need some additional horsepower i mean youre right that was additional horsepower that was utilization going up on horsepower as we exited q and it was pricing so i dont know thinking about another  growth from q to q in fracturing is likely but i think its still strong growth and still delivering strong incrementals which we would like to see the margin continue to improve in that business vaibhav vaishnav  cowen  co llc yeah switching to gulf of mexico it just sounds like the sand control business is doing very good you spoke about it continuing to grow in q and possibly the pa tool can be added late third quarter early fourth quarter it sounds like its going to stay at the same growth rate as we saw in q but were you implying that the fourth quarter gulf of mexico could be down because the sand control could be down i didnt understand what the message was there david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah so a good way to think about this i mean the sand control work that weve done reaches a peak in the third quarter and i think you can expect that our sand control revenue in the third quarter will be higher than it was in the second quarter and it probably drives gulf of mexico revenue up i think if you think somewhere in the  to  range thats probably about right what will happen in the fourth quarter is sand control revenue will decline but will pickup subsea pa revenue and i think the result is q in the gulf of mexico that probably looks a lot like the second quarter we just reported vaibhav vaishnav  cowen  co llc okay and one last question from me maybe i missed that when you spoke about the  incrementals were you talking about the us land incrementals or were you talking about the companywide incrementals david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah i mean us land incrementals will continue to be strong i mean i dont think its a big stretch to think about companywide incrementals being close to that  mark vaibhav vaishnav  cowen  co llc perfect thats all from me thank you sir operator well go next to stephen gengaro with loop capital stephen d gengaro  loop capital markets llc hi thank you good morning david d dunlap  superior energy services inc good morning stephen d gengaro  loop capital markets llc two things dave p where it  start with on the onshore completion and workover business when i look at the progression you had in the second quarter which looked very good and listening to the incrementals youre talking about on an operating income basis could that be profitable in the fourth quarter david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah fourth quarter may be a bit early for it i mean i think overall i see at some point during  and maybe thats in the first or second quarter we reach a point where were at ebit – where we are ebit positive for the entire company i think q may be just a bit early for it but i mean look weve been – ive been surprised by the way that prices progressed during the course of the second quarter i mean we know fundamentally that this early point in the cycle is the point in time where you really want to take advantage of higher demand and have as much of your equipment activated as possible thats why we chose to do the things we did in q and q i was surprised at how fast price went up but i was also surprised at where the rig count wound up and so im not saying it couldnt happen before the end of the year but i think about that being probably more for  stephen d gengaro  loop capital markets llc okay thank you and then on the drilling products side obviously the margins sequentially were i believe hurt by the gulf and probably more the international side has the international – it sounds like youre thinking its troughing here should those margins start to gain some traction in the third and fourth quarters or is it still with international and gulf being sloppy just hard to see a lot of progress david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah i mean i think that clearly us revenue in those product lines in the drilling products and services segment will continue to come up whether or not they offset what we think is probably continued weakness in deepwater gulf of mexico and also deepwater globally i dont know if theyll offset i mean i think that in general you could probably expect going forward something similar to what we see in the second quarter which is just kind of weaker margins in that segment overall even though us land is coming up the us land side of the business although margins are very strong in premium drill pipe not quite as high as what we see on premium drill pipe rentals internationally and in the gulf of mexico thats just driven by fixed cost i mean in most of those international and particularly gulf of mexico markets were able to operate from a single facility single point of distribution in the us as you well know i mean weve got to have distribution capabilities that are scattered in the basins and that makes the fixed cost just a bit higher so i think what you saw in the second quarter is probably something you ought to expect kind of in the third quarter as well i mean i think we are anticipating at some point in the future a bit stronger global deepwater activity i dont know exactly when that comes but its certainly something that we anticipate because the incremental margins that that business can drive for us when we begin to see a few more deepwater rigs working globally are tremendous stephen d gengaro  loop capital markets llc okay great thank you operator well take our next question from marshall adkins with raymond james j marshall adkins  raymond james  associates inc good morning dave in the past you had mentioned that your rebuild cost for these frac fleets was kind of in the  million per fleet range i guess were coming up to the last  horsepower couple questions on that is it still – are you still thinking  million per fleet on the rebuild or is that cost lower is it different and how hard is it to get in line to get this equipment rebuilt david d dunlap  superior energy services inc so youre in the ballpark marshall i mean i think thats probably a reasonable way to think about rebuild at about  million a fleet could wind up being slightly less than that as far as where we are in the queue we are in line in the queue to be able to get that rebuild accomplished in the second half of the year i think keep in mind i mean we have continued to be a component buyer throughout the down cycle weve replaced engines weve had transmission replacements and although we havent had any capital rebuild all of those same components are the ones that go into capital rebuild so were well positioned in the queue for the components and have no concern about being able to source the components or assembly capacity that we need to have that equipment rebuilt in the second half ill also draw you to another number that we talk about and this goes back probably at least a year year and a half where we said that we thought it would cost us about  million overall cash in order to get to  horsepower from the  horsepower that we had in the second quarter of  and were pretty much spot on with that  million in cash most of what we spent todate has been expensed as you know and a lot of thats been in engine replacements and fleet reactivation the remainder is in capex but were pretty well right in line with that  million in cash over the last year j marshall adkins  raymond james  associates inc so is it fair to say your – even these last ones which obviously require a lot more capital in the first fleets you did your rebuild costs are still going to be less than  on the  versus what youre going to have to pay when the tier  engines come out in  david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yes certainly less than where the tier  engines would be in  but i mean even relative to new equipment cost for the like components its around  on the  j marshall adkins  raymond james  associates inc okay last question from me any signs of slowing from customer interest due to the sloppy oil prices over the past three months david d dunlap  superior energy services inc not at this point j marshall adkins  raymond james  associates inc in any of the subsegments david d dunlap  superior energy services inc not at this point i mean listen ill give you my personal bias i mean i think that theres probably likely to be certain small operators that will tap the brakes of it as we go through the second half of the year but what were hearing from our larger customers at this point in time is that we can expect for our fleets to remain fully utilized through the end of the year j marshall adkins  raymond james  associates inc thank you david d dunlap  superior energy services inc thanks marshall operator well go next to bill herbert with simmons  company william a herbert  simmons  company international thanks good morning david d dunlap  superior energy services inc hey bill william a herbert  simmons  company international dave hey how are you sir why wouldnt your incrementals in the third quarter be as – for onshore completions be as strong as they were in the second quarter if not stronger frankly right i mean youre not going to have the reactivation expense and im just curious you said  understand david d dunlap  superior energy services inc just to clarify its  for the entire company william a herbert  simmons  company international okay sorry but for the third quarter so we think – so would it be a rash assumption to assume that effectively the incrementals would not be as strong in the third quarter or basically effectively close to  incrementals were generated in the second quarter david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah listen i think that the incrementals that well see in fracturing are probably similar william a herbert  simmons  company international okay david d dunlap  superior energy services inc from what we – from q to q i think those are clearly the highest incrementals that we have in the company and its a result of the price momentum that weve had in that product line which by the way started at a very low point in q so i mean there was clearly good ways to go from a pricing standpoint in other areas incrementals – in other product lines incrementals in the us arent going to be quite as high i mean weve seen good price momentum in things like coiled tubing and even in our standard service rigs and well test flow back and that kind of thing but not quite the same dynamic that we have in supply and demand of fracturing so fracturing is going to lead the way there and of course our gulf of mexico incrementals are not going to be as high as us land although we expect them to be good in kind of the  range so yeah im not sure if im answering your question but i mean i do expect to see still very strong incrementals and would expect that fracturing business incrementals are above  william a herbert  simmons  company international awesome good thanks and the point of my query was to try and understand whether there was any kind of percolating supply chain or wage or labor inflation thats beginning to inflect more strongly that possibly would suppress the flow through in the second half of the year relative to what you saw in the second quarter it doesnt sound like it david d dunlap  superior energy services inc i think youre correct in that assumption there please dont misread that to believe theres not some labor inflation taking place in the market there is william a herbert  simmons  company international okay david d dunlap  superior energy services inc some labor inflation taking place in the market but at this point prices were overcoming that labor inflation otherwise incrementals will be higher right william a herbert  simmons  company international yeah and i want to kind of delve into a little bit about the competitive structure of the industry i mean i think youve been a sort of consistent voice of realism in – just passion about the cyclical opportunities and threats associated with the industry and you made a comment earlier on that even if activity flattens out you think the market is going to stay tight and i guess i want to more fully understand that because there seems to be a decent chunk of new horsepower in the process of being built with possibly a strong upward bias and you still got slugs of reactivation opportunities looming in the marketplace in the form of one stem and what have you so i guess the worry is that youve got an industry which is fragmented and deconsolidated to the extent that it really never has been so the competitive structure is weak and youve got again sort of insufficiently discriminating sources of capital committing capital towards new builds and if you get the convergence between significantly increased horsepower and flattening out activity how does the persistence of decent pricing and margins take place david d dunlap  superior energy services inc so i think what gets lost a bit in the market bill is just how much equipment needs to be replaced on an annual basis so if you think about the market today is being supplied with ill use an easy round number around  million horsepower i dont know if thats exactly right but just bear with me here for a moment engine life of a fracturing fleet thats working today is somewhere between four and five years and in fact you could say that the transmission and power have very similar life so equipment needs to be rebuilt between four and five years if its seen that type of utilization i think more and more companies are migrating to that kind of utilization because thats what the longer laterals higher stage count and more pad require and so to me what that means is that if weve got  million horsepower out there working today somewhere between  million and  million of it needs to be rebuilt or replaced within the next  months im not seeing that kind of orders out there thats william a herbert  simmons  company international okay david d dunlap  superior energy services inc if you maintain  million and so then if you take into account that – and this is just my belief that a lot of the horsepower which has been reactivated over the last eight or nine months is capacity that only had   or  useful life remaining to it thats capacity thats got to be rebuilt or replaced as well over the next year so i see this as there being a surge in demand for components that we see in the marketplace over the course of the next  months and its part of the reason why we were so insistent on equipment that we reactivated going out with a minimum four years useful life as i believe there will be that tightness in the marketplace and we wanted to have  of our potential capacity available and working through that tightness william a herbert  simmons  company international okay thank you sir david d dunlap  superior energy services inc youre welcome operator well take our next question from byron pope with tudor pickering holt byron k pope  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc good morning guys david d dunlap  superior energy services inc good morning byron k pope  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc just on the international side i mean you mentioned the few areas where you could have potential bright spots maybe as we step over the next  months but as we think about your international operations overall could you frame for us some of the geomarkets that youre more i guess more dependent on i know argentina is one of those but could you just frame it at a high level for us david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah for the part of those that were most dependent on i mean latin america is our largest revenuegenerating region followed kind of by europe and the north sea and then asia i mean i think as i look forward where we expect to see opportunities in growth over the course of the next few years is in the middle east which is still a relatively small region of operation for us but one where weve had a pretty strong business development effort underway for the last year and a half or so that i believe starts to produce some good fruits for us as we move into  and beyond and specifically countrywise were speaking of saudi arabia and kuwait we also see some upside in places in asia really more gas markets if you think about places like india then oil markets where weve had great success in growing business over the last few years and see continued opportunities and then in latin america a business thats been slow really for about the last  months were beginning to get more and more excited about spending increases in argentina in the vaca muerta shale this does appear to be a place for a foreign investment along with ypf investment is going to result in a growing business for us in  and beyond the sleeper out there is brazil and although i dont want to present myself as a nearterm brazil bull byron k pope  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc sure david d dunlap  superior energy services inc brazil is a market which began coming down kind of in  and really outside of what happened to oil prices and it is a worldclass resource that i believe ultimately well begin to see some additional investment dollars go to so thats probably a bit further down the road but anyway just general thoughts on international byron k pope  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc thanks dave appreciate it david d dunlap  superior energy services inc youre welcome operator well take our next question from dave anderson with barclays j david anderson  barclays capital inc hi dave i was wondering if you could expand a bit on the conversations around coiled tubing and well servicing maybe just start with the coiled tubing performance this quarter it was excellent obviously of  whats your sweet spot in that business what part of the activity chain is driving that outperformance this quarter david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah so i mean i would say its – for us sweet spot is permian basin and midcontinent i think its clearly driven by the completions activity that we see in those markets and i think we have capacity thats in very good condition weve chosen not to reactivate additional coiled tubing units but the coiled tubing  in the field going into the fiscal year i mean its a function of higher completions activity driving utilization up im not sure i understand your question about sweet spot j david anderson  barclays capital inc well no thats kind of what i was wondering because – you talked about the automated well servicing rigs david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah j david anderson  barclays capital inc and how thats better for the longer laterals so maybe you can just frame the question this way if im an operator whats my ideal time when do i use coiled tubing for completions versus the automated well servicing rigs like whats the kind of lateral length kind of limitations if you will and kind of how the costs compare from if im in the operator standpoint – operator seat david d dunlap  superior energy services inc so if all youre thinking about is lateral length if youre less than about  mile lateral then in most cases a service rig or coiled tubing unit or combination of those two is going to be sufficient but a lot of operators are using a combination where theyll bring – if they get longer than about  mile theyll bring a service rig out to drill the plugs in the farther reaches of the well which are difficult if not technically impossible for coiled tubing to get to and then once theyve got – reach the point where coiled tubing is going to be more effective then theyll demobilized to service rig  coiled tubing out to drill out the remainder of the plugs the benefit of the cats rig is it can reach the deepest of plugs and so thats really – think sweet spot getting closer to two miles or beyond twomile laterals it doesnt have to be demobed it can drill all the way through its got walking capability and so yeah its a service rig so your tripping pipe is a bit slower than it would be in reeling in and reeling out with coil the offset to that is that it doesnt need to demobed and when youre finished with one well then you just skid over on the walking – with the walking system over to the next well so and then of course its got safety benefits there is no hands on the rig floor and so from a safety standpoint its really an optimal solution all the way around j david anderson  barclays capital inc all right great thanks dave david d dunlap  superior energy services inc you bet operator well take our next question from jud bailey from wells fargo judson e bailey  wells fargo securities llc thanks good morning david d dunlap  superior energy services inc hi jud judson e bailey  wells fargo securities llc hey just a quick question we talked a lot about pressure pumping and how strong the pricing environment is could you maybe talk a little bit more or kind of give us some color on how youre see pricing in your other us land segments im just trying to get a sense of how tight various markets are and how pricing discussions are even though oil prices have pulled back a little bit david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah i mean certainly those discussions have not had the same type of pace to them that weve had in fracturing and listen i think this is just purely a function of supply and demand there is very tight supply demand in fracturing with the other product lines i think theres still capacity that could come into the market and our own capacity would be an example and we continue to have service rigs which are idle we continue to have coiled tubing units which are idle if price points move very rapidly in those businesses and weve got capacity and im sure others do as well that they could hire staff for and put to work so in other service lines it just becomes a bit of a check i guess on how fast price can rise weve seen nice solid price momentum that i guess would be consistent with the type of increases that weve seen in activity its only in fracturing where weve got this fundamental and structural tightness in supply and demand driven by the extreme changing capacity requirements that weve had in fracturing going from  horsepower fleets in  to  horsepower and  horsepower fleets now you just hadnt seen that in the other product lines but i dont want to dismiss the price momentum that we have in those areas because its good its just not of the extreme nature that fracturing has been judson e bailey  wells fargo securities llc okay all right thank you and just a followup on the reactivation of your remaining  horsepower is the timing of maybe getting those deployed in early  is that – im just curious is that being driven by the customers kind of schedule and timing or are there bottlenecks in terms of getting the equipment ready in time david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah we really dont have any bottlenecks as far as getting the equipment ready and as ive said earlier its possible that some of that equipment does get deployed before the end of the fourth quarter just as we think about it its most likely to be fully revenuegenerating if we choose to deploy it once again by the first quarter of  judson e bailey  wells fargo securities llc got it thank you operator well go next to gregg brody with bank of america merrill lynch gregg brody  bank of america merrill lynch good morning guys david d dunlap  superior energy services inc good morning gregg brody  bank of america merrill lynch could you just say – would you mind giving an update on where you stand with the credit facility if theres anything to add and – where you stand with your banks david d dunlap  superior energy services inc weve got great relationships with our banks were undrawn on the credit facility and – i dont know that i have anything else to say about it gregg brody  bank of america merrill lynch i thought on one of the last calls you – or your conference calls you were mentioning you were looking at refinancing or pushing out the maturity david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah so i mean i think you may be speaking of senior notes and weve got senior notes that mature in  – or  im sorry gregg brody  bank of america merrill lynch and maybe  youre talking about was with the credit facility youve – pushing that out was part of a process to possibly refinancing those notes i guess david d dunlap  superior energy services inc well i mean – yeah listen the credit facility expires in february  i think its normal course to have negotiation on extension on a new credit facility before the current one with the current one that were undrawn  on it so i mean in all likelihood over the course of the next few quarters well be having conversations with banks about an extended credit facility i dont think its a huge pressing matter for us at the moment gregg brody  bank of america merrill lynch thats helpful and then david d dunlap  superior energy services inc its part of the normal course of business gregg brody  bank of america merrill lynch thats helpful and then just one followup if i look at your cash balance at the end of the quarter i would have thought it would have been a little bit higher just with the income tax refund is there – was there a greater drain on working capital than you expected or we just didnt model – i just didnt model it right david d dunlap  superior energy services inc i dont know theres a greater drain than we expected we saw revenue increase dramatically so our receivable balance did increase during the course of the second quarter it was offset some by an increase in payables so i dont know that there was anything that was surprising to us we did make an – we had interest payments always occurring in the second quarter and then about  million in capex so listen it was helpful to get the income tax refund but i dont think we were surprised at all or saw anything unusual in cash balance at the end of the quarter gregg brody  bank of america merrill lynch i appreciate the color guys thats it for me david d dunlap  superior energy services inc okay operator well go next to haithum nokta with clarksons platou securities haithum nokta  clarksons platou securities inc hi good morning guys david d dunlap  superior energy services inc good morning haithum nokta  clarksons platou securities inc wanted to touch on gulf of mexico you touched on the sand control and hydraulic workover and snubbing being particularly strong this quarter and that would trend down in the fourth quarter just kind of curious how much of that was present in the first quarter or did a lot of this work kind of start up during the second quarter im just trying to understand how that plays out david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yes so we had – we certainly had the sand control completions work that was good in the first quarter and so if i think about progression here it was good in the first quarter it was even better in the second quarter its great in the third quarter and it goes back to just being kind of good in the fourth quarter snubbing – hydraulic workover and snubbing was very low in the first quarter it came up some in the second quarter and should stay at about the same level for the remainder of the year what weve been missing is weve been missing the subsea plug and abandonment revenue which has been missing throughout this year and will start up either late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter so its kind of ins and outs from a product line standpoint but thats the flow haithum nokta  clarksons platou securities inc got you and the – on the well intervention side i think you had last communicated by a sixmonth type opportunity is that still in place but just starting up late q or early q david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah i think thats right we had earlier anticipated that well be starting up during the third – early part of the third quarter its just pushed back a bit and thats really a function of vessel availability and customer schedule remember its plug and abandonment work its not always which is driving the spending plans for our customers but we do feel confident well be out there in the fourth quarter haithum nokta  clarksons platou securities inc and has there been any kind of change in the pricing dynamic since the analyst day that you had or  david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah same pricing dynamic haithum nokta  clarksons platou securities inc all right thank you very much david d dunlap  superior energy services inc youre welcome operator and with no further questions in queue id like to turn it over to todays speakers for any

land is being driven by a more rapid increase in drilling rig count than many expected including us although the acceleration of activity was surprising we were prepared for the increased demand caused by elevated activity levels due to our efforts to activate equipment and add staff ahead of the recovery the natural lag in completions activity relative to rig count creates additional demand on an already stressed pressure pumping supply resulting in continued price momentum we are very wellpositioned with our fullystaffed and reactivated  horsepower to continue to provide for our customers the highest level of execution in this improving environment the greatest beneficiary of increased customer activity during the quarter was pressure pumping where revenue grew  sequentially prices migrated higher more quickly and with less resistance than anticipated during the quarter resulting in a good starting point for the third quarter we did have approximately  million of reactivation expense associated with deployment of idle horsepower during the quarter given the current pricing trajectory in pressure pumping current customer demand and visibility on activity through the end of the year we have decided to rebuild an additional  horsepower this additional spending will be capitalized and will result in capex for the year of  million to  million up from approximately  million bottom hole assemblies premium drill pipe rentals and coiled tubing are other business lines that performed very well in us land markets during the quarter and are all benefiting from escalating rig count and higher intensity completions in the gulf of mexico revenue grew during the quarter primarily as a result of continued growth in sand control completion services we expect this business to continue to grow throughout the third quarter as several projects reach a peak in revenue elsewhere in the gulf activity levels were improved in hydraulic workover and snubbing eline and coiled tubing all of these are encouraging signs that operators with high value offshore assets are identifying projects with acceptable returns in the current commodity price environment internationally offshore drilling activity remained weak during the quarter while this impacted our drilling products and services segment a recovery in hydraulic workover and snubbing more than offset the impact of lower drilling activity we believe our international revenue reached floor during the first half of  and expect results to improve gradually through the end of the year international customer activity generally tends to lag the us and while we have modest expectations for growth internationally over the nearterm well be monitoring customer plans closely for indications of a change in sentiment towards higher spending levels in  it is important to emphasize that the gulf of mexico and particularly international markets are essential to our future growth plans we remain committed to these regions and believe the competitive landscape of both markets favor superior energys product lines and service expertise over the longterm ill now turn the call over to robert for our second quarter financial review robert s taylor  superior energy services inc thank you david in discussing our operating segments all sequential comparisons are being made to our first quarter  results drilling products and services segment revenue increased  to  million with a loss from operations of  million compared to loss from operations of  million in the first quarter of  us land revenue increased  to  million as the rig count continued to grow throughout the quarter and demand for bottom hole assemblies premium drill pipe and drill site accommodations increased gulf of mexico revenue decreased  to  million and international revenue decreased  to  million as the deepwater floating rig count continued to decline in the onshore completion and workover services segment which is comprised of product lines that exclusively serve us land markets revenue increased  million to  million the segment recorded a loss from operations of  million compared to a loss from operations of  million in the first quarter pressure pumping led the revenue growth in this segment as it increased by approximately  and accounted for approximately  of consolidated revenue fluid management and well services both grew sequentially due to higher utilization rate our production services segment revenue increased  to  million which resulted in a loss from operations of  million compared to a loss from operations of  million in the first quarter us land revenue increased  to  million as our coiled tubing business performed extremely well gulf of mexico revenue increased  to  million as hydraulic workover and snubbing activity bounced back during the quarter international revenue increased  to  million as hydraulic workover and snubbing activity increased sharply in the technical solutions segment revenue increased  to  million reducing the loss from operations to  million compared to a loss from operations of  million in the first quarter us land revenue decreased  to  million and international revenue decreased  to  million due to lower completion tools activity and lower well control activity respectively gulf of mexico revenue increased  to  million on higher completion tools activity turning to the balance sheet our debttocapital ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately  and our debt – total debt at quarterend remained at  billion we ended the quarter with one  million in cash capex during the quarter was approximate  million for the year we expect capex to be between  million and  million before turning back the call to dave there are a few modelingrelated items ga for the quarter was  million and we expect third quarter ga to be in the range of  million to  million we expect dda to increase slightly to between  million and  million as our capital expenditures add assets with slightly lower depreciable log third quarter interest expense is expected to be in the range of  million to  million our effective income tax rate for the second quarter  was  and we expect the rate for  to remain in the range of  to  thank you and ill now turn the call back over to dave for closing comments david d dunlap  superior energy services inc okay thanks robert despite a strong second quarter and better visibility for the remainder of the year there is still a great deal of uncertainty around oil prices and ep spending levels in  were therefore extremely cautious about incremental investment and well likely limit our interest in growth investment in us land markets however this doesnt mean we dont believe there is a great opportunity ahead of us it just means we will emphasize returns and profitability through this cycle we expect cycles to be shorter and believe the business needs to be managed accordingly we have a significant investment in assets in us land markets that are available during this cycle and any cost we add will be variable in nature and associated with higher levels of utilization over time low levels of capital expenditures and emphasis on free cash flow and divestitures of noncore assets that arent generating adequate returns will put us on a path to profitability we believe will be rewarded by investors we also believe that we will be able to reduce debt from current levels over this cycle this isnt a new strategy for superior weve been paying down debt and reducing capital expenditure levels since  the outlook is a bit more defined for the remainder of  on the back of a strong second quarter we see activity and pricing trending higher in q with much of our startup and reactivation of equipment occurring in q of last year and q of this year we expect to fully benefit from an improved us land market and continue to deliver strong incremental margins the best opportunity to secure margins and returns in this cycle will be early and we are exactly where we want to be from an asset perspective to capture our share we are also recognizing opportunities to pursue growth by applying technical innovation as our customers continue to drill longer laterals this trend is increasing the demand for our automated well service rigs known as cats rigs which are padoptimized and have the ability to reach the toes on the longest laterals our customers are drilling originally designed for the enhanced safety an automated process provides these service rigs are now becoming preferred completion options and are capable of generating compelling day rates other product lines in us land markets such as premium drill pipe bottom hole assemblies coiled tubing and well service rigs are all performing nicely and we expect continued strong performance through the remainder of the year in the gulf of mexico we are very excited by the sand control completion services work that weve been doing in the deepwater this is technically challenging work that our team has met headon and has done an excellent job with this work continues during q before slowing down in the fourth quarter at the same time our subsea intervention technology is expected to deploy later in the third quarter andor early in the fourth quarter offsetting the slowdown of completion activity as often happens with project work like plug and abandonment customer scheduling and vessel availability determines when our work begins internationally for the remainder of the year we expect activity to be rather quiet but we see signs that may change as we head into  areas of the world that we believe have opportunity for growth over the next  months include the middle east with our well services business potential stimulation work in india and in argentina where the vaca muerta shale continues to garner attention as a worldclass asset before qa some highlights from our results and call revenue growth of  million and ebitda growth of  million a  overall ebitda incremental  increase in pressure pumping revenue primarily due to higher utilization and pricing with  horsepower working at june  an increase in capex to between  million and  million up from  million with this increase funding the rebuild of our remaining horsepower this will result in approximately  horsepower being potentially deployed early in  a conservative outlook on growth investment in us markets we will prioritize utilization of existing assets to meet growing demand while keeping fixed cost from growing ultimately generating free cash and reducing debt we worked extremely hard for a number of years to get the company to the position it is in today our culture and core values have produced an exceptional team of management and field level professionals who are running premium businesses and service lines in the best markets globally this business is never easy but our shared experience gives us the conviction that we can outperform anyone we compete with that concludes our prepared remarks well now – operator open the lineup for qa questionandanswer session operator thanks and well go first to scott gruber with citi scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc yes good morning david d dunlap  superior energy services inc good morning scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc good quarter i want to start with the frac spread rebuild so capex goes up  million to  million how much of that is for the rebuilding of the idle frac fleets and will there be additional capex early next year im trying to think about the total expenditure for the effort now that you have  quotes from the vendors david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah i would expect that  of the rebuild of that  horsepower is completed in the third and fourth quarter of this year and it accounts for the bulk of the increase in capital spending that we mentioned scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc and do you have a line of sight in terms of customer commitments on the incremental spreads david d dunlap  superior energy services inc in all likelihood it will be equipment thats deployed with customers that we are working for today scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc great and then just on the completion and workover segment great quarter huge incrementals can you just frame for us expectations for q in terms of both revenue growth potential and incrementals david d dunlap  superior energy services inc well i think that in general you think about frac revenue being up in that weve got a total of  horsepower that well be working for the full quarter i think you can also assume that pricing will be up we saw pricing move up during the course of the second quarter it set a good starting point for us in the third quarter and my expectation would be that there is further price momentum that we experience during the third quarter i think outside of hydraulic fracturing the remainder of the us service lines will have about the same amount of capacity available and so it should be more kind of in line with rig count or slightly better than rig count i do think that our incrementals will continue to be strong and i would expect that we deliver incrementals on a us revenue increase that are kind in the  range scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc and just a final one on the pricing commentary is that spot pricing continue to move higher or is it just moving more spreads to current leadingedge david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah i mean if youre speaking exclusively of fracturing prices i mean i think that fracturing prices with all of our fracturing customers has been migrating upwards so were not in the spot market on a daytoday basis so i kind of hesitate to use that phrase leading edge prices but i think what weve seen is all of our fleets migrate upwards at a fairly similar pace scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc excellent ill turn it back good quarter david d dunlap  superior energy services inc thank you operator well go next to chase mulvehill with wolfe research chase mulvehill  wolfe research llc hey good morning dave a big war eagle to you today nice quarter david d dunlap  superior energy services inc thanks chase chase mulvehill  wolfe research llc i guess ill keep on the pressure pumping theme could you talk about pressure pumping margins in q and maybe kind of where they are on a ebitda level and then how much of your fleet is actually earning kind of leadingedge pricing right now david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah so as ive said in the other – in answering the prior question were not in the spot market on a daytoday basis and so i kind of hate to use that phrase leadingedge all of our – we migrated prices up during the course of the second quarter with all of our customers and i cant say that there is a huge spread on prices with any of those customers today weve continued to have conversations during the second quarter about where prices need to be in q and where we would like for prices to migrate to as we exit q and enter q and thats kind of what gives me confidence that well continue to see those prices migrate upwards chase mulvehill  wolfe research llc okay and it sounds like the  horsepower none of thats going to be active by the end of this year is that correct david d dunlap  superior energy services inc well i mean i think that its possible that we get some of it active at some point during the fourth quarter but i think what wed be most comfortable planning on is having the optionality to activate that horsepower more like in early part of q of  and i want to emphasize optionality we believe that we will continue to see pricing migrate upwards and tightness in the market the market is very tight from a supplydemand standpoint with fracturing today i think at the same time were going to be cautious about deployment of that equipment and in the same way that we would resist any investment and growth in hydraulic fracturing if for whatever reason we begin to see activity or price momentum begin to stall out having the equipment rebuilt gives us optionality to put it in the marketplace or not at some point in time that equipment is going to be rebuilt so i think about the cash investment that goes into it is being a pretty safe investment for the company to make but i do want to make clear to everyone that if for whatever reason we begin to see utilization levels or price momentum begin to stall well always got the optionality to keep that rebuilt equipment parked on the fence chase mulvehill  wolfe research llc okay last one and ill turn it back over looking into q are you seeing any issues with sourcing sand i know that i think only about  of your fleets use source of sand for so – but any issues there when we think about sourcing sand for the third quarter david d dunlap  superior energy services inc not in the way of bottlenecks i mean i think that sand is – sand and logistics in this business are always a challenge and im sure theyll be a challenge in q as they were in the first or second quarter but i dont think that we are in anyway thinking about bottlenecks that would hold us back in the third quarter as a result of sand chase mulvehill  wolfe research llc all right thanks dave war eagle again operator well now go next to sean meakim with jpmorgan sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning david d dunlap  superior energy services inc good morning sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc dave i heard you i think you talked about frac activity completion activity maybe at or above the rig count in the third quarter how do you see the duc inventory playing out have you seen ducs continue to build in the first half of the year as you been – you and along with your peers activating a lot of horsepower at some point shouldnt we see completions growth outstrip rig count by a fairly large amount how you see that interplay in the third quarter maybe just for the rest of the year david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah well my comment was actually related to the service lines other than fracturing i mean i think that in general fracturing is going – fracturing – the pace of revenue growth in fracturing is going to be a function of how much equipment we have activated and how much price increases so i mean there is a point in time where it could get disconnected from the rig count but – and wed kind of outpace the rig count from the first to second quarter as well so my comments about revenue outpacing or being at close to the rig count was really about product lines other than frac to supply and demand i mean listen from – all signs are that the market is extremely tight for capacity i personally believe that some of the capacity that industry has activated in the first half of  is capacity that did not have a whole lot of useful life of remaining to it so i think even in a flattish demand market for hydraulic fracturing services that we continue to see tightness in the market weve got fracturing fleets now that with the types of hours that they operate are only good for four to five years so you think about the amount of equipment that we have working today and the amount that should be rebuilt or replaced during  i dont think we have that much capital rebuild and replacement going on today so that leads me to believe that we continue to see tightness in that market for quite some time sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you for that clarification and then you mentioned during the quarter you sort out a standard drill pipe in lower  just curious if that adoption of inch has been slower than you anticipated kind of whats the way to stock in terms of the opportunity there relative to perhaps putting incremental capital into that business to add inventory to standard pipe david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah i mean i think when you refer to standard pipe i think youre thinking of inch premium drill pipe which is sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc correct david d dunlap  superior energy services inc certainly seeing the highest level of demand and it is an area where weve got very little additional capacity to put to work we do have additional inch drill pipe which is a higher priced premium  pipe that we could rent to our customers the uptake of that has been somewhat slow its more expensive pipe to use we think its the better technical solution and over time on the longest of laterals more operators migrate to that but i think the point you bring up is a good one and that is that with demand for inch drill pipe where it is there may be some opportunities for growth as we look out to the future and well monitor that keep an eye on it and see when we want to take advantage of that sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc fair enough okay thanks dave operator well go next to jim wicklund with credit suisse james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc good morning guys good quarter thank you david d dunlap  superior energy services inc thanks jim james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc mr chases question about sand and you provided about  of your own weve been looking at the disaggregation of pressure pumping as a business over the last several years before there were sand stacks that any of us covered or knew about and it just strikes me that with more and more ep companies buying their own chemicals direct from ecolab and their own sand direct from hicrush that – thats a passthrough item that you dont get to see as much of anymore and while you did a very little markup im sure on it in the past the returns were good can you talk a little bit about how thats going to be different in this recovery not sourcing all those different things and just providing the pumping services to a larger extent versus the last cycle we were in david d dunlap  superior energy services inc look jim you may recall that our pressure pumping business has been built around a model which was specifically geared towards some of the most efficient horizontal well operators that we see in the marketplace for quite some time our customers a number of our customers have sourced their own sand theyve sourced their own chemicals and so we are very accustomed to a pricing model and an efficiency delivery model in the field thats geared towards customers that choose to supply their own chemicals and proppant so i dont think this is any switch for us i think there are others in the marketplace that have traditionally lived off of margins created by markups on sand and markups on chemicals that may be having to learn the pricing things in a little bit different way but the market is migrating to a point where we have been for quite some time james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc okay thank you sir thats helpful and you mentioned your automated well service rigs and im a fan of service rigs  rigs used in completions and im just curious how many of these do you have and is that a point of incremental capex kind of seans question david d dunlap  superior energy services inc so we have built four of these service rigs all delivered prior to the end of  and you may recall that this was a bit of a stepout program for us from a technology standpoint to begin in about  or  were seeing very high demand for those four service rigs today and yes it is only four service rigs that being said those four service rigs generated substantially higher day rate than any other service rigs that we have in our fleet demand for those service rigs is at a point where were being to evaluate whether or not that is a unique technology that we would put some incremental growth capital to in  and  its a very well suited tool for the very longest laterals and as we speak to many of our customers that are planning laterals that are well beyond two miles its a very very important tool for them from an efficiency standpoint so i think at this point i would tell you its an opportunity for us with the unique growth investment one that well be talking to you a bit more as the year progresses and well tell you specifically what were going to do from a growth standpoint in that product line when we get to telling you about our  capital spending plan james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc okay okay david thanks a lot thanks guys david d dunlap  superior energy services inc thanks jim operator well take our next question from vebs vaishnav with cowen vaibhav vaishnav  cowen  co llc hey good morning and thanks for taking the question very good quarter dave i guess sticking with pressure pumping can you speak – like it sounds like the q pressure pumping revenue was helped by addition of  horsepower and does not sound like you are any fleets in q but obviously youll get some fullquarter impact from the fleet addition and some higher pricing can that drive the  revenue growth in q that we saw in q or would you need additional horsepower to get that kind of revenue growth david d dunlap  superior energy services inc i mean for – to match the  revenue growth we probably need some additional horsepower i mean youre right that was additional horsepower that was utilization going up on horsepower as we exited q and it was pricing so i dont know thinking about another  growth from q to q in fracturing is likely but i think its still strong growth and still delivering strong incrementals which we would like to see the margin continue to improve in that business vaibhav vaishnav  cowen  co llc yeah switching to gulf of mexico it just sounds like the sand control business is doing very good you spoke about it continuing to grow in q and possibly the pa tool can be added late third quarter early fourth quarter it sounds like its going to stay at the same growth rate as we saw in q but were you implying that the fourth quarter gulf of mexico could be down because the sand control could be down i didnt understand what the message was there david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah so a good way to think about this i mean the sand control work that weve done reaches a peak in the third quarter and i think you can expect that our sand control revenue in the third quarter will be higher than it was in the second quarter and it probably drives gulf of mexico revenue up i think if you think somewhere in the  to  range thats probably about right what will happen in the fourth quarter is sand control revenue will decline but will pickup subsea pa revenue and i think the result is q in the gulf of mexico that probably looks a lot like the second quarter we just reported vaibhav vaishnav  cowen  co llc okay and one last question from me maybe i missed that when you spoke about the  incrementals were you talking about the us land incrementals or were you talking about the companywide incrementals david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah i mean us land incrementals will continue to be strong i mean i dont think its a big stretch to think about companywide incrementals being close to that  mark vaibhav vaishnav  cowen  co llc perfect thats all from me thank you sir operator well go next to stephen gengaro with loop capital stephen d gengaro  loop capital markets llc hi thank you good morning david d dunlap  superior energy services inc good morning stephen d gengaro  loop capital markets llc two things dave p where it  start with on the onshore completion and workover business when i look at the progression you had in the second quarter which looked very good and listening to the incrementals youre talking about on an operating income basis could that be profitable in the fourth quarter david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah fourth quarter may be a bit early for it i mean i think overall i see at some point during  and maybe thats in the first or second quarter we reach a point where were at ebit – where we are ebit positive for the entire company i think q may be just a bit early for it but i mean look weve been – ive been surprised by the way that prices progressed during the course of the second quarter i mean we know fundamentally that this early point in the cycle is the point in time where you really want to take advantage of higher demand and have as much of your equipment activated as possible thats why we chose to do the things we did in q and q i was surprised at how fast price went up but i was also surprised at where the rig count wound up and so im not saying it couldnt happen before the end of the year but i think about that being probably more for  stephen d gengaro  loop capital markets llc okay thank you and then on the drilling products side obviously the margins sequentially were i believe hurt by the gulf and probably more the international side has the international – it sounds like youre thinking its troughing here should those margins start to gain some traction in the third and fourth quarters or is it still with international and gulf being sloppy just hard to see a lot of progress david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah i mean i think that clearly us revenue in those product lines in the drilling products and services segment will continue to come up whether or not they offset what we think is probably continued weakness in deepwater gulf of mexico and also deepwater globally i dont know if theyll offset i mean i think that in general you could probably expect going forward something similar to what we see in the second quarter which is just kind of weaker margins in that segment overall even though us land is coming up the us land side of the business although margins are very strong in premium drill pipe not quite as high as what we see on premium drill pipe rentals internationally and in the gulf of mexico thats just driven by fixed cost i mean in most of those international and particularly gulf of mexico markets were able to operate from a single facility single point of distribution in the us as you well know i mean weve got to have distribution capabilities that are scattered in the basins and that makes the fixed cost just a bit higher so i think what you saw in the second quarter is probably something you ought to expect kind of in the third quarter as well i mean i think we are anticipating at some point in the future a bit stronger global deepwater activity i dont know exactly when that comes but its certainly something that we anticipate because the incremental margins that that business can drive for us when we begin to see a few more deepwater rigs working globally are tremendous stephen d gengaro  loop capital markets llc okay great thank you operator well take our next question from marshall adkins with raymond james j marshall adkins  raymond james  associates inc good morning dave in the past you had mentioned that your rebuild cost for these frac fleets was kind of in the  million per fleet range i guess were coming up to the last  horsepower couple questions on that is it still – are you still thinking  million per fleet on the rebuild or is that cost lower is it different and how hard is it to get in line to get this equipment rebuilt david d dunlap  superior energy services inc so youre in the ballpark marshall i mean i think thats probably a reasonable way to think about rebuild at about  million a fleet could wind up being slightly less than that as far as where we are in the queue we are in line in the queue to be able to get that rebuild accomplished in the second half of the year i think keep in mind i mean we have continued to be a component buyer throughout the down cycle weve replaced engines weve had transmission replacements and although we havent had any capital rebuild all of those same components are the ones that go into capital rebuild so were well positioned in the queue for the components and have no concern about being able to source the components or assembly capacity that we need to have that equipment rebuilt in the second half ill also draw you to another number that we talk about and this goes back probably at least a year year and a half where we said that we thought it would cost us about  million overall cash in order to get to  horsepower from the  horsepower that we had in the second quarter of  and were pretty much spot on with that  million in cash most of what we spent todate has been expensed as you know and a lot of thats been in engine replacements and fleet reactivation the remainder is in capex but were pretty well right in line with that  million in cash over the last year j marshall adkins  raymond james  associates inc so is it fair to say your – even these last ones which obviously require a lot more capital in the first fleets you did your rebuild costs are still going to be less than  on the  versus what youre going to have to pay when the tier  engines come out in  david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yes certainly less than where the tier  engines would be in  but i mean even relative to new equipment cost for the like components its around  on the  j marshall adkins  raymond james  associates inc okay last question from me any signs of slowing from customer interest due to the sloppy oil prices over the past three months david d dunlap  superior energy services inc not at this point j marshall adkins  raymond james  associates inc in any of the subsegments david d dunlap  superior energy services inc not at this point i mean listen ill give you my personal bias i mean i think that theres probably likely to be certain small operators that will tap the brakes of it as we go through the second half of the year but what were hearing from our larger customers at this point in time is that we can expect for our fleets to remain fully utilized through the end of the year j marshall adkins  raymond james  associates inc thank you david d dunlap  superior energy services inc thanks marshall operator well go next to bill herbert with simmons  company william a herbert  simmons  company international thanks good morning david d dunlap  superior energy services inc hey bill william a herbert  simmons  company international dave hey how are you sir why wouldnt your incrementals in the third quarter be as – for onshore completions be as strong as they were in the second quarter if not stronger frankly right i mean youre not going to have the reactivation expense and im just curious you said  understand david d dunlap  superior energy services inc just to clarify its  for the entire company william a herbert  simmons  company international okay sorry but for the third quarter so we think – so would it be a rash assumption to assume that effectively the incrementals would not be as strong in the third quarter or basically effectively close to  incrementals were generated in the second quarter david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah listen i think that the incrementals that well see in fracturing are probably similar william a herbert  simmons  company international okay david d dunlap  superior energy services inc from what we – from q to q i think those are clearly the highest incrementals that we have in the company and its a result of the price momentum that weve had in that product line which by the way started at a very low point in q so i mean there was clearly good ways to go from a pricing standpoint in other areas incrementals – in other product lines incrementals in the us arent going to be quite as high i mean weve seen good price momentum in things like coiled tubing and even in our standard service rigs and well test flow back and that kind of thing but not quite the same dynamic that we have in supply and demand of fracturing so fracturing is going to lead the way there and of course our gulf of mexico incrementals are not going to be as high as us land although we expect them to be good in kind of the  range so yeah im not sure if im answering your question but i mean i do expect to see still very strong incrementals and would expect that fracturing business incrementals are above  william a herbert  simmons  company international awesome good thanks and the point of my query was to try and understand whether there was any kind of percolating supply chain or wage or labor inflation thats beginning to inflect more strongly that possibly would suppress the flow through in the second half of the year relative to what you saw in the second quarter it doesnt sound like it david d dunlap  superior energy services inc i think youre correct in that assumption there please dont misread that to believe theres not some labor inflation taking place in the market there is william a herbert  simmons  company international okay david d dunlap  superior energy services inc some labor inflation taking place in the market but at this point prices were overcoming that labor inflation otherwise incrementals will be higher right william a herbert  simmons  company international yeah and i want to kind of delve into a little bit about the competitive structure of the industry i mean i think youve been a sort of consistent voice of realism in – just passion about the cyclical opportunities and threats associated with the industry and you made a comment earlier on that even if activity flattens out you think the market is going to stay tight and i guess i want to more fully understand that because there seems to be a decent chunk of new horsepower in the process of being built with possibly a strong upward bias and you still got slugs of reactivation opportunities looming in the marketplace in the form of one stem and what have you so i guess the worry is that youve got an industry which is fragmented and deconsolidated to the extent that it really never has been so the competitive structure is weak and youve got again sort of insufficiently discriminating sources of capital committing capital towards new builds and if you get the convergence between significantly increased horsepower and flattening out activity how does the persistence of decent pricing and margins take place david d dunlap  superior energy services inc so i think what gets lost a bit in the market bill is just how much equipment needs to be replaced on an annual basis so if you think about the market today is being supplied with ill use an easy round number around  million horsepower i dont know if thats exactly right but just bear with me here for a moment engine life of a fracturing fleet thats working today is somewhere between four and five years and in fact you could say that the transmission and power have very similar life so equipment needs to be rebuilt between four and five years if its seen that type of utilization i think more and more companies are migrating to that kind of utilization because thats what the longer laterals higher stage count and more pad require and so to me what that means is that if weve got  million horsepower out there working today somewhere between  million and  million of it needs to be rebuilt or replaced within the next  months im not seeing that kind of orders out there thats william a herbert  simmons  company international okay david d dunlap  superior energy services inc if you maintain  million and so then if you take into account that – and this is just my belief that a lot of the horsepower which has been reactivated over the last eight or nine months is capacity that only had   or  useful life remaining to it thats capacity thats got to be rebuilt or replaced as well over the next year so i see this as there being a surge in demand for components that we see in the marketplace over the course of the next  months and its part of the reason why we were so insistent on equipment that we reactivated going out with a minimum four years useful life as i believe there will be that tightness in the marketplace and we wanted to have  of our potential capacity available and working through that tightness william a herbert  simmons  company international okay thank you sir david d dunlap  superior energy services inc youre welcome operator well take our next question from byron pope with tudor pickering holt byron k pope  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc good morning guys david d dunlap  superior energy services inc good morning byron k pope  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc just on the international side i mean you mentioned the few areas where you could have potential bright spots maybe as we step over the next  months but as we think about your international operations overall could you frame for us some of the geomarkets that youre more i guess more dependent on i know argentina is one of those but could you just frame it at a high level for us david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah for the part of those that were most dependent on i mean latin america is our largest revenuegenerating region followed kind of by europe and the north sea and then asia i mean i think as i look forward where we expect to see opportunities in growth over the course of the next few years is in the middle east which is still a relatively small region of operation for us but one where weve had a pretty strong business development effort underway for the last year and a half or so that i believe starts to produce some good fruits for us as we move into  and beyond and specifically countrywise were speaking of saudi arabia and kuwait we also see some upside in places in asia really more gas markets if you think about places like india then oil markets where weve had great success in growing business over the last few years and see continued opportunities and then in latin america a business thats been slow really for about the last  months were beginning to get more and more excited about spending increases in argentina in the vaca muerta shale this does appear to be a place for a foreign investment along with ypf investment is going to result in a growing business for us in  and beyond the sleeper out there is brazil and although i dont want to present myself as a nearterm brazil bull byron k pope  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc sure david d dunlap  superior energy services inc brazil is a market which began coming down kind of in  and really outside of what happened to oil prices and it is a worldclass resource that i believe ultimately well begin to see some additional investment dollars go to so thats probably a bit further down the road but anyway just general thoughts on international byron k pope  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc thanks dave appreciate it david d dunlap  superior energy services inc youre welcome operator well take our next question from dave anderson with barclays j david anderson  barclays capital inc hi dave i was wondering if you could expand a bit on the conversations around coiled tubing and well servicing maybe just start with the coiled tubing performance this quarter it was excellent obviously of  whats your sweet spot in that business what part of the activity chain is driving that outperformance this quarter david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah so i mean i would say its – for us sweet spot is permian basin and midcontinent i think its clearly driven by the completions activity that we see in those markets and i think we have capacity thats in very good condition weve chosen not to reactivate additional coiled tubing units but the coiled tubing  in the field going into the fiscal year i mean its a function of higher completions activity driving utilization up im not sure i understand your question about sweet spot j david anderson  barclays capital inc well no thats kind of what i was wondering because – you talked about the automated well servicing rigs david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah j david anderson  barclays capital inc and how thats better for the longer laterals so maybe you can just frame the question this way if im an operator whats my ideal time when do i use coiled tubing for completions versus the automated well servicing rigs like whats the kind of lateral length kind of limitations if you will and kind of how the costs compare from if im in the operator standpoint – operator seat david d dunlap  superior energy services inc so if all youre thinking about is lateral length if youre less than about  mile lateral then in most cases a service rig or coiled tubing unit or combination of those two is going to be sufficient but a lot of operators are using a combination where theyll bring – if they get longer than about  mile theyll bring a service rig out to drill the plugs in the farther reaches of the well which are difficult if not technically impossible for coiled tubing to get to and then once theyve got – reach the point where coiled tubing is going to be more effective then theyll demobilized to service rig  coiled tubing out to drill out the remainder of the plugs the benefit of the cats rig is it can reach the deepest of plugs and so thats really – think sweet spot getting closer to two miles or beyond twomile laterals it doesnt have to be demobed it can drill all the way through its got walking capability and so yeah its a service rig so your tripping pipe is a bit slower than it would be in reeling in and reeling out with coil the offset to that is that it doesnt need to demobed and when youre finished with one well then you just skid over on the walking – with the walking system over to the next well so and then of course its got safety benefits there is no hands on the rig floor and so from a safety standpoint its really an optimal solution all the way around j david anderson  barclays capital inc all right great thanks dave david d dunlap  superior energy services inc you bet operator well take our next question from jud bailey from wells fargo judson e bailey  wells fargo securities llc thanks good morning david d dunlap  superior energy services inc hi jud judson e bailey  wells fargo securities llc hey just a quick question we talked a lot about pressure pumping and how strong the pricing environment is could you maybe talk a little bit more or kind of give us some color on how youre see pricing in your other us land segments im just trying to get a sense of how tight various markets are and how pricing discussions are even though oil prices have pulled back a little bit david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah i mean certainly those discussions have not had the same type of pace to them that weve had in fracturing and listen i think this is just purely a function of supply and demand there is very tight supply demand in fracturing with the other product lines i think theres still capacity that could come into the market and our own capacity would be an example and we continue to have service rigs which are idle we continue to have coiled tubing units which are idle if price points move very rapidly in those businesses and weve got capacity and im sure others do as well that they could hire staff for and put to work so in other service lines it just becomes a bit of a check i guess on how fast price can rise weve seen nice solid price momentum that i guess would be consistent with the type of increases that weve seen in activity its only in fracturing where weve got this fundamental and structural tightness in supply and demand driven by the extreme changing capacity requirements that weve had in fracturing going from  horsepower fleets in  to  horsepower and  horsepower fleets now you just hadnt seen that in the other product lines but i dont want to dismiss the price momentum that we have in those areas because its good its just not of the extreme nature that fracturing has been judson e bailey  wells fargo securities llc okay all right thank you and just a followup on the reactivation of your remaining  horsepower is the timing of maybe getting those deployed in early  is that – im just curious is that being driven by the customers kind of schedule and timing or are there bottlenecks in terms of getting the equipment ready in time david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah we really dont have any bottlenecks as far as getting the equipment ready and as ive said earlier its possible that some of that equipment does get deployed before the end of the fourth quarter just as we think about it its most likely to be fully revenuegenerating if we choose to deploy it once again by the first quarter of  judson e bailey  wells fargo securities llc got it thank you operator well go next to gregg brody with bank of america merrill lynch gregg brody  bank of america merrill lynch good morning guys david d dunlap  superior energy services inc good morning gregg brody  bank of america merrill lynch could you just say – would you mind giving an update on where you stand with the credit facility if theres anything to add and – where you stand with your banks david d dunlap  superior energy services inc weve got great relationships with our banks were undrawn on the credit facility and – i dont know that i have anything else to say about it gregg brody  bank of america merrill lynch i thought on one of the last calls you – or your conference calls you were mentioning you were looking at refinancing or pushing out the maturity david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah so i mean i think you may be speaking of senior notes and weve got senior notes that mature in  – or  im sorry gregg brody  bank of america merrill lynch and maybe  youre talking about was with the credit facility youve – pushing that out was part of a process to possibly refinancing those notes i guess david d dunlap  superior energy services inc well i mean – yeah listen the credit facility expires in february  i think its normal course to have negotiation on extension on a new credit facility before the current one with the current one that were undrawn  on it so i mean in all likelihood over the course of the next few quarters well be having conversations with banks about an extended credit facility i dont think its a huge pressing matter for us at the moment gregg brody  bank of america merrill lynch thats helpful and then david d dunlap  superior energy services inc its part of the normal course of business gregg brody  bank of america merrill lynch thats helpful and then just one followup if i look at your cash balance at the end of the quarter i would have thought it would have been a little bit higher just with the income tax refund is there – was there a greater drain on working capital than you expected or we just didnt model – i just didnt model it right david d dunlap  superior energy services inc i dont know theres a greater drain than we expected we saw revenue increase dramatically so our receivable balance did increase during the course of the second quarter it was offset some by an increase in payables so i dont know that there was anything that was surprising to us we did make an – we had interest payments always occurring in the second quarter and then about  million in capex so listen it was helpful to get the income tax refund but i dont think we were surprised at all or saw anything unusual in cash balance at the end of the quarter gregg brody  bank of america merrill lynch i appreciate the color guys thats it for me david d dunlap  superior energy services inc okay operator well go next to haithum nokta with clarksons platou securities haithum nokta  clarksons platou securities inc hi good morning guys david d dunlap  superior energy services inc good morning haithum nokta  clarksons platou securities inc wanted to touch on gulf of mexico you touched on the sand control and hydraulic workover and snubbing being particularly strong this quarter and that would trend down in the fourth quarter just kind of curious how much of that was present in the first quarter or did a lot of this work kind of start up during the second quarter im just trying to understand how that plays out david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yes so we had – we certainly had the sand control completions work that was good in the first quarter and so if i think about progression here it was good in the first quarter it was even better in the second quarter its great in the third quarter and it goes back to just being kind of good in the fourth quarter snubbing – hydraulic workover and snubbing was very low in the first quarter it came up some in the second quarter and should stay at about the same level for the remainder of the year what weve been missing is weve been missing the subsea plug and abandonment revenue which has been missing throughout this year and will start up either late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter so its kind of ins and outs from a product line standpoint but thats the flow haithum nokta  clarksons platou securities inc got you and the – on the well intervention side i think you had last communicated by a sixmonth type opportunity is that still in place but just starting up late q or early q david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah i think thats right we had earlier anticipated that well be starting up during the third – early part of the third quarter its just pushed back a bit and thats really a function of vessel availability and customer schedule remember its plug and abandonment work its not always which is driving the spending plans for our customers but we do feel confident well be out there in the fourth quarter haithum nokta  clarksons platou securities inc and has there been any kind of change in the pricing dynamic since the analyst day that you had or  david d dunlap  superior energy services inc yeah same pricing dynamic haithum nokta  clarksons platou securities inc all right thank you very much david d dunlap  superior energy services inc youre welcome operator and with no further questions in queue id like to turn it over to todays speakers for any
