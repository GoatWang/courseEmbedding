quotes from research analysts about irhythm tech stock  according to zacks investment research irhythm technologies inc is a digital healthcare company it focuses on the provision of ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring for patients at risk for arrhythmias primarily in the united states the company offers zio service a platform which provides wearable biosensor with cloudbased data analytics that distill data from heartbeats into clinically actionable information irhythm technologies inc is headquartered in san francisco california    canaccord genuity analysts commented we reiterate our buy rating on shares of irtc following recent fda approval of the firm’s next generation zio platform with timely data transmission capabilities approval for the platform comes a bit earlier than our expectations with irtc seemingly on track for a us market launch in he while we expect a measured ramp – given the firm will once again engage insurers visàvis the contracting process for this new technology – we surmise that fda approval for this marketexpanding nextgeneration platform opens up the mcot tam thus the remainder of the aecg market to the firm allowing irtc to address  of physician aecg needs over time while the realtime segment of the aecg market represents an incremental addition to irtc’s currently addressable tam we see the real value of this offering to be implicit in irhythm’s ability to become a fullline supplier for its customers targeting both first and secondline aecg monitoring currently zio targets only firstline as well as expansion into new indications such as postaf ablation postcardiac surgery and post ischemic stroke in sum we continue to see the potential for material upside to forward estimates as irtc is still early in its campaign to drive a paradigm change in the ambulatory ecg monitoring space further we expect the firm’s vast competitive moat – consisting of substantial clinical data proprietary backend analytics and robust ip – as supportive of sustainable type growth for several years to come  are investors shorting irhythm tech irhythm tech saw a increase in short interest in june as of june th there was short
