table of contents revenue recognition tenant receivables and allowance for uncollectible accounts we recognize revenue in accordance with asc topic  revenue recognition or asc topic  asc topic  requires that all four of the following basic criteria be met before revenue is realized or realizable and earned i there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured tenant receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that collectability is not reasonably assured and thus such revenue is recognized using the cash basis method table of contents consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to real estate revenue over the remaining noncancelable lease term plus any belowmarket renewal options of the acquired leases with each property table of contents impairment of longlived and intangible assets our longlived assets primarily consist of investments in real estate which we carry at historical cost less accumulated depreciation we periodically evaluate the impairment of a real estate investment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable indicators we consider important and that we believe could trigger an impairment review include among others the following a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and a significant change in the extent or manner in which the asset is used or significant physical change in the asset if indicators of impairment are present we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted net cash flows of the underlying operations in performing this evaluation the estimation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on subjective assumptions dependent upon market conditions and our current intentions with respect to holding or disposing of the asset it requires us to make assumptions related to discount rates future rental rates tenant allowances operating expenditures property taxes capital improvements occupancy levels and the estimated proceeds generated from the future sale of the property changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results we adjust the net book value of leased properties and other longlived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted net cash flows including sales proceeds is less than book value we recognize an impairment loss at the time we make any such determination the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets an active program to locate a buyer or buyers and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset has been initiated the sale of the asset is probable and the transfer of the asset is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and given the actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan would be made or that the plan would be
