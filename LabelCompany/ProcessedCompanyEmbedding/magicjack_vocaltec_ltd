other useful sections reviews  cs info qa  tools take me straight to the  user submitted reviews  magicjack plus review by whichvoip this section provides an overall summary of our review of the magicjack plus phone service scroll down to read the complete review including ordering installation using the service and returning the good the magicjack plus is very simple to acquire setup and also has three  different ways to utilize the service computer home phone and mobile the biggest plus is the low cost of service a fraction of a typical landline cost this device and service lends itself very well for a cheap second line or for people who are not that reliant on a home phone line eg someone who uses their cell phone for most conversations the bad there is no customer support to call if you have issues but they do have online chat and a knowledgebase this would be more of a concern for less tech savvy people who like the comfort of knowing that help is just a phone call away the feature set is minimal compared with other voip services available there are also a few annoying points with the magicjack mobile application the bottom line cost  for the magicjack plus device which includes  months free phone service service plans monthly plan costs  per month  month plan costs  every  months  year plan costs  per year and their  year plan costs  every  years extra fees apply for some features eg porting your number plus applicable regulatory fees and taxes extra fees apply for certain national area codes plus international calling magicjack go is now available and comes with  year of free service included for an up front cost of  overall thoughts overlooking the nuances about the magicjack plus it is actually quite a neat product setting up the device is a little obnoxious but after you survive the deluge of ads what lies beneath is an acceptable calling solution worth considering if you are comfortable with technology and cost is a major driving factor over anything else our ratings for the magicjack plus overall rating  ease of order delivery installation voice quality service reliability service features customer service value for money mobile app introduction a lot of easytouse voip calling solutions have made their way to the market a variety of solutions have surfaced both as an attempt to meet the needs of the everyday consumer as well as enterprises these simple devices and applications allow people with an internet connection the ability to make a voice call without an actual landline one very low cost solution is the magicjack plus magicjack first hit the market in  the original version was a small usb device that plugged directly into a personal computer pc and allowed a standard telephone to be plugged into the device it utilizes voice over ip voip technology allowing users to make internetbased phone calls magicjack plus was introduced in  to remove the requirement of connecting directly to a pc instead connecting directly to an available internet port modem router etc the company behind the magicjack products is ymax communications corporation who provide the transfer of the phone calls made with these products many people have heard of magicjack as it is promoted through commercials on television it is a very low cost option with a small annual charge for making unlimited calls in usa and canada note that certain fee type codes and some area codes may require prepaid minutes to be purchased though a day money back guarantee is offered for those who want to try it out with no risk we decided to take the magicjack plus for a test drive to see how it performs including ordering setting up using it trying customer support and returning the device ordering the magicjack plus though you can find the magicjack plus in many consumer electronics stores we went ahead and purchased the device through the companys website we selected the expedited shipping option for an additional  so the device would arrive between  to  business days however the device arrived  days  business days after ordering causing us to deduct a star if you are someone who is easily offended by up selling tactics i would avoid ordering the device online after you register for your free trial magicjack bombards you with a deluge of addons for your order some of the offers do make some sense though if you were planning on keeping the service however it still feels like a high pressure sales situation so we knocked a star off for these tactics the below image shows an example of some of the ads the cost for the magicjack plus device is  and this includes six  months of service free unlimited calling to the usa and canada they also promote a  day money back guarantee excluding shipping fees like any phone solution voip or landline additional fees apply to make international calls unless you are calling another magicjack subscriber you are subject to certain fees for numbers outside of the coverage area including some national area codes fortunately their rates are fairly low it differs by country these fees can only be circumvented if a person you are calling in another country is also using magicjack if youre really trying to beat the system you can also assign a local number to a unit and send it to someone over seas here is an image of the package once it arrived installing the magicjack plus there are three  main ways that the magicjack plus device and service can be used as follows however option  below is required to configure your service before you can make phone calls you can connect the device directly to a computer via the usb connector in this scenario you can use what is known as a softphone application which includes a piece of software that turns your computer into your phone dialer you will then need a headset or separate microphone and speaker set to make calls you can also plug any analog touchtone phone to the device for a more authentic experience the magicjack plus device can plug directly into your internet modem or router which is the easiest way to use the device if you want to use a regular phone for various setup options with your home network we recommend reading our setup article there is a free mobile application app available on google play and apple app store which gives users a highly mobile option to use the service as it can function on g or higher networks or over wifi connections perfect for modern day smartphones no matter how you use it you have the ability to access voicemail fortunately you dont have to fine tune anything nor do you have the ability as you simply plug in the device provide requested information and youre good to go next lets look at the different ways to use it as introduced above  using the magicjack plus with a computer installation can be a pain point for some users who are not technology comfortable so we will walk through this the device utilizes a usb  connection to interface with a computer since windows commands a majority of operating systems in the market we installed and tested the device on a computer utilizing the windows   bit operating system when you plug the magicjack into a usb port on your computer the driver automatically installs one quick note here is that the device includes two additional usb ports which can be very useful as the device depth means it can cover multiple ports on your computer device if you have not already registered the device you will need to now you have to work through a few web forms to setup the device and register a valid phone number be prepared the same offers you encounter when ordering the device come back for a second round of promotional assault the below image shows the device connected to one of our laptops you can request an area code for anywhere in the us or canada which is a free feature of magicjack plus additionally it is possible to port an existing number to the service or you can optionally create a vanity number subject to availability of course both for an additional fee of  plus  a year annually note we typically recommend not porting your existing phone number initially until at least you have used the service and are happy with it we recommend this for any voip service you may be considering once you have named your device selected a valid number and shuffled through all the promos you are ready to make calls the below image shows the phone dialer on the computer screen the magicjack application you see above is the softphone you can utilize to initiate phone calls if you dont have a phone connected to the device then you will need a headset or microphonespeakers combo as mentioned previously just like every phone since the rotary phone went to the wayside you will see a familiar number layout you use this dialpad to dial the phone number you want to call and click on the send button to end the call you simply click on the end button you can also connect your existing home phone to the magicjack plus device in this configuration connecting a phone to the device is just as simple as connecting a phone to any other rj socket in your home or business if youre using an actual phone you can also use its number pad like any other phone just pick it up and dial the number you want to call we made a few test calls with this set up and found the sound quality as good as a landline with no noticeable hum echo or static noises in the background depending on how you plan on using the magicjack device this option works ok but it is somewhat clunky and space consuming especially when using a laptop it also requires the computer device to be on and running for the phone service to work fortunately the plus device includes other ways to use the service as well  using magicjack plus with your router another way to use the magicjack plus is by plugging the device directly into an internet modem or a router internet port the device includes an adaptor for the usb connector to plug into a v mains socket to power the plus device similar to a smartphone power adaptor your analog phone will plug into the rj port just like when using the device with a computer then you will use the phone in the same way as if it were a landline the below images shows the magicjack plus device connected to a mains outlet and then a cable connected to a router and a cable connected to the phone  connections in total the device will protrude if connecting directly to a mains outlet so it is best to avoid plugging it into a socket in a high traffic area alternatively the device does include a usbpower extension cable this setup is likely the most commonly used however when performing an initial setup it is probably simpler to start with the device connected directly to your computer and then move to this setup once complete we recommend setting up  service as soon as you can which must be configured through a separate verification process especially if this will be your main home number  the magicjack smartphone application this magicjack application is one more way you can utilize this service for someone with limited minutes on a carrier plan this is the perfect way to add virtually unlimited minutes to your cell calling plan it works over both wifi and g or higher mobile data networks the image below gives you an idea of what the app looks like on a smartphone though the magicjack application is a great a value addon we did notice a couple of minor issues we should mention the first one was that when going to download the app the icon presented is a green square with the words talk free in white this app icon looks nothing like the rest of their branding and we almost didnt download the app as we were not sure it was truly for magicjack the second issue we encountered with the application has to do with the contact integration for android after selecting a contact in the magicjack application you are taken to the actual phones contact database if you attempt to make a call from here you will simply utilize your actual phone and not the magicjack application so using your phone minutes rather than free calling many voip apps for example skype integrate further into the android os such that they appear in a prompt that allows you to select your phone skype or another application to call the number you select  magicjack does not though the magicjack app has some flaws it is a nice addon feature and does work for making phone calls the sound quality was no worse than a typical phone call made from your cell phone the g network in the area where we tested the phone app is very good so that would have helped features of the magicjack plus as a voip product and service the magicjack plus is considerably light on features the included call features are voicemail caller id call forwarding and call waiting they do also boast free  calling however these are basic features when compared to many other voip services available today some with  features as mentioned previously they do allow number porting but at an additional fee to switch  and then annually to maintain  a fee for porting your existing number is common though due to paperwork involved customer service the customer service options are detailed in the tabbed section above titled customer support this is a very low cost service so its not surprising that there is no phone support they do have a knowledgebase on their website which includes some howto videos and frequently asked questions as well as a live chat option we reached out to magicjacks tech support with a hypothetical issue that we considered uncommon to test out the persons knowledge here is the live chat this is the meat of the conversation  the rest of the unseen messages primarily consist of profuse appreciative statements from the live chat person we were also presented with a link to claim a  year contract extension for a grand total of about  in a nutshell the live chat person was able to provide an answer even though it was a somewhat obscure request this is just an example and of course does not cover all scenarios so is not necessarily a true representation of their support as a whole final thoughts the only remaining item to test was returning the device this can be an important step for those who decide it is not for them during the trial period returning the product was straight forward and simple we are glad to say it consisted of entering in a little information confirming that indeed we wanted to cancel and then getting an rma authorization to include in the return shipment overall we had a positive experience with the magicjack plus device and phone service the sound quality was acceptable during our testing although it must be noted we have a high quality internet connection the main strength and attraction is quite clearly the low cost if cost is your only priority then this service is worth considering the weaknesses include no customer service phone line and the reduced feature set compared with typical voip services in the market today there are also some quirks with the mobile app although it is a nice feature to have and does work based on its low cost we would certainly recommend this device to anyone who was looking for a second phone line that was not for critical use if you are considering this option for your main home phone line then we recommend you consider what is important to you most cost customer service features etc and to also look through the user submitted reviews before making your decision magicjack overview from the over  user submitted reviews below since  you can see a mixed reaction of experiences one of the biggest complaints is related to customer service which is only available through live chat on the website click on the customer service tab for more information however for the very low annual fee its hard to see how cs could be extended without adding more cost to the end user overall the users average rating is ok please browse through the reviews below or add your own based on your experience overall the service is at a good price customer service is at the bottom of any telecom service i have used so far very happy with it for the price but if you dont have the patience or minimum knowledge to connect it reliably i would recommend something easier with better customer service all user reviews page  of  total number   thumbs up   thumbs down   average rating   more providers  magicjack reviews are listed in

days ago i talked to so many people that could not fix my telephone under volumeheadset controls i tried to explain what was wrong but the individuals i spoke to were unable to understand what i was saying or said they couldnt fix it i am furious at this point i wrote an email to the manager but have not received a reply comment on this review  great serviceuntil you get scam calls    may th   c recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value i love magicjack pro it is a great service for a little bit of money con this is big for some reason magicjack does not support nomorobo it is a service that works magicjack does nothing to help with scam calls if they cant block them through their own service why not allow nomorobo to do it for them come on help us to stop these annoying phone calls even our cable provider offered assistance comment on this review  poor customer service    apr rd   jon recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value i have three magic jacks that i located in three separate properties the first issue i encountered is that each had to have its own email address and had to be associated to a separate computer or laptop my main device started acting up about  months ago i had to pay about  each time to replace the adaptor only two weeks and bad again mj wants to sell me an upgrade instead of replace or allow me to use a device i no longer use but with my home number too inflexible on cleaning any of these issues up want to sell me more when i already have plenty  they just wont let me use it each time it acts up no one can call in and it can be days before you know it goes to vm not recommended to do business with this company until they improve support and attitude toward their customers comment on this review  worst voip ever    mar th   peter recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value they are crooks  they steal your information  their customer service are incompetent  they cheat you on your international minutes please beware comment on this review  magicjack plus static customer service useless    feb th   linda recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value i have been using magicjack then magicjack plus for around  years now the past  months the static on all calls in and out is horrendous you cannot hear almost anything except static wasted hours online with magicjacks customer service quite a few times a bunch of idiots after  hour im always told let me get you to a higherup tech rep so whyd they waste my time for an hour looking to change phone provider right now magicjack is probably the most inexpensive phone service but the aggravation and lost calls and static makes it not worth the savings comment on this review  no problems    nov th   anna recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value i have had mj for a few years and had no problems it is plugged into the wall with a phone by it and an extension phone in another room it works as well as the land line and message recorder it replaced at setup i had to deal with typing and waiting for customer service to answer my questions but i havent had to deal with that since it was set up so that doesnt bother me i did not have trouble with customer service but without voice service i cant give them the best rating if you dont know the least thing about computers or electronics or just dont want to fiddle with it you probably need to search for a service with a person you can actually talk to for the rest you can deal easily enough with mj i like it because it works well sounds good and is economical comment on this review  a happy customer    oct st   tom recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value i have been using magicjack for  years the price of the service is right really right over the years magicjack service has improved in the past there were many ruralarea phone systems which did not accept magicjack calls now it appears that i can use magicjack everywhere when i use it with some people their voice appears to be a little weak with others the volume is fine one thing to note if you have decent wifi service you can call the us from anywhere in the world free i have used my magicjack from france and central america the magicjack support system is a little spartan but eventually they have solved my problems and the price is a real bargain comment on this review  buyer beware    oct st   ed recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value i had to cancel because magicjack does not support nomorobo if you are plagued by telemarketers you must have nomorobo it started the day i started magicjack phone service i quit and went to phone power and literally the same day the calls stopped right after i setup nomorobo so you get what you pay for phone power is about  month versus  for magicjack comment on this review  could be better    aug st   leo recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value i would recommend it for low use landline and not very important phone line they need to work on the cellphone application to integrate it to the current smart phones there is a delay in the connection and if you dont have the app open youll probably miss the call as far as texting the delay is even worse if someone sends you  parts text the shortest text will arrive first regardless of the order it was sent if someone sends an email address the second part xxxxcom never arrives only the first part before the  sign the voice calls are good only if you are in a wifi area with full reception comment on this review   year plan expired results    jul th   robert recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value my  year subscription expired a few months ago  up until that point my magicjack was used only for making long distance calls clarity was as good as calling my next door neighbor and the person on the other end couldnt tell the difference between this service and my land line during my subscription i had no need for customer service other than assigning me a phone number service was straight forward and results were favorable i have been shopping around for mj renewal or a different voip provider as i cant justify my current  centurylink monthly land line fee nor  monthly for a cell phone as i dont use a telephone on a daily basis still shopping from my experience using magicjack i would recommend simple straight forward good results and cheap comment on this review  share this page  of  write a review reviews comparison tool view more providers   disclaimer

does not have to be connected to a computer is this true  response yes that is true the old magicjack device had to be connected to a pc but the newer ones can be connected to a pc or used standalone     posted by gary hart installed magicjack  months ago and have sporadic breaking up of conversations have purchased new cordless phone set with all new handsets and upload bandwith is  kbps which is  times required all connections are secure and snug fitting and device is hooked directly to wireless modem please help  response when it breaks up is it both directions or just  way eg uplink to the other person please run our voip test and let us know the results also ensure nothing else is running on your internet at the time as a test limited bandwidth by the sounds of things which may be causing issues if other devices using your internet at the same time     posted by pat i want to use the magic jack for incoming fax fax is currently on a lan line can i just plug in the magic jack into the router and fax into the magic jack  response you should be able to connect the mj to your fax machine instead of your analog phone and it will receive your fax faxing over the internet is not as reliable as landlines and mj does not officially support this but usually it is successful     posted by marty do i have connect my router and answering machine to the magic jack  response you need to connect the magicjack to your internet could be direct to a modem or through a switch or router magic jack has voicemail and voicemail to email so no need to use your answering machine     posted by marty if i purchase the newest magicjack can i use multiple phones  response yes you can the easiest way is to use cordless phones alternatively connect to your home internal phone wiring and use phones throughout the house you just have to be careful with the landline coming into the house in the second case as it is powered by the old landline provider so really should be disconnected at the side of the house     posted by renee sigley i currently have a magic jack device and the quality is terrible the people on the other end always tell me there is a beeping sound like i am pressing the buttons also they tell me the calls fade in and out so as you can see i am very leary in purchasing another voip service but i can not stand to use this magic jack one more day i am on a limited budget and sometimes it will be days before my phone rings i also dont use it much to make outgoing calls either nut i still want piece of mind in having a land line phone please advise me as to what plan would be best for me also if it ends up being the quality of the magic jack i now have will i be able to return it if i am not satisfied  response try running our voip test to see if there is an issue with your internet connection this may be the issue rather than magicjack so worth trying this before looking at any other provider many providers offer  day cancellation we normally advise running the voip test then choose a provider that has the option to cancel and when you order choose a new phone number test the service and if happy port any existing numbers over this tends to ensure a hasslefree approach     posted by mike h can i get my existing centurytel number transferred to magic jack  response you should be able to there are a few corner cases but it is usually fine to port your number over a word of warning though dont cancel centurytel until the port has been done as otherwise you could lose the number also i would recommend testing the mj service first to make sure you are happy with it before doing the number transfer     posted by dan nielsen i recently signed up with magicjack and am totally satisfied with their service and support setup may be complicated for some but their online support will talk you through any problems you encounter my son who recommended magicjack to me has been using them for  years with no problems     posted by robert thomas ive had both magic jack and the plus version the regular one was not dependable but when they came out with mj plus i got it and cant tell the difference from verizon i bought the  year plan after seeing how good it was feeling like i was stealing it for  that was about  months of phone service with verizon if i didnt make long distance calls when my  years are up ill renew it even though ive got viber on my cell phone  pc and skype on my pc     posted by george a i have had magic jack for years and want to renew my service for  however i have been having some major problems with this service about  to  of the time when there is an incoming phone call they can hear us but we cannot hear them please let me know how this can be fixed before i sign up again  response george

evaluate different voip equipment options some basic items to consider are listed as follows how many new ip phones do you need and what will the upfront cost be are ethernet ports available in every office do you need to upgrade any network switches to support ip phones and voip the good news is that your service provider will be able to help answer some of these questions with you the bad news is that you need to research and confirm that the equipment that is being recommended is right for your business as well as pricing step  decide if you need new ip phones if you are considering changing your phone service provider and your business is already using a hosted voip solution or an onpremise voip phone system then there is a good chance that you do not need to purchase new phones however it is critical that you confirm phone compatibility with the new service provider that you are considering switching to or it could be a costly mistake if your business is switching to hosted voip or an onpremise ip enabled phone system then you will need to either purchase or rent ip phones that support the call control protocols used by the phone service provider you choose often you can purchase equipment directly from the service provider at a good price keep an eye out for providers that offer free phones or  for the price of  deals this can save you on up front costs and make the switch more viable financially visit our ip phones section for extensive information on makes and models like cisco polycom and yealink plus reviews and more even the most basic ip phones have a good

productivity benefits of ip phones this may not work out a good choice in the long run compare popular phone adaptors atas  ethernet cabling average price range varies purchasing and installing cate ethernet cable can be expensive depending on the size of the installation most offices will already have this cabling installed but it is definitely worth checking to avoid a costly surprise uninterruptible power supply ups average price range varies network equipment should already be connected to a ups to avoid issues during power outages if no ups currently exists then it is recommended that a ups is installed to ensure that phones and service keep working during a power outage onpremise system if you are seeking an onpremise system then it is likely that you will need to perform a very thorough evaluation of your existing network most service providers can help with this and advise on any recommendations step  the bottom line although additional equipment is often required to be purchased when upgrading to a voip solution the overall benefits typically far outweigh this cost businesses should evaluate the annual cost savings that such a solution can offer while considering any up front equipment expenses in most cases the overall cost savings and productivity increases that voip provides will easily justify any potential equipment upgrades for businesses
