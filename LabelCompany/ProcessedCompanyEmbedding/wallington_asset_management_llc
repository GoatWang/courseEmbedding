on investements philosophy our ultimate objective in using a systematic and disciplined investment process is to capture the financial goals unique to each client wallington asset management believes in an active approach to investment management with an emphasis on quality and effective diversification a systematic and disciplined investment process is utilized as we strive to achieve over the longterm a total return that exceeds a client’s benchmark return based upon popular stock and bond indexes commensurate with this return objective is the assumption of a reasonable and conservative risk posture through investments in highquality common stocks fixed income securities andor money market instruments while a prescribed set of guidelines determined by the clients investment policy governs the allocation of investment funds to the various asset classes these allocations may be adjusted over time due to fluctuations in individual asset values or when our analysis indicates a fundamental imbalance in the riskreturn spectrum photo scalini what is a fixed income philopsopy for high quality bonds and conservative maturity structures philosophy fixed income the defining characteristics of wallington asset management’s fixed income philosophy are the use of high quality bonds and conservative maturity structures wallington asset management utilizes a four phase approach in the management of fixed income portfolios first a fixed income strategy is designed to meet each client’s longterm investment objectives this is more difficult than generally believed each client’s liquidity needs tax considerations and time horizon constraints are entwined with the investment objective defined for the portfolio objectives may include any goal in the spectrum from stability of principal and income to the maximization of longterm nominal returns once these objectives have been defined wallington asset management will then establish a duration range to manage the sensitivity of each client’s bond portfolio value to changes in interest rates since most research evidence indicates that a conservative bond maturity structure allows for the capture of most of the returns offered in longerdated maturities while incurring proportionately less interest rate risk our preference is to focus on the intermediate term maturities the third phase of our fixed income management employs the use of prudent portfolio strategies on an ongoing basis these strategies are drawn from macroeconomic analysis as well as yield curve and fundamental credit analysis our tactics may take the form of composite duration and convexity adjustment shifts to undervalued sectors and individual bond swaps we seek to reap the rewards of credit upgrades and to avoid the risk of credit downgrades finally we continually monitor the performance of each holding as well as that holding’s contribution to the total interest rate risk of the fixed income portfolio we believe this fourth step is crucial as we strive to maximize returns within a predetermined level of risk photo scalini financial services for personal trusts and institutions constructing equity portfolios with value and growth stocks philosophy common stock the distinguishing characteristic of wallington asset management’s equity philosophy is the employment of both value and growth stocks in constructing equity portfolios wallington asset management employs both value and growth stock philosophies in the construction and management of equity portfolios this blended investment philosophy toward common stocks originates from the ongoing debate between value and growth stock adherents and the inordinate amount of risk incurred when either value or growth selection is used exclusively we believe that simultaneous investment in both value and growth stocks results in enhanced performance and serves to reduce the risk of underperformance associated with a stock portfolio exposed solely to the characteristics of either growth stocks or value stocks our strategy is to select stocks of companies in those instances where we believe the market is underestimating the total return potential from holding such a security conversely we eliminate those securities we believe are priced at a level reflecting unrealistic expectations each client’s equity portfolio maintains diversification but not in strict accordance with the sector weights reflected in the popular indexes it is our ultimate objective to preserve capital and to outperform the market on a riskadjusted basis over the longterm utilizing the sp  stock index as the benchmark portfolio against which performance will be measured photo scalini create a well defined investment policy to reach long term financial goals for retirement philosophy formulation each investment portfolio whether for the individual or the institutional investor requires a welldefined investment policy to successfully fulfill financial goals over the longterm as independent investment professionals we are available to work closely with our clients and their advisors to establish a suitable investment policy in this process items such as risk expected rates of return cash flow requirements and time horizons are discussed to formulate guidelines by which each investment portfolio will be managed specifically it is this phase of the investment management process which dictates the general allocation of investment funds to the various asset classes ie equities fixed income and cash consequently these guidelines serve as a benchmark to realistically evaluate future investment performance photo scalini business directory of indiana wallington asset management llc  business directoryinformation on every company and

a garp equity investment approach that is based on both value and growth investment strategies the firm believes that simultaneous investment in value and growth stocks results in enhanced performance

producer manufacturing consumer nondurables electronic technology and technology services sectors wallington also invests in europe the middle east and asia the firm maintains a very low turnover ratewallington manages fixedincome portfolios using a fourphase approach first a fixedincome strategy is designed to meet each clients longterm objectives then establish a duration range to manage the sensitivity of each clients bond portfolio value to changes in interest rates wallington prefers to focus on intermediateterm maturities the third phase of the firms fixedincome management strategy employs the use of prudent portfolio strategies on an ongoing basis these strategies are drawn from macroeconomic analysis and from yield curve and fundamental credit analysis wallingtons strategies may take the form of composite duration and convexity adjustment shifts to undervalued sectors and individual bond swaps they seek the rewards of credit upgrades while avoiding the risk of credit downgrades finally wallington continually monitors the performance of each holding as well as that holdings contribution to the total interest rate risk of the fixedincome portfolio website
