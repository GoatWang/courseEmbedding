network of more than  suppliers in  countries to bring the finest seafood from around the world to america’s table through many of the country’s retailers distributors and chain restaurants as one of the largest importers distributors and manufacturers of wholesome nutritious and sustainable food from the ocean slade gorton goes to every length to ensure customers consistent availability and product integrity building on a multigenerational commitment to feeding america thomas slade gorton jr established slade gorton in  having spent his teenage years as a fisherman’s apprentice harvesting all the best the great banks off newfoundland had to offer even then the gorton family’s history in the seafood industry stretched back three generations to  and today slade gorton builds off of a fivegeneration legacy in the seafood industry investing in old trades and new technologies slade gorton maintains headquarters and a manufacturing plant in boston with additional sales offices in ft lauderdale fla elgin ill and los angeles calif it also operates additional manufacturing plants in ft lauderdale and in sparks reno nev to extend distribution from coast to coast complete commitment slade gorton offers a product selection spanning some  species of seafood – high volume highly demanded products complemented by regional and seasonal specialties – and a team of more than  associates the company continually invests its efforts to drive inefficiency out of the supply chain lower costs improve operating margins and ensure the highest levels of service for its customers it works simultaneously to pursue innovation in product development traceability food safety and advance the industry’s best practices across a wide array of disciplines most importantly however is an underlying belief that slade gorton’s greatest responsibility and challenge is to continually adapt to changing consumer trends customer requirements and global supply and demand dynamics “everything we do – from product development sourcing distribution manufacturing packaging and marketing – is done with the consumer experience in mind” expands kim gorton president and ceo of slade gorton “we actually work backward from that consumer experience to design our supply chain and all of our programs in order to address not only what the consumer wants but what our clients need to ensure our products contribute to an enjoyable dining experience” slade gorton supplies its superior quality seafood and support services to foodservice distributors and wholesalers as well as

make the most of each season’s harvest as well as keep the company’s offerings fresh and ontrend advancing an industry throughout its operations the company keeps focused on the sustainability of its seafood products not just because of increasing consumer awareness but also out of an ingrained respect for the earth’s resources slade gorton commits to ensuring its network of loyal seafood suppliers continually work to pursue and adopt industry best practices whether through aquaculture methods responsible harvesting or investing in greater traceability the company furthermore refuses to source any product from a farm or fishery with illegal unreported and unregulated iuu fishing practices of any kind in order to leverage its considerable purchasing power to encourage suppliers to pursue credible documented improvements “we recognize that we are a part of something much bigger” expands gorton “it might be because we are also a familyowned company but we believe that we not only help fulfill a basic lifesustaining human need but that it is our responsibility to ensure we provide something wholesome nutritious and sustainable” similarly slade gorton aims to stay well ahead of the curve when it comes to food safety it significantly increased its investments in food safety roughly five years ago by gorton’s account because the company sees food safety as equally important to the quality of the final product the safe quality food institute certified slade gorton’s manufacturing plants according to its level iii standards the institute’s highest distinction making slade gorton one of only a handful of seafood companies in the us to achieve such certification certification requires a rigorous annual audit to ensure each certified party adheres to certain practices that ensure the product’s safety integrity authenticity traceability and overall quality ecoconscious seafood slade gorton is committed to providing its customers with the finest catch through both their wildcaught offerings and through strategic sustainable farming partnerships in  slade gorton partnered with wf gray another storied familyowned company operating one of north america’s largest and oldest salmon hatcheries and more recently marine farming sites in newfoundland together the pair has brought to market what they believe is the highest quality most sustainably oceanraised and allnatural farmed atlantic salmon in the world using a proprietary allnatural feed for the fish that enhances the gorgeous orangepink color of the salmon flesh without the need for any artificial colorings antibiotics or growth hormones whatsoever “our partnership is all about how we can go about producing a naturally healthy delicious and sustainable product that consumers will enjoy” asserts gorton “the wf gray family shares our core values and a commitment to bringing wholesome and delicious seafood to the market” on top of its investments in innovation food safety and strategic partnerships the company doubled down on its efforts to ensure continuous improvement toward a fully sustainable supply chain by partnering with sustainable fisheries partnership sfp in  it also secured certification through the best aquaculture practices program for two of its manufacturing and processing plants in  the company’s boston and ft lauderdale facilities can handle or process catfish tilapia and salmon and the boston facility is certified to process pangasius a genus of mildflavored whiteflesh fish the company also achieved certification as a women’s business enterprise in  through the women’s business enterprise national council meanwhile the slade gorton team introduced thermafresh packaging across its manufacturing and fresh supply operations as a biodegradable recyclable and lighter alternative to traditional styrofoam packaging as an added bonus the thermafresh products offers leakproof air transportapproved containers that are guaranteed to preserve freshness at  degrees fahrenheit for up to  hours raising the bar next up for the slade gorton team will be expanding the product line once again as of  the final details were being laid out for the new seafood made simple brand of consumerfriendly products the products are developed and packaged to help consumers prepare healthy wholesome delicious seafood meals ensuring a more consistently enjoyable seafood dining experience at home “until recently vacuum packaging technology had not advanced to a point where the food and drug administration allowed fresh seafood to be vacuum packaged” expands gorton “we now have the technology to safely vacuum package our fresh products which has allowed us to get creative with the packaging and really highlight the fish itself” whether through investments in sustainability and food safety pioneering packaging or new innovative seafood products slade gorton has found the seafood industry holds a wealth of opportunities to explore in the
