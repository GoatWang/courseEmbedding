reports fixed income mortgage and assetbacked securities investments  fixed income mortgage and assetbacked securities skip to select a section most fixed income securities provide you with periodic interest payments over the stated term of the security and repay the principal in full at maturity most mortgage and assetbacked securities however make both principal and interest payments monthly quarterly or semiannually over the life of the security interest payments are fully taxable principal payments are not most mortgagebacked securities are driven by the principal and interest payments on home mortgages for example a governmentsponsored enterprise that provides housing loans such as fannie mae will issue a mortgagebacked security to generate capital for lending the bondholders later receive their interest and principal in the form of monthly payments as the mortgages that the funds were used to finance are paid off since homeowners have the right to pay off their mortgages at any time these monthly payments may include additional payments of principal known as prepayments generally when interest rates decline prepayments accelerate beyond the initial pricing assumptions which could cause the average life and expected maturity of the securities to shorten conversely when interest rates rise prepayments slow down beyond the initial pricing assumptions and could cause the average life and expected maturity of the securities to extend and the market value to decline when prepayments accelerate due to falling interest rates principal may have to be reinvested at a lower interest rate than the coupon of the security similarly many assetbacked securities are driven by consumer and home equity loans for this reason assetbacked securities structures always contain some form of credit enhancement to bring the credit quality to the desired level in exchange for the cash flow uncertainty caused by prepayments mortgage and assetbacked securities afford you relative safety provided you hold them to maturity liquidity and superior yields relative to comparable bonds most mortgage and assetbacked securities are available in small denominations making them a good
