journal  voyager’s mission is to develop and deliver lifechanging therapies to people around the world affected by severe neurological diseases this begins with a commitment to discovery research development and manufacturing and extends to our engagement with patients healthcare providers caregivers and advocacy organizations researchers are investigating gene therapy as a way to treat disease at its source by delivering new instructions or genes into cells affected by parkinson’s disease one approach that has emerged as highly promising over the last decade is to use an adenoassociated virus aav as a vector that is naturally able to transfer genes into cells and not known to cause illness the vector is like an envelope that carries a message or in this case a gene to specific brain cells once the gene has been transferred inside the cell it is then read by the cell the brain cells then use their normal machinery to produce the gene product with the goal of restoring typical function it is believed that this kind of therapy could potentially be delivered in a single dose and be a longlasting or even lifelong treatment aav vectors have previously been safely used in clinical trials for investigational gene therapy products voyager is headquartered in cambridge massachusetts company history product pipeline gene therapy product pipeline developing
