entrepreneurship your money market watch market watch investors love loans to deadbeats by floyd norris published august   carl h westcott is a car dealer who is now rich that is due in part to his decision to start a new business a couple of years ago but mostly it is because wall street has fallen in love with mr westcotts dream and made it into a hot stock this story is not as you might expect about technology it is not about some clever software or a new design in semiconductors mr westcotts idea was far more prosaic his company lends money to usedcar buyers with bad credit not people who have missed a payment or two in the past but people who have defaulted on loans including bankrupts these are people whose ability and willingness to repay are dubious how does one make money lending to such people the way was shown by a company named the credit acceptance corporation which went public back in  first you charge very high interest rates say  percent then you pay the dealer only part of the amount borrowed usually half the dealer will get more money only if his customers as a group make enough payments to let you make a profit there is a lot of room in there for defaults and for borrowers who skip town credit acceptance makes decent money although it has received some bad publicity with complaints about high interest rates unsurprisingly dealers that arrange such financing often charge high prices for their cars so that even if they only get half the money they will still show a profit wall street thinks there is a lot of room for growth credit acceptance now trades for about  times its initial offering price in  and for about  times its earnings it was a year after credit acceptance went public that mr westcott decided to imitate the idea in the last two years his company jayhawk acceptance has proven it can lend money lots of used car dealers have signed up although jayhawk has decided that it is unwilling to do business with about  percent of them but almost all the lending has been done in recent months and the financial statements shed little light on whether the money will be repaid what is clear is that a lot of the borrowers quickly fall behind it looks as if at least a third of the loans more than six months old are at least four months behind in making payments one might think investors would want to wait to see how the repayments go before committing funds but this is a hot concept and those who wait may miss out when jayhawk filed to go public it hoped to sell shares at  to  each last week underwriters led by montgomery securities sold the offering at  or more than  percent more than the company was willing to take but that was not enough to satisfy demand and the shares ended the week at  a  percent gain when mr westcott started the business he invested  for  million shares now those shares are worth  million not bad for a business whose total revenues in its short life are about  million that amazing performance shows how the  stock market focuses on upside possibilities with the biggest risk deemed to be missing a great bull market it also is a reminder that whatever the federal reserve may do about the cost of credit money is available here wall street is falling all over itself to finance a company that lends to deadbeats there the banks are confident that despite its history of problems westinghouse electric can borrow  billion  more than the total value of its stock  so that it can buy a television network speculation is flourishing graph showing jayhawk acceptances daily closing
