the basin and grate is functional dont see your question here where can tempo products be purchased tempo products are sold through qualified plumbing and irrigation supply houses contact your local supply house or if you are having difficulty finding our products please contact us directly and we will make sure you find a distributor of ours back to top what is the warranty on tempo products the standard warranty on all tempo products is one year from date of purchase back to top where are tempos products manufactured tempo is proud to manufacture virtually all of its products in the usa back to top what do the products cost list prices are available in our price list however every distributor is free to set their own selling price back to top what colors are the basins and grates available in all basins are black as they are generally buried and not visible grates are typically available in black green sand and grey the  round flat grate is alao available in purple for reclaimed water applications check price list for details back to top can i order products in a different color than what is shown in the catalog we are happy to address your specific needs however keep in mind that there may be minimum order quantities required for special custom colors back to top are tempo products compatible with other drainage products currently in the market all tempo products are designed to fit standard pipe and fittings and hence are interchangeable with the most popular competitive products on the market when used as a retrofit back to top what materials are the products made from tempo is committed to being a green company and has engineered its products and manufacturing processes to be able to utilize first quality recycled plastics while still providing outstanding quality products designed for long life back to top what are the benefits of a drainage system excess water as a result of heavy rains or overirrigation can cause substantial damage to both property and plants standing water is also a breeding area for mosquitoes a well designed drainage system will allow this excess water to be quickly removed from critical areas to storm water sewers street curbs or other areas where it may leach into the soil without causing damage back to top can the drainage runoff water be collected and put to later use all runoff water may be collected in rain tanks or any other suitable storage system for future use back to top are drainage systems appropriate for both residential and commercial applications drainage systems are appropriate for both residential and commercial properties in areas where potential flooding may be expected there are very few areas in the usa where homes would not benefit from the protection of a drainage system the same applies to most commercial properties golf courses medians sports fields etc back to top can i get help designing my own drainage system designing a small residential system is relatively simple our drainage design guide will take you through a stepbystep process to simple drainage design for larger more sophisticated systems using a qualified drainage consultant or engineer is recommended back to top what if the topography of the area to be drained doesn’t allow for the minimum slope to be met if the natural topography of the area to be drained does not have the necessary fall to meet the minimum slope requirements you will need to dig a trench with the minimum slope required and then use a combination of low profile basins and catch basins some of which will have one or multiple risers to make sure that grates end up at grade level back to top can a drainage system be installed by a homeowner drainage systems are relatively easy to install however the drainage pipe must be buried and trenches need to be dug and then eventually backfilled the homeowner should evaluate their ability to design their own system and then whether they are able and willing to excavate the trenches before deciding whether to do it themselves or to use a qualified drainage contractor our drainage installation guide takes you through a stepbystep process to simple drainage installation back to top does a drainage system need to be installed before landscaping is completed drainage systems because of the need for buried drainage pipes are most easily installed at the same time the landscape and irrigation system is installed however it may also be added later back to top can an existing downspout from my roof tie into a drainage system this is an ideal application for your drainage system water from the downspout can be collected in a catch basin as it exits and then be ported through the drainage system to a suitable location like the storm water sewer or street curb back to top what happens if there are no stormwater sewers or street curbs available to discharge water there are methods of retaining stormwater on site the most common way of achieving this is to direct the excess water to a french drain french drains are created by excavating large holes and filling them with small rocks the water then percolates from this drain into the surrounding soil back to top will the system rust most of the components of the system are plastic so rust will not be an issue we also have grates made of brass which also do not rust back to top what special tools are needed to install a drainage system besides a trencher or shovel to excavate the trenches installing a drainage system does not require specialized tools or equipment everyday items like saws to cut the pipe levels to evaluate the slope etc are required a utility knife or small chisel may be used to remove the optional cutout on the bottom of the square catch basins a  hole saw may be used to remove the optional drain holes at the bottom of the square catch basins back to top do basins need to be encased in concrete in most cases basins are encased in the surrounding soil which needs to be well compacted however when the grate and basin may be exposed to high traffic and load encasing in concrete is recommended back to top are the basins and grates very heavy basin and grate weights are shown on the price list but as they are made of plastic they are relatively light and easy to carry back to top are there special techniques to cutting the drainage pipe pipe cutters or a saw should be used to cut the pipe a sharp utility knife can be used for corrugated pipe make sure the cut is clean and square back to top how are the grates attached directly to the drainage pipe all  through  grates attach directly to drainage pipe each grate has  stepped diameters with each diameter matching the internal diameter of commonly used drainage pipe the leadin diameter fits triple wall pipe the next diameter fits sewer and drain pipe and corrugated pipe while the last diameter generated by the tabs fits sewer and drain hub fittings the pipe or fittings are simply press fitted and should not be solvent welded for best results make sure the pipe is cut clean and square sometimes the manufacturing tolerances on corrugated pipe are fairly large so the fit may not always be perfect to resolve this try pushing the corrugated pipe onto the next diameter formed by the tabs or secure with duct tape back to top at what height should the basin and grate be installed grates are typically installed  below the surrounding grade level so position the basin accordingly back to top what size basins are available basins are available from  through  and have capacities ranging from  gallons through  gallons back to top how is the pipe attached to the basins a basin to  or  pipe adapter part number aba easily clips into the square catch basin outlets to accept  or  pipe we also have a basin to  pipe adapter part number aba which clips into the square catch basin outlets to accept  pipe the round catch basins have built in outlets on to which  or  pipe can easily be attached back to top what size pipe can be used with square basins the basin to  or  pipe adapter aba accepts all  and  pipe commonly used with drainage systems the basin to  pipe adapter aba accepts all  pipe commonly used with drainage systems back to top what type of pipe should be used with basins corrugated pipe sewer and drain pipe and triple wall pipe can be used corrugated pipe is the easiest to install but the more rigid sewer and drain or triple wall pipe may offer improved results back to top when should a riser be used a riser should be used when the depth of the trench is too deep and using a catch basin by itself would result in the top of the basin sitting below grade for ” or ” basins an abr or abr may need to be stacked on the basin to bring the grate up to the ground surface for ” round basins a length of pvc pipe may be cut to the desired length to bring the grate after being installed to grade level the grate may be attached directly to the top of the pipe but for a better fit use a ” pvc coupler between the grate and pipe back to top can i use multiple risers together to achieve the correct height of the basin and grate yes the risers were designed to nest together to achieve the correct height back to top how much does a riser increase the height of the basin and grate a riser increases the height of the installed grate by approximately  inches back to top can the  round basin height be extended the  round basin accepts  astm d and astm d sdr pvc sewer and drain pipe as a riser cut the pipe to the desired height and push into top of basin finally position the  round grate directly on to the top of the pipe or use a  coupling in between the grate and pipe for a better fit back to top when should a catch basin be used a catch basin is basically a settling tank so that debris and sediment can sink to the bottom of the sump of the basin and not enter and potentially plug the drainage pipe if you are concerned that this may occur then a catch basin is recommended back to top when should a low profile basin be used a low profile basin should be used when the depth of the trench is too shallow and using a regular ” or ” catch basin would result in the grate being above grade in this situation a low profile basin bslp or bslp needs to be used instead back to top what does sump capacity mean the sump is the bottom section of the basin below the outlet the volume of this section is known as the sump capacity and is usually measured in gallons back to top can basins be used in series basins are often used in series but keep in mind that water only flows downhill so each basin must be slightly lower than the previous one back to top is any glue or adhesive necessary when installing a basin no glue or adhesive is needed to attach the grate plug or adapter to the basin back to top can drain pipe exit from bottom of basin at the bottom of the   and  basin is a potential outlet that can be cut out along the marked template most people use a utility knife to do this and care should be taken while cutting once this cut out is removed use a basin to  or  pipe adapter part number aba or a basin to  pipe adapter part number aba to connect to the drainage pipe back to top how are unused outlets plugged a basin plug part number abp easily clips into any unused outlet on square catch basins the round catch basins can not be plugged however there are two round catch basin versions  outlet and  outlets available so select the model with the correct number of outlets back to top which grates do the basins use the  round basin accepts both the  round flat and  round atrium style grates the  square basin accepts the  square flat and  square atrium style grate the  square basin accepts the  square flat and  square atrium style grate lastly the  square basin accepts the  square flat grate back to top should the grate be screwed on to the basin screwing the grates on to the basin is recommended to prevent theft or vandalism a basin without the grate is also a safety hazard use   long stainless steel phillips flathead screws back to top when should the ” square universal grate be used the primary application for the ” square universal grate is for tiled or paved areas where a square grate is easier to install than a round grate also the ” square universal grate may be preferable when you want to attach directly to ” or ” pipe and you have higher flow rates than a ” or ” grate will allow the square universal grate is very versatile and also connects directly to ” and ” sewer and drain corrugated and triple wall pipe ” ” and ” sewer and drain hub fittings and the ” round catch basins back to top when should brass grates be used the most typical application for the brass grates is in high visibility areas eg walkways sidewalks or pool areas the brass grates are attached to a pvc collar which should be permanently glued on to a pvc pipe or hub fitting back to top where do you use a popup relief valve the popup relief valve emitter is used at the end of the drainage pipe to discharge water to an appropriate location it is often placed close to the street so that water flows over the curb to the street without the need for core drilling the curb back to top can you walk on the grates the flat grates are designed for light traffic while the atrium grates are not specific load ratings are shown in the specifications tab of the product pages on our website specification sheets can also be downloaded on each respective product page the  through  grates are designed for pedestrian traffic while the  through  grates can withstand autos and light trucks in addition the grates have a textured surface to minimize the risk of slippage back to top what maintenance will my system need periodic cleaning out of the catch basin if used is recommended to prevent sediment and small debris from getting into the drainage pipes and plugging the system back to top can water in sump be drained there are  small round perforations at the bottom of the square catch basins that may be removed if desired this will allow standing water to drain into the soil below the basin to create these holes along the perforations use a  hole saw back to top how long will the basins and grates last provided the load ratings are adhered to the grates should last for years slight discoloration due to sun exposure is to be expected back to top how do i test to see if the basin and grate is functional the easiest way to check is to use a hose to run water onto the grate and make sure that the water is being rerouted to the planned discharge point back to top dont see your question here please contact us for more information were happy to help back to top about
