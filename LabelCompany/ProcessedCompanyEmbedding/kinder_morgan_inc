brief summary of kinder morgan trans mountain pipeline system see wikipediasummary style for information on how to properly incorporate it into this articles main text main article kinder morgan trans mountain pipeline system in  kinder morgan filed its application to the canadian national energy board neb for building a second pipeline roughly parallel to the existing trans mountain for transporting diluted bitumen between edmonton alberta and burnaby east of vancouver bc the new pipeline would nearly triple the transportation capacity from  to  barrels per day for an estimated investment of  billion this expansion would enable the export of larger volumes of albertas bituminous sands oil to the us and to asian countries kinder morgan had the support of several large petroleum industry customers for this expansion bp canada energy trading co canadian natural resources canadian oil sands ltd cenovus energy inc devon canada corp husky energy marketing inc imperial oil ltd nexen marketing inc statoil canada ltd suncor energy marketing inc suncor energy products partnership tesoro refining  marketing co and total ep canada ltdcitation needed this project is controversial as are similar pipeline projects like northern gateway from alberta to kitimat bc keystone xl to the us south and line  enbridges project from sarnia to montreal all of which expand the transportation capacity of heavy crude to refineries or loading ports for export to the us or overseas the expansion project faced strong opposition from civic governments first nations environmentally concerned citizens and others protests in november  focused on kinder morgans surveying work members of the squamish and tsleilwaututh first nations of british columbia canada paddled canoes on the waters of burrard inlet to the kinder morgan burnaby terminal for a ceremony to protest the expansion of the trans mountain pipeline in north vancouver bc on september   tsleilwaututh leaders hoped to shut down the project altogether the existing and proposed pipelines ship diluted bitumen through the strait of juan de fuca an extremely sensitive environmental region the tankers have to pass through a very narrow channel of shallow water to reach the open sea making the project controversial and strongly opposed by some canadians  and americans for reasons similar to the opposition to keystone xl line  and northern gateway and offshore deep ocean oil drilling in  bc said that it did not support trans mountain partly because kinder morgan has not provided enough information about its proposed spill prevention program northeast energy direct pipelineedit this highpressure inch gas transmission pipeline proposed in  was slated to pass from wright new york to dracut massachusetts to “help alleviate new england’s uniquely high natural gas and electricity costs caused by severely limited natural gas transportation capacity currently serving the region” however the project faced stiff opposition from a coalition of antifracking activists pipeline safety advocates who raised questions about the proximity of a highpressure pipeline to their homes sustainableenergy advocates property owners who objected to having land seized by eminent domain and environmentalists hoping to preserve wetlands and oldgrowth forests legislators and elected officials responded to voters concerns on april   kinder morgan suspended its effort to build the mile ned pipeline citing economic difficulties and lack of distribution commitments or customers for the gas palmetto pipelineedit likewise kinder morgans proposed palmetto pipeline designed to go from the gulf coast to the southeast markets was nixed its path would have taken it through  miles of eastern and coastal georgia and drew opposition from local residents and environmental groups the company suspended work on the project after the georgia state legislature passed a temporary moratorium on the use of eminent domain for pipeline construction and commissioned a study to review the project the company filed an appeal connecticut expansion projectedit kinder morgan proposed a mile long inch diameter highpressure natural gas storage loop which would include a mile pipeline spur through sandisfield massachusetts crossing the otis state forest and using water from spectacle pond the company invoked the us natural gas act to have the needed land condemned so they could seize it by eminent domain however the commonwealth of massachusetts challenged kinder morgan in court

concern to anyone who lived or worked near a kinder morgan pipeline the wall street journal asked is kinder morgan scrimping on its pipelines after an investment analyst charged the company with

pipeline system see wikipediasummary style for information on how to properly incorporate it into this articles main text main article kinder morgan trans mountain pipeline system in  kinder morgan filed its application to the canadian national energy board neb for building a second pipeline roughly parallel to the existing trans mountain for transporting diluted bitumen between edmonton alberta and burnaby east of vancouver bc the new pipeline would nearly triple the transportation capacity from  to  barrels per day for an estimated investment of  billion this expansion would enable the export of larger volumes of albertas bituminous sands oil to the us and to asian countries kinder morgan had the support of several large petroleum industry customers for this expansion bp canada energy trading co canadian natural resources canadian oil sands ltd cenovus energy inc devon canada corp husky energy marketing inc imperial oil ltd nexen marketing inc statoil canada ltd suncor energy marketing inc suncor energy products partnership tesoro refining  marketing co and total ep canada ltdcitation needed this project is controversial as are similar pipeline projects like northern gateway from alberta to kitimat bc keystone xl to the us south and line  enbridges project from sarnia to montreal all of which expand the transportation capacity of heavy crude to refineries or loading ports for export to the us or overseas the expansion project faced strong opposition from civic governments first nations environmentally concerned citizens and others protests in november

terminal for a ceremony to protest the expansion of the trans mountain pipeline in north vancouver bc on september   tsleilwaututh leaders hoped to shut down the project altogether the existing and proposed pipelines ship diluted bitumen through the strait of juan de fuca an extremely sensitive environmental region the tankers have to pass through a very narrow channel of shallow water to reach the open sea making the project controversial and strongly opposed by some canadians  and americans for reasons similar to the opposition to keystone xl line  and northern gateway and offshore deep

direct pipelineedit this highpressure inch gas transmission pipeline proposed in  was slated to pass from wright new york to dracut massachusetts to “help alleviate new england’s uniquely high natural gas and electricity costs caused by severely limited natural gas transportation capacity currently serving the region” however the project faced stiff opposition from a coalition of antifracking

review the project the company filed an appeal connecticut expansion projectedit kinder morgan proposed a mile long inch diameter highpressure natural gas storage loop which would include a mile pipeline spur through sandisfield massachusetts crossing the otis state forest and using water from spectacle pond the company invoked the us natural gas act to have the needed land condemned so they could seize it by eminent domain however the commonwealth of massachusetts challenged kinder morgan in court arguing that the state constitutions article  which protects designated conservation land

pipeline system see wikipediasummary style for information on how to properly incorporate it into this articles main text main article kinder morgan trans mountain pipeline system in  kinder morgan filed its application to the canadian national energy board neb for building a second pipeline roughly parallel to the existing trans mountain for transporting diluted bitumen between edmonton alberta and burnaby east of vancouver bc the new pipeline would nearly triple the transportation capacity from  to  barrels per day for an estimated investment of  billion this expansion would enable the export of larger volumes of albertas bituminous sands oil to the us and to asian countries kinder morgan had the support of several large petroleum industry customers for this expansion bp canada energy trading co canadian natural resources canadian oil sands ltd cenovus energy inc devon canada corp husky energy marketing inc imperial oil ltd nexen marketing inc statoil canada ltd suncor energy marketing inc suncor energy products partnership tesoro refining  marketing co and total ep canada ltdcitation needed this project is controversial as are similar pipeline projects like northern gateway from alberta to kitimat bc keystone xl to the us south and line  enbridges project from sarnia to montreal all of which expand the transportation capacity of heavy crude to refineries or loading ports for export to the us or overseas the expansion project faced strong opposition from civic governments first nations environmentally concerned citizens and others protests in november

terminal for a ceremony to protest the expansion of the trans mountain pipeline in north vancouver bc on september   tsleilwaututh leaders hoped to shut down the project altogether the existing and proposed pipelines ship diluted bitumen through the strait of juan de fuca an extremely sensitive environmental region the tankers have to pass through a very narrow channel of shallow water to reach the open sea making the project controversial and strongly opposed by some canadians  and americans for reasons similar to the opposition to keystone xl line  and northern gateway and offshore deep ocean oil drilling in  bc said that it did not support trans mountain partly because kinder morgan has not provided enough information about its proposed spill prevention program northeast energy direct pipelineedit this highpressure inch gas transmission pipeline proposed in  was slated to pass from wright new york to dracut massachusetts to “help alleviate new england’s uniquely high natural gas and electricity costs caused by severely limited natural gas transportation capacity currently serving the region” however the project faced stiff opposition from a coalition of antifracking activists pipeline safety advocates who raised questions about the proximity of a highpressure pipeline to their homes sustainableenergy advocates property owners who objected to having land seized by

build the mile ned pipeline citing economic difficulties and lack of distribution commitments or customers for the gas palmetto pipelineedit likewise kinder morgans proposed palmetto pipeline designed to go from the gulf coast to the southeast markets was nixed its path would have taken it through  miles of eastern and coastal georgia and drew opposition from local residents and environmental

review the project the company filed an appeal connecticut expansion projectedit kinder morgan proposed a mile long inch diameter highpressure natural gas storage loop which would include a mile pipeline spur through sandisfield massachusetts crossing the otis state forest and using water from spectacle pond the company invoked the us natural gas act to have the needed land condemned so they could seize it by eminent domain however the commonwealth of massachusetts challenged kinder morgan in court arguing that the state constitutions article  which protects designated conservation land

needed this project is controversial as are similar pipeline projects like northern gateway from alberta to kitimat bc keystone xl to the us south and line  enbridges project from sarnia to montreal all of which expand the transportation capacity of heavy crude to refineries or loading ports for export to the us or overseas the expansion project faced strong opposition from civic governments

canada paddled canoes on the waters of burrard inlet to the kinder morgan burnaby terminal for a ceremony to protest the expansion of the trans mountain pipeline in north vancouver bc on september   tsleilwaututh leaders hoped to shut down the project altogether the existing and proposed pipelines ship diluted bitumen through the strait of juan de fuca an extremely sensitive environmental region the tankers have to pass through a very narrow channel of shallow water to reach the open sea making the project controversial and strongly opposed by some canadians  and americans for reasons similar to the opposition to keystone xl line  and northern gateway and offshore deep ocean oil drilling in  bc said that it did not support trans mountain partly because kinder morgan has not provided enough information about its proposed spill prevention program northeast energy direct pipelineedit this highpressure inch gas transmission pipeline proposed in  was slated to pass from wright new york to dracut massachusetts to “help alleviate new england’s uniquely high natural gas and electricity costs caused by severely limited natural gas transportation capacity currently serving the region”

mile long inch diameter highpressure natural gas storage loop which would include a mile pipeline spur through sandisfield massachusetts crossing the otis state forest and using water from spectacle pond the company invoked the us natural gas act to have the needed land condemned so they could seize it by eminent domain however the commonwealth of massachusetts challenged kinder morgan in court

this section should include only a brief summary of kinder morgan trans mountain pipeline system see wikipediasummary style for information on how to properly incorporate it into this articles main text main article kinder morgan trans mountain pipeline system in  kinder morgan filed its application to the canadian national energy board neb for building a second pipeline roughly parallel to the existing trans mountain for transporting diluted bitumen between edmonton alberta and burnaby east of vancouver bc the new pipeline would nearly triple the transportation capacity from  to  barrels per day for an estimated investment of  billion this expansion would enable the export of larger volumes of albertas bituminous sands oil to the us and to asian countries kinder morgan had the support of several large petroleum industry customers for this expansion bp canada energy trading co canadian natural resources canadian oil sands ltd cenovus energy inc devon canada corp husky energy marketing inc imperial oil ltd nexen marketing inc statoil canada ltd suncor energy marketing inc suncor energy products partnership tesoro refining  marketing co and total ep canada ltdcitation needed this project is controversial as are similar pipeline projects like northern gateway from alberta to kitimat bc keystone xl to the us south and line  enbridges project from sarnia to montreal all of which expand the transportation capacity of heavy crude to refineries or loading ports for export to the us or overseas the expansion project faced strong opposition from civic governments first nations environmentally concerned citizens and others protests in november  focused on kinder morgans surveying work members of the squamish and tsleilwaututh first nations of british columbia canada paddled canoes on the waters of burrard inlet to the kinder morgan burnaby terminal for a ceremony to protest the expansion of the trans mountain pipeline in north vancouver bc on september   tsleilwaututh leaders hoped to shut down the project altogether the existing and proposed pipelines ship diluted bitumen through the strait of juan de fuca an extremely sensitive environmental region the tankers have to pass through a very narrow channel of shallow water to reach the open sea making the project controversial and strongly opposed by some canadians  and americans for reasons similar to the opposition to keystone xl line  and northern gateway and offshore deep ocean oil drilling in  bc said that it did not support trans mountain partly because kinder morgan has not provided enough information about its proposed spill prevention program northeast energy direct pipelineedit this highpressure inch gas transmission pipeline proposed in  was slated to pass from wright new york to dracut massachusetts to “help alleviate new england’s uniquely high natural gas and electricity costs caused by severely limited natural gas transportation capacity currently serving the region” however the project faced stiff opposition from a coalition of antifracking activists pipeline safety advocates who raised questions about the proximity of a highpressure pipeline to their homes sustainableenergy advocates property owners who objected to having land seized by eminent domain and environmentalists hoping to preserve wetlands and oldgrowth forests legislators and elected officials responded to voters concerns on april   kinder morgan suspended its effort to build the mile ned pipeline citing economic difficulties and lack of distribution commitments or customers for the gas palmetto pipelineedit likewise kinder morgans proposed palmetto pipeline designed to go from the gulf coast to the southeast markets was nixed its path would have taken it through  miles of eastern and coastal georgia and drew opposition from local residents and environmental groups the company suspended work on the project after the georgia state legislature passed a temporary moratorium on the use of eminent domain for pipeline construction and commissioned a study to review the project the company filed an appeal connecticut expansion projectedit kinder morgan proposed a mile long inch diameter highpressure natural gas storage loop which would include a mile pipeline spur through sandisfield massachusetts crossing the otis state forest and using water from spectacle pond the company invoked the us natural gas act to have the needed land condemned so they could seize it by eminent domain however the commonwealth of massachusetts challenged kinder morgan in court

pipeline system see wikipediasummary style for information on how to properly incorporate it into this articles main text main article kinder morgan trans mountain pipeline system in  kinder morgan filed its application to the canadian national energy board neb for building a second pipeline roughly parallel to the existing trans mountain for transporting diluted bitumen between edmonton alberta and burnaby east of vancouver bc the new pipeline would nearly triple the transportation capacity from  to  barrels per day for an estimated investment of  billion this expansion would enable the export of larger volumes of albertas bituminous sands oil to the us and to asian countries kinder morgan had the support of several large petroleum industry customers for this expansion bp canada energy trading co canadian natural resources canadian oil sands ltd cenovus energy inc devon canada corp husky energy marketing inc imperial oil ltd nexen marketing inc statoil canada ltd suncor energy marketing inc suncor energy products partnership tesoro refining  marketing co and total ep canada ltdcitation needed this project is controversial as are similar pipeline projects like northern gateway from alberta to kitimat bc keystone xl to the us south and line  enbridges project from sarnia to montreal all of which expand the transportation capacity of heavy crude to refineries or loading ports for export to the us or overseas the expansion project faced strong opposition from civic governments first nations environmentally concerned citizens and others protests in november  focused on kinder morgans surveying work members of the squamish and tsleilwaututh first nations of british columbia canada paddled canoes on the waters of burrard inlet to the kinder morgan burnaby terminal for a ceremony to protest the expansion of the trans mountain pipeline in north vancouver bc on september   tsleilwaututh leaders hoped to shut down the project altogether the existing and proposed pipelines ship diluted bitumen through the strait of juan de fuca an extremely sensitive environmental region the tankers have to pass through a very narrow channel of shallow water to reach the open sea making the project controversial and strongly opposed by some canadians  and americans for reasons similar to the opposition to keystone xl line  and northern gateway and offshore deep ocean oil drilling in  bc said that it did not support trans mountain partly because kinder morgan has not provided enough information about its proposed spill prevention program northeast energy direct pipelineedit this highpressure inch gas transmission pipeline proposed in  was slated to pass from wright new york to dracut massachusetts to “help alleviate new england’s uniquely high natural gas and electricity costs caused by severely limited natural gas transportation capacity currently serving the region” however the project faced stiff opposition from a coalition of antifracking activists pipeline safety advocates who raised questions about the proximity of a highpressure pipeline to their homes sustainableenergy advocates property owners who objected to having land seized by eminent domain and environmentalists hoping to preserve wetlands and oldgrowth forests legislators and elected officials responded to voters concerns on april   kinder morgan suspended its effort to build the mile ned pipeline citing economic difficulties and lack of distribution commitments or customers for the gas palmetto pipelineedit likewise kinder morgans proposed palmetto pipeline designed to go from the gulf coast to the southeast markets was nixed its path would have taken it through  miles of eastern and coastal georgia and drew opposition from local residents and environmental groups the company suspended work on the project after the georgia state legislature passed a temporary moratorium on the use of eminent domain for pipeline construction and commissioned a study to review the project the company filed an appeal connecticut expansion projectedit kinder morgan proposed a mile long inch diameter highpressure natural gas storage loop which would include a mile pipeline spur through sandisfield massachusetts crossing the otis state forest and using water from spectacle pond the company invoked the us natural gas act to have the needed land condemned so they could seize it by eminent domain however the commonwealth of massachusetts challenged kinder morgan in court arguing that the state constitutions article  which protects designated conservation land forbids construction of a pipeline through protected lands safety violationsedit in  the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa cited kinder morgan for violating safety standards

brief summary of kinder morgan trans mountain pipeline system see wikipediasummary style for information on how to properly incorporate it into this articles main text main article kinder morgan trans mountain pipeline system in  kinder morgan filed its application to the canadian national energy board neb for building a second pipeline roughly parallel to the existing trans mountain for transporting diluted bitumen between edmonton alberta and burnaby east of vancouver bc the new pipeline would nearly triple the transportation capacity from  to  barrels per day for an estimated investment of  billion this expansion would enable the export of larger volumes of albertas bituminous sands oil to the us and to asian countries kinder morgan had the support of several large petroleum industry customers for this expansion bp canada energy trading co canadian natural resources canadian oil sands ltd cenovus energy inc devon canada corp husky energy marketing inc imperial oil ltd nexen marketing inc statoil canada ltd suncor energy marketing inc suncor energy products partnership tesoro refining  marketing co and total ep canada ltdcitation needed this project is controversial as are similar pipeline projects like northern gateway from alberta to kitimat bc keystone xl to the us south and line  enbridges project from sarnia to montreal all of which expand the transportation capacity of heavy crude to refineries or loading ports for export to the us or overseas the expansion project faced strong opposition from civic governments first nations environmentally concerned citizens and others protests in november  focused on kinder morgans surveying work members of the squamish and tsleilwaututh first nations of british columbia canada paddled canoes on the waters of burrard inlet to the kinder morgan burnaby terminal for a ceremony to protest the expansion of the trans mountain pipeline in north vancouver bc on september   tsleilwaututh leaders hoped to shut down the project altogether the existing and proposed pipelines ship diluted bitumen through the strait of juan de fuca an extremely sensitive environmental region the tankers have to pass through a very narrow channel of shallow water to reach the open sea making the project controversial and strongly opposed by some canadians  and americans for reasons similar to the opposition to keystone xl line  and northern gateway and offshore deep ocean oil drilling in  bc said that it did not support trans mountain partly because kinder morgan has not provided enough information about its proposed spill prevention program northeast energy direct pipelineedit this highpressure inch gas transmission pipeline proposed in  was slated to pass from wright new york to dracut massachusetts to “help alleviate new england’s uniquely high natural gas and electricity costs caused by severely limited natural gas transportation capacity currently serving the region” however the project faced stiff opposition from a coalition of antifracking activists pipeline safety advocates who raised questions about the proximity of a highpressure pipeline to their homes sustainableenergy advocates property owners who objected to having land seized by eminent domain and environmentalists hoping to preserve wetlands and oldgrowth forests legislators and elected officials responded to voters concerns on april   kinder morgan suspended its effort to build the mile ned pipeline citing economic difficulties and lack of distribution commitments or customers for the gas palmetto pipelineedit likewise kinder morgans proposed palmetto pipeline designed to go from the gulf coast to the southeast markets was nixed its path would have taken it through  miles of eastern and coastal georgia and drew opposition from local residents and environmental groups the company suspended work on the project after the georgia state legislature passed a temporary moratorium on the use of eminent domain for pipeline construction and commissioned a study to review the project the company filed an appeal connecticut expansion projectedit kinder morgan proposed a mile long inch diameter highpressure natural gas storage loop which would include a mile pipeline spur through sandisfield massachusetts crossing the otis state forest and using water from spectacle pond the company invoked the us natural gas act to have the needed land condemned so they could seize it by eminent domain however the commonwealth of massachusetts challenged kinder morgan in court arguing that the state constitutions article  which protects designated conservation land forbids construction of a pipeline through protected lands safety violationsedit in  the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa cited kinder morgan for violating safety standards regarding the distance between a natural gas pipeline and a high consequence area such as a school or hospital the pipeline was too close for safe operation in case of a leak in  phmsa cited kinder morgan for these safety violations failing to maintain update maps showing pipeline locations failing to test pipeline safety devices failing to maintain proper firefighting equipment failing to inspect its pipelines as required failing to adequately monitor pipes’ corrosion levels also in  the us department of transportation cited kinder morgan for violations including the companys failure to have and follow written startup and shutdown procedures and failing to have or use other measures to detect abnormal operating conditions and proposed a fine of  in  the headline wall street worries about kinder morgan’s safety record bc pipeline operator slashes and defers maintenance spending was a concern to anyone who lived or worked near a kinder morgan pipeline the wall street journal asked is kinder morgan scrimping on its pipelines after an investment analyst charged the company with starving its pipelines of routine maintenance spending in order to return more cash to investors deferred maintenance may account for the high number of kinder morgan pipeline accidents in the last decade phmsas incident reports for kinder morgans onshore gas transmission pipelines show that faulty infrastructure causes  of the significant leaks failure of the pipe cracked welds and faulty pipeline equipment together account for  of pipeline leaks and corrosion of the pipe causes  accidentsedit in texas alone from  to  kinder morgan experienced at least  significant incidents resulting in fatalities or hospitalization fires explosions or spills throughout the us since  kinder morgan and its subsidiaries pipelines of all kinds have been responsible for more than  spills evacuations explosions fires and fatalities in  states incurring more than  federal enforcement actions kinder morgans natural gas transmission pipeline accidents caused more than  million in property damage this list below is not complete see the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration operator data at httpprimisphmsadotgov for more incidents some notable examples including spills in canada  in august  in caddo county oklahoma a kinder morgan natural gas pipeline of america failed in a rural farming area about just east of the town of stecker a  diameter pipe exploded throwing a foot long section of pipe  feet from the ditch the cause was environmental cracking along the length of the failed section parallel to the longitudinal weld seam  on april   an underground kinder morgan  pipeline ruptured at suisun marsh in solano county california spilling over  gallons of diesel fuel directly into the marsh the cause was pipe corrosion the company failed to notify authorities about

this section should include only a brief summary of kinder morgan trans mountain pipeline system see wikipediasummary style for information on how to properly incorporate it into this articles main text main article kinder morgan trans mountain pipeline system in  kinder morgan filed its application to the canadian national energy board neb for building a second pipeline roughly parallel to the existing trans mountain for transporting diluted bitumen between edmonton alberta and burnaby east of vancouver bc the new pipeline would nearly triple the transportation capacity from  to  barrels per day for an estimated investment of  billion this expansion would enable the export of larger volumes of albertas bituminous sands oil to the us and to asian countries kinder morgan had the support of several large petroleum industry customers for this expansion bp canada energy trading co canadian natural resources canadian oil sands ltd cenovus energy inc devon canada corp husky energy marketing inc imperial oil ltd nexen marketing inc statoil canada ltd suncor energy marketing inc suncor energy products partnership tesoro refining  marketing co and total ep canada ltdcitation needed this project is controversial as are similar pipeline projects like northern gateway from alberta to kitimat bc keystone xl to the us south and line  enbridges project from sarnia to montreal all of which expand the transportation capacity of heavy crude to refineries or loading ports for export to the us or overseas the expansion project faced strong opposition from civic governments first nations environmentally concerned citizens and others protests in november  focused on kinder morgans surveying work members of the squamish and tsleilwaututh first nations of british columbia canada paddled canoes on the waters of burrard inlet to the kinder morgan burnaby terminal for a ceremony to protest the expansion of the trans mountain pipeline in north vancouver bc on september   tsleilwaututh leaders hoped to shut down the project altogether the existing and proposed pipelines ship diluted bitumen through the strait of juan de fuca an extremely sensitive environmental region the tankers have to pass through a very narrow channel of shallow water to reach the open sea making the project controversial and strongly opposed by some canadians  and americans for reasons similar to the opposition to keystone xl line  and northern gateway and offshore deep ocean oil drilling in  bc said that it did not support trans mountain partly because kinder morgan has not provided enough information about its proposed spill prevention program northeast energy direct pipelineedit this highpressure inch gas transmission pipeline proposed in  was slated to pass from wright new york to dracut massachusetts to “help alleviate new england’s uniquely high natural gas and electricity costs caused by severely limited natural gas transportation capacity currently serving the region” however the project faced stiff opposition from a coalition of antifracking activists pipeline safety advocates who raised questions about the proximity of a highpressure pipeline to their homes sustainableenergy advocates property owners who objected to having land seized by eminent domain and environmentalists hoping to preserve wetlands and oldgrowth forests legislators and elected officials responded to voters concerns on april   kinder morgan suspended its effort to build the mile ned pipeline citing economic difficulties and lack of distribution commitments or customers for the gas palmetto pipelineedit likewise kinder morgans proposed palmetto pipeline designed to go from the gulf coast to the southeast markets was nixed its path would have taken it through  miles of eastern and coastal georgia and drew opposition from local residents and environmental groups the company suspended work on the project after the georgia state legislature passed a temporary moratorium on the use of eminent domain for pipeline construction and commissioned a study to review the project the company filed an appeal connecticut expansion projectedit kinder morgan proposed a mile long inch diameter highpressure natural gas storage loop which would include a mile pipeline spur through sandisfield massachusetts crossing the otis state forest and using water from spectacle pond the company invoked the us natural gas act to have the needed land condemned so they could seize it by eminent domain however the commonwealth of massachusetts challenged kinder morgan in court

brief summary of kinder morgan trans mountain pipeline system see wikipediasummary style for information on how to properly incorporate it into this articles main text main article kinder morgan trans mountain pipeline system in  kinder morgan filed its application to the canadian national energy board neb for building a second pipeline roughly parallel to the existing trans mountain for transporting diluted bitumen between edmonton alberta and burnaby east of vancouver bc the new pipeline would nearly triple the transportation capacity from  to  barrels per day for an estimated investment of  billion this expansion would enable the export of larger volumes of albertas bituminous sands oil to the us and to asian countries kinder morgan had the support of several large

controversial as are similar pipeline projects like northern gateway from alberta to kitimat bc keystone xl to the us south and line  enbridges project from sarnia to montreal all of which expand the transportation capacity of heavy crude to refineries or loading ports for export to the us or overseas the expansion project faced strong opposition from civic governments first nations

canoes on the waters of burrard inlet to the kinder morgan burnaby terminal for a ceremony to protest the expansion of the trans mountain pipeline in north vancouver bc on september   tsleilwaututh leaders hoped to shut down the project altogether the existing and proposed pipelines ship diluted bitumen through the strait of juan de fuca an extremely sensitive environmental region the tankers have to pass through a very narrow channel of shallow water to reach the open sea making the project controversial and strongly opposed by some canadians  and americans for reasons similar to the opposition to keystone xl line  and northern gateway and offshore deep ocean oil drilling in  bc said that it did not support trans mountain partly because kinder morgan has not provided enough information about its proposed spill prevention program northeast energy direct pipelineedit this highpressure inch gas transmission pipeline proposed in  was slated to pass from wright new york to dracut massachusetts to “help alleviate new england’s uniquely high natural gas and electricity costs caused by severely limited natural gas transportation capacity currently serving the region” however the project faced stiff opposition from a coalition of antifracking activists pipeline safety advocates who raised questions about the proximity of a highpressure pipeline to their homes sustainableenergy advocates property owners who objected to having land seized by eminent domain and environmentalists hoping to preserve wetlands and oldgrowth forests legislators and elected officials responded to voters concerns on april   kinder morgan suspended its effort to build the mile ned pipeline citing economic difficulties and lack of distribution commitments or customers for the gas palmetto pipelineedit likewise kinder morgans proposed palmetto pipeline designed to go from the gulf coast to the southeast markets was nixed its path would have taken it through  miles of eastern and coastal georgia and drew opposition from local residents and environmental groups the company suspended work on the project after the georgia state legislature passed a temporary moratorium on the use of eminent domain for pipeline construction and commissioned a study to review the project the company filed an appeal connecticut expansion projectedit kinder morgan proposed a mile long inch diameter highpressure natural gas storage loop which would include a mile pipeline spur through sandisfield massachusetts crossing the otis state forest and using water from spectacle pond the company invoked the us natural gas act to have the needed land condemned so they could seize it by eminent domain however the commonwealth of massachusetts challenged kinder morgan in court arguing that the state constitutions article  which protects designated conservation land forbids construction of a pipeline through protected lands safety violationsedit in  the pipeline and

enterprise products partners lp between these two giant midstream oil and gas companies which is the better option the one with the better dividend record of course reuben gregg brewer tmfreubengbrewer mar   at am if you are examining the midstream oil and gas industry then youve likely seen the names kinder morgan inc nysekmi and enterprise products partners lp nyseepd they are two of the largest players in the sector albeit with very different histories a quick analysis of their pasts will tell you a lot about their outlook for the future and which one is the better buy the problem with kinder morgan in kinder morgans most recent investor presentation it included this statement on a slide labeled our strategy reduced dividend demonstrates our commitment to investment grade and our ability to fund growth projects without need to access capital markets you read that right cutting the dividend  in early  was a good thing   image source kinder morgan inc thats not how i see it i see the dividend cut as an admission of management overreach with too much debt and plans that were larger than could be afforded if everything didnt go just right well the market didnt cooperate and plans didnt play out as expected and when push came to shove shareholders got hit  hard thats not to suggest that kinder morgan is a bad company it has a massive portfolio of assets across the united states and it even reaches into mexico and canada roughly  of its cash flow is backed by tolltaker contracts not impacted by commodity prices  of cash flow is take or pay and it has a  billion backlog of projects that it now believes it can fund out of cash flow while still paying its dividend   its muchreduced dividend that is if dividends dont matter to you then kinder morgan is a stock you should look at very closely however i care a great deal about dividends i believe they are among other things a statement about managements commitment to shareholders if you believe that too then kinder morgan made a very important statement when it chose to make a massive dividend cut dont forget that management had professed a commitment to the dividend including plans for an increase in  just a few weeks before the cut was announced   enterprises distribution held up when others didnt image source enterprise products partners lp another option enterprise products partners to be fair kinder morgan may have made the right choice for the company in cutting the dividend but when you compare it to fellow midstream industry giant enterprise products partners you see there are better options for investors who like to keep getting their distributions in good times and bad like kinder morgan enterprise has a sprawling network of midstream assets a big piece of its business is backed by tolltaker contracts and it has roughly  billion of projects set to come on line between now and  that will help grow the business but heres the real difference enterprise has increased its distribution every year for the last  years including a hike in each of the last  quarters when the markets got rough and kinder morgan cut its payout enterprises commitment to its unitholders held firm   that didnt happen by accident enterprise has a conservative management approach that gives it breathing room when things get tough for example it covered its distribution by  times in  which is more than ample room to raise the distribution or protect it if there are problems in  a great example of this is the graph below when oil prices cratered the red line enterprises distributable cash flow didnt skip a beat the green line   when oil fell enterprises distributable cash flow stayed strong image source enterprise products partners lp ill go with boring what all this doesnt tell you is how fast each company can grow or how they will perform in the stock market now that kinder morgan has gotten itself into a better financial position partly thanks to that  dividend cut it might very well grow its top and bottom lines faster than enterprise does that in turn could lead investors to reward the company with a swiftly rising stock price even if that were to happen i would still rather own enterprise the truth is it is likely to be very boring with slowandsteady distribution increases backed by slowandsteady business growth thats the kind of trend that lets dividend investors sleep well at night add in the hefty  distribution yield enterprise offers today and you are getting paid very well to be bored leave all that dividend excitement to other investors reuben brewer has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool owns shares of and recommends kinder morgan the motley fool recommends enterprise products partners the motley fool has a

comes to dividends in late october  the company announced that  we currently expect to increase our declared dividend for  by  to  percent over the  declared dividend of  per share a few days later it increased the quarterly dividend by a penny noting that a key corporate goal was to continue to return cash to our shareholders in increasing amounts     but in early december of the same year kinder announced a  dividend cut the reason was that the company needed to fund the growth projects it had earlier said it could afford while still managing to return cash to our shareholders in increasing amounts thus at this point its hard to believe that dividends are really a high priority at kinder morgan     better numbers which is why investors should be looking at enterprise products partners and holly energy both of which have increased their distributions each and every quarter for  or more consecutive quarters while kinder was scrounging for money ultimately choosing to break its own word on the dividend to get it enterprise and holly energy continued to return cash to their unitholders in increasing amounts but thats not the only reason to like this pair     enterprise currently offers investors a  distribution yield backed by a largely feebased business with a portfolio that is just as large and diverse as kinder morgans if not more so it also has  billion worth of growth

structure     enterprises growth plans image source enterprise products partners investor presentation  basically the story at enterprise is pretty similar to kinders businesswise the big difference is that enterprises tale includes continued slow and steady distribution growth and no distribution cuts riskier fare but lets assume you dont mind taking on the added risk of kinders spotty dividend history in that case id suggest a look at holly energy which offers a robust  or so yield that will be a full  percentage points above what kinder would offer if it indeed increases its dividend in  as in the case of kinder and enterprise hollys business is feebased its actually  feebased with more than  of revenue tied to longterm contracts that said its a smaller company focusing mostly on pipelines storage and terminals  so you would be giving up some diversification the most concerning fact however is that longterm debt makes up around  of the capital structure that helps explain the relatively high yield     hep financial debt to ebitda ttm data by ycharts holly however has been in a similar situation before it has a history of adding debt to buy assets from its general partner hollyfrontier or unaffiliated companies it then uses the cash flows from its feebased businesses to bring its debt levels back down theres clearly more risk today but holly energy is comfortable with what its doing  and  consecutive dividend hikes prove that the model works well for the company and its unitholders go with the green for dividendminded investors the prospect of a huge dividend increase at kinder morgan is pretty enticing but you should consider the companys past lack of commitment to its own statements regarding the payout if you are looking at kinder you are better off
