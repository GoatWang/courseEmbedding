business citrix suddenly changes ceo tatarinov out coo david henshall in mutual separation decision after just  months in the job by simon sharwood apac editor  jul  at  share ▼ citrix has announced a boltfromtheblue change of ceo the company says its board and immediatepastceo kirill tatarinov reached a “mutual separation decision” that will see him depart the company david j henshall previously the companys chief financial officer and chief operations officer now glories in the titles of ceo president and member of the companys board citrixs canned statement says the change was made ahead of plans to introduce “a series of strategic initiatives intended to drive operating margin expansion increase capital return and facilitate further investment in accelerating citrix’s transformation to a cloudbased subscription business and in highgrowth areas such as data security and analytics services” that “transformation” was flagged in the companys q  results announcement so we cannot image tatarinov was unaware of it or was not involved in its preparation citixs statement offers nothing more than the boards belief that “we now have the right team in place to execute on that vision” which begs the question about why tatarinov was not felt to be “right” tatarinov took the job in january 6 and to the registers mind did pretty well on his watch the company and pocketed shed its goto product lines and pocketed a cool usbn improved profitability and forged alliances that saw cisco and microsoft send customers its way in preference to their own wares on the downside growth was slow on his watch and while citrixs core products did well plans for growth were not obvious the company also faced rumours the company was for sale which tatarinov did not definitively deny perhaps thats where the difference of opinion lay the announcement of tatarinov makes much of plans to return capital to investors one way to do that is with a sale another is with a new strategy the register wonders if the former ceo didnt think investors would be bestserved by citrix trying to innovate its way to a more pleasing balance sheet but the board felt that was the best approach such a difference of opinion would be unsustainable whatever the reasons for the change citrix says it will reveal its new plans on its next earnings call in early august el reg will tune in to bear

 business citrix suddenly changes ceo tatarinov out coo david henshall in mutual separation decision after just  months in the job by simon sharwood apac editor  jul  at  share ▼ citrix has announced a boltfromtheblue change of ceo the company says its board and immediatepastceo kirill tatarinov reached a “mutual separation decision” that will see him depart the company david j henshall previously the companys chief financial officer and chief operations officer now glories in the titles of ceo president and member of the companys board citrixs canned statement says the change was made ahead of plans to introduce “a series of strategic initiatives intended to drive operating margin expansion increase capital return and facilitate further investment in accelerating citrix’s transformation to a cloudbased subscription business and in highgrowth areas such as data security and analytics services” that “transformation” was flagged in the companys q  results announcement so we cannot image tatarinov was unaware of it or was not involved in its preparation citixs statement offers nothing more than the boards belief that “we now have the right team in place to execute on that vision” which begs the question about why tatarinov was not felt to be “right” tatarinov took the job in january 6 and to the registers mind did pretty well on his watch the company and pocketed shed its goto product lines and pocketed a cool usbn improved profitability and forged alliances that saw cisco and microsoft send customers its way in preference to their own wares on the downside growth was slow on his watch and while citrixs core products did well plans for growth were not obvious the company also faced rumours the company was for sale which tatarinov did not definitively deny perhaps thats where the difference of opinion lay the announcement of tatarinov makes much of plans to return capital to investors one way to do that is with a sale another is with a new strategy the register wonders if the former ceo didnt think investors would be bestserved by citrix trying to innovate its way to a more pleasing balance sheet but the board felt that was the best approach such a difference of opinion would be unsustainable whatever the reasons for the change citrix says it will reveal its new plans on its next earnings call in early august el reg will tune in to bear
