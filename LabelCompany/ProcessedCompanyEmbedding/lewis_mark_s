choose the law offices of mark e lewis  associates to create my estate plan everyone has an estate plan whether intentionally or by default if you think you have no plan because you have not made out a will or a trust you still have a plan — it is simply one that will be dictated by the laws of your state upon your death               intestacy                                     • dying without a will                                     • state law dictates distribution which you may not want                                     • usually requires probate court proceeding               will                                     • written instruction to court                                     • you select your distribution                                     • usually requires probate court proceeding               living trust                                     • you select your distribution                                     • usually avoids probate court proceeding                                     • provides benefit while you are alive • greatly reduced administrative costs at time of death or incapacity • immediate access to assets without court intervention • avoiding or minimizing burdensome estate tax • establishes your choice of guardians to protect your children • immediate authority of guardians over children’s inheritance • asset protection for children any competent person over the age of   the question of how extensive of a plan is needed depends on the assets a person holds and the number and age of any children for whom someone is responsible  a wellcrafted estate plan is especially important for those families caring for a special needs dependent or aging loved one proper estate planning involves a plan that is carefully designed to meet your goals it requires a cooperative effort between you your attorney and other appropriate members of your estate planning team such as a financial planner a life insurance agent and a cpa the plan should not be thought of as a productoriented series of individual transactions but rather a “team effort” to provide a comprehensive evaluation and subsequent development of a plan to protect you and your loved ones into the future   the development of your estate plan is an ongoing process that evolves as your needs goals and family change as the laws change and as new estate planning tools and techniques are developed it is a process of continually evolving entrance growth maintenance and exit strategies proper planning requires professional thoroughness that respects the overall wellbeing of you and your family   your goals should include the following             • control of your assets during your life             • a business exit strategy if you have an ownership interest in a business             • providing instructions for your care and the management of your assets for you and your family if you become incapacitated             • protecting the assets you leave your spouse children or other beneficiaries from creditors and unscrupulous persons             • developing a plan of distribution that will leave your assets to whom you want when you want and with whatever controls you want             • avoiding probate             • saving the greatest amount of taxes and postdeath administrative costs possible  not only in your own estate but in the estates of your spouse and your descendants one of the main functions of an estate plan is to minimize expense and effort when a person becomes incapacitated or dies  minimizing expense and effort means avoiding the probate court if possible  nothing will place a person or their assets in probate court faster than a poorly written estate plan  using websites or software individuals often force the program to insert words or phrases which they do not realize will destroy the ability of the document to do its job  even when these documents are ‘correct’ on their face they are never able to handle all the contingency plans that must be written into a good estate plan  every step or element of a written estate plan that is misaligned with the other elements threatens to destroy the efficiency of the entire plan  even the best designed website or software program is no substitute for the benefits of an ongoing personal relationship with your own attorney             competence

article is  years old zoe wood zoewoodguardian thursday  march   est first published on thursday  march   est john lewis has stolen the uk high street crown from marks  spencer after sales in britain overtook the high street bellwether for the first time the success was twofold as both parts of the staffowned retailer waitrose and john lewis cemented their status as middleenglands favourite shopping destination with record sales john lewis has definitely replaced ms as the darling of the british high street said retail analyst neil saunders of conlumino ms is still the more predominant – it has more stores and more shoppers – but when you look at new routes to market like online and mobile john lewis is light years ahead the new heights scaled by the partnership are good news for its  staff – known as partners – who will share a bonus pool of more than £m in this months pay packet every member of staff from the chairman to saturday shelfstackers gets the same level of bonus – which has this year been set at  or about eight weeks pay a decade ago sales at john lewis partnership were just £bn while ms was in a different league with around £bn those lines have now crossed the most recent figures available show mss uk business turning over £bn last year compared to the £bn john lewis and waitrose achieved this year ms is not expected to eclipse john lewis when it publishes more uptodate figures in may this years sales were boosted by the retailers hugely successful christmas advertising campaign – the bear and the hare cartoon – which became a youtube sensation with m views it also benefited from the demise of comet – which meant it sold far more electrical goods than ever before – and the upturn in the housing market which has boosted demand for new carpets and curtains in the past john lewis was unfavourably compared with the civil service it was slow to adapt to changing shopping habits such as late night shopping sunday trading and even accepting credit cards but it did not make the same mistake with the internet both chains have invested heavily in their website and the click and collect services that many timepressed customers now take for granted ms meanwhile is playing catchup with the recent relaunch of its website the latest savvy developments include waitrose installing grocery collection lockers in london underground stations while john lewis is backing a silicon roundaboutstyle technology incubator – called jlab – which it hopes will come up with the next big thing for its stores unlike the toxic issue of bankers bonuses there is no backlash from the public or politicians or members of the public when john lewis doles out its annual staff bonus although small beer compared with payouts received by investment bankers – last month barclays said its bonus pool was more than £bn – the payout is equal to  of salary john lewis staff earn the same as shopworkers at rival chains but the yearend bonus is a significant topup this year the average payout is £ and for some it can be life changing darren hayes who works in waitroses aylesford depot is using the extra cash to send his son nineyearold darragh who has cerebral palsy to the peto institute in hungary for a course of intensive physiotherapy its lifechanging for me –  says hayes im convinced he will walk out of there john lewis became a partnership in  when john spedan lewis established a trust committed to sharing profits among staff the businesss values which include putting the happiness of partners at the centre of everything we do have not always been fashionable but the formula of rewarding staff – on top of the bonus staff will receive discounts and perks ranging from subsidised holidays to sailing clubs and theatre outings worth £m this year – went from strength to strength during the recession both waitrose and john lewis increased market share for the fifth consecutive year said chairman charlie mayfield our ownership by partners played a key role in these results there are fundamental changes taking place in retail … the level of change has at times been challenging but partners have understood and embraced the need for their business to continue to develop rivals such as next and ms are far more profitable than john lewis but iain hasdell chief executive of the employee ownership association says that is only one yardstick with which to measure success john lewis is a good antidote to how much of our economy is externally controlled and driven by the obsessive shorttermism that creates a significant financial breakdown every generation some mock the middle class values of the john lewis brands  two years ago a waitrose twitter campaign which invited shoppers to finish the sentence i shop at waitrose because … went awry with memorable comments such as because i was once in the holloway road branch and heard a dad say put the papaya down orlando but it has not stopped them shopping there as big supermarkets such as tesco and asda lose shoppers to german discounters aldi and lidl waitrose led by mark price has been holding its own thanks to a promise to match market leader tescos prices on brands and a loyalty scheme that offers free newspapers and coffee i asked my mother if she had shopped at aldi or lidl said price she said yes at aldi she bought four hub caps and a pack of carbon monoxide detectors he said waitrose had decided on a very british response we have decided to compete on giving our customers morning coffee and a cup of tea in the afternoon his latest thinking includes introducing concierge desks to welcome shoppers and tapas bars in its wine departments it was not all plain sailing profits before the bonus and tax were down  at £m after a £7m charge for compensating staff who had been underpaid for holidays the bonus was down from last years 7 figure as the retailer also tackled a £bn black hole in its pension scheme the holiday pay error has led to questions about the checks and balances in place at the partnership given the backdrop of implosion at the coop where trust was shattered by the rescue of its bank and the reverend paul flowers drugs allegations our governance structure is completely different to that of the coop group insisted mayfield the group is owned by the partners and they are represented on the board and there are also nonexecutives we are very careful that our governance is in good and improving shape and we are not taking undue risk john lewis partnership v ms sales £bn v £bn profit £7m v £m staff  v  uk stores   waitrose v 7
