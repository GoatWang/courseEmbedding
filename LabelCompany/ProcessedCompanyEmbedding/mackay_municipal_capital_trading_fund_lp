in price the fund may have to cover its short position at a higher price than the short sale price resulting in a loss because the fund’s loss on a short sale arises from increases in the value of the

increase the cost of the security sold short by investing the proceeds received from selling securities short the fund is employing a form of leverage which creates special risks the use of leverage may increase the fund’s exposure to long equity positions and make any change in the fund’s nav greater than it would be without the use of leverage this could result in increased volatility of
