process and bottle water from this unique yearold protected high ph aquiferspring hill water company a native american blackfeet tribal member corporation and humble water company have agreed to build a facility that will process and bottle water in  biodegradable bottles that generate yearly revenues this ancient water comes from the artesian springs located on the blackfeet nation near browning montana this endless supply of naturally alkaline mineral water is the next step in the companys investment into the health and wellness sectorwhat truly separates this bottled water from the competition is its purity this is not city tap water that has gone through reverse osmosis this is arguably the purest naturally filtered water in the world our ancient artesian water contains essential minerals for your body that tastes cool and refreshingartesian springs are different than well water artesian springs are deep bodies of prehistoric water that may be thousands of years old the multiple layers complex beds of rock clay and granite act to filter out all the contaminants we believe this is one of natures purest water filters says daniel crawford ceo the artesian water will be packaged in a  ecofriendly container using the best sustainable materials to ensure that we stick to our green packaging roots it is estimated that more than  billion plastic bottles are added to landfills each year when a traditional plastic bottle enters a landfill it can take thousands of years to break down  if ever as you can imagine this can have a profound impact on our environmentin order for plastics to properly break down tiny microscopic organisms must find the discarded products an irresistible morsel and begin consuming it bite by bite only then can the item be broken down in its entirety traditional plastics are unattractive to microbes and therefore inediblemany products on the market claim to be biodegradable but are in fact only compostable and are unable to degrade in a landfill environment or the product simply breaks down into smaller pieces plastic flakesspring hill water cos bio bottles accelerate the natural biodegradation of plastics in biologically active landfills and anaerobic digesters as validated by independent certified laboratories using internationally recognized test methods plastics enhanced with the bio bottles are also fda recognized
