kilimanjaro right to play uk we use sport and play as a tool to educate  empower disadvantaged children charity registration no  story the year  turned out to be both more challenging and inspiring than the skattum family could have imagined    as most of you know last year i was diagnosed with multiple myeloma a form of cancer of the plasma cells from my initial surprise diagnosis we ran the gauntlet of visits to specialists in the uk and the usa researched the internet endlessly and spoke with a multitude of incredibly helpful people from all walks of lifeall of which culminated in my  month stay in little rock arkansas  in little rock  we learned that this disease which is frequently misunderstood and has long been considered incurable can be effectively managed and cured over the long term i left little rock with a revised diagnosis an innocuous treatment regime and an even more positive outlook for an active and healthy life but much work still needs to be done to develop a curative treatment for high risk myeloma and we hope you will join our family in rising to the challenges ahead   our journey over the last year gave us a profound respect for and appreciation of the smarts compassion and dedication of people involved in treating counseling and tirelessly working to cure cancer it also made us realize that those of us in a position to help others less able should do so as life is short and one never knows what’s around the corner   with this in mind we want to give something back in appreciation of all the care and support we received from family friends and colleagues in april i will climb mt kilimanjaro together with julie and our three boys lars erik and nils kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in africa  ft  meters above sea level and one of the highest freestanding mountains in the world  although nils is disappointed not to set the record as the youngest climber we suspect the challenge nonetheless will be formidable at least for the  member of the family and that’s not julie   we’d like to invite our friends around the world to participate in our family “kili challenge” our aim in climbing is to raise funds for three organizations that make a positive difference in the lives of individuals families and communities throughout the world   here is the challenge our family has committed £ to the effort and with everyones help we hope to double or triple that amount – approximately £ per foot per person climbed   the three organizations we’re supporting the international children’s charity right to play myeloma institute for research and therapy and myeloma uk – embody innovation compassion dedication and commitment to a better future    right to play wwwrighttoplayorguk  wwwrighttoplaycom was founded by johann koss a multiple gold winner in the  winter olympics in norway johann was the first olympian to donate his winnings to what was then olympic aid over the years olympic aid morphed into right to play  an organization that leverages sport and play for the development of children in warn torn or otherwise troubled parts of the world    as a family we are privileged to have witnessed firsthand the impact right to play has in the local communities in which it operates  after our climb we will witness the impact of your support on programmes with children in the slums of dar es salaam and the towns of morogoro and dodoma these programmes help vulnerable children protect themselves from malaria and hivaids and acquire crucial leadership skills click here for a story from our dar es salaam projects    with funds raised through the skattum family challenge we can give almost  children living in these communities the chance to fulfil their potential and access sport and play opportunities that we take for granted every day    for children such as grace alupo your support will make a profound difference to their lives    “malaria prevents us from achieving our goals at school we had been falling sick and did not understand why now we have played right to play games we know about malaria’s symptoms effects and how it can be prevented”    her friend godfrey feels just as strongly “when leading the games i feel empowered to make decisions i can make right choices in my life i have made my destiny  i have been able to learn a lot through leading my fellow children i love it when children follow what i tell them we learn together”    should you like us be inspired be inspired to give know you will be making a real difference in the lives of many individuals and in communities
