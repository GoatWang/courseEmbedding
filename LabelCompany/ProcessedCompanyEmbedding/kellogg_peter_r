an ordinary resolution to expand the size of mfc’s board of directors by fixing the number of directors of mfc at eleven and to nominate eight new directors “we are not shareholder activists in fact this is the first time in my life that i have ever set the wheels in motion to be an active participant in a proxy contest” said peter kellogg “it is also the first time that i have felt that the circumstances warranted it” continued mr kellogg over the  years that iat has held its investment in mfc it has been a patient and supportive partner with mfc iat’s previous requests for board representation were rebuffed by mfc in no uncertain terms as a shareholder iat advocates and encourages longterm stewardship of companies through the proper working of a relevant and independent board of directors whose fiduciary responsibility  to oversee and guide management and its operational plans and to act in the interests of all of the shareholders  is upheld and honored “shareholders need to have confidence in a company’s board and its strategic direction we have lost that confidence in the current board of mfc” commented tony kerbs managing director of iat “we are appealing to
