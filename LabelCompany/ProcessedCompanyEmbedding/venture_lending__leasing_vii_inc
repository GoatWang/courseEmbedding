  venture lending  leasing vii inc   notes to condensed financial statements unaudited      organization and operations of the fund venture lending  leasing vii inc the “fund” was incorporated in maryland on june   as a nondiversified closedend management investment company electing status as a business development company “bdc” under the investment company act of  as amended  act and is managed by westech investment advisors llc “manager” or “management”  the fund will be dissolved on december   unless an election is made to dissolve earlier by the board of directors of the fund the board one hundred percent of the stock of the fund is held by venture lending  leasing vii llc the “company”  prior to commencing its operations on december   the fund had no operations other than the sale to the company of  shares of common stock  par value for  in july   this issuance of stock was a requirement in order to apply for a finance lenders license from the california commissioner of corporations which was obtained on september     the funds investment objective is to achieve a superior riskadjusted investment return in the managers opinion the accompanying interim condensed financial statements hereafter referred to as financial statements include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and results of operations for interim periods certain information and note disclosures normally included in audited annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap have been omitted however the fund believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading the interim results for the nine months ended september   are not necessarily indicative of what the results would be for a full year these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes included in the funds annual report on form k for the year ended december         summary of significant accounting policies basis of accounting   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and money market mutual funds with maturities of  days or less money market mutual funds held as cash equivalents are valued at their most recently traded net asset value   interest income   interest income on loans is recognized using the effective interest method including amounts from the amortization of discounts attributable to equity securities received as part of the loan transaction  additionally fees received as part of the transaction are added to the loan discount and amortized over the life of the loan   investment valuation procedures   the fund accounts for loans at fair value in accordance with the “valuation methods” below  all valuations are determined under the direction of the manager in accordance with the valuation methods          the funds loans are valued in connection with the issuance of its periodic financial statements the issuance or repurchase of the funds shares at a price equivalent to the current net asset value per share and at such other times as required by law  on a quarterly basis management submits to the board a valuation report and valuation notes which details the rationale for the valuation of investments as of september   and december    the financial statements include nonmarketable investments of  million and  million  respectively or  and  of total assets respectively with fair values determined by the manager in the absence of readily determinable market values because of the inherent uncertainty of these valuations estimated fair values of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed and the differences could be material below is the information used by the manager in making these estimates   loans   the fund defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to lower a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date there is no secondary market for the loans made by the fund to borrowers hence management determines fair value based on hypothetical markets venture loans are generally held to maturity and are recorded at estimated fair value the determination of fair value is based on a number of factors including the amount for which an investment could be exchanged in a current sale which assumes an orderly disposition over a reasonable period other than in a forced sale management also considers the fact that no ready market exists for substantially all of the investments held by the fund management determines whether to adjust the estimated fair value of a loan based on a number of factors including but not limited to the borrowers payment history available cash and “burn rate” revenues net income or loss the likelihood that the borrower will be able to secure additional financing in the future as well as an evaluation of the general interest rate environment the amount of any valuation adjustment considers liquidation analysis and is determined based upon a credit analysis of the borrower and an analysis of the expected recovery from the borrower including consideration of factors such as the nature and quality of the funds security interests in collateral the estimated value of the funds collateral the size of the loan and the estimated time that will elapse before the fund achieves a recovery management has evaluated these factors and has concluded that the effect of deterioration in the quality of the underlying collateral increase in the estimated time to recovery and increase in the hypothetical market coupon rate would have the effect of lowering the value of the current portfolio of loans   nonaccrual loans   the funds policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when the portfolio company is delinquent for three months on its monthly loan payment or ceases or drastically curtails its operation and management deems that it is unlikely that the loan will return to performing status  when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed for the quarter in which the loan was placed on nonaccrual status  any uncollected interest related to quarters prior to when the loan was placed on nonaccrual status is added to the principal balance and the aggregate balance of the principal and interest is evaluated in accordance with the policy for valuation of loans in determining managements best estimate of fair value interest received by the fund on nonaccrual loans will be recognized as interest income if and when the proceeds exceed the book value of the loans if a borrower of a nonaccrual loan resumes making regular payments and is deemed by management to have the ability to service the loan on a sustainable basis the loan is reclassified back to accrual or performing status  interest that would have been accrued during the nonaccrual status will be added back to the remaining payment schedule and thus changing the effective interest rate as of september    loans with a cost basis of   million and a fair value of   million have been classified as nonaccrual as of december   loans with a cost basis of   million and a fair value of   million have been classified as nonaccrual            warrants stock and convertible notes   warrants stock and convertible notes that are received in connection with loan transactions generally will be assigned a fair value at the time of acquisition these securities are then distributed by the fund to its shareholder at the assigned value warrants are valued based on a modified blackscholes option pricing model which takes into account factors underlying stock value expected term volatility and the riskfree interest rate among other factors   underlying asset value is estimated based on information available including information regarding recent rounds of funding of the portfolio company or the publiclyquoted stock price at the end of the financial reporting period for warrants for comparable publiclyquoted securities volatility or the amount of uncertainty or risk about the size of the changes in the warrant price is based on an index of publicly traded companies grouped by industry and which are similar in nature to the underlying portfolio companies issuing the warrant “industry index” the volatility assumption for each industry index is based on the average volatility for individual public companies within the portfolio companys industry for a period of time approximating the expected life of the warrants a hypothetical increase in the volatility of the warrants used in the modified blackscholes option pricing model would have the effect of increasing the value of the warrants the remaining expected lives of warrants are based on historical experience of the average life of the warrants as warrants are often exercised in the event of acquisitions mergers or initial public offerings and terminated due to events such as bankruptcies restructuring activities or additional financings these events cause the expected term to be less than the remaining contractual term of the warrants for the nine months ended september   and september    the fund assumed the average duration of a warrant is  years the effect of a hypothetical increase in the estimated initial term of the warrants used in the modified blackscholes option pricing model would have the effect of increasing the value of the warrants the riskfree interest rate is derived from the constant maturity tables issued by the us treasury department the effect of a hypothetical increase in the estimated riskfree rate used in the modified blackscholes option pricing model would have the effect of increasing the value of the warrants the fund engages an independent valuation company to provide valuation assistance including the evaluations of the funds valuation methodology and the reasonableness of the assumptions used from the perspective of a market participant they calculate several of the inputs used such as volatility and riskfree rate upon the receipt of such data from the valuation company a sample test is performed to ensure the accuracy of their calculations and that the source of data is reliable and consistent with the way in which the calculations were made in prior periods such inputs are entered into the database with a second review to ensure the accuracy of the input information all calculations of warrant values are performed by one employee and reviewed by a second employee the inputs of the modified blackscholes option pricing model are reevaluated every quarter   other assets and liabilities other assets include costs incurred in conjunction with borrowings under the funds debt facility and are stated at initial cost the costs are amortized over the term of the facility as of september   and december    the fair values of other assets and liabilities are estimated at their carrying values because of the shortterm nature of these assets or liabilities as of september   and december    based on borrowing rates available to the fund the estimated fair values of the borrowings under the debt facility were  million and  million  respectively   commitment fees   unearned income and commitment fees on loans are recognized as additional interest on loans using the effective interest method over the term of the loan commitment fees are carried as liabilities when received for commitments upon which          no draws have been made when the first draw is made the fee is treated as unearned income and is recognized as described above  if a draw is never made the forfeited commitment fee less any applicable legal costs becomes recognized as other income after the commitment expires   deferred bank fees   through september    the deferred bank fees and costs associated with the debt facility have been capitalized and will be amortized over the estimated life of the facility which currently is through november   the deferred bank fees are included in other assets in the condensed statements of assets and liabilities the amortization
