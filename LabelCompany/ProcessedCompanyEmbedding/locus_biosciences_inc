locus biosciences founded by pioneers in the crispr field engineering a novel class of precision medicines designing precision antimicrobials about us locus biosciences is an emerging biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of a next generation crisprcas platform for programmed cell death crisprcas technology locus biosciences’ novel approach to precision antimicrobials works by taking advantage of an immune system present in many bacteria called the crisprcas system the crisprcas system protects bacteria from invaders such as viruses by creating a small strand of rna called a crispr rna which matches a dna sequence specific to a given invader if the crispr rna is matched to a complementary dna sequence the cas proteins will cleave the invading dna locus biosciences designs and creates novel crispr rnas and uses a powerful crisprcas system referred to as cascadecas that kills target bacteria by irreversibly destroying the bacterial dna the irreversible destruction of dna is the primary differentiator between cas and cas as cas makes doublestranded breaks that can be repaired by the cell the locus biosciences platform enables the design and development of powerful antimicrobials that avoid currently known antibiotic resistance mechanisms while leaving nontarget bacteria unharmed built on prokaryotic technology for prokaryotic targets locus is advancing its platform to create therapeutics for critical disease areas ranging from resistant bacterial infections to the microbiome proven leadership our team everyoneallboard of
