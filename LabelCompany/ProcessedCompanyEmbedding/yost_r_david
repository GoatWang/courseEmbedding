operational sales and executive positions including cochief operating officer executive vice president of operations and president in  yost began working for alco health systems corporation formerly associated with kauffmanlattimer that was based in malvern pennsylvania in  alco standard spun off alco health services the newly formed company increased its sales dramatically through key acquisitions and expanded product lines and went public as amerisource health corporation in  during this period of expansion yost held the positions of group vice president and group president of the central region in  yost became executive vice president of operations for malvern pennsylvaniabased amerisource health corporation two years later in may  yost was promoted to president and ceo and remained as president until december  at which time he added the position of chairman during this period  he led a reorganization of amerisource after the us federal trade commission blocked a proposed merger with mckesson corporation first president and ceo of newly merged company amerisource health corporation and orange californiabased bergen brunswig corporation merged on august   in a  billion deal yost became the president ceo and a member of the board of directors of the new company which was called amerisourcebergen corporation at the time of the merger yost felt that the coming together of the two serviceoriented companies would provide many new kinds of services and programs for its customers along with saving the new company about  million to  million annually in synergies or combined efforts mostly from a consolidation of its distribution centers he remained as amerisourcebergens president until october  then continued as ceo and director simple single focus as the new head of the largest purchaser of generic drugs in the united states yost began to concentrate on improving amerisourcebergens position in the pharmaceutical supply sector by bringing new and innovative products and services to its customers and increasing efficiencies throughout its giant distribution network yost committed himself to the companys only agenda dedicating itself to the distribution business within the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry in fact yost believed americsourcebergen differentiated itself from its competitors such as cardinal health mckesson and owens  minor by not competing with its customers in services to the end user and with this simple focus yost promoted the idea throughout his organization about how to make its retailers more competitive in the market how to increase their revenues cut their costs and improve their margins maximized efficiency and customer service with  billion in projected annual revenues in  and operations in almost every us state yost was given the job of improving the companys overall efficiency while focusing on customer service throughout its  chain and independent pharmacies as well as thousands of hospitals nursing homes and mailorder pharmacies yost began this strenuous task in a number of different key areas yost used a unique decentralized organizational structure that dealt with national sales at the distributioncenter level in fact yost made sure that customer service was handled at the operatingunit level the level closest to the customer which was managed by yosts team of regional vice presidents and general managers this management team had final decisionmaking authority to handle most customer situations that arose within its region while yost talked with these vice presidents on a weekly basis his chief operating officer talked with them every business day while this was happening the vice presidents who had years of experience at their jobs were talking with the customers on a daily basis although yost dealt with customers in a decentralized arrangement he implemented a technologybased program for centralized procurement data processing and other administrative functions throughout his operational structure in order to achieve greater efficiencies yost integrated this technology so that tens of thousands of customers could easily and effortlessly submit millions of daily transactions into its nationwide system such technology included orderentry platforms automated receivables accounting systems and warehouse management systems with such an infrastructure yost wanted to respond rapidly to deliveries improve warehouse efficiencies to a justintime model where products are left in warehouses for a minimal amount of time and provide greater forecasting of product demands all without sacrificing customer service yost also dealt with the two wellestablished drugstore membership buying and marketing programs—bergens good neighbor pharmacy and amerisources family pharmacy—that together had about  independently owned drug stores he combined the two programs into one unified datadriven package that reduced the increasingly heavy workloads of its pharmacists yost also expanded many of the services offered by its pharmacies including a diabeticcare business yost reduced the number of the companys distribution centers from  in  at the time of the companys merger to  in  and projected to reduce them further to  by  in an effort to become as efficient as possible the average amerisource center according to yost handled about  million a year in products in  but now in  took care of more than  billion per year these increased levels of activities were also enhanced with the use of new robotic machines and computer systems that could handle many more products involving advanced stateoftheart automation paperless ordering picking up and tracking and faster turnaround yost also predicted at that time that errors would be greatly reduced with such efficiency efforts expansion plans in  yost directed amerisourcebergen through several major acquisitions he began to acquire smaller drug companies related to but outside its core business area in order to strengthen the companys position in the pharmaceutical supply chain with regards to both customers and suppliers yost specifically stayed away from billiondollar purchases but instead concentrated on acquisitions in the  million to  million range that he thought would help earnings in the most efficient way possible in july  yost acquired the chicago illinoisbased automed technologies for  million yost bought the company in order to use its automated drug dispensing system to lower amerisourcebergens costs for dispensing drugs in pharmacies with only about  percent of retail pharmacies and fewer than  percent of outpatient hospital pharmacies using automation yost planned to employ automeds software equipment and workflow design to automate pharmacy dispensing equipment throughout amerisource yost signed an order for his intent to purchase bridge medical a company based in solana beach california in december  he intended to take advantage of the companys barcodeenabled pointofcare software a bedside scanning system that coordinated the correct medication with a patients barcoded wristband the base price for the acquisition of bridge medical was  million with an incentive option of up to  million depending on future earnings yost liked the company because its products helped to reduce medication errors and as a result decreased the costs of the companys healthcare facilities while increasing their operating efficiencies the third purchase brokered by yost was of the washington dcbased us bioservices corporation a  millionplus deal made in january  bioservices with  revenues of about  million was a specialty pharmaceutical services company that distributed complicated medications for such diseases as aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome cancer multiple sclerosis and hepatitis c to patients across the country the reason that yost purchased bioservices was to expand amerisourcebergens ability to support pharmaceutical manufacturers with complicated products that targeted small markets such as in the biotechnology arena yost continued his acquisition activities with the june  agreement to purchase anderson packaging a privately held contract pharmaceutical packaging company headquartered in rockford illinois the complete purchase amount totaled  million including assumed debt of about  million in the early part of  yost brokered a deal to buy alpharetta georgiabased medselect a privately held provider of automated medication and supply dispensing cabinets for  million including assumed debt twoyear results within a year of taking the helm yost proudly declared that amerisourcebergens management team had progressed greatly with integrating its service programs establishing a common technology platform in many of its pharmacies and raising the amount of use of its programs among its customers after about two years of streamlining activities acquisitions and improved technology within its services yost reported total revenues for amerisourcebergen of  billion in  a  percent increase over  and a net income of  million a  percent increase over  with a  percent share of the us drugdistribution market
