skills  – chetan kapoor – mediumhomepagesign in  sign upchetan kapoorblockedunblockfollowfollowingsoftware is eating the world i decide what goes on the menumar what are your product leadership skills as a product manager you need to have lot of different skill sets while it might be certainly difficult to excel at all the skills needed there are a few skills that you can be aware off that make you a unique product leader and excel at that far greater than the othersover the years i have reached out to lot of people i have worked with to extract feedback from them on what do they think about me as a product leader and what skills i needed to work on while they all did their best to give feedback often times i felt that did not have the correct structure to go by or parameters i was most interested in to know more aboutplease note all these people were not necessarily from product roles some were ceo’s or executives in other important functions of the organisation and hence did not necessarily know the skill set to excel as a pmover last couple of years i have tried something different instead of asking an open ended question “how do you think i can improve ”or some other variation of this i send people a link to a quick survey and asked them very pointed feedback across two important dimensions of product leadership skills first being product encompassing technical management business creative marketing design and consumer insights and second being leader encompassing leadership management strategy resultsoriented culture business maturity and domain expertisei am currently in the second iteration of this form of survey and i can definitely say that it really helps you avoid the blind spots in your product leadership skills and it can really give you a sense of things that you can double down oni won’t share the exact data but below is the bubble chart that i created out of the latest surveywould love to know what other techniques you use to keep yourself
