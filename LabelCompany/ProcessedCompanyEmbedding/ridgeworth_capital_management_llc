prices will fluctuate providing the potential for principal gain or loss intermediateterm higherquality bonds generally offer less risk than longerterm bonds and a lower rate of return generally a strategy’s fixed income securities will decrease in value if interest rates rise and vice versa although a strategy’s yield may be higher than that of fixed income strategies that purchase higherrated securities the potentially higher yield is a function of the greater risk that the fund’s share price will decline mortgagebacked investments involve risk of loss due to prepayments and like any bond
