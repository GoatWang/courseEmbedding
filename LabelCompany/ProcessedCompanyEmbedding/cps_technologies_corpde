and results of operations this document contains forwardlooking statements based on numerous assumptions subject to risks and uncertainties although we believe that the forwardlooking statements are reasonable we do not and cannot give any assurance that our beliefs and expectations will prove to be correct many factors could significantly affect our operations and cause our actual results to be substantially different from our expectations those factors include but are not limited to i general economic and business conditions ii customer acceptance of our products iii materials and manufacturing costs iv the financial condition of customers competitors and suppliers v technological developments vi increased competition vii changes in capital market conditions viii governmental and business conditions in countries where our products are manufactured and sold ix changes in trade regulations x the effect of acquisition activity xi changes in our plans strategies objectives expectations or intentions and xii other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission actual results might differ materially from results suggested by any forwardlooking statements in this report we do not have an obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of the receipt of new information the occurrence of future events or otherwise overview the company provides advanced material solutions to the transportation automotive energy computinginternet telecommunications aerospace defense and oil and gas end markets our primary material solution is metal matrix composites we design manufacture and sell custom metal matrix composite components which improve the performance and reliability of systems in these end markets products we provide include baseplates for motor controllers used in highspeed electric trains subway cars wind turbines and hybrid and electric vehicles we provide baseplates and housings used in radar satellite and avionics applications we provide lids and heatspreaders used with high performance integrated circuits for in internet switches and routers we provide baseplates and housings used in modules built with wide band gap semiconductors like sic and gan cps also assembles housings and packages for hybrid circuits these housings and packages may include mmc components they may include components made of more traditional materials such as aluminum coppertungsten etc cps is a fully qualified manufacturer for many of the worlds largest electronics oems cps is actively working with customers in end markets other than electronics an example is cpss hybridtech armorr for use in armoring military and commercial vehicles in  the company entered into a cooperative agreement with the army research laboratory to further develop large mmc hybridtech armorr module panels although this program ended in  the company continues to receive funded orders from the us army primarily for ballistic armor associated with the development for future combat vehicles and enhancements to present vehicles cpss hybridtech armorr offers lighter weight improved multihit capability and easier attachment to the vehicle compared to alternatives cpss products are custom rather than catalog items they are made to customers designs and are used as components in systems built and sold by our customers at any point in time our product mix will consist of some products with ongoing production demand and some products which are in the prototyping or evaluation stages at our customers the company seeks to have a portfolio of products which include products in every stage of the technology adoption lifecycle at our customers cps growth is dependent upon the level of demand for those products already in production as well as its success in achieving new design wins for future products as a manufacturer of highly technical and custom products the company incurs fixed costs needed to support the business but which do not vary significantly with changes in sales volume these costs include the fixed costs of applications engineering tooling design and fabrication process engineering etc accordingly particularly given our current size changes in sales volume generally result in even greater changes in financial performance on a percentage basis as fixed costs are spread over a larger or smaller base sales volume is therefore a key financial metric used by management the company believes the underlying demand for metal matrix composites is growing as the electronics and other industries seek higher performance higher reliability and reduced costs cps believes that the company is well positioned to offer our solutions to current and new customers as these demands grow in  its top three customers accounted for  of revenue and the remaining  of revenue was derived from  other customers in  the top three customers accounted for  of revenue and the remaining  of revenue was derived from approximately  customers application of critical accounting policies financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such the company is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented cpss significant accounting policies are presented within note  to the financial statements the significant accounting policies which management believes are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  in  revenue is recognized in accordance with the provisions of the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no  which establishes guidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements sab no  requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured shipping terms are customarily exw exworks shipping point which terms are consistent with fob shipping point revenues for products sold in the normal course of business are recognized upon shipment when delivery terms are exw shipping point and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met the company also has consigned inventory agreements with a few customers for product shipped under consigned inventory agreements the company recognizes revenue when the customer either notifies cps that they have picked the product from the consigned inventory or in some cases when sixty days have elapsed from the date the shipment arrives at the customers location of the inventory of  million at december    thousand was located at customers locations pursuant to consigned inventory agreements of the total inventory of  million at december    thousand was located at customers locations pursuant to consigned inventory agreements advance payments if any in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue accounts receivable the company performs ongoing monitoring of the status of its receivables based on the payment history and the credit worthiness of our customers as determined by a review of their current credit information management continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified while such credit losses have historically been low and within expectations there is no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past although the companys major customers are large and have a favorable payment history a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of one of them could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of accounts receivable and future operating results sales returns are offset against the related amounts invoiced in accounts receivable inventory the company has a buildtoorder business model and manufactures product to ship against specific purchase orders occasionally cps manufactures product in advance of anticipated purchase orders to level load production or prepare for a rampup in demand in addition  of the companys products are custom meaning they are produced to a customers design and generally cannot be used for any other purpose purchase orders generally have cancellation provisions which vary from customer to customer but which can result occasionally in cps producing product which the customer is not obligated to purchase however once a product has gone into production most customer orders are recurring and order cancellations are rare the companys general obsolescence policy is to write off obsolete inventory when there has been no activity on a particular part for a twelve month period and there are no pending customer orders in some cases customers place blanket purchase orders and request the company to maintain inventory sufficient to respond quickly upon receiving a shipment request the company manufactures to specifications and the products typically have a life which extends over several years and does not deteriorate over time therefore the risk of obsolescence due to the passage of time per se is minimal however in order to more efficiently schedule production or to meet agreements with customers to have inventory in the pipeline the company occasionally manufactures products in advance of purchase orders in these instances the company bears the risk that it will be left with product manufactures to specification for which there are no customer purchase orders the company scrutinizes its inventory and in the absence of pending orders or strong evidence of future sales establishes an obsolescence reserve when there has been no activity on a particular part for a twelve month period in determining inventory cost the company uses the firstin firstout method and states inventory at the lower of cost or market virtually all of the companys inventory is customer specific as a result if a customers order is cancelled it is unlikely that cps would be able to sell that inventory to another customer likewise if the company chooses to manufacture product in advance of anticipated purchase orders and those orders did not materialize it is unlikely that it would be able to sell that inventory to another customer the value of cpss work in process and finished goods is based on the assumption that specific customers will take delivery of specific items of inventory the company has not experienced losses to date as a result of customer cancellations and has not established a reserve for such cancellations the company typically buys lots of components for its hermetic packaging products often all the components in a lot are not necessary to complete the order annually the company reviews this unused material and establishes an obsolescence reserve for the amount it does not expect to use over the next three years property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost depreciation of equipment is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life generally five years for production equipment and three to five years for furniture and office equipment amortization of equipment under capital leases is calculated on a straightline basis over the life of the lease maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred upon retirement or sale the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from their respective accounts any gains or losses on the disposition of property and equipment are included in the results of operations in the period in which they occur income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the net tax effects of tax credits operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes the company considers many factors in assessing whether or not a valuation allowance for its deferred tax asset is warranted on the positive side the company considered such factors as its at december   the companys deferred tax asset and other temporary differences which will require taxable income of approximately  million and reversals of existing temporary differences to fully utilize assuming an effective corporate tax rate of  the company has concluded that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax asset will be fully realized current projections of future taxable income including the reversal of temporary differences reflect the companys belief that it has attractive growth opportunities and a favorable cost structure these projections support the conclusion that the company will generate taxable income sufficient to utilize the losses before they expire the companys policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense as of december   and december   the company had no accruals for interest or penalties related to income tax matters the company did not have any uncertain tax positions at december   or december   which required accrual or disclosure income tax effects related to sharebased compensation that are in excess or less than grantdate fair value less any proceeds received on exercise of stock prices are recognized as either an increase or decrease to additional paidin capital upon exercise these tax effects are either offset against currently payable taxes or the benefit of net operating loss utilization results of operations year ended december    compared to the year ended december    total revenues were  million in  a  decrease compared with the  million generated in  this decrease was due primarily to a reduction in the sales of baseplates the sale of hermetic packages fracking balls and lids were also down offset in part by an increase in armor revenues there were no significant price reductions during the year gross margin in  totaled  million or  of sales in  the companys gross margin totaled  million or  of sales the decrease in margin was directly attributable to the reduction in sales offset in part by reduced spending on factory support costs selling general and administrative sga expenses totaled  million in  down  when compared with sga spending of  million in  this difference of  million was due to lower sales commissions incentive compensation professional fees k match and legal costs offset in small part by an increased spending on sales and marketing activities in china the company generated  of other income in   of this was interest and  was due to the sale of used equipment in excess of book value as a result of lower volume offset in part by reduced spending on factory overhead and sga the company incurred an operating loss of  million in  compared with an operating profit of  million in  the effective tax rate in  was  and in  was  significant fourth quarter activity in  revenues totaled  million versus  million in the last quarter of  representing a  decline the great majority of the  million reduction was due to a lower shipment of baseplates a reduction in the sales of frac balls also contributed to the shortfall the impact of price changes was insignificant in the quarter compared with the same period in  gross margin decreased in the fourth quarter of  compared with the fourth quarter of  from  thousand to  thousand this decline was directly associated with the reduction in sales volume no significant impact from price changes last quarter  compared with last quarter  sga expenses declined from  thousand to  thousand approximately half of this reduction was associated with commissions on lower sales while reductions in professional fees and the absence of a k match expense also contributed to the reduction primarily as a result of lower sales volume the company incurred an operating loss for the fourth quarter of  of  thousands compared with an operating profit of  thousand in the same quarter of  the net loss of the last quarter of  was  thousand compared with a net profit of  thousand in the fourth quarter of  liquidity and capital resources the companys cash and cash equivalents at december   totaled  million flat with the  million existing at december   this occurred because reductions in working capital approximately offset operating losses incurred during the year accounts receivable at december  totaled  million compared with  million at december   the days sales outstanding dsos increased slightly from  days at the end of  to  days at the end of  inventories totaled  million at december   compared with inventories of  million at december  reflecting the reduction in volume the inventory turnover in  was  times based on a  point average compared with  times in  the company chose to adopt accounting standards update no  income taxes early as a result of this adoption the entirety of deferred taxes has been classified as longterm after previously separating this asset between current and long term all consigned inventory is shipped under existing purchase orders and per customers requests of the inventory of  million at december    thousand was located at customers locations pursuant to consigned inventory agreements of the total inventory of  million at december    thousand was located at customers locations pursuant to consigned inventory agreements contractual obligations all  in s in early may  the company renewed its  revolving line of credit loc and  of an equipment finance facility lease line with santander bank both agreements mature in may  the loc is secured by the accounts receivable and other assets of the company has an interest rate of prime and a oneyear term under the terms of the agreement the company is required to maintain its operating accounts with santander bank the loc and the lease line are cross defaulted and cross collateralized the company is also subject to certain financial covenants within the terms of the loc that require the company to maintain a targeted coverage ratio as well as targeted debt to equity and current ratios at december   the company was in compliance with all existing covenants at december   the company had not utilized the equipment finance facility and therefore had  available at december   the company had no borrowings under this loc and its borrowing base at the time would have permitted an additional  to have been borrowed the financial covenants with santander bank are identical for the loc and lease line the covenant requirements are shown below together with the actual ratios achieved covenant requirement actual debt service coverage ratio minimum of  na current ratio minimum of x x liabilities to tangible net worth maximum of x x borrowings under the lease line maximum of k none borrowings under the line of credit maximum of k none management believes that cash flows from operations existing cash balances and the annual leasing and credit line in place with santander bank expires in may  will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for the foreseeable future we would expect to continue to renew the lease line and loc agreements annually as we have in the past several years however there is no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient revenues or reduce certain discretionary spending in the event that planned operational goals are not met as of december   the company had  thousand of construction in progress and no outstanding commitments to purchase production equipment the company intends to finance production equipment in construction in progress and outstanding commitments under the lease agreement with existing cash balances and funds generated by operations the company entered into a year lease for the norton facilities effective on march   the leased facilities comprise approximately  thousand square feet subsequently the company obtained two oneyear options which enabled it to continue to lease through february   in june  the company exercised the option to extend the lease through february   the lease is a triple net lease wherein the company is responsible for payment of all real estate taxes operating costs and utilities the company also has an option to buy the property and a first right of refusal during the term of the lease annual rental payments are  thousand in year one increasing to  thousand at the end of the extended term in february  the company entered into a lease for an additional  thousand square feet in attleboro the lease term is for one year and has an option to extend the lease for five additional oneyear periods monthly rent which includes utilities is  the company renewed the lease in  for one additional year and also obtained two years of additional options which could extend the company use through february  in  the company exercised its option to extend the lease through the end of february  offbalance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements recent accounting pronouncements a summary of recent accounting standards is included in note  to the financial statements inflation inflation had no material effect on the results of operations or financial condition during the last few years there can be no

computinginternet telecommunications aerospace defense and oil and gas end markets our primary material solution is metal matrix composites we design manufacture and sell custom metal matrix composite components which improve the performance and reliability of systems in these end markets the company is an important participant in the growing movement towards alternative energy and green lifestyles for example the company’s products are used in highspeed trains mass transit hybrid and electric cars windturbines for electricity generation as well as routers and switches for the internet which enable telecommuting these applications involve energy use or energy generation the company’s products allow higher performance and improved energy efficiency metal matrix composites mmcs are a class of materials consisting of a combination of metals and ceramics compared to conventional materials mmcs provide superior thermal conductivity improved thermal expansion matching greater stiffness and lighter weight for  years cps has been the leader in manufacturing mmc components products we provide include baseplates for motor controllers used in highspeed electric trains subway cars wind turbines and hybrid and electric vehicles we provide baseplates and housings used in radar satellite and avionics applications we provide lids and heatspreaders used with high performance integrated circuits for use in internet switches and routers we provide baseplates and housings used in modules built with wide band gap semiconductors like sic and gan cps also assembles housings and packages for hybrid circuits these housings and packages may include mmc components they may also include components made of more traditional materials such as aluminum coppertungsten etc cps is a fully qualified manufacturer for many of the world’s largest electronics oems cps is actively working with customers in end markets other than electronics an example is cps’s hybridtech armor® for use in armoring military and commercial vehicles in  the company entered into a cooperative agreement with the army research laboratory to further develop large mmc hybridtech armor® module panels  although this program ended in  the company continues to receive funded orders from the us army primarily for ballistic armor associated with the development for future combat vehicles and enhancements to present vehicles cps’s hybridtech armor® offers lighter weight improved multihit capability and easier attachment to the vehicle compared to alternatives cps management believes our business model of providing advanced material solutions to a portfolio of high growth end markets in various stages of the technology adoption lifecycle provides cps with the opportunity for sustained growth and a diversified customer base we believe we have validated this model as we are now supplying customers at all stages of the technology adoption lifecycle our products are manufactured by proprietary processes we have developed including the quicksettm injection molding process ‘quickset process’ and the quickcasttm pressure infiltration process ‘quickcast process’ cps was incorporated in massachusetts in  as ceramics process systems corporation and reincorporated in delaware in april  through a merger into a whollyowned delaware subsidiary organized for purposes of the reincorporation in july  cps completed our initial public offering of  million shares of our common stock in march  the company changed its name from ceramics process systems corporation to cps technologies corporation overview of markets and products electronics markets overview enduser demand continues to motivate the electronics industry to produce products which  operate at higher speeds  are smaller in size and  operate with higher reliability while these three requirements result in products of everincreasing performance these requirements also create a fundamental challenge for the designer to manage the heat generated by the system operating at higher speeds andor higher power smaller assemblies further concentrate the heat and increase the difficulty of removing it this challenge is found at each level in an electronic assembly at the integrated circuit level speeds are increasing and line widths are decreasing at the circuit board level higher density devices are placed closer together on circuit boards and at the system level higher density circuit boards are being assembled closer together the designer must resolve the thermal management issues or the system will fail for every  degree celsius rise in temperature above a threshold level the reliability of a circuit is decreased by approximately half in addition heat usually causes changes in parameters which degrade the performance of both active and passive electronic components to resolve thermal management issues the designer is primarily concerned with two properties of the materials which comprise the system  thermal conductivity which is the rate at which heat moves through materials and  thermal expansion rate coefficient of thermal expansion or cte which is the rate at which materials expand or contract as temperature changes the designer must ensure that the temperature of an electronic assembly stays within a range in which the differences in the expansion rates of the materials in the assembly do not cause a failure from breaking delaminating etc cps combines at the microstructural level a ceramic with a metal to produce a metal matrix composite which has the thermal conductivity needed to remove heat and a thermal expansion rate which is sufficiently close to other components in the assembly to ensure the assembly is reliable the ceramic is silicon carbide sic the metal is aluminum al and the composite is aluminum silicon carbide alsic a metalmatrix composite cps can adjust the thermal expansion rate of alsic components to match the specific application by modifying the amount of sic compared to the amount of al in the component the company also has the capability of encapsulating pyrolytic graphite inserts to enhance the thermal conductivity of the alsic composite cps produces products made of alsic in the shapes and configurations required for each application for example in the form of lids substrates housings etc every product is made to a customer’s blueprint the cps process technology allows most products to be made to net shape requiring no or little final machining although the company’s focus today is on alsic components it believes its proprietary quickset quickcast process technology can be used to produce other metalmatrix composites which may meet future market needs today the problem of thermal management is most acute in highperformance highdensity applications such as highperformance microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits for internet routers and switches motor controllers for trains subway cars and wind turbines and components for satellite communications however as the trends towards faster speeds reduced size and increased reliability continue and as highdensity circuitry is used in a larger number of applications we believe our products will be used in an increasing number of applications across many end markets structural markets overview structural applications perform primarily a mechanical rather than electrical function in any mechanical assembly with moving parts the stiffness and weight of moving parts can have a significant impact on the performance and energy efficiency of the assembly in particular in equipment with reciprocating components increasing the stiffness and reducing the weight of reciprocating components improves the performance and energy efficiency of the equipment today many mechanical components are made of steel because steel has the stiffness required for the particular application alsic has approximately the same stiffness as steel but is only onethird the weight of steel alsic is however higher cost than steel however we believe there are many mechanical applications where the customer will pay the higher cost for alsic because of significant improvements in performance resulting from the superior stiffnesstoweight ratio of alsic examples of structural applications for which we have developed and supplied components include robotic arms for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and components the company continues to identify opportunities for using advanced materials in such diverse areas as fracking in oil and gas nonskid coatings fireheat barriers consumer electronics and working with nuclear waste specific markets and products motor controller applications insulated gate bipolar transistor igbt applications the use of power modules to control electric motors of all sizes is growing this growth is the result of several factors including emerging highpower applications which demand power controllers such as trains subways and certain industrial equipment and cost declines in power modules which increasingly make variable speed drives cost effective power semiconductors are a very significant portion of the cost of variable speed drives and the cost of the module housing and thermal management system are also significant declines in the costs of all these components is driving increased use of variable speed drives we provide baseplates and heat spreaders on which power semiconductors are mounted to produce modules for motor control the power semiconductors are typically igbts and these applications are often referred to as igbt applications our alsic baseplates have sufficient thermal conductivity to allow for removal of heat through the baseplate and have a thermal expansion rate sufficiently similar to the other components in the assembly to ensure reliability over time as the assembly thermally cycles we believe this market will continue to grow as the use of power modules penetrates additional motor applications and as electric motors themselves penetrate new applications such as the hybrid electric vehicle today our primary products for igbt applications are used in electric trains subway cars windgenerating turbines and hybrid and electric vehicles major automobile companies around the world are introducing hybrid electric vehicles hevs and electric vehicle evs at an increasing rate this focus on more energy efficient vehicles is being driven by increases in energy costs and concerns about climate change there are many varieties of hevs and evs but all hevs and evs contain an electric motor and contain one or more motor controller modules the company provides baseplates on which motor controller modules are assembled these baseplates are lighter weight and provide greater reliability than baseplates made from more conventional materials the company is working with multiple tier one and tier two suppliers to the automobile industry on several new designs for future introduction the company believes the hev and ev markets will be the source of significant and longterm growth for the company lids and heat spreaders for highperformance microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits and other integrated circuits flipchip applications increases in speed circuit density and the number of connections in microprocessor chips cpus and applicationspecific integrated circuits asics are accelerating a transition in the way in which these circuits are packaged packages provide mechanical protection to the integrated circuit ic enable the ic to be connected to other circuits via pins solder bumps or other connectors and allow attachment of a heat sink or fan to ensure the ic does not overheat in the past most highperformance ics were electrically connected to the package by fine wires in a process known as wire bonding today most highperformance semiconductors are connected to the package by placing metal bumps on the connection points of the die turning the die upside down in the package and directly connecting the bumps on the die with corresponding bumps on the package base by reflowing the bumps this is referred to as a flipchip package flip chip packages allow for connection of a larger number of leads in a smaller space and can provide other electrical performance advantages compared to wire bonded packages in many flip chip configurations a lid or heat spreader is placed over the die to protect the die from mechanical damage and to facilitate the removal of heat from the die often a heat sink or fan is then attached to the lid for a highdensity die the package designer must ensure that the lid has sufficient thermal conductivity to remove heat from the die and that all components of the package assembly  the die itself the package base and the package lid  are made from materials with sufficiently similar thermal expansion rates to ensure the assembly will not break apart over time as it thermally cycles our composite material alsic has been developed to meet these two needs it is engineered to have sufficient thermal conductivity to allow the heat generated by the die to be removed through the lid and it is engineered to expand upon heating at a rate similar to other materials used in the package assembly in order to ensure reliability of the package over time as it thermally cycles we produce lids made of alsic for high performance microprocessors and applicationspecific integrated circuits used in servers internet switches and other applications most participants in the semiconductor industry believe the densities of ics will continue to increase following the wellknown moore’s law as ic densities increase generally so does the ic size and the amount of heat generated by the ic we believe the need for thermal management will continue to grow rapidly customers we sell primarily to major microelectronics systems houses in the united states europe and asia our customers typically purchase prototype and evaluation quantities of our products over a one to three year period before purchasing production volumes in  our three largest customers accounted for   and  of revenues respectively in  approximately  of our revenues were derived from commercial applications and  from defenserelated applications research and development in  costs incurred related to funding under the cooperative agreement totaled  thousand of which essentially  was reimbursed by the us army and was recorded as revenue this revenue of  thousand resulted in a gross margin of  thousand in  no costs were incurred as the contract expired march   availability of raw materials we use a variety of raw materials from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers these materials are primarily aluminum ingots ceramic powders and chemicals the raw materials we use are available from domestic and foreign sources and none is believed to be scarce or restricted for national security reasons we use no conflict metals patents and trade secrets as of december   the company had  united states patents  in addition the company had several international patents covering the same subject matter as the us patents licensees of these patents have rights to use certain patents as defined in their respective license agreements we intend to continue to apply for domestic and foreign patent protection in appropriate cases in other cases we believe we are better served by reliance on trade secret protection in all cases we seek protection for our technological developments to preserve our competitive position backlog and contracts over  of the companys product sales are custom in that they are based on customers’ drawings and the large majority of these sales are designed in and are sold over multiple years major customers typically give the company a nonbinding forecast of demand for a oneyear period and then negotiate a pricing agreement with the company valid for that oneyear period each week customers then issue releases or authorizations to ship under the pricing agreements at any point in time the contractually binding backlog represented by the releases in hand does not necessarily reflect underlying demand given this situation the company does not believe backlog data is helpful to investors competition we have developed and expect to continue to develop products for a number of different end markets and we will encounter competition from different producers of metalmatrix composites and other competing materials we believe that the principal competitive factors in our end markets today include technical competence product performance quality reliability price corporate reputation and strength of sales and marketing resources we believe our proprietary processes reputation and the price at which we can offer products for sale will enable us to compete successfully in the many electronics end markets however we do have one major direct competitor producing metal matrix composites that company denka is based in japan and sells to our major customers in europe and japan government regulation we produce nonnuclear nonmedical hazardous waste in our development and manufacturing operations the disposal of such waste is governed by state and federal regulations various customers vendors and collaborative development agreement partners of cps may reside abroad thereby possibly requiring export and import of raw materials intermediate products and finished products as well as potential technology transfer abroad under collaborative development agreements these types of activities are regulated by bureaus within the departments of commerce state and treasury in  the company entered into a cooperative agreement with the us army research laboratory to perform research and development concerning hybrid metal matrix composite encapsulated ceramic armor technology the cooperative agreement was a fouryear agreement recently expired march   which was  funded by the us department of defense and  funded by cps revenues from this cooperative agreement are recognized proportionally as costs are incurred we are reimbursed for reasonable and allocable costs up to the reimbursement limits set by the cooperative agreement all payments to the company for work performed on this cooperative agreement are subject to audit and adjustment by the defense contract audit agency adjustments if any are recognized in the period made employees as of december   we had  permanent fulltime employees  were engaged in manufacturing and engineering and  in sales and administration including finance hr and general management none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our relations with our employees to be excellent item a risk factors we are heavily dependent on the electronics industry and changes in the industry could harm our business and operating results the electronics industry is subject to economic cycles demand in some segments is currently volatile and is likely in the future to experience recessionary periods a protracted general recession in the electronics industry could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our operating results may fluctuate substantially which may cause our stock price to fall our quarterly and annual results of operations have varied in the past and our operating results may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors including but not limited to timing of orders from major customers mix of products and services pricing and other competitive pressures delays in prototype shipments economic conditions in the electronics industry raw material costs and our ability to time expenditures in anticipation of future revenues some executive officers and key personnel are critical to our business and these key personnel may not remain with the company in the future our success depends upon the continued service of some executive officers and other key personnel our employees are not bound by employment agreements and there can be no assurance that the company will retain its officers and key employees we may need additional capital in the future which may not be available if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements we will have to raise additional funds the sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our shareholders if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing agreements on unattractive terms the trading price of our common stock may be volatile the trading prices of our common stock has been and could in the future be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results developments in the electronics industry changes in general economic conditions and economic conditions in the electronics industry and other factors in addition the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market prices of technology companies and which have been unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of those companies these broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline the company relies on a small number of customers for a large percentage of its revenues historically the company has had a small number of customers representing a large percentage of its total sales although the company endeavors to expand its customer base we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our revenues in any given period for the foreseeable future the reliance makes us particularly susceptible to factors affecting those customers if such customers’ business declines and as a result our sales to such customers decline without corresponding sales orders from other customers our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected the growth of our business depends upon the development and successful commercial acceptance of our new products our failure to develop manufacture and sell new products in quantities sufficient to offset a decline in revenue from existing products or to successfully manage product and related inventory transactions could harm our business we depend upon timely and efficient completion of design and development implementation of manufacturing processes and effective sales marketing and customer service because of the complexity of our products significant delays may occur in introducing new products or between a product’s initial introduction and volume production technological changes may make our products obsolete or result in decreased prices or increased expenses although our products are “designedin” and often have lives lasting several years any technological changes could eliminate our competitive advantages this could lead to significant price erosion for products our success will depend in part on our ability to develop and offer more advanced products in the future to anticipate both future demand and the technology to supply that demand to enhance our current products and services to provide those products and services at competitive prices on a timely and costeffective basis to achieve market acceptance of those products and services our military business could suffer as a result of the pressures to reduce defense spending over the past few years revenues from our contract with the us army research laboratory represented less than  of the company’s total revenue pressures to reduce national spending on defense could make it difficult to continue to generate revenues from the military sector in the near future exchange rates can impact our business adversely  our major competitor is based in japan and as a result our relative costs vary by the yendollar exchange rate as the dollar strengthens versus the yen our relative costs increase affecting our margins and prices to major customers any future action by the us congress lowering the federal corporate income tax rate andor eliminating the federal corporate alternative minimum tax could result in the reduction of the net deferred tax asset and a corresponding charge against earnings the deferred tax asset reported on the company’s balance sheet represents the net amount of income taxes expected to be received upon the reversal of the temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by enacted tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements as of december   the company’s net deferred tax asset was computed using the federal statutory rate of  the president of the united states and members of congress have announced plans to lower the federal corporate income tax rate from its current level of a maximum of  and to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax if these plans ultimately result in the enactment of new laws lowering the corporate income tax rate andor eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax the company’s net deferred tax asset would be remeasured this would result in a reduction of the deferred tax asset in the period of the law change and a corresponding charge against earnings our sales of fracking balls are adversely affected by a decline in oil prices the fracking industry in north america is adversely impacted by low oil prices as a result our sales of fracking balls are directly affected item b unresolved staff comments none item  properties as of december   all our manufacturing engineering sales and administrative operations were and continue to be located in leased facilities in norton massachusetts and attleboro massachusetts the company entered into a year lease for the norton facilities effective on march   the leased facilities comprise approximately  thousand square feet subsequently the company obtained two oneyear options which enabled it to continue to lease through february   in june  the company exercised the option to extend the lease through february   the lease is a triple net lease wherein the company is responsible for payment of all real estate taxes operating costs and utilities the company also has an option to buy the property and a first right of refusal during the term of the

of more traditional materials such as aluminum coppertungsten etc cps is a fully qualified manufacturer for many of the world’s largest electronics oems cps is actively working with customers in end markets other than electronics an example is cps’s hybridtech armor® for use in armoring military and commercial vehicles in  the company entered into a cooperative agreement with the army research laboratory to further develop large mmc hybridtech armor® module panels  although this program ended in  the company continues to receive funded orders from the us army primarily for ballistic armor associated with the development for future combat vehicles and enhancements to present vehicles cps’s hybridtech armor® offers lighter weight improved multihit capability and easier attachment to the vehicle compared to alternatives cps’s products are custom rather than catalog items they are made to customers’ designs and are used as components in systems built and sold by our customers at any point in time our product mix will consist of some products with ongoing production demand and some products which are in the prototyping or evaluation stages at our customers the company seeks to have a portfolio of products which include products in every stage of the technology adoption lifecycle at our customers cps’ growth is dependent upon the level of demand for those products already in production as well as its success in achieving new design wins for future products as a manufacturer of highly technical and custom products the company incurs fixed costs needed to support the business but which do not vary significantly with changes in sales volume these costs include the fixed costs of applications engineering tooling design and fabrication process engineering etc accordingly particularly given our current size changes in sales volume generally result in even greater changes in financial performance on a percentage basis as fixed costs are spread over a larger or smaller base sales volume is therefore a key financial metric used by management the company believes the underlying demand for metal matrix composites is growing as the electronics and other industries seek higher performance higher reliability and reduced costs cps believes that the company is well positioned to offer our solutions to current and new customers as these demands grow in  its top three customers accounted for  of revenue and the remaining  of revenue was derived from  other customers in  the top three customers accounted for  of revenue and the remaining  of revenue was derived from approximately  customers application of critical accounting policies financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such the company is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented cps’s significant accounting policies are presented within note  to the financial statements the significant accounting policies which management believes are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  in  revenue is recognized in accordance with the provisions of the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no  which establishes guidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements sab no  requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured shipping terms are customarily exw exworks shipping point which terms are consistent with “fob shipping point” revenues for products sold in the normal course of business are recognized upon shipment when delivery terms are exw shipping point and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met the company also has consigned inventory agreements with a few customers for product shipped under consigned inventory agreements the company recognizes revenue when the customer either notifies cps that they have picked the product from the consigned inventory or in some cases when sixty days have elapsed from the date the shipment arrives at the customer’s location of the inventory of  million at december    thousand was located at customers’ locations pursuant to consigned inventory agreements of the total inventory of  million at december    thousand was located at customers’ locations pursuant to consigned inventory agreements advance payments if any in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue accounts receivable the company performs ongoing monitoring of the status of its receivables based on the payment history and the credit worthiness of our customers as determined by a review of their current credit information management continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified while such credit losses have historically been low and within expectations there is no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past although the company’s major customers are large and have a favorable payment history a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of one of them could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of accounts receivable and future operating results sales returns are offset against the related amounts invoiced in accounts receivable inventory the company has a buildtoorder business model and manufactures product to ship against specific purchase orders occasionally cps manufactures product in advance of anticipated purchase orders to level load production or prepare for a rampup in demand in addition  of the company’s products are custom meaning they are produced to a customer’s design and generally cannot be used for any other purpose purchase orders generally have cancellation provisions which vary from customer to customer but which can result occasionally in cps producing product which the customer is not obligated to purchase however once a product has gone into production most customer orders are recurring and order cancellations are rare the company’s general obsolescence policy is to write off obsolete inventory when there has been no activity on a particular part for a twelve month period and there are no pending customer orders in some cases customers place blanket purchase orders and request the company to maintain inventory sufficient to respond quickly upon receiving a shipment request the company manufactures to specifications and the products typically have a life which extends over several years and does not deteriorate over time therefore the risk of obsolescence due to the passage of time per se is minimal however in order to more efficiently schedule production or to meet agreements with customers to have inventory in the pipeline the company occasionally manufactures products in advance of purchase orders in these instances the company bears the risk that it will be left with product manufactures to specification for which there are no customer purchase orders the company scrutinizes its inventory and in the absence of pending orders or strong evidence of future sales establishes an obsolescence reserve when there has been no activity on a particular part for a twelve month period in determining inventory cost the company uses the firstin firstout method and states inventory at the lower of cost or market virtually all of the company’s inventory is customer specific as a result if a customer’s order is cancelled it is unlikely that cps would be able to sell that inventory to another customer likewise if the company chooses to manufacture product in advance of anticipated purchase orders and those orders did not materialize it is unlikely that it would be able to sell that inventory to another customer the value of cps’s work in process and finished goods is based on the assumption that specific customers will take delivery of specific items of inventory the company has not experienced losses to date as a result of customer cancellations and has not established a reserve for such cancellations the company typically buys ‘lots’ of components for its hermetic packaging products often all the components in a lot are not necessary to complete the order annually the company reviews this unused material and establishes an obsolescence reserve for the amount it does not expect to use over the next three years property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost depreciation of equipment is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life generally five years for production equipment and three to five years for furniture and office equipment amortization of equipment under capital leases is calculated on a straightline basis over the life of the lease maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred upon retirement or sale the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from their respective accounts any gains or losses on the disposition of property and equipment are included in the results of operations in the period in which they occur income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the net tax effects of tax credits operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes the company considers many factors in assessing whether or not a valuation allowance for its deferred tax asset is warranted on the positive side the company considered such factors as its history of taxable earnings three of the last four years had operating profits global customer base consisting of large companies with significant resources current products and their expected life technological advantages potential for price increases trend of improved manufacturing efficiencies and the magnitude of the deferred tax asset compared with the company’s expectation of future earnings over the remaining life of the asset on the negative side the company considered such factors as the global economic environment the company’s ability to absorb a period of operating losses and negative cash flow and the potential for the technological breakthroughs and substitution of the company’s products by lower cost solutions at december   the company’s deferred tax asset and other temporary differences which will require taxable income of approximately  million and reversals of existing temporary differences to fully utilize assuming an effective corporate tax rate of  the company has concluded that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax asset will be fully realized current projections of future taxable income including the reversal of temporary differences reflect the company’s belief that it has attractive growth opportunities and a favorable cost structure these projections support the conclusion that the company will generate taxable income sufficient to utilize the losses before they expire the company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense as of december   and december   the company had no accruals for interest or penalties related to income tax matters the company did not have any uncertain tax positions at december   or december   which required accrual or disclosure income tax effects related to sharebased compensation that are in excess or less than grantdate fair value less any proceeds received on exercise of stock prices are recognized as either an increase or decrease to additional paidin capital upon exercise these tax effects are either offset against currently payable taxes or the benefit of net operating loss utilization results of operations   year ended december   “” compared to the year ended december   “”   total revenues were  million in  a  decrease compared with the  million generated in  this decrease was due primarily to a reduction in the sales of baseplates the sale of hermetic packages fracking balls and lids were also down offset in part by an increase in armor revenues there were no significant price reductions during the year   gross margin in  totaled  million or  of sales in  the company’s gross margin totaled  million or  of sales the decrease in margin was directly attributable to the reduction in sales offset in part by reduced spending on factory support costs   selling general and administrative sga expenses totaled  million in  down  when compared with sga spending of  million in  this difference of  million was due to lower sales commissions incentive compensation professional fees k match and legal costs offset in small part by an increased spending on sales and marketing activities in china   the company generated  of “other income” in   of this was interest and  was due to the sale of used equipment in excess of book value   as a result of lower volume offset in part by reduced spending on factory overhead and sga the company incurred an operating loss of  million in  compared with an operating profit of  million in  the effective tax rate in  was  and in  was    significant fourth quarter activity in    revenues totaled  million versus  million in the last quarter of  representing a  decline the great majority of the  million reduction was due to a lower shipment of baseplates a reduction in the sales of frac balls also contributed to the shortfall the impact of price changes was insignificant in the quarter compared with the same period in    gross margin decreased in the fourth quarter of  compared with the fourth quarter of  from  thousand to  thousand this decline was directly associated with the reduction in sales volume no significant impact from price changes last quarter  compared with last quarter    sga expenses declined from  thousand to  thousand approximately half of this reduction was associated with commissions on lower sales while reductions in professional fees and the absence of a k match expense also contributed to the reduction   primarily as a result of lower sales volume the company incurred an operating loss for the fourth quarter of  of  thousands compared with an operating profit of  thousand in the same quarter of  the net loss of the last quarter of  was  thousand compared with a net profit of  thousand in the fourth quarter of    liquidity and capital resources   the company’s cash and cash equivalents at december   totaled  million flat with the  million existing at december   this occurred because reductions in working capital approximately offset operating losses incurred during the year   accounts receivable at december  totaled  million compared with  million at december   the “days sales outstanding” dsos increased slightly from  days at the end of  to  days at the end of    inventories totaled  million at december   compared with inventories of  million at december  reflecting the reduction in volume the inventory turnover in  was  times based on a  point average compared with  times in    the company chose to adopt accounting standards update no  income taxes early as a result of this adoption the entirety of deferred taxes has been classified as longterm after previously separating this asset between current and long term   all consigned inventory is shipped under existing purchase orders and per customers’ requests of the inventory of  million at december    thousand was located at customers’ locations pursuant to consigned inventory agreements of the total inventory of  million at december    thousand was located at customers’ locations pursuant to consigned inventory agreements contractual obligations all  in ’s in early may  the company renewed its  revolving line of credit “loc” and  of an equipment finance facility “lease line” with santander bank   both agreements mature in may   the loc is secured by the accounts receivable and other assets of the company has an interest rate of prime and a oneyear term under the terms of the agreement the company is required to maintain its operating accounts with santander bank the loc and the lease line are cross defaulted and cross collateralized the company is also subject to certain financial covenants within the terms of the loc that require the company to maintain a targeted coverage ratio as well as targeted debt to equity and current ratios at december   the company was in compliance with all existing covenants at december   the company had not utilized the equipment finance facility and therefore had  available at december   the company had no borrowings under this loc and its borrowing base at the time would have permitted an additional  to have been borrowed the financial covenants with santander bank are identical for the loc and lease line the covenant requirements are shown below together with the actual ratios achieved covenant requirement actual debt service coverage ratio minimum of  na current ratio minimum of x x liabilities to tangible net worth maximum of x x       borrowings under the lease line maximum of k none borrowings under the line of credit maximum of k none   based on receivables at          management believes that cash flows from operations existing cash balances and the annual leasing and credit line in place with santander bank expires in may  will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for the foreseeable future we would expect to continue to renew the lease line and loc agreements annually as we have in the past several years however there is no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient revenues or reduce certain discretionary spending in the event that planned operational goals are not met as of december   the company had  thousand of construction in progress and no outstanding commitments to purchase production equipment the company intends to finance production equipment in construction in progress and outstanding commitments under the lease agreement with existing cash balances and funds generated by operations the company entered into a year lease for the norton facilities effective on march   the leased facilities comprise approximately  thousand square feet subsequently the company obtained two oneyear options which enabled it to continue to lease through february   in june  the company exercised the option to extend the lease through february   the lease is a triple net lease wherein the company is responsible for payment of all real estate taxes operating costs and utilities the company also

february  the company entered into a lease for an additional  thousand square feet in attleboro the lease term is for one year and has an option to extend the lease for five additional oneyear periods monthly rent which includes utilities is  the company renewed the lease in  for one additional year and also obtained two years of additional options which could extend the company use through

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market as determined under the firstin firstout method fifo or market a reserve for obsolete inventories is based on factors regarding the sales and usage of such inventories including inventories manufactured for specific customers the company’s general obsolescence policy is to write off obsolete inventory when there has been no activity on a particular part for a twelve month period and there are no pending customer orders d property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost depreciation of equipment is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life generally five years for production equipment and three to five years for furniture and office equipment amortization of equipment under capital leases is calculated on a straightline basis over the shorter of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the equipment maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred upon retirement or sale the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from their respective accounts any gains or losses on the disposition of property and equipment are included in the results of operations in the period in which they occur e impairment of longlived assets the company reviews longlived assets for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recovered recoverability is assessed based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows as of december   and december   the company believes that there has been no impairment of its longlived assets f revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc”  which establishes guidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements asc  requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured shipping terms are customarily exw exworks shipping point which terms are consistent with “fob shipping point” revenues for products sold in the normal course of business are recognized upon shipment when delivery terms are exw shipping point and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met the company has entered into consigned inventory agreements with a few customers for products shipped under consigned inventory agreements the company recognizes revenue when either the customer notifies cps that they have picked the product from the consigned inventory or in some cases when sixty days have elapsed from the date the shipment arrives at the customer’s location in  the company entered into a cooperative agreement with the us army research laboratory to perform research and development concerning hybrid metal matrix composite encapsulated ceramic armor technology the cooperative agreement was a fouryear agreement recently expired march   which was  funded by the us department of defense and  funded by cps revenues from this cooperative agreement are recognized proportionally as costs are incurred we are reimbursed for reasonable and allocable costs up to the reimbursement limits set by the cooperative agreement all payments to the company for work performed on this cooperative agreement are subject to audit and adjustment by the defense contract audit agency adjustments if any are recognized in the period made g research and development costs in  costs incurred related to funding under the cooperative agreement totaled  thousand of which  was reimbursed by the us army and was recorded as revenue this revenue of  thousand resulted in a gross margin of  thousand in  no costs were incurred as the contract expired march   in  costs incurred related to funding under the cooperative agreement totaled  thousand of which  was reimbursed by the us army and was recorded as revenue this revenue of  thousand resulted in a gross margin of  thousand h income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the net tax effects of tax credits operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes the company considers many factors in assessing whether or not a valuation allowance for its deferred tax asset is warranted on the positive side the company considered such factors as its history of taxable earnings three of the last four years had operating profits global customer base consisting of large companies with significant resources current products and their expected life technological advantages potential for price increases trend of improved manufacturing efficiencies and the magnitude of the deferred tax asset compared with the company’s expectation of future earnings over the remaining life of the asset on the negative side the company considered such factors as the global economic environment the company’s ability to absorb additional periods of operating losses and negative cash flow and the potential for the technological breakthroughs and substitution of the company’s products by lower cost solutions the company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense as of december   and december   the company has no accruals for interest or penalties related to income tax matters the company does not have any uncertain tax positions at december   or december   which required accrual or disclosure income tax effects related to sharebased compensation that are in excess or less than grantdate fair value less any proceeds received on exercise of stock prices are recognized as either an increase or decrease to additional paidin capital upon exercise these tax effects are either offset against currently payable taxes or the tax benefit of net operating loss utilization i net income loss per common share basic net income loss per common share is calculated by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted net income loss per common share is calculated by dividing net income loss by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares plus additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential dilutive common shares had been issued for granted stock option and stock purchase rights common stock equivalents are excluded from the diluted calculations when a net loss is incurred as they would be antidilutive j reclassification certain amounts in prior year’s financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation in november  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance on balance sheet classification of deferred taxes asu no  balance sheet classification of deferred taxes this update provides for simplified presentation of deferred income taxes deferred tax liabilities and assets are now required to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position this guidance is effective within those annual reporting periods that begin after december   and interim periods within those annual periods and allows for full prospective or retrospective application early adoption is permitted the company adopted this new guidance in fiscal  and as a result  of the deferred tax asset is classifies as noncurrent for all periods presented k other recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  revenue from contracts with customers this update provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the

 grant bennett president and ceo said “revenues in the fourth quarter continued to be weak as expected we have discussed this development in previous communications as far back as the second quarter last year this weakness is centered in our major european customers who indicate that they are experiencing general weakness in demand similar to that experienced in  in addition we are adversely impacted by the strength of the us dollar which limits our pricing flexibility adversely affecting both our unit volume and margins the market conditions are temporary and while we are maintaining a tight rein on most spending we are continuing aggressive sales and marketing activities in both old and new sectors which are critical to returning to a growth path our strategy includes achieving a leadership position worldwide in the electronics markets in which we currently participate and diversifying into other markets such as armor where our core technology provides real value this strategy is driving positive developments which improve our outlook for later this year and  these developments include we recently we made our first shipment to china a market we believe could be as large as europe within a few years and is on a rapid growth trajectory despite the absence of a final ruling in our patent dispute in japan we have been communicating frequently with large potential japanese customers we have been solicited for quotes and it is very possible that we will be shipping additional products in the second half of this year this market for our products is also roughly the size of europe and represents a significant longterm opportunity · in november of  we added tom breen to fill the newlycreated position of svp sales and marketing as discussed in previous investor calls since joining cps tom has been visiting many of our key current and potential customers and led the annual sales meeting focused on energizing the worldwide sales group to more effectively offer solutions that meet emerging customer needs in addition he has been a major contributor to our annual strategic planning process that will position cps for long term profitable growth we believe tom’s leadership coupled with the investment in the sales force over the past two years will begin to yield meaningful new orders during  and offers significant upside in  and beyond · we are pressing forward with our fracking and armor customers and early this year those discussions have accelerated resulting in new orders in both areas we expect to generate greater business this year than last year and we believe both product lines offer significant longterm growth potential” the company will be hosting its fourth quarter conference call with investors at pm today those interested in
