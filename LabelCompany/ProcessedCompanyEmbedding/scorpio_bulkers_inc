or revenue days is tce per revenue day which is consistent with industry standards  tce per revenue day is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters because charter hire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in perday amounts while charter hire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts   we report tce revenue a nongaap financial measure because i we believe it provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with voyage revenues and voyage expenses the most directly comparable usgaap measure ii it assists our management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of our vessels and in evaluating their financial performance iii it is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare periodtoperiod changes in a shipping companys performance irrespective of changes in the mix of charter types ie spot charters time charters and bareboat charters under which the vessels may be employed between the periods and iv we believe that

accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap management uses certain nongaap financial measures as such term is defined in regulation g promulgated by the sec generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys operating performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap management believes the presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our
