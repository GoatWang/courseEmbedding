carbohydrate by hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis to glycerol and glycol products in the presence of a catalyst consisting of finely divided metallic nickel and tungsten oxide on a carrier there is continuing interest in the development of new and improved processes for efficient conversion of higher polyhydric starting materials selectively to lower polyhydric products accordingly it is an object of this invention to provide a process for converting a higher polyhydric hydrocarbon to a lower polyhydric hydrocarbon it is another object of this invention to provide a process for converting glycerol selectively to propanediols in a homogeneous catalytic reaction medium other objects and advantages of the present invention shall become apparent from the accompanying description and examples description of the invention one or more objects of the present invention are accomplished by the provision of a process for the conversion of glycerol to lower oxygenated hydrocarbons which comprises reacting glycerol carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a basic organic solvent medium in contact with a soluble catalyst composition containing tungsten and group viii metal components to yield a product mixture comprising propanediols in another embodiment this invention provides a process for the production of propanediol which comprises reacting glycerol carbon monoxide and hydrogen in an aprotic organic amide solvent medium in the presence of a soluble catalyst composition containing tungsten and group viii metal compounds at a temperature between about °° c and a pressure between about  psi to yield a product mixture comprising propanediol and propanediol the term basic organic solvent refers to a liquid organic medium which is at least weakly alkaline in reactivity relative to a strong acid illustrative of basic organic solvents are amines and amides which have the following base strengths in terms of pka relative to ammonia pka eg pyrrolidine  ethylamine  diethylamine  triethylamine  benzylamine  morpholine  pyridine  aniline  nmethylacetamide  acetamide  pyrrolidinone  methylpyrrolidinone  and benzamide  the process can be conducted by charging a reactor with solvent medium glycerol and catalyst and pressuring the reaction system with synthesis gas the carbon monoxidehydrogen gas mixture can be employed in a molar ratio between about  of carbon monoxide to hydrogen with the preferred molar ratio being between about  of carbon monoxide to hydrogen an inert diluent gas such as nitrogen can be included in the pressure system the basic organic solvent is employed in a sufficient quantity to provide a liquid phase reaction medium in the reactor a typical volume of basic organic solvent will range between about  milliliters per gram of glycerol in the reaction medium the catalyst composition can be employed in a quantity between about  gramatom of tungsten and group viii metals per liter of reaction medium typically between about  gramatom of active metal content in the catalyst composition is utilized per liter of reaction medium with reference to the glycerol starting material the catalyst composition usually is employed in a quantity between about  weight percent based on the weight of glycerol the invention process is conducted at a temperature between about °° c and usually will be in the range between about °° c the pressure employed in the reaction system can range between about  psi the synthesis gas partial pressure on the average will be in the range between about  psi the process is conducted for a reaction period between about  hours and typically will be in the range of about  hours the organic solvent employed in the process generally is a polar medium which is at least weakly alkaline with respect to the ability to form salts with strongly acidic compounds illustrative of suitable basic organic solvents are methylamine dimethylamine trimethylamine ethylamine diethylamine triethylamine triethanolamine trichloromethylamine pyridine piperidine piperazine and the like a preferred type of basic organic solvent is an aprotic organic amide illustrative of this type of solvent are nndimethylformamide nndimethylacetamide methylpyrrolidinone methylpiperidone hexamethylphosphoric triamide tetramethylurea and the like the basic organic solvent can be employed in admixture with other solvent media such as water methanol ethanol tetrahydrofuran diethyl ether acetonitrile benzonitrile dioxane ethylene glycol alkyl ether ethyl acetate butyrolactone and the like operation of the invention process appears to require a basic reaction medium in order to achieve a desirable rate of reaction and yield of propanediol products this requirement is satisfied by the use of a basic organic solvent alternatively the required reaction medium basicity can be provided by employing an inorganic base such as a metal hydroxide or metal carbonate or a quaternary ammonium compound such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide in combination with a polar solvent medium such as aqueous methanol the basic reaction medium tends to stabilize the catalyst and maintain the reactivity of the catalyst under the invention process hydrogenation conditions for purposes of the present invention process an essential parameter for the production of propanediols is the presence of a homogeneous catalyst system which contains active tungsten and group viii metal constituents the presence of tungsten metal is critical for obtaining efficient production of propanediol products optimal results are achieved when the tungsten metal is employed in combination with a group viii metal such as iron cobalt nickel ruthenium rhodium palladium osmium or platinum additional metal components may be included as promoters in the tungstengroup viii metal combination eg metals such as titanium zirconium tin and the like the gramatom ratio of tungsten metal component to group viii metal component in the catalyst composition can be varied in the range between about  of tungsten to group viii metal the tungsten and group viii metals can be incorporated in the catalyst system in any convenient form of chemical compounds illustrative of suitable compounds are tungsten and group viii metal oxides acetylacetonates sulfates tetrafluoroborates formates acetates propionates oxalates gluconates lactates citrates cyclopentadienides and the like illustrative of metal compound species are tungstic acid cobalt carbonyl and rhodium carbonyl acetylacetonate the tungsten and group viii metal compounds initially need not be soluble in the reaction medium solubilization to a homogeneous reaction medium is effected or completed by contact with synthesis gas under the reaction conditions a homogeneous catalyst system is an essential feature of the invention process the presence of carbon monoxide contributes to the solubilization and stabilization and activation of the catalyst species without the presence of carbon monoxide the conversion of glycerol to propanediol proceeds less efficiently after the completion of a process run the propanediols can be separated and recovered by conventional means such as distillation the catalyst composition can be isolated and recycled in the process the following examples are further illustrative of the present invention the components and specific ingredients are presented as being typical and various modifications can be derived in view of the foregoing disclosure within the scope of the invention example i this example illustrates a

to room temperature and the gas is vented gas chromatographicmass spectroscopic analysis of the resulting solution indicates product yields of  g of propanediol  g of propanediol and  g of propanol when a ruthenium palladium nickel or cobalt metal component is employed in place of rhodium with the tungsten compound similar product yield results are obtained when a titanium or molybdenum metal promoter component is used with a group viii metal and tungsten metal in the catalyst similar product yield results are obtained example ii the example i procedure is repeated except that  g  mmole of rhco acetylacetonate alone without a tungsten component is employed as a catalyst the resulting product mixture contains  g of propanediol  g of propanediol and  g of propanol the example i procedure
