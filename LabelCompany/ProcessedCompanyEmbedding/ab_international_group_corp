which are licensed and able to purchase car at auctions and sell to their clients we will be in direct competition with them many large car dealerships have greater financial capabilities than us and will be able to provide more favorable credit terms to the buyers of automobiles many of these companies may have a greater more established customer base than us we will likely lose business to such companies also many of these companies will be able to afford to offer greater price discounts than us which may also cause us to lose business in addition we will be competing with unlicensed private

may need additional financing we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us because we are not certain how we will fund our longterm liquidity needs we have no ability to assess when we might be profitable our principal office address is located at frunze street  issikatinskiy milianfan kyrgyzstan  our telephone number is  our plan of operation is forwardlooking and there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations we are a development stage company and have generated  in revenue it is likely that we will not be able to achieve profitability and will have to cease operations due to the lack of funding we are in the business of selling used automobiles in kyrgyzstan we will rely on our sole officer and director’s knowledge and expertise of the car industry in conducting our operations our service will include checking the condition of the car shipping and handling and custom clearing if needed depending on the number of shares that we sell from this offering we plan to keep a small inventory of cars this inventory will consist of most popular models with highest turnover rate we will display the cars that we own on our website our customers will be able to select a car on our website according to their budget and preferences our customers will also be able to order cars which are not displayed on our website by specifying the make model and year when we do not have the car that our client

interest we plan to offer our used cars at price markedup from  to  of our cost our customers will be asked to pay us the full price in advance there is no guarantee that our customer will pay the full purchase price in advance in some cases we will ask for lower advance payments and the remainder during  days after the automobile is loaded and left a sea port when we do not have a particular car in inventory we will generally ask our client for prepayment before purchasing the car on their behalf to be able to extend credit payment terms to more customers we may need to raise additional

assets as of february   was  and  as of august   in assessing the recovery of the deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible management considers the scheduled reversals of future deferred tax assets projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment as a result management
