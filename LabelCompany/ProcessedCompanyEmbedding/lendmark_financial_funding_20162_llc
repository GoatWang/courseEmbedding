on july  satisfaction ratingi paid off my car loan then waited approximately  days to receive the title i never did and the manager i had talk to was not in so i went to the main department of revenue on a friday to obtain the title once i got there i was told lendmark had it then i found out it was in the managers desk drawer i asked them to overnight it to me because i had been waiting for the title in order to sell the car they waited until monday to overnight it to me no sense of urgency with this company but they certainly want their money on time i will never use them again i contacted the better business bureau to file a complaint against them and they never responded to them beware they are not with the better business bureau nor have to answer to them they want your money but they provide very bad customer serviceupdate on  i reported earlier the misfortune i had with lendmark sending my title to make matters worse i just found out they sent the wrong title they all of a sudden found a more uptodate title after i called to say the department of motor vehicles would not accept the title for the new owner to register the vehicle i was livid they never bothered to send the right title they do not need to be in business the manager blamed it on poor staff she is part of the poor staff her name is amy only do business with lendmark if you want heartache and problemshelpfulyesnosherrie of eden nc on june  satisfaction ratingi took out a loan for a dire emergency with lendmark everything was going well until i fell into a hardship situation i even know the employees that work for the local branch i went to in collinsville va we worked together at another finance company previously lendmark employees went into my checking account on  occasions without my permission and took out money i had them blocked at the bank and called the local office  was told by the manager she actually heard the conversation with myself  the employees i advised that was a

was going to take my truck or what and would not give me a direct answer she said that i could write them a check and it would not go through my bank until the nd of the next month i told her that i did not want to do that because if they send it through it would cost me a  dollar overdraft fee on my account her response was that it was better than lawyer fees which i took as a threat refused to answer questions that i ask her and only want to have me listen to her and not say a wordthen she told me that if my payment was one day late they could take my truck so i ask her if thats what they was going to do and she refused to give me a straight answer i know they have to try and keep things on time but things happen and they could charge a crap load of charges and the interest rate is ungodly i would like to change my account to my local bank and tell this woman to stick it just because she is new and power hungry does not mean that she has to be a witchhelpfulyesnojo ann of jasper

my judgment too i tried to pay them and they did not know when and where the letter was going to be sent they held my bank account for over  days when i tried to pay them their staff did not know how to answer the questions that they should have been trained on my bank tried to help them retrieve my funds and they did not know how to i can keep on and on this has been the worse experience of my life no one should have a judgment against them but if you are trying to correct it and you are dealing with a company that does not understand how to collect the debt never borrow money from them i will call a family member or a stranger before i use their services againhelpfulyesnolanaye of charlotte nc on march  satisfaction ratingi got a loan from them out of absolute necessity when they were springleaf lendmark has purchased them now i am in a position to pay the loan down if not pay it completely when i called about a payoff amount i was told that it was practically identical to my balance in other words for me to pay them off i have to pay off the entire balancemost of the time with a loan if you pay it off early you arent required to pay all of the interest that would be accrued if you paid it off for the full duration of the loan apparently these people dont operate like this like everyone else said they put up a good front they seem professional and legit but these are predatory lenders who prey on people in need stay away or prepare to be taken advantage of and i would have rated this zero stars had that been an optionhelpfulyesnomark of durham nc on feb  satisfaction ratingwas not properly advised of what was being done i was looking to get my current loan up to date and called to discuss my options i was told i could get some additional money and was asked how much i wanted i said an  so they did what they had to do and called and told me i was approved so i go to the office to sign the paperwork and had told them i was in a rush so i was sat down and was given the paper to sign got my check and went back to my office the next day i had the opportunity to sit down and read my terms of the loan and saw that i was being charged like  more so i said i would call them later that week the next few days went by and i received a letter from some insurance company and lendmark saying that i had order this additional insurance coverage and that why was charged more for the loan it also said i had  days to cancel it i called the office and was told yeah they did add this coverage for me and i asked when was that disclosed to me nevertheless i told them i wanted to cancel it and then i was told i can but i would still be charged that amount on my loan so my choice was either give the money to some insurance company or take the additional cash for my loan so me asking for an additional  i ended up getting additional  loan to me this was a sham and i was tricked into taking out a higher loan amount than what i asked for so now im thinking about filing bankruptcy because i didnt agree to this and then didnt have any way out of the dollar amount take my advised and stay away from this companyhelpfulyesnorandi of gwynn oak md on feb  satisfaction ratingcollection harassment at its finest i have a loan through lendmark financial baltimore maryland and will encourage any  everyone to beware of their collection practices ive

employer requesting a payment including one day after the due date although they have a grace period for paymentshelpfulyesnochristopher of grampian pa on feb  satisfaction ratingthese people are very unprofessional they contacted me about getting a loan through them so we go through all the information on the phone then they ask me to give them collateral so we go through that process at the end

when i got out of the military that hurt me because nobody would hire me due to disability from me getting hurt overseasduring this time i could not work so me and my family had a rough   years of bills and just trying to survive i waited that long for my claim to go through the va but i tell this guy this and he says well thats not our fault you could not pay your bills because you was hurt i said oh really you feel that way about the disabled military veterans he just laughed and hung up the phone i will do everything i can to take customers or potential future customers away from

and ac company deals with this company my original purchase was in the neighborhood of  however even though i officially owe around  right now my statement says i owe around  when i called a few times to have this changed they not only saw nothing wrong with it they said they were unable to change it when i mentioned how this inaccurately displays on my credit report as owning more than i technically do they didnt carebesides that i have fallen behind  payments and have been nonstop threatened to go to the attorneys office harassed call taker being unpleasant rude and demanding lied to called multiple occasions and then they couldnt find a record of the conversation was told that i would only need to pay  for the monthly payment to keep my account only  month behind but the following week was told that whoever i spoke to was incorrect and therefore that payment didnt mean anything and they continued to harass me get disturbing letters about collections when it was only a few days past due etc ive been late on other things and have never been treated so poorlyfor instance just now i received a call from them demanding payment today i actually believe they are putting words in my mouth i said i would get a paycheck feb th and believe i made it clear that i want to pay this bill but that i dont have the money this exact day she said that if i didnt pay it today that it would go to the attorneys office you know if you want to work for collections the best way of doing your job would be to work with your customers not bully or harass them i know i owe this money and im sorry i was unemployed for  months by being laid off and im trying to pay it off if i call in and work out payment arrangements dont call me the next week with a completely different story and then throw it in my face when i cant pay it i would never ever use this company again they should be ashamed of their conduct ive spoken to several people at lendmark financial now come to this site  i see im not the only one my interest rate is around  and they offered to refinance my loan to  do they think im stupidhelpfulyesnonjeri of greenbelt md on jan  satisfaction ratingi got a loan from lendmark financial in  for  after paying on the loan for almost  years i requested a payoff because i assumed i was almost finished paying i was told that after paying for  years i still owe just about what i borrowed  they told me that all my payments went to interest and late fees i attempted to settle for  but they would not accept it they would not negotiate with me at all after a few months they filed a judgment at court i asked the attorney if i could settle the account again for  he told me he would take it back to the creditor and get back to me i called him and never heard back this company also has other companies that will mail you letters stating that they are trying to assist you but they actually work with lendmark i believe two months after the judgment was filed i got a wage garnishment this company is a crook and should be put out of business its a shame that consumers have no rights in matters like this i believe in capitalism but this is ridiculoushelpfulyesnotiffany of greenville sc on dec  satisfaction ratinglendmark financial is a company i would not recommend to anyone i fell late on my payments and now i have to appear in court lendmark filed a civil suit to collect on a payoff that should be less they filed because i was  days behind this is poor customer service but they have an arbitration clause in their contact to help resolve any disputes that they are clearly violating if they are taking people to civil court something should be done to companies that use the court system to try and scare people into paying no one wants to fall behind in paying their bill its just sometimes things happen that you have no control over then you have companies like this that uses this against youhelpfulyesnotimothy of dallas ga on dec  satisfaction ratinglet me start off by saying that i always try to avoid predatory lending but this company puts on a good front it looks like they are legit with a decent office and some sort of affiliation with bbt bank if you can take any advice about finding a loan no matter what your financial situation is or credit score do not go here they have high interest rates and constantly want to refinance your loan to trap you after about six month of paying they will send and call with offers to get an additional amount of money so they can trap you in their predatory scheme then when you get too far behind they will attempt to take you to court falling behind  days is unacceptable and they will take you to court they completely took advantage of myself and family by taking me to court in a different state and of course winning because they knew i couldnt be present  miles away i was only  days behind with a payment set up to draft from my bank account they do not care they will take full advantage of the law that works in their favor i had to drain my savings account to pay them off in full which brings me to another point good luck trying to pay them the money they took you to court for it took  weeks to pay these people because of all the crap you have to jump through just to get them money not to mention they will continue the legal process by freezing your bank accounts and sending garnishment letters to your employer luckily i had a joint savings account in a complete separate state they couldnt freeze so i could get them the money this is a payday loan multiplied by  no matter how desperate you are for money no matter how hard times get do yourself a favor a beg on the street before going through the hell that this company will put you through to

in a company i would gladly investhelpfulyesnoshawn of pequea pa on aug  satisfaction ratingi got a loan through lendmark in  in feb of  i had a bad fall and was going to be out of work for at least

satisfaction ratingi would never do business with this company the customer service they provide is beyond farther than the worst i have ever seen during my application process not once did i receive a phone call from anyone even after leaving several messages for them to call me i received a letter in the mail  weeks later they are crazy to think i would continue doing business with them i would rather take my business to another company and pay a higher interest rate than to ever have them gain me as a customer i think being made to feel like you are just another number would be a step above how i was treated i am in my mid s and own a very successful real estate title company and i would never in a million years treat anyone like they treated me with as many contacts as i have in many areas of the community i will definitely make sure that everyone i know will know exactly what a terrible company this is to do business withhelpfulyesnolisa of martinsburg wv on july  satisfaction ratingi just had my first garnishment to my paycheck without any warnings from lendmark in hagerstown md i cosigned with my now exboyfriend on a motorcycle that was repossessed in fact after them calling me several times i told them where to find the motorcycle when i called after the repo and asked if there was a balance i was told no the balance was zero i checked my credit report and it said balance of zero i have checked my credit report several times over the past few years and the lendmark account for the motorcycle has been zero now  years later with no written letters no phone calls i am having my wages garnished the original loan papers had my address and phone number as i was the primary applicant my exboyfriend was coapplicant as my credit score was much high than his at the timewhen we separated he kept the motorcycle as it was his he made the monthly payments until i heard from you that he was behind and you needed to repossess it when he moved he apparently changed the account address to his new place of residence therefore i never received any notifications i understand i signed the paper and am responsible for the balance but where is lendmarks responsibility in letting me know there was a balance you had my address and phone number i took responsibility and helped you find the motorcycle i took responsibility and called them to see if there was a balance and i was told zero balance now instead of the original balance i owe a lot more due to interest court costs and debt collectors fees and you are not even garnishing my exboyfriends wages when he is working and living in the hagerstownsharpsburg area why not they have his ss number you cant tell me they or the debt collecting company cant find him when i called the hagerstown lendmark office and talked to the manger he was very rude unprofessional uncaring and downright mean he wouldnt listen to me he wouldnt let me speak without him interrupting and continually saying you signed the papers youre responsible he kept saying that it didnt matter that the office people told me zero balance that they must have been looking at the wrong screen he was raising his voice to me and interrupting me so i hung up and called your  number your  number person even told me i had a zero balance that day they switched me over to their lawyer she was very nice and compassionate she got my file and looked at it and said she would research it back to the beginning and call me back in an hour she never called me back but i figured she needed more time to research it i waited  days and finally called her i was told that she was not in and wouldnt be back till after the weekend i waited and still have not heard from her guess ill be calling again stay away from this companyhelpfulyesnosharon

believes everyone deserves to make smart decisions we aim to provide readers with the most uptodate information available about todays consumer products and serviceswhat features matter most when choosing a loan company top costwhen you take out a loan chances are you’re thinking more about the cost of the item you’ll purchase with the loan money than about the cost of the loan itself if you don’t consider the loan cost that item could end up costing much more than you expect to ensure that you get the best deal on a loan make sure you understand all fees associated with it and how interest will accumulateinterest rate the interest rate is the money a lender charges you when you borrow money and is a percentage of the total amount borrowed your credit score will influence the interest rate a lender charges because they will charge people deemed higher risk a higher rate if your loan doesn’t have prepayment penalties or precomputed interest you’ll save money on interest by paying your loan off early apr the annual percentage rate apr is often confused with the interest rate however the apr actually accounts for the total cost of the loan including any onetime fees when comparing loan offers look at the apr to get the best price comparison origination fee the origination or processing fee is a onetime charge that covers the cost of processing a loan this fee is typically included in the overall loan amount so you aren’t required to pay it up front prepayment penalties some lenders charge a fee if you pay off your loan early these fees help the lender make up the money they lose in interest but they also prevent people from getting out of debt early when they’re able to precomputed interest loans with a precomputed interest rate use the original amount instead of the outstanding balance to determine the amount of interest a consumer will pay each billing cycle this method means your payments may get smaller as time passes however if you pay the loan off early you won’t save any money on interest late payment fees most lenders will charge a fee if you pay your bill late avoid that fee by setting up autopay from your bank account or just put a reminder on your calendar to keep you on track payment processing fees some lenders charge a fee to pay your bill in a certain way for example some lenders may charge a small fee if you pay your bill by phone or using a check instead of setting up automatic electronic withdrawals make sure you understand these fees and choose a lender that allows you to make your payment in the way you want for free trustworthinesswhen working with a lender you should choose someone you feel comfortable with and who is trustworthy in general if you’re taking out a mortgage or auto loan from a wellestablished bank or credit union you can feel confident in the lender’s credibility if you’re working with an online loan company or new business make sure to fully research the company to avoid being scammed scams may be most likely to occur with unsecured personal loanshold loans vs flip loans determine whether the lender you’re working with will hold the loan after you close or if they’ll flip or sell it to another party while lenders who flip loans aren’t more or less trustworthy than those who don’t you’ll have to simply accept that the company they sell your loan to will be trustworthy and offer good customer service customer service consider how easy it is to get in touch with your lender now to determine if they’ll be easy to reach later if you have any problems also consider how patient they are in answering your questions they should be willing to address all your concerns and explain anything you’re confused about registered lenders must be registered to do business with the appropriate authority usually the department of banking or consumer credit in every state in which they do business you can find a list of state licensing authorities on the nationwide mortgage licensing system  registry website mortgage broker vs loan officerwhen taking out a loan you’ll have the choice to work with either a mortgage broker or a loan officer there are perks to each one so it is important to know the differenceloan officer loan officers work for the bank or lender so getting a loan through them may be faster than working with a mortgage broker these individuals are primarily accountable to their employer so they may not always make recommendations that are best for you mortgage broker mortgage brokers are a kind of middleman between those seeking loans and multiple lenders if you’re worried that your credit may make it difficult to get a loan consider working with a broker because they can help you decide which lender is most likely to approve you these individuals may also be able to help you find a better interest rate because they’ll be comparing multiple lenders other considerationsthere are a variety of other factors to consider when borrowing money if at any point during the process you’re confused make sure to discuss the matter with your lenderexpertise look for a loan company that specializes in the type of loans you’re considering if you’re working with a big bank ask whether they have loan officers who specialize in certain types of loans credit report all consumers are entitled to get one free report from each credit reporting company every year if you’re considering taking out a loan request one of your credit reports as far in advance as possible to make sure no inaccurate information appears on it many credit cards show you your credit score for free knowing your credit score may help you decide whether to work with a loan officer or mortgage broker down payment if you’re taking out a mortgage or car loan consider how much of a down payment you’re able to make the larger your down payment the less money you’ll need to borrow saving a little longer to have a larger down payment could save you a significant
