sent into space the pioneer plaque and the voyager golden record universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them sagan argued the now accepted hypothesis that the high surface temperatures of venus can be attributed to and calculated using the greenhouse effect sagan published more than  scientific papers and articles and was author coauthor or editor of more than  books he wrote many popular science books such as the dragons of eden brocas brain and pale blue dot and narrated and cowrote the awardwinning  television series

further reading  external links early lifeedit carl sagan was born in brooklyn new york his father samuel sagan was an immigrant garment worker from kamianetspodilskyi then in the russian empire in todays ukraine his mother rachel molly gruber was a housewife from new york carl was named in honor of rachels biological mother chaiya clara in sagans words the mother she never knew he had a sister carol and the family lived in a modest apartment near the atlantic ocean in bensonhurst a brooklyn neighborhood according to sagan they were reform jews the most liberal of north american judaisms four main groups both sagan and his sister agreed that their father was not especially religious but that their mother definitely believed in god and was active in the temple  and served only kosher meat during the depths of the depression his father worked as a theater usher according to biographer keay davidson sagans inner war was a result of his close relationship with both of his parents who were in many ways opposites sagan traced his later analytical urges to his mother a woman who had been extremely poor as a child in new york city during world war i and the s as a young woman she had held her own intellectual ambitions but they were frustrated by social restrictions her poverty her status as a woman and a wife and her jewish ethnicity davidson notes that she therefore worshipped her only son carl he would fulfill her unfulfilled dreams however he claimed that his sense of wonder came from his father in his free time he gave apples to the poor or helped soothe labormanagement tensions within new yorks garment industry although he was awed by carls intellectual abilities he took his sons inquisitiveness in stride and saw it as part of his growing up in his later years as a writer and scientist sagan would often draw on his childhood memories to illustrate scientific points as he did in his book shadows of forgotten ancestors sagan describes his parents influence on his later thinking my parents were not scientists they knew almost nothing about science but in introducing me simultaneously to skepticism and to wonder they taught me the two uneasily cohabiting modes of thought that are central to the scientific method  worlds fairedit sagan recalls that one of his most defining moments was when his parents took him to the  new york worlds fair when he was four years old the exhibits became a turning point in his life he later recalled the moving map of the america of tomorrow exhibit it showed beautiful highways and cloverleaves and little general motors cars all carrying people to skyscrapers buildings with lovely spires flying buttresses—and it looked great at other exhibits he remembered how a flashlight that shone on a photoelectric cell created a crackling sound and how the sound from a tuning fork became a wave on an oscilloscope he also witnessed the future media technology that would replace radio television sagan wrote plainly the world held wonders of a kind i had never guessed how could a tone become a picture and light become a noise he also saw one of the fairs most publicized events the burial of a time capsule at flushing meadows which contained mementos of the s to be recovered by earths descendants in a future millennium the time capsule thrilled carl writes davidson as an adult sagan and his colleagues would create similar time capsules—capsules that would be sent out into the galaxy these were the pioneer plaque and the voyager golden record précis all of which were spinoffs of sagans memories of the worlds fair world war iiedit during world war ii sagans family worried about the fate of their european relatives sagan however was generally unaware of the details of the ongoing war he wrote sure we had relatives who were caught up in the holocaust hitler was not a popular fellow in our household but on the other hand i was fairly insulated from the horrors of the war his sister carol said that their mother above all wanted to protect carl she had an extraordinarily difficult time dealing with world war ii and the holocaust sagans book the demonhaunted world  included his memories of this conflicted period when his family dealt with the realities of the war in europe but tried to prevent it from undermining his optimistic spirit inquisitiveness about natureedit soon after entering elementary school he began to express a strong inquisitiveness about nature sagan recalled taking his first trips to the public library alone at the age of five when his mother got him a library card he wanted to learn what stars were since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer i went to the librarian and asked for a book about stars  and the answer was stunning it was that the sun was a star but really close the stars were suns but so far away they were just little points of light  the scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me it was a kind of religious experience there was a magnificence to it a grandeur a scale which has never left me never ever left me at about age six or seven he and a close friend took trips to the american museum of natural history across the east river in manhattan while there they went to the hayden planetarium and walked around the museums exhibits of space objects such as meteorites and displays of dinosaurs and animals in natural settings sagan writes about those visits i was transfixed by the dioramas—lifelike representations of animals and their habitats all over the world penguins on the dimly lit antarctic ice a family of gorillas the male beating his chest an american grizzly bear standing on his hind legs ten or twelve feet tall and staring me right in the eye his parents helped nurture his growing interest in science by buying him chemistry sets and reading materials his interest in space however was his primary focus especially after reading science fiction stories by writers such as h g wells and edgar rice burroughs which stirred his imagination about life on other planets such as mars according to biographer ray spangenburg these early years as sagan tried to understand the mysteries of the planets became a driving force in his life a continual spark to his intellect and a quest that would never be forgotten in  he discovered astounding science fiction magazine which introduced him to more hard science fiction speculations than those in burroughss novels that same year inaugurated the flying saucer mass hysteria with the young carl suspecting the discs might be alien spaceships high school yearsedit sagan had lived in bensonhurst where he went to david a boody junior high school he had his bar mitzvah in bensonhurst when he turned  the following year  his family moved to the nearby town of rahway new jersey for his fathers work where sagan then entered rahway high school he graduated in  rahway was an older industrial town and the sagans were among its few jewish families photo of sagan from high school yearbook  sagan was a straighta student but was bored due to unchallenging classes and uninspiring teachers his teachers realized this and tried to convince his parents to send him to a private school the administrator telling them this kid ought to go to a school for gifted children he has something really remarkable this they couldnt do partly because of the cost sagan was made president of the schools chemistry club and at home he set up his own laboratory he taught himself about molecules by making cardboard cutouts to help him visualize how molecules were formed i found that about as interesting as doing chemical experiments he said sagan remained mostly interested in astronomy as a hobby and in his junior year made it a career goal after he learned that astronomers were paid for doing what he always enjoyed that was a splendid day­­­­—when i began to suspect that if i tried hard i could do astronomy fulltime not just parttime before the end of high school he entered an essay contest in which he posed the question of whether human contact with advanced life forms from another planet might be as disastrous for people on earth as it was for native americans when they first had contact with europeans the subject was considered controversial but his rhetorical skill won over the judges and they awarded him first prize by graduation his classmates had voted him most likely to succeed and put him in line to be valedictorian educationedit sagan attended the university of chicago which was one of the few colleges he applied to that would consider admitting a sixteenyearold despite his excellent high school grades its chancellor robert hutchins structured the school as an ideal meritocracy with no age requirement the school also employed a number of the nations leading scientists including enrico fermi and edward teller along with operating the famous yerkes observatory during his time as an honors program undergraduate sagan worked in the laboratory of the geneticist h j muller and wrote a thesis on the origins of life with physical chemist harold urey sagan joined the ryerson astronomical society received a ba degree in selfproclaimed nothing with general and special honors in  and a bs degree in physics in  he went on to earn a ms degree in physics in  before earning a phd degree in  with the dissertation physical studies of planets submitted to the department of astronomy and astrophysics he used the summer months of his graduate studies to work with his dissertation director planetary scientist gerard kuiper as well as physicist george gamow and chemist melvin calvin the title of sagans dissertation reflects his shared interests with kuiper who throughout the s had been president of the international astronomical unions commission on physical studies of planets and satellites in  the two worked on the classified military project a the secret air force plan to detonate a nuclear warhead on the moon sagan had a top secret clearance at the us air force and a secret clearance with nasa while working on his doctoral dissertation sagan revealed us government classified titles of two project a papers when he applied for a university of california at berkeley scholarship in  the leak was not publicly revealed until  when it was published in the journal nature a followup letter to the journal by project leader leonard reiffel confirmed sagans security leak scientific careeredit from  to  sagan was a miller fellow at the university of california berkeley meanwhile he published an article in  in the journal science on the atmosphere of venus while also working with nasas mariner  team and served as a planetary sciences consultant to the rand corporation play media sagan is one of those discussing the likelihood of life on other planets in whos out there  an awardwinning nasa documentary film by robert drew after the publication of sagans science article in  harvard university astronomers fred whipple and donald menzel offered sagan the opportunity to give a colloquium at harvard and they subsequently offered him a lecturer position at the institution sagan instead asked to be made an assistant professor and eventually whipple and menzel were able to convince harvard to offer sagan the assistant professor position he requested sagan lectured performed research and advised graduate students at the institution from  until  as well as working at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory both located in cambridge massachusetts in  sagan was denied tenure at harvard he later indicated the decision was very much unexpected the tenure denial has been blamed on several factors including that he focused his interests too broadly across a number of areas while the norm in academia is to become a renowned expert in a narrow specialty and perhaps because of his wellpublicized scientific advocacy which some scientists perceived as borrowing the ideas of others for little more than selfpromotion an advisor from his years as an undergraduate student harold urey wrote a letter to the tenure committee recommending strongly against tenure for sagan science is more than a body of knowledge it is a way of thinking i have a foreboding of an america in my childrens or grandchildrens time — when the united states is a service and information economy when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority when clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes our critical faculties in decline unable to distinguish between what feels good and whats true we slide almost without noticing back into superstition and darkness carl sagan from demonhaunted world  long before the illfated tenure process cornell university astronomer thomas gold had courted sagan to move to ithaca new york and join the faculty at cornell following the denial of tenure from harvard sagan accepted golds offer and remained a faculty member at cornell for nearly  years until his death in  unlike harvard the smaller and more laidback astronomy department at cornell welcomed sagans growing celebrity status following two years as an associate professor sagan became a full professor at cornell in  and directed the laboratory for planetary studies there from  to  he was associate director of the center for radiophysics and space research crsr at cornell in  he became the david duncan professor of astronomy and space sciences a position he held for the remainder of his life sagan was associated with the us space program from its inception from the s onward he worked as an advisor to nasa where one of his duties included briefing the apollo astronauts before their flights to the moon sagan contributed to many of the robotic spacecraft missions that explored the solar system arranging experiments on many of the expeditions sagan assembled the first physical message that was sent into space a goldanodized plaque attached to the space probe pioneer  launched in  pioneer  also carrying another copy of the plaque was launched the following year he continued to refine his designs the most elaborate message he helped to develop and assemble was the voyager golden record that was sent out with the voyager space probes in  sagan often challenged the decisions to fund the space shuttle and the international space station at the expense of further robotic missions scientific achievementsedit former student david morrison describes sagan as an idea person and a master of intuitive physical arguments and back of the envelope calculations and gerard kuiper said that some persons work best in specializing on a major program in the laboratory others are best in liaison between sciences dr sagan belongs in the latter group sagans contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of the planet venus in the early s no one knew for certain the basic conditions of that planets surface and sagan listed the possibilities in a report later depicted for popularization in a time–life book planets his own view was that venus was dry and very hot as opposed to the balmy paradise others had imagined he had investigated radio emissions from venus and concluded that there was a surface temperature of  °c  °f as a visiting scientist to nasas jet propulsion laboratory he contributed to the first mariner missions to venus working on the design and management of the project mariner  confirmed his conclusions on the surface conditions of venus in  sagan was amongclarification needed the first to hypothesize that saturns moon titan might possess oceans of liquid compounds on its surface and that jupiters moon europa might possess subsurface oceans of water this would make europa potentially habitable europas subsurface ocean of water was later indirectly confirmed by the spacecraft galileo the mystery of titans reddish haze was also solved with sagans help the reddish haze was revealed to be due to complex organic molecules constantly raining down onto titans surface he further contributed insights regarding the atmospheres of venus and jupiter as well as seasonal changes on mars he also perceived global warming as a growing manmade danger and likened it to the natural development of venus into a hot lifehostile planet through a kind of runaway greenhouse effect sagan and his cornell colleague edwin ernest salpeter speculated about life in jupiters clouds given the planets dense atmospheric composition rich in organic molecules he studied the observed color variations on mars surface and concluded that they were not seasonal or vegetational changes as most believedclarification needed but shifts in surface dust caused by windstorms sagan is best known however for his research on the possibilities of extraterrestrial life including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation he is also the  recipient of the public welfare medal the highest award of the national academy of sciences for distinguished contributions in the application of science to the public welfare he was denied membership in the academy reportedly because his media activities made him unpopular with many other scientists cosmos popularizing science on tvedit sagan in cosmos  in  sagan cowrote and narrated the awardwinning part pbs television series cosmos a personal voyage which became the most widely watched series in the history of american public television the show has been seen by at least  million people across  different countries the book cosmos written by sagan was published to accompany the series because of his earlier popularity as a science writer from his bestselling books including the dragons of eden which won him a pulitzer prize in  he was asked to write and narrate the show it was targeted to a general audience of viewers who sagan felt had lost interest in science partly due to a stifled educational system each of the  episodes was created to focus on a particular subject or person thereby demonstrating the synergy of the universe they covered a wide range of scientific subjects including the origin of life and a perspective of humans place on earth the show won an emmy along with a peabody award and transformed sagan from an obscure astronomer into a popculture icon time magazine ran a cover story about sagan soon after the show broadcast referring to him as creator chief writer and hostnarrator of the show in  cosmos was released on a remastered set of dvds billions and billionsedit see also sagans number sagan with a model of the viking lander that would land on mars sagan examined possible landing sites for viking along with mike carr and hal masursky from cosmos he was invited to frequent appearances on the tonight show starring johnny carson sagan became jokingly associated with the catchphrase billions and billions although he never actually used the phrase in the cosmos series he rather used the term billions upon billions carson however would sometimes use the phrase during his parodies of sagana as a humorous tribute to sagan and his association with the catchphrase billions and billions a sagan has been defined as a unit of measurement equivalent to a very large number of anything scientific and critical thinking advocacyedit sagans ability to convey his ideas allowed many people to understand the cosmos better—simultaneously emphasizing the value and worthiness of the human race and the relative insignificance of the earth in comparison to the universe he delivered the  series of royal institution christmas lectures in london sagan was a proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life he urged the scientific community to listen with radio telescopes for signals from potential intelligent extraterrestrial lifeforms sagan was so persuasive that by  he was able to get a petition advocating seti published in the journal science and signed by  scientists including seven nobel prize winners this signaled a tremendous increase in the respectability of a thencontroversial field sagan also helped frank drake write the arecibo message a radio message beamed into space from the arecibo radio telescope on november   aimed at informing potential extraterrestrials about earth sagan was chief technology officer of the professional planetary research journal icarus for twelve years he cofounded the planetary society and a member of the seti institute board of trustees sagan served as chairman of the division for planetary science of the american astronomical society as president of the planetology section of the american geophysical union and as chairman of the astronomy section of the american association for the advancement of science aaas the planetary society members at the organizations founding carl sagan is seated on the right at the height of the cold war sagan became involved in nuclear disarmament efforts by promoting hypotheses on the effects of nuclear war when paul crutzens twilight at noon concept suggested that a substantial nuclear exchange could trigger a nuclear twilight and upset the delicate balance of life on earth by cooling the surface in  he was one of five authors—the s—in the followup ttaps model as the research paper came to be known which contained the first usage of the term nuclear winter which his colleague richard p turco coined in  he coauthored the book the cold and the dark the world after nuclear war and in  he coauthored the book a path where no man thought nuclear winter and the end of the arms race which explains the nuclear winter hypothesis and with that advocates nuclear disarmament sagan received a great deal of skepticism and disdain for the use of media to disseminate a very uncertain hypothesis in personal correspondence with edward teller c  although beginning amicably with teller expressing support for continued research to ascertain the credibility of the winter hypothesis sagan and tellers correspondence would ultimately result in teller writing a propagandist is one who uses incomplete information to produce maximum persuasion i can compliment you on being indeed an excellent propagandist remembering that a propagandist is the better the less he appears to be one biographers of sagan would also comment that from a scientific viewpoint nuclear winter was a low point for sagan although politically speaking it popularized his image amongst the public sagan also wrote books to popularize science such as cosmos which reflected and expanded upon some of the themes of a

fraction of a dot carl sagan cornell lecture in  he wrote a sequel to cosmos pale blue dot a vision of the human future in space which was selected as a notable book of  by the new york times he appeared on pbs charlie rose program in january  sagan also wrote the introduction for stephen hawkings bestseller a brief history of time sagan was also known for his popularization of science his efforts to increase scientific understanding among the general public and his positions in favor of scientific skepticism and against pseudoscience such as his debunking of the betty and barney hill abduction to mark the tenth anniversary of sagans death david morrison a former student of sagans recalled sagans immense contributions to planetary research the public understanding of science and the skeptical movement in skeptical inquirer following saddam husseins threats to light kuwaits oil wells on fire in response to any physical challenge to iraqi control of the oil assets sagan together with his ttaps colleagues and paul crutzen warned in january  in the baltimore sun and wilmington morning star newspapers that if the fires were left to burn over a period of several months enough smoke from the  or so  kuwaiti oil fires might get so high as to disrupt agriculture in much of south asia  and that this possibility should affect the war plans these claims were also the subject of a televised debate between sagan and physicist fred singer on  january aired on the abc news program nightline sagan admitted he had overestimated the danger posed by the  kuwaiti oil fires in the televised debate sagan argued that the effects of the smoke would be similar to the effects of a nuclear winter with singer arguing to the contrary after the debate the fires burnt for many months before extinguishing efforts were complete the results of the smoke did not produce continentalsized cooling sagan later conceded in the demonhaunted world that the prediction did not turn out to be correct it was pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped °–° c over the persian gulf but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and asia was spared in his later years sagan advocated the creation of an organized search for asteroidsnearearth objects neo that might impact the earth but to forestall or postpone developing the technological methods that would be needed to defend against them he argued that all of the numerous methods proposed to alter the orbit of an asteroid including the employment of nuclear detonations created a deflection dilemma if the ability to deflect an asteroid away from the earth exists then one would also have the ability to divert a nonthreatening object towards earth creating an immensely destructive weapon in a  paper he coauthored he ridiculed a day long nearearth object interception workshop held by lanl in  that did not even in passing state that such interception and deflection technologies could have these ancillary dangers sagan however was hopeful that the natural neo impact threat and the intrinsically doubleedged essence of the methods to prevent these threats would serve as a new and potent motivation to maturing international relations later acknowledging that with sufficient international oversight in the future a work our way up approach to fielding nuclear explosive deflection methods could be fielded and when sufficient knowledge was gained to use them to aid in mining asteroids his interest in the use of nuclear detonations in space grew out of his work in  for the armour research foundations project a concerning the possibility of detonating a nuclear device on the lunar surface sagan was a critic of plato having said of the ancient greek philosopher science and mathematics were to be removed from the hands of the merchants and the artisans this tendency found its most effective advocate in a follower of pythagoras named plato and he plato believed that ideas were far more real than the natural world he advised the astronomers not to waste their time observing the stars and planets it was better he believed just to think about them plato expressed hostility to observation and experiment he taught contempt for the real world and disdain for the practical application of scientific knowledge platos followers succeeded in extinguishing the light of science and experiment that had been kindled by democritus and the other ionians popularizing scienceedit speaking about his activities in popularizing science sagan said that there were at least two reasons for scientists to share the purposes of science and its contemporary state simple selfinterest was one much of the funding for science came from the public and the public therefore had the right to know how the money was being spent if scientists increased public admiration for science there was a good chance of having more public supportersclarification needed the other reason was the excitement of communicating ones own excitement about science to others criticismsedit while sagan was widely adored by the general public his reputation in the scientific community was more polarized critics sometimes characterized his work as fanciful nonrigorous and selfaggrandizing and others complained in his later years that he neglected his role as a faculty member to foster his celebrity status one of sagans harshest critics harold urey felt that sagan was getting too much publicity for a scientist and was treating some scientific theories too casually urey and sagan were said to have different philosophies of science according to davidson while urey was an oldtime empiricist who avoided theorizing about the unknown sagan was by contrast willing to speculate openly about such matters fred whipple wanted harvard to keep sagan there but learned that because urey was a nobel laureate his opinion was an important factor in harvard denying sagan tenure sagans harvard friend lester grinspoon also stated i know harvard well enough to know there are people there who certainly do not like people who are outspoken grinspoon added wherever you turned there was one astronomer being quoted on everything one astronomer whose face you were seeing on tv and one astronomer whose books had the preferred display slot at the local bookstore some like urey later came to realize sagans popular brand of scientific advocacy was beneficial to the science as a whole urey especially liked sagans  book the dragons of eden and wrote sagan with his opinion i like it very much and am amazed that someone like you has such an intimate knowledge of the various features of the problemi congratulate youyou are a man of many talents sagan was accused of borrowing some ideas of others for his own benefit while sagan countered these claims by explaining that the misappropriation was an unfortunate side effect of his role as a science communicator and explainer and that he attempted to give proper credit whenever possible social concernsedit sagan believed that the drake equation on substitution of reasonable estimates suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form but that the lack of evidence of such civilizations highlighted by the fermi paradox suggests technological civilizations tend to selfdestruct this stimulated his interest in identifying and publicizing ways that humanity could destroy itself with the hope of avoiding such a cataclysm and eventually becoming a spacefaring species sagans deep concern regarding the potential destruction of human civilization in a nuclear holocaust was conveyed in a memorable cinematic sequence in the final episode of cosmos called who speaks for earth sagan had already resigneddate missing from the air force scientific advisory boards ufo investigating condon committee and voluntarily surrendered his top secret clearance in protest over the vietnam war following his marriage to his third wife novelist ann druyan in june  sagan became more politically active—particularly in opposing escalation of the nuclear arms race under president ronald reagan the united states and soviet unionrussia nuclear stockpiles in total number of nuclear bombswarheads in existence throughout the cold war and postcold war era in march  reagan announced the strategic defense initiative—a multibilliondollar project to develop a comprehensive defense against attack by nuclear missiles which was quickly dubbed the star wars program sagan spoke out against the project arguing that it was technically impossible to develop a system with the level of perfection required and far more expensive to build such a system than it would be for an enemy to defeat it through decoys and other means—and that its construction would seriously destabilize the nuclear balance between the united states and the soviet union making further progress toward nuclear disarmament impossible when soviet leader mikhail gorbachev declared a unilateral moratorium on the testing of nuclear weapons which would begin on august  —the th anniversary of the atomic bombing of hiroshima—the reagan administration dismissed the dramatic move as nothing more than propaganda and refused to follow suit in response us antinuclear and peace activists staged a series of protest actions at the nevada test site beginning on easter sunday in  and continuing through  hundreds of people in the nevada desert experience group were arrested including sagan who was arrested on two separate occasions as he climbed over a chainlink fence at the test site during the underground operation charioteer and united statess musketeer nuclear test series of detonations sagan was also a vocal advocate of the controversial notion of testosterone poisoning arguing in  that human males could become gripped by an unusually severe case of testosterone poisoning and this could compel them to become genocidal in his review of moondance magazine writer daniela gioseffis  book women on war he argues that females are the only half of humanity untainted by testosterone poisoning one chapter of his  book shadows of forgotten ancestors is dedicated to testosterone and its alleged poisonous effects personal life and beliefsedit i have just finished the cosmic connection and loved every word of it you are my idea of a good writer because you have an unmannered style and when i read what you write i hear you talking one thing about the book made me nervous it was entirely too obvious that you are smarter than i am i hate that isaac asimov in letter to sagan  sagan was married three times in  he married biologist lynn margulis the couple had two children jeremy and dorion sagan after carl sagan and margulis divorced he married artist linda salzman in  and they also had a child together nick sagan during these marriages carl sagan focused heavily on his career a factor which may have contributed to sagans first divorce in  sagan married author ann druyan and they later had two children alexandra and samuel sagan carl sagan and druyan remained married until his death in  he lived in an egyptian revival house in ithaca perched on the edge of a cliff that had formerly been the headquarters of a cornell secret society isaac asimov described sagan as one of only two people he ever met whose intellect surpassed his own the other he claimed was the computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert marvin minsky sagan wrote frequently about religion and the relationship between religion and science expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of god as a sapient being for example some people think god is an outsized lightskinned male with a long white beard sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky busily tallying the fall of every sparrow others—for example baruch spinoza and albert einstein—considered god to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe i do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws in another description of his view on the concept of god sagan emphatically wrote the idea that god is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous but if by god one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe then clearly there is such a god this god is emotionally unsatisfying  it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity on atheism sagan commented in  an atheist is someone who is certain that god does not exist someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of god i know of no such compelling evidence because god can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes we would have to know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such god exists to be certain of the existence of god and to be certain of the nonexistence of god seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed sagan also commented on christianity and the jefferson bible stating my longtime view about christianity is that it represents an amalgam of two seemingly immiscible parts the religion of jesus and the religion of paul thomas jefferson attempted to excise the pauline parts of the new testament there wasnt much left when he was done but it was an inspiring document regarding spirituality and its relationship with science sagan stated spirit comes from the latin word to breathe what we breathe is air which is certainly matter however thin despite usage to the contrary there is no necessary implication in the word spiritual that we are talking of anything other than matter including the matter of which the brain is made or anything outside the realm of science on occasion i will feel free to use the word science is not only compatible with spirituality it is a profound source of spirituality when we recognize our place in an immensity of lightyears and in the passage of ages when we grasp the intricacy beauty and subtlety of life then that soaring feeling that sense of elation and humility combined is surely spiritual an environmental appeal preserving and cherishing the earth signed by sagan with other noted scientists in january  stated that the historical record makes clear that religious teaching example and leadership are powerfully able to influence personal conduct and commitment thus there is a vital role for religion and science in reply to a question in  about his religious beliefs sagan answered im agnostic sagan maintained that the idea of a creator god of the universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe sagans views on religion have been interpreted as a form of pantheism comparable to einsteins belief in spinozas god his son dorion sagan said my father believed in the god of spinoza and einstein god not behind nature but as nature equivalent to it his last wife ann druyan stated when my husband died because he was so famous and known for not being a believer many people would come up to me—it still sometimes happens—and ask me if carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife they also frequently ask me if i think i will see him again carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions the tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again i dont ever expect to be reunited with carl in  ann druyan edited sagans  glasgow gifford lectures in natural theology into a book the varieties of scientific experience a personal view of the search for god in which he elaborates on his views of divinity in the natural world carl sagan center speaks with cdc employees in  sagan is also widely regarded as a freethinker or skeptic one of his most famous quotations in cosmos was extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence called the sagan standard by some this was based on a nearly identical statement by fellow founder of the committee for the scientific investigation of claims of the paranormal marcello truzzi an extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof this idea had been earlier aphorized in théodore flournoys work from india to the planet mars  from a longer quote by pierresimon laplace – a french mathematician and astronomer as the principle of laplace the weight of the evidence should be proportioned to the strangeness of the facts late in his life sagans books elaborated on his skeptical naturalistic view of the world in the demonhaunted world he presented tools for testing arguments and detecting fallacious or fraudulent ones essentially advocating wide use of critical thinking and the scientific method the compilation billions and billions thoughts on life and death at the brink of the millennium published in  after sagans death contains essays written by sagan such as his views on abortion and his widow ann druyans account of his death as a skeptic agnostic and freethinker sagan warned against humans tendency towards anthropocentrism he was the faculty adviser for the cornell students for the ethical treatment of animals in the cosmos chapter blues for a red planet sagan wrote if there is life on mars i believe we should do nothing with mars mars then belongs to the martians even if the martians are only microbes sagan was a user and advocate of marijuana under the pseudonym mr x he contributed an essay about smoking cannabis to the  book marihuana reconsidered the essay explained that marijuana use had helped to inspire some of sagans works and enhance sensual and intellectual experiences after sagans death his friend lester grinspoon disclosed this information to sagans biographer keay davidson the publishing of the biography carl sagan a life in  brought media attention to this aspect of sagans life not long after his death widow ann druyan had gone on to preside over the board of directors of the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws norml a nonprofit organization dedicated to reforming cannabis laws in  engineers at apple computer codenamed the power macintosh  carl sagan in the hope that apple would make billions and billions with the sale of the powermac  the name was only used internally but sagan was concerned that it would become a product endorsement and sent apple a ceaseanddesist letter apple complied but engineers retaliated by changing the internal codename to bha for “butthead astronomer” sagan then sued apple for libel in federal court the court granted apples motion to dismiss sagans claims and opined in dicta that a reader aware of the context would understand apple was clearly attempting to retaliate in a humorous and satirical way and that it strains reason to conclude that defendant was attempting to criticize plaintiffs reputation or competency as an astronomer one does not seriously attack the expertise of a scientist using the undefined phrase butthead sagan then sued for apples original use of his name and likeness but again lost sagan appealed the ruling in november  an outofcourt settlement was reached and apples office of trademarks and patents released a conciliatory statement that apple has always had great respect for dr sagan it was never apples intention to cause dr sagan or his family any embarrassment or concern apples third and final code name for the project was law short for lawyers are wimps sagan briefly served as an adviser on stanley kubricks film  a space odyssey sagan proposed that the film suggest rather than depict extraterrestrial superintelligence sagan and ufosedit in  the year that inaugurated the flying saucer craze the young sagan suspected the discs might be alien spaceships sagans interest in ufo reports prompted him on august   to write a letter to us secretary of state dean acheson to ask how the united states would respond if flying saucers turned out to be extraterrestrial– he later had several conversations on the subject in  with jacques vallée though quite skeptical of any extraordinary answer to the ufo question sagan thought scientists should study the phenomenon at least because there was widespread public interest in ufo reports stuart appelle notes that sagan wrote frequently on what he perceived as the logical and empirical fallacies regarding ufos and the abduction experience sagan rejected an extraterrestrial explanation for the phenomenon but felt there were both empirical and pedagogical benefits for examining ufo reports and that the subject was therefore a legitimate topic of study in  sagan was a member of the ad hoc committee to review project blue book the us air forces ufo investigation project the committee concluded blue book had been lacking as a scientific study and recommended a universitybased project to give the ufo phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny the result was the condon committee – led by physicist edward condon and in their final report they formally concluded that ufos regardless of what any of them actually were did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security sociologist ron westrum writes that the high point of sagans treatment of the ufo question was the aaas symposium in  a wide range of educated opinions on the subject were offered by participants including not only proponents such as james mcdonald and j allen hynek but also skeptics like astronomers william hartmann and donald menzel the roster of speakers was balanced and it is to sagans credit that this event was presented in spite of pressure from edward condon with physicist thornton page sagan edited the lectures and discussions given at the symposium these were published in  as ufos a scientific debate some of sagans many books examine ufos as did one episode of cosmos and he claimed a religious undercurrent to the phenomenon sagan again revealed his views on interstellar travel in his  cosmos series in one of his last written works sagan argued that the chances of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting earth are vanishingly small however sagan did think it plausible that cold war concerns contributed to governments misleading their citizens about ufos and wrote that some ufo reports and analyses and perhaps voluminous files have been made inaccessible to the public which pays the bills  its time for the files to be declassified and made generally available he cautioned against jumping to conclusions about suppressed ufo data and stressed that there was no strong evidence that aliens were visiting the earth either in the past or present sagans paradox sagans contribution to the  symposium was an attack on the belief that ufos are piloted by extraterrestrial beings applying several logical assumptions see drake equation sagan calculated the possible number of advanced civilizations capable of interstellar travel to be about one million he projected that any civilization wishing to check on all the others on a regular basis of say once a year would have to launch  spacecraft annually not only does that seem like an unreasonable number of launchings but it would take all the material in one percent of the universes stars to produce all the spaceships needed for all the civilizations to seek each other out to argue that the earth was being chosen for regular visitations sagan said one would have to assume that the planet is somehow unique and that assumption goes exactly against the idea that there are lots of civilizations around because if there are then our sort of civilization must be pretty common and if were not pretty common then there arent going to be many civilizations advanced enough to send visitors this argument which some called sagans paradox helped to establish a new school of thought the belief that extraterrestrial life exists but has nothing to do with ufos the new belief had a salutary effect on ufo studies it helped separate researchers who wanted to identify unidentified flying objects from those who wanted to identify their pilots and it gave scientists opportunities to search the universe for intelligent life unencumbered by the stigma associated with ufos deathedit stone dedicated to carl sagan in the celebrity

links early lifeedit carl sagan was born in brooklyn new york his father samuel sagan was an immigrant garment worker from kamianetspodilskyi then in the russian empire in todays ukraine his mother rachel molly gruber was a housewife from new york carl was named in honor of rachels biological mother chaiya clara in sagans words the mother she never knew he had a sister carol and the family lived in a modest apartment near the atlantic ocean in bensonhurst a brooklyn neighborhood according to sagan they were reform jews the most liberal of north american judaisms four main groups both sagan and his sister agreed that their father was not especially religious but that their mother definitely believed in god and was active in the temple  and served only kosher meat during the depths of the depression his father worked as a theater usher according to biographer keay davidson sagans inner war was a result of his close relationship with both of his parents who were in many ways opposites sagan traced his later analytical urges to his mother a woman who had been extremely poor as a child in new york city during world war i and the s as a young woman she had held her own intellectual ambitions but they were frustrated by social restrictions her poverty her status as a woman and a wife and her jewish ethnicity davidson notes that she therefore worshipped her only son carl he would fulfill her unfulfilled dreams however he claimed that his sense of wonder came from his father in his free time he gave apples to the poor or helped soothe labormanagement tensions within new yorks garment industry although he was awed by carls intellectual abilities he took his sons inquisitiveness in stride and saw it as part of his growing up in his later years as a writer and scientist sagan would often draw on his childhood memories to illustrate scientific points as he did in his book shadows of forgotten ancestors sagan describes his parents influence on his later thinking my parents were not scientists they knew almost nothing about science but in introducing me simultaneously to skepticism and to wonder they taught me the two uneasily cohabiting modes of thought that are central to the scientific method  worlds fairedit sagan recalls that one of his most defining moments was when his parents took him to the  new york worlds fair when he was four years old the exhibits became a turning point in his life he later recalled the moving map of the america of tomorrow exhibit it showed beautiful highways and cloverleaves and little general motors cars all carrying people to skyscrapers buildings with lovely spires flying buttresses—and it looked great at other exhibits he remembered how a flashlight that shone on a photoelectric cell created a crackling sound and how the sound from a tuning fork became a wave on an oscilloscope he also witnessed the future media technology that would replace radio television sagan wrote plainly the world held wonders of a kind i had never guessed how could a tone become a picture and light become a noise he also saw one of the fairs most publicized events the burial of a time capsule at flushing meadows which contained mementos of the s to be recovered by earths descendants in a future millennium the time capsule thrilled carl writes davidson as an adult sagan and his colleagues would create similar time capsules—capsules that would be sent out into the galaxy these were the pioneer plaque and the voyager golden record précis all of which were spinoffs of sagans memories of the worlds fair world war iiedit during world war ii sagans family worried about the fate of their european relatives sagan however was generally unaware of the details of the ongoing war he wrote sure we had relatives who were caught up in the holocaust hitler was not a popular fellow in our household but on the other hand i was fairly insulated from the horrors of the war his sister carol said that their mother above all wanted to protect carl she had an extraordinarily difficult time dealing with world war ii and the holocaust sagans book the demonhaunted world  included his memories of this conflicted period when his family dealt with the realities of the war in europe but tried to prevent it from undermining his optimistic spirit inquisitiveness about natureedit soon after entering elementary school he began to express a strong inquisitiveness about nature sagan recalled taking his first trips to the public library alone at the age of five when his mother got him a library card he wanted to learn what stars were since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer i went to the librarian and asked for a book about stars  and the answer was stunning it was that the sun was a star but really close the stars were suns but so far away they were just little points of light  the scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me it was a kind of religious experience there was a magnificence to it a grandeur a scale which has never left me never ever left me at about age six or seven he and a close friend took trips to the american museum of natural history across the east river in manhattan while there they went to the hayden planetarium and walked around the museums exhibits of space objects such as meteorites and displays of dinosaurs and animals in natural settings sagan writes about those visits i was transfixed by the dioramas—lifelike representations of animals and their habitats all over the world penguins on the dimly lit antarctic ice a family of gorillas the male beating his chest an american grizzly bear standing on his hind legs ten or twelve feet tall and staring me right in the eye his parents helped nurture his growing interest in science by buying him chemistry sets and reading materials his interest in space however was his primary focus especially after reading science fiction stories by writers such as h g wells and edgar rice burroughs which stirred his imagination about life on other planets such as mars according to biographer ray spangenburg these early years as sagan tried to understand the mysteries of the planets became a driving force in his life a continual spark to his intellect and a quest that would never be forgotten in  he discovered astounding science fiction magazine which introduced him to more hard science fiction speculations than those in burroughss novels that same year inaugurated the flying saucer mass hysteria with the young carl suspecting the discs might be alien spaceships high school yearsedit sagan had lived in bensonhurst where he went to david a boody junior high school he had his bar mitzvah in bensonhurst when he turned  the following year  his family moved to the nearby town of rahway new jersey for his fathers work where sagan then entered rahway high school he graduated in  rahway was an older industrial town and the sagans were among its few jewish families photo of sagan from high school yearbook  sagan was a straighta student but was bored due to unchallenging classes and uninspiring teachers his teachers realized this and tried to convince his parents to send him to a private school the administrator telling them this kid ought to go to a school for gifted children he has something really remarkable this they couldnt do partly because of the cost sagan was made president of the schools chemistry club and at home he set up his own laboratory he taught himself about molecules by making cardboard cutouts to help him visualize how molecules were formed i found that about as interesting as doing chemical experiments he said sagan remained mostly interested in astronomy as a hobby and in his junior year made it a career goal after he learned that astronomers were paid for doing what he always enjoyed that was a splendid day­­­­—when i began to suspect that if i tried hard i could do astronomy fulltime not just parttime before the end of high school he entered an essay contest in which he posed the question of whether human contact with advanced life forms from another planet might be as disastrous for people on earth as it was for native americans when they first had contact with europeans the subject was considered controversial but his rhetorical skill won over the judges and they awarded him first prize by graduation his classmates had voted him most likely to succeed and put him in line to be valedictorian educationedit sagan attended the university of chicago which was one of the few colleges he applied to that would consider admitting a sixteenyearold despite his excellent high school grades its chancellor robert hutchins structured the school as an ideal meritocracy with no age requirement the school also employed a number of the nations leading scientists including enrico fermi and edward teller along with operating the famous yerkes observatory during his time as an honors program undergraduate sagan worked in the laboratory of the geneticist h j muller and wrote a thesis on the origins of life with physical chemist harold urey sagan joined the ryerson astronomical society received a ba degree in selfproclaimed nothing with general and special honors in  and a bs degree in physics in  he went on to earn a ms degree in physics in  before earning a phd degree in  with the dissertation physical studies of planets submitted to the department of astronomy and astrophysics he used the summer months of his graduate studies to work with his dissertation director planetary scientist gerard kuiper as well as physicist george gamow and chemist melvin calvin the title of sagans dissertation reflects his shared interests with kuiper who throughout the s had been president of the international astronomical unions commission on physical studies of planets and satellites in  the two worked on the classified military project a the secret air force plan to detonate a nuclear warhead on the moon sagan had a top secret clearance at the us air force and a secret clearance with nasa while working on his doctoral dissertation sagan revealed us government classified titles of two project a papers when he applied for a university of california at berkeley scholarship in  the leak was not publicly revealed until  when it was published in the journal nature a followup letter to the journal by project leader leonard reiffel confirmed sagans security leak scientific careeredit from  to  sagan was a miller fellow at the university of california berkeley meanwhile he published an article in  in the journal science on the atmosphere of venus while also working with nasas mariner  team and served as a planetary sciences consultant to the rand corporation play media sagan is one of those discussing the likelihood of life on other planets in whos out there  an awardwinning nasa documentary film by robert drew after the publication of sagans science article in  harvard university astronomers fred whipple and donald menzel offered sagan the opportunity to give a colloquium at harvard and they subsequently offered him a lecturer position at the institution sagan instead asked to be made an assistant professor and eventually whipple and menzel were able to convince harvard to offer sagan the assistant professor position he requested sagan lectured performed research and advised graduate students at the institution from  until  as well as working at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory both located in cambridge massachusetts in  sagan was denied tenure at harvard he later indicated the decision was very much unexpected the tenure denial has been blamed on several factors including that he focused his interests too broadly across a number of areas while the norm in academia is to become a renowned expert in a narrow specialty and perhaps because of his wellpublicized scientific advocacy which some scientists perceived as borrowing the ideas of others for little more than selfpromotion an advisor from his years as an undergraduate student harold urey wrote a letter to the tenure committee recommending strongly against tenure for sagan science is more than a body of knowledge it is a way of thinking i have a foreboding of an america in my childrens or grandchildrens time — when the united states is a service and information economy when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority when clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes our critical faculties in decline unable to distinguish between what feels good and whats true we slide almost without noticing back into superstition and darkness carl sagan from demonhaunted world  long before the illfated tenure process cornell university astronomer thomas gold had courted sagan to move to ithaca new york and join the faculty at cornell following the denial of tenure from harvard sagan accepted golds offer and remained a faculty member at cornell for nearly  years until his death in  unlike harvard the smaller and more laidback astronomy department at cornell welcomed sagans growing celebrity status following two years as an associate professor sagan became a full professor at cornell in  and directed the laboratory for planetary studies there from  to  he was associate director of the center for radiophysics and space research crsr at cornell in  he became the david duncan professor of astronomy and space sciences a position he held for the remainder of his life sagan was associated with the us space program from its inception from the s onward he worked as an advisor to nasa where one of his duties included briefing the apollo astronauts before their flights to the moon sagan contributed to many of the robotic spacecraft missions that explored the solar system arranging experiments on many of the expeditions sagan assembled the first physical message that was sent into space a goldanodized plaque attached to the space probe pioneer  launched in  pioneer  also carrying another copy of the plaque was launched the following year he continued to refine his designs the most elaborate message he helped to develop and assemble was the voyager golden record that was sent out with the voyager space probes in  sagan often challenged the decisions to fund the space shuttle and the international space station at the expense of further robotic missions scientific achievementsedit former student david morrison describes sagan as an idea person and a master of intuitive physical arguments and back of the envelope calculations and gerard kuiper said that some persons work best in specializing on a major program in the laboratory others are best in liaison between sciences dr sagan belongs in the latter group sagans contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of the planet venus in the early s no one knew for certain the basic conditions of that planets surface and sagan listed the possibilities in a report later depicted for popularization in a time–life book planets his own view was that venus was dry and very hot as opposed to the balmy paradise others had imagined he had investigated radio emissions from venus and concluded that there was a surface temperature of  °c  °f as a visiting scientist to nasas jet propulsion laboratory he contributed to the first mariner missions to venus working on the design and management of the project mariner  confirmed his conclusions on the surface conditions of venus in  sagan was amongclarification needed the first to hypothesize that saturns moon titan might possess oceans of liquid compounds on its surface and that jupiters moon europa might possess subsurface oceans of water this would make europa potentially habitable europas subsurface ocean of water was later indirectly confirmed by the spacecraft galileo the mystery of titans reddish haze was also solved with sagans help the reddish haze was revealed to be due to complex organic molecules constantly raining down onto titans surface he further contributed insights regarding the atmospheres of venus and jupiter as well as seasonal changes on mars he also perceived global warming as a growing manmade danger and likened it to the natural development of venus into a hot lifehostile planet through a kind of runaway greenhouse effect sagan and his cornell colleague edwin ernest salpeter speculated about life in jupiters clouds given the planets dense atmospheric composition rich in organic molecules he studied the observed color variations on mars surface and concluded that they were not seasonal or vegetational changes as most believedclarification needed but shifts in surface dust caused by windstorms sagan is best known however for his research on the possibilities of extraterrestrial life including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation he is also the  recipient of the public welfare medal the highest award of the national academy of sciences for distinguished contributions in the application of science to the public welfare he was denied membership in the academy reportedly because his media activities made him unpopular with many other scientists cosmos popularizing science on tvedit sagan in cosmos  in  sagan cowrote and narrated the awardwinning part pbs television series cosmos a personal voyage which became the most widely watched series in the history of american public television the show has been seen by at least  million people across  different countries the book cosmos written by sagan was published to accompany the series because of his earlier popularity as a science writer from his bestselling books including the dragons of eden which won him a pulitzer prize in  he was asked to write and narrate the show it was targeted to a general audience of viewers who sagan felt had lost interest in science partly due to a stifled educational system each of the  episodes was created to focus on a particular subject or person thereby demonstrating the synergy of the universe they covered a wide range of scientific subjects including the origin of life and a perspective of humans place on earth the show won an emmy along with a peabody award and transformed sagan from an obscure astronomer into a popculture icon time magazine ran a cover story about sagan soon after the show broadcast referring to him as creator chief writer and hostnarrator of the show in  cosmos was released on a remastered set of dvds billions and billionsedit see also sagans number sagan with a model of the viking lander that would land on mars sagan examined possible landing sites for viking along with mike carr and hal masursky from cosmos he was invited to frequent appearances on the tonight show starring johnny carson sagan became jokingly associated with the catchphrase billions and billions although he never actually used the phrase in the cosmos series he rather used the term billions upon billions carson however would sometimes use the phrase during his parodies of sagana as a humorous tribute to sagan and his association with the catchphrase billions and billions a sagan has been defined as a unit of measurement equivalent to a very large number of anything scientific and critical thinking advocacyedit sagans ability to convey his ideas allowed many people to understand the cosmos better—simultaneously emphasizing the value and worthiness of the human race and the relative insignificance of the earth in comparison to the universe he delivered the  series of royal institution christmas lectures in london sagan was a proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life he urged the scientific community to listen with radio telescopes for signals from potential intelligent extraterrestrial lifeforms sagan was so persuasive that by  he was able to get a petition advocating seti published in the journal science and signed by  scientists including seven nobel prize winners this signaled a tremendous increase in the respectability of a thencontroversial field sagan also helped frank drake write the arecibo message a radio message beamed into space from the arecibo radio telescope on november   aimed at informing potential extraterrestrials about earth sagan was chief technology officer of the professional planetary research journal icarus for twelve years he cofounded the planetary society and a member of the seti institute board of trustees sagan served as chairman of the division for planetary science of the american astronomical society as president of the planetology section of the american geophysical union and as chairman of the astronomy section of the american association for the advancement of science aaas the planetary society members at the organizations founding carl sagan is seated on the right at the height of the cold war sagan became involved in nuclear disarmament efforts by promoting hypotheses on the effects of nuclear war when paul crutzens twilight at noon concept suggested that a substantial nuclear exchange could trigger a nuclear twilight and upset the delicate balance of life on earth by cooling the surface in  he was one of five authors—the s—in the followup ttaps model as the research paper came to be known which contained the first usage of the term nuclear winter which his colleague richard p turco coined in  he coauthored the book the cold and the dark the world after nuclear war and in  he coauthored the book a path where no man thought nuclear winter and the end of the arms race which explains the nuclear winter hypothesis and with that advocates nuclear disarmament sagan received a great deal of skepticism and disdain for the use of media to disseminate a very uncertain hypothesis in personal correspondence with edward teller c  although beginning amicably with teller expressing support for continued research to ascertain the credibility of the winter hypothesis sagan and tellers correspondence would ultimately result in teller writing a propagandist is one who uses incomplete information to produce maximum persuasion i can compliment you on being indeed an excellent propagandist remembering that a propagandist is the better the less he appears to be one biographers of sagan would also comment that from a scientific viewpoint nuclear winter was a low point for sagan although politically speaking it popularized his image amongst the public sagan also wrote books to popularize science such as cosmos which reflected and expanded upon some of the themes of a personal voyage and became the bestselling science book ever published in english the dragons of eden speculations on the evolution of human intelligence which won a pulitzer prize and brocas brain reflections on the romance of science sagan also wrote the bestselling science fiction novel contact in  based on a film treatment he wrote with his wife in  but he did not live to see the books  motion picture adaptation which starred jodie foster and won the  hugo award for best dramatic presentation pale blue dot earth is a bright pixel when photographed from voyager  six billion kilometers out beyond pluto sagan encouraged nasa to generate this image from pale blue dot  on it everyone you ever heard ofthe aggregate of all our joys and sufferings thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines every hunter and forager every hero and coward every creator and destroyer of civilizations every king and peasant every young couple in love every hopeful child every mother and father every inventor and explorer every teacher of morals every corrupt politician every superstar every supreme leader every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam    think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot carl sagan cornell lecture in  he wrote a sequel to cosmos pale blue dot a vision of the human future in space which was selected as a notable book of  by the new york times he appeared on pbs charlie rose program in january  sagan also wrote the introduction for stephen hawkings bestseller a brief history of time sagan was also known for his popularization of science his efforts to increase scientific understanding among the general public and his positions in favor of scientific skepticism and against pseudoscience such as his debunking of the betty and barney hill abduction to mark the tenth anniversary of sagans death david morrison a former student of sagans recalled sagans immense contributions to planetary research the public understanding of science and the skeptical movement in skeptical inquirer following saddam husseins threats to light kuwaits oil wells on fire in response to any physical challenge to iraqi control of the oil assets sagan together with his ttaps colleagues and paul crutzen warned in january  in the baltimore sun and wilmington morning star newspapers that if the fires were left to burn over a period of several months enough smoke from the  or so  kuwaiti oil fires might get so high as to disrupt agriculture in much of south asia  and that this possibility should affect the war plans these claims were also the subject of a televised debate between sagan and physicist fred singer on  january aired on the abc news program nightline sagan admitted he had overestimated the danger posed by the  kuwaiti oil fires in the televised debate sagan argued that the effects of the smoke would be similar to the effects of a nuclear winter with singer arguing to the contrary after the debate the fires burnt for many months before extinguishing efforts were complete the results of the smoke did not produce continentalsized cooling sagan later conceded in the demonhaunted world that the prediction did not turn out to be correct it was pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped °–° c over the persian gulf but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and asia was spared in his later years sagan advocated the creation of an organized search for asteroidsnearearth objects neo that might impact the earth but to forestall or postpone developing the technological methods that would be needed to defend against them he argued that all of the numerous methods proposed to alter the orbit of an asteroid including the employment of nuclear detonations created a deflection dilemma if the ability to deflect an asteroid away from the earth exists then one would also have the ability to divert a nonthreatening object towards earth creating an immensely destructive weapon in a  paper he coauthored he ridiculed a day long nearearth object interception workshop held by lanl in  that did not even in passing state that such interception and deflection technologies could have these ancillary dangers sagan however was hopeful that the natural neo impact threat and the intrinsically doubleedged essence of the methods to prevent these threats would serve as a new and potent motivation to maturing international relations later acknowledging that with sufficient international oversight in the future a work our way up approach to fielding nuclear explosive deflection methods could be fielded and when sufficient knowledge was gained to use them to aid in mining asteroids his interest in the use of nuclear detonations in space grew out of his work in  for the armour research foundations project a concerning the possibility of detonating a nuclear device on the lunar surface sagan was a critic of plato having said of the ancient greek philosopher science and mathematics were to be removed from the hands of the merchants and the artisans this tendency found its most effective advocate in a follower of pythagoras named plato and he plato believed that ideas were far more real than the natural world he advised the astronomers not to waste their time observing the stars and planets it was better he believed just to think about them plato expressed hostility to observation and experiment he taught contempt for the real world and disdain for the practical application of scientific knowledge platos followers succeeded in extinguishing the light of science and experiment that had been kindled by democritus and the other ionians popularizing scienceedit speaking about his activities in popularizing science sagan said that there were at least two reasons for scientists to share the purposes of science and its contemporary state simple selfinterest was one much of the funding for science came from the public and the public therefore had the right to know how the money was being spent if scientists increased public admiration for science there was a good chance of having more public supportersclarification needed the other reason was the excitement of communicating ones own excitement about science to others criticismsedit while sagan was widely adored by the general public his reputation in the scientific community was more polarized critics sometimes characterized his work as fanciful nonrigorous and selfaggrandizing and others complained in his later years that he neglected his role as a faculty member to foster his celebrity status one of sagans harshest critics harold urey felt that sagan was getting too much publicity for a scientist and was treating some scientific theories too casually urey and sagan were said to have different philosophies of science according to davidson while urey was an oldtime empiricist who avoided theorizing about the unknown sagan was by contrast willing to speculate openly about such matters fred whipple wanted harvard to keep sagan there but learned that because urey was a nobel laureate his opinion was an important factor in harvard denying sagan tenure sagans harvard friend lester grinspoon also stated i know harvard well enough to know there are people there who certainly do not like people who are outspoken grinspoon added wherever you turned there was one astronomer being quoted on everything one astronomer whose face you were seeing on tv and one astronomer whose books had the preferred display slot at the local bookstore some like urey later came to realize sagans popular brand of scientific advocacy was beneficial to the science as a whole urey especially liked sagans  book the dragons of eden and wrote sagan with his opinion i like it very much and am amazed that someone like you has such an intimate knowledge of the various features of the problemi congratulate youyou are a man of many talents sagan was accused of borrowing some ideas of others for his own benefit while sagan countered these claims by explaining that the misappropriation was an unfortunate side effect of his role as a science communicator and explainer and that he attempted to give proper credit whenever possible social concernsedit sagan believed that the drake equation on substitution of reasonable estimates suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form but that the lack of evidence of such civilizations highlighted by the fermi paradox suggests technological civilizations tend to selfdestruct this stimulated his interest in identifying and publicizing ways that humanity could destroy itself with the hope of avoiding such a cataclysm and eventually becoming a spacefaring species sagans deep concern regarding the potential destruction of human civilization in a nuclear holocaust was conveyed in a memorable cinematic sequence in the final episode of cosmos called who speaks for earth sagan had already resigneddate missing from the air force scientific advisory boards ufo investigating condon committee and voluntarily surrendered his top secret clearance in protest over the vietnam war following his marriage to his third wife novelist ann druyan in june  sagan became more politically active—particularly in opposing escalation of the nuclear arms race under president ronald reagan the united states and soviet unionrussia nuclear stockpiles in total number of nuclear bombswarheads in existence throughout the cold war and postcold war era in march  reagan announced the strategic defense initiative—a multibilliondollar project to develop a comprehensive defense against attack by nuclear missiles which was quickly dubbed the star wars program sagan spoke out against the project arguing that it was technically impossible to develop a system with the level of perfection required and far more expensive to build such a system than it would be for an enemy to defeat it through decoys and other means—and that its construction would seriously destabilize the nuclear balance between the united states and the soviet union making further progress toward nuclear disarmament impossible when soviet leader mikhail gorbachev declared a unilateral moratorium on the testing of nuclear weapons which would begin on august  —the th anniversary of the atomic bombing of hiroshima—the reagan administration dismissed the dramatic move as nothing more than propaganda and refused to follow suit in response us antinuclear and peace activists staged a series of protest actions at the nevada test site beginning on easter sunday in  and continuing through  hundreds of people in the nevada desert experience group were arrested including sagan who was arrested on two separate occasions as he climbed over a chainlink fence at the test site during the underground operation charioteer and united statess musketeer nuclear test series of detonations sagan was also a vocal advocate of the controversial notion of testosterone poisoning arguing in  that human males could become gripped by an unusually severe case of testosterone poisoning and this could compel them to become genocidal in his review of moondance magazine writer daniela gioseffis  book women on war he argues that females are the only half of humanity untainted by testosterone poisoning one chapter of his  book shadows of forgotten ancestors is dedicated to testosterone and its alleged poisonous effects personal life and beliefsedit i have just finished the cosmic connection and loved every word of it you are my idea of a good writer because you have an unmannered style and when i read what you write i hear you talking one thing about the book made me nervous it was entirely too obvious that you are smarter than i am i hate that isaac asimov in letter to sagan  sagan was married three times in  he married biologist lynn margulis the couple had two children jeremy and dorion sagan after carl sagan and margulis divorced he married artist linda salzman in  and they also had a child together nick sagan during these marriages carl sagan focused heavily on his career a factor which may have contributed to sagans first divorce in  sagan married author ann druyan and they later had two children alexandra and samuel sagan carl sagan and druyan remained married until his death in  he lived in an egyptian revival house in ithaca perched on the edge of a cliff that had formerly been the headquarters of a cornell secret society isaac asimov described sagan as one of only two people he ever met whose intellect surpassed his own the other he claimed was the computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert marvin minsky sagan wrote frequently about religion and the relationship between religion and science expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of god as a sapient being for example some people think god is an outsized lightskinned male with a long white beard sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky busily tallying the fall of every sparrow others—for example baruch spinoza and albert einstein—considered god to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe i do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws in another description of his view on the concept of god sagan emphatically wrote the idea that god is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous but if by god one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe then clearly there is such a god this god is emotionally unsatisfying  it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity on atheism sagan commented in  an atheist is someone who is certain that god does not exist someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of god i know of no such compelling evidence because god can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes we would have to know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such god exists to be certain of the existence of god and to be certain of the nonexistence of god seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed sagan also commented on christianity and the jefferson bible stating my longtime view about christianity is that it represents an amalgam of two seemingly immiscible parts the religion of jesus and the religion of paul thomas jefferson attempted to excise the pauline parts of the new testament there wasnt much left when he was done but it was an inspiring document regarding spirituality and its relationship with science sagan stated spirit comes from the latin word to breathe what we breathe is air which is certainly matter however thin despite usage to the contrary there is no necessary implication in the word spiritual that we are talking of anything other than matter including the matter of which the brain is made or anything outside the realm of science on occasion i will feel free to use the word science is not only compatible with spirituality it is a profound source of spirituality when we recognize our place in an immensity of lightyears and in the passage of ages when we grasp the intricacy beauty and subtlety of life then that soaring feeling that sense of elation and humility combined is surely spiritual an environmental appeal preserving and cherishing the earth signed by sagan with other noted scientists in january  stated that the historical record makes clear that religious teaching example and leadership are powerfully able to influence personal conduct and commitment thus there is a vital role for religion and science in reply to a question in  about his religious beliefs sagan answered im agnostic sagan maintained that the idea of a creator god of the universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe sagans views on religion have been interpreted as a form of pantheism comparable to einsteins belief in spinozas god his son dorion sagan said my father believed in the god of spinoza and einstein god not behind nature but as nature equivalent to it his last wife ann druyan stated when my husband died because he was so famous and known for not being a believer many people would come up to me—it still sometimes happens—and ask me if carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife they also frequently ask me if i think i will see him again carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions the tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again i dont ever expect to be reunited with carl in  ann druyan edited sagans  glasgow gifford lectures in natural theology into a book the varieties of scientific experience a personal view of the search for god in which he elaborates on his views of divinity in the natural world carl sagan center speaks with cdc employees in  sagan is also widely regarded as a freethinker or skeptic one of his most famous quotations in cosmos was extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence called the sagan standard by some this was based on a nearly identical statement by fellow founder of the committee for the scientific investigation of claims of the paranormal marcello truzzi an extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof this idea had been earlier aphorized in théodore flournoys work from india to the planet mars  from a longer quote by pierresimon laplace – a french mathematician and astronomer as the principle of laplace the weight of the evidence should be proportioned to the strangeness of the facts late in his life sagans books elaborated on his skeptical naturalistic view of the world in the demonhaunted world he presented tools for testing arguments and detecting fallacious or fraudulent ones essentially advocating wide use of critical thinking and the scientific method the compilation billions and billions thoughts on life and death at the brink of the millennium published in  after sagans death contains essays written by sagan such as his views on abortion and his widow ann druyans account of his death as a skeptic agnostic and freethinker sagan warned against humans tendency towards anthropocentrism he was the faculty adviser for the cornell students for the ethical treatment of animals in the cosmos chapter blues for a red planet sagan wrote if there is life on mars i believe we should do nothing with mars mars then belongs to the martians even if the martians are only microbes sagan was a user and advocate of marijuana under the pseudonym mr x he contributed an essay about smoking cannabis to the  book marihuana reconsidered the essay explained that marijuana use had helped to inspire some of sagans works and enhance sensual and intellectual experiences after sagans death his friend lester grinspoon disclosed this information to sagans biographer keay davidson the publishing of the biography carl sagan a life in  brought media attention to this aspect of sagans life not long after his death widow ann druyan had gone on to preside over the board of directors of the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws norml a nonprofit organization dedicated to reforming cannabis laws in  engineers at apple computer codenamed the power macintosh  carl sagan in the hope that apple would make billions and billions with the sale of the powermac  the name was only used internally but sagan was concerned that it would become a product endorsement and sent apple a ceaseanddesist letter apple complied but engineers retaliated by changing the internal codename to bha for “butthead astronomer” sagan then sued apple for libel in federal court the court granted apples motion to dismiss sagans claims and opined in dicta that a reader aware of the context would understand apple was clearly attempting to retaliate in a humorous and satirical way and that it strains reason to conclude that defendant was attempting to criticize plaintiffs reputation or competency as an astronomer one does not seriously attack the expertise of a scientist using the undefined phrase butthead sagan then sued for apples original use of his name and likeness but again lost sagan appealed the ruling in november  an outofcourt settlement was reached and apples office of trademarks and patents released a conciliatory statement that apple has always had great respect for dr sagan it was never apples intention to cause dr sagan or his family any embarrassment or concern apples third and final code name for the project was law short for lawyers are wimps sagan briefly served as an adviser on stanley kubricks film  a space odyssey sagan proposed that the film suggest rather than depict extraterrestrial superintelligence sagan and ufosedit in  the year that inaugurated the flying saucer craze the young sagan suspected the discs might be alien spaceships sagans interest in ufo reports prompted him on august   to write a letter to us secretary of state dean acheson to ask how the united states would respond if flying saucers turned out to be extraterrestrial– he later had several conversations on the subject in  with jacques vallée though quite skeptical of any extraordinary answer to the ufo question sagan thought scientists should study the phenomenon at least because there was widespread public interest in ufo reports stuart appelle notes that sagan wrote frequently on what he perceived as the logical and empirical fallacies regarding ufos and the abduction experience sagan rejected an extraterrestrial explanation for the phenomenon but felt there were both empirical and pedagogical benefits for examining ufo reports and that the subject was therefore a legitimate topic of study in  sagan was a member of the ad hoc committee to review project blue book the us air forces ufo investigation project the committee concluded blue book had been lacking as a scientific study and recommended a universitybased project to give the ufo phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny the result was the condon committee – led by physicist edward condon and in their final report they formally concluded that ufos regardless of what any of them actually were did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security sociologist ron westrum writes that the high point of sagans treatment of the ufo question was the aaas symposium in  a wide range of educated opinions on the subject were offered by participants including not only proponents such as james mcdonald and j allen hynek but also skeptics like astronomers william hartmann and donald menzel the roster of speakers was balanced and it is to sagans credit that this event was presented in spite of pressure from edward condon with physicist thornton page sagan edited the lectures and discussions given at the symposium these were published in  as ufos a scientific debate some of sagans many books examine ufos as did one episode of cosmos and he claimed a religious undercurrent to the phenomenon sagan again revealed his views on interstellar travel in his  cosmos series in one of his last written works sagan argued that the chances of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting earth are vanishingly small however sagan did think it plausible that cold war concerns contributed to governments misleading their citizens about ufos and wrote that some ufo reports and analyses and perhaps voluminous files have been made inaccessible to the public which pays the bills  its time for the files to be declassified and made generally available he cautioned against jumping to conclusions about suppressed ufo data and stressed that there was no strong evidence that aliens were visiting the earth either in the past or present sagans paradox sagans contribution to the  symposium was an attack on the belief that ufos are piloted by extraterrestrial beings applying several logical assumptions see drake equation sagan calculated the possible number of advanced civilizations capable of interstellar travel to be about one million he projected that any civilization wishing to check on all the others on a regular basis of say once a year would have to launch  spacecraft annually not only does that seem like an unreasonable number of launchings but it would take all the material in one percent of the universes stars to produce all the spaceships needed for all the civilizations to seek each other out to argue that the earth was being chosen for regular visitations sagan said one would have to assume that the planet is somehow unique and that assumption goes exactly against the idea that there are lots of civilizations around because if there are then our sort of civilization must be pretty common and if were not pretty common then there arent going to be many civilizations advanced enough to send visitors this argument which some called sagans paradox helped to establish a new school of thought the belief that extraterrestrial life exists but has nothing to do with ufos the new belief had a salutary effect on ufo studies it helped separate researchers who wanted to identify unidentified flying objects from those who wanted to identify their pilots and it gave scientists opportunities to search the universe for intelligent life unencumbered by the stigma associated with ufos deathedit stone dedicated to carl sagan in the celebrity path of the brooklyn botanic garden after suffering from myelodysplasia for two years and receiving three bone marrow

administrator daniel goldin ann druyan was at the center as it opened its doors on october   sagan has at least three awards named in his honor the carl sagan memorial award presented jointly since

observed to have used the phrase billions and billions many times in his red books however sagans frequent use of the word billions and distinctive delivery emphasizing the b which he did intentionally in place of more cumbersome alternatives such as billions with a b in order to distinguish the word from millions made him a favorite target of comic performers including johnny carson gary kroeger mike myers bronson pinchot penn jillette harry shearer and others frank zappa satirized the line in the song be in my video noting as well atomic light sagan took this all in good humor and his final book was entitled billions and billions which opened with a tongueincheek discussion of this catchphrase observing that carson was an amateur astronomer and that carsons comic caricature

rachel molly gruber was a housewife from new york carl was named in honor of rachels biological mother chaiya clara in sagans words the mother she never knew he had a sister carol and the family lived in a modest apartment near the atlantic ocean in bensonhurst a brooklyn neighborhood according to sagan they were reform jews the most liberal of north american judaisms four main groups both sagan and his sister agreed that their father was not especially religious but that their mother definitely believed in god and was active in the temple  and served only kosher meat during the depths of the depression his father worked as a theater usher according to biographer keay davidson sagans inner war was a result of his close relationship with both of his parents who were in many ways opposites sagan traced his later analytical urges to his mother a woman who had been extremely poor as a child in new york city during world war i and the s as a young woman she had held her own intellectual ambitions but they were frustrated by social restrictions her poverty her status as a woman and a wife and her jewish ethnicity davidson notes that she therefore worshipped her only son carl he would fulfill her unfulfilled dreams however he claimed that his sense of wonder came from his father in his free time he gave apples to the poor or helped soothe labormanagement tensions within new yorks garment industry although he was awed by carls intellectual abilities he took his sons inquisitiveness in stride and saw it as part of his growing up in his later years as a writer and scientist sagan would often draw on his childhood memories to illustrate scientific points as he did in his book shadows of forgotten ancestors sagan describes his parents influence on his later thinking my parents were not scientists they knew almost nothing about science but in introducing me simultaneously to skepticism and to wonder they taught me the two uneasily cohabiting modes of thought that are central to the scientific method  worlds fairedit sagan recalls that one of his most defining moments was when his parents took him to the  new york worlds fair when he was four years old the exhibits became a turning point in his life he later recalled the moving map of the america of tomorrow exhibit it showed beautiful highways and cloverleaves and little general motors cars all carrying people to skyscrapers buildings with lovely spires flying buttresses—and it looked great at other exhibits he remembered how a flashlight that shone on a photoelectric cell created a crackling sound and how the sound from a tuning fork became a wave on an oscilloscope he also witnessed the future media technology that would replace radio television sagan wrote plainly the world held wonders of a kind i had never guessed how could a tone become a picture and light become a noise he also saw one of the fairs most publicized events the burial of a time capsule at flushing meadows which contained mementos of the s to be recovered by earths descendants in a future millennium the time capsule thrilled carl writes davidson as an adult sagan and his colleagues would create similar time capsules—capsules that would be sent out into the galaxy these were the pioneer plaque and the voyager golden record précis all of which were spinoffs of sagans memories of the worlds fair world war iiedit during world war ii sagans family worried about the fate of their european relatives sagan however was generally unaware of the details of the ongoing war he wrote sure we had relatives who were caught up in the holocaust hitler was not a popular fellow in our household but on the other hand i was fairly insulated from the horrors of the war his sister carol said that their mother above all wanted to protect carl she had an extraordinarily difficult time dealing with world war ii and the holocaust sagans book the demonhaunted world  included his memories of this conflicted period when his family dealt with the realities of the war in europe but tried to prevent it from undermining his optimistic spirit inquisitiveness about natureedit soon after entering elementary school he began to express a strong inquisitiveness about nature sagan recalled taking his first trips to the public library alone at the age of five when his mother got him a library card he wanted to learn what stars were since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer i went to the librarian and asked for a book about stars  and the answer was stunning it was that the sun was a star but really close the stars were suns but so far away they were just little points of light  the scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me it was a kind of religious experience there was a magnificence to it a grandeur a scale which has never left me never ever left me at about age six or seven he and a close friend took trips to the american museum of natural history across the east river in manhattan while there they went to the hayden planetarium and walked around the museums exhibits of space objects such as meteorites and displays of dinosaurs and animals in natural settings sagan writes about those visits i was transfixed by the dioramas—lifelike representations of animals and their habitats all over the world penguins on the dimly lit antarctic ice a family of gorillas the male beating his chest an american grizzly bear standing on his hind legs ten or twelve feet tall and staring me right in the eye his parents helped nurture his growing interest in science by buying him chemistry sets and reading materials his interest in space however was his primary focus especially after reading science fiction stories by writers such as h g wells and edgar rice burroughs which stirred his imagination about life on other planets such as mars according to biographer ray spangenburg these early years as sagan tried to understand the mysteries of the planets became a driving force in his life a continual spark to his intellect and a quest that would never be forgotten in  he discovered astounding science fiction magazine which introduced him to more hard science fiction speculations than those in burroughss novels that same year inaugurated the flying saucer mass hysteria with the young carl suspecting the discs might be alien spaceships high school yearsedit sagan had lived in bensonhurst where he went to david a boody junior high school he had his bar mitzvah in bensonhurst when he turned  the following year  his family moved to the nearby town of rahway new jersey for his fathers work where sagan then entered rahway high school he graduated in  rahway was an older industrial town and the sagans were among its few jewish families photo of sagan from high school yearbook  sagan was a straighta student but was bored due to unchallenging classes and uninspiring teachers his teachers realized this and tried to convince his parents to send him to a private school the administrator telling them this kid ought to go to a school for gifted children he has something really remarkable this they couldnt do partly because of the cost sagan was made president of the schools chemistry club and at home he set up his own laboratory he taught himself about molecules by making cardboard cutouts to help him visualize how molecules were formed i found that about as interesting as doing chemical experiments he said sagan remained mostly interested in astronomy as a hobby and in his junior year made it a career goal after he learned that astronomers were paid for doing what he always enjoyed that was a splendid day­­­­—when i began to suspect that if i tried hard i could do astronomy fulltime not just parttime before the end of high school he entered an essay contest in which he posed the question of whether human contact with advanced life forms from another planet might be as disastrous for people on earth as it was for native americans when they first had contact with europeans the subject was considered controversial but his rhetorical skill won over the judges and they awarded him first prize by graduation his classmates had voted him most likely to succeed and put him in line to be valedictorian educationedit sagan attended the university of chicago which was one of the few colleges he applied to that would consider admitting a sixteenyearold despite his excellent high school grades its chancellor robert hutchins structured the school as an ideal meritocracy with no age requirement the school also employed a number of the nations leading scientists including enrico fermi and edward teller along with operating the famous yerkes observatory during his time as an honors program undergraduate sagan worked in the laboratory of the geneticist h j muller and wrote a thesis on the origins of life with physical chemist harold urey sagan joined the ryerson astronomical society received a ba degree in selfproclaimed nothing with general and special honors in  and a bs degree in physics in  he went on to earn a ms degree in physics in  before earning a phd degree in  with the dissertation physical studies of planets submitted to the department of astronomy and astrophysics he used the summer months of his graduate studies to work with his dissertation director planetary scientist gerard kuiper as well as physicist george gamow and chemist melvin calvin the title of sagans dissertation reflects his shared interests with kuiper who throughout the s had been president of the international astronomical unions commission on physical studies of planets and satellites in  the two worked on the classified military project a the secret air force plan to detonate a nuclear warhead on the moon sagan had a top secret clearance at the us air force and a secret clearance with nasa while working on his doctoral dissertation sagan revealed us government classified titles of two project a papers when he applied for a university of california at berkeley scholarship in  the leak was not publicly revealed until  when it was published in the journal nature a followup letter to the journal by project leader leonard reiffel confirmed sagans security leak scientific careeredit from  to  sagan was a miller fellow at the university of california berkeley meanwhile he published an article in  in the journal science on the atmosphere of venus while also working with nasas mariner  team and served as a planetary sciences consultant to the rand corporation play media sagan is one of those discussing the likelihood of life on other planets in whos out there  an awardwinning nasa documentary film by robert drew after the publication of sagans science article in  harvard university astronomers fred whipple and donald menzel offered sagan the opportunity to give a colloquium at harvard and they subsequently offered him a lecturer position at the institution sagan instead asked to be made an assistant professor and eventually whipple and menzel were able to convince harvard to offer sagan the assistant professor position he requested sagan lectured performed research and advised graduate students at the institution from  until  as well as working at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory both located in cambridge massachusetts in  sagan was denied tenure at harvard he later indicated the decision was very much unexpected the tenure denial has been blamed on several factors including that he focused his interests too broadly across a number of areas while the norm in academia is to become a renowned expert in a narrow specialty and perhaps because of his wellpublicized scientific advocacy which some scientists perceived as borrowing the ideas of others for little more than selfpromotion an advisor from his years as an undergraduate student harold urey wrote a letter to the tenure committee recommending strongly against tenure for sagan science is more than a body of knowledge it is a way of thinking i have a foreboding of an america in my childrens or grandchildrens time — when the united states is a service and information economy when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority when clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes our critical faculties in decline unable to distinguish between what feels good and whats true we slide almost without noticing back into superstition and darkness carl sagan from demonhaunted world  long before the illfated tenure process cornell university astronomer thomas gold had courted sagan to move to ithaca new york and join the faculty at cornell following the denial of tenure from harvard sagan accepted golds offer and remained a faculty member at cornell for nearly  years until his death in  unlike harvard the smaller and more laidback astronomy department at cornell welcomed sagans growing celebrity status following two years as an associate professor sagan became a full professor at cornell in  and directed the laboratory for planetary studies there from  to  he was associate director of the center for radiophysics and space research crsr at cornell in  he became the david duncan professor of astronomy and space sciences a position he held for the remainder of his life sagan was associated with the us space program from its inception from the s onward he worked as an advisor to nasa where one of his duties included briefing the apollo astronauts before their flights to the moon sagan contributed to many of the robotic spacecraft missions that explored the solar system arranging experiments on many of the expeditions sagan assembled the first physical message that was sent into space a goldanodized plaque attached to the space probe pioneer  launched in  pioneer  also carrying another copy of the plaque was launched the following year he continued to refine his designs the most elaborate message he helped to develop and assemble was the voyager golden record that was sent out with the voyager space probes in  sagan often challenged the decisions to fund the space shuttle and the international space station at the expense of further robotic missions scientific achievementsedit former student david morrison describes sagan as an idea person and a master of intuitive physical arguments and back of the envelope calculations and gerard kuiper said that some persons work best in specializing on a major program in the laboratory others are best in liaison between sciences dr sagan belongs in the latter group sagans contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of the planet venus in the early s no one knew for certain the basic conditions of that planets surface and sagan listed the possibilities in a report later depicted for popularization in a time–life book planets his own view was that venus was dry and very hot as opposed to the balmy paradise others had imagined he had investigated radio emissions from venus and concluded that there was a surface temperature of  °c  °f as a visiting scientist to nasas jet propulsion laboratory he contributed to the first mariner missions to venus working on the design and management of the project mariner  confirmed his conclusions on the surface conditions of venus in  sagan was amongclarification needed the first to hypothesize that saturns moon titan might possess oceans of liquid compounds on its surface and that jupiters moon europa might possess subsurface oceans of water this would make europa potentially habitable europas subsurface ocean of water was later indirectly confirmed by the spacecraft galileo the mystery of titans reddish haze was also solved with sagans help the reddish haze was revealed to be due to complex organic molecules constantly raining down onto titans surface he further contributed insights regarding the atmospheres of venus and jupiter as well as seasonal changes on mars he also perceived global warming as a growing manmade danger and likened it to the natural development of venus into a hot lifehostile planet through a kind of runaway greenhouse effect sagan and his cornell colleague edwin ernest salpeter speculated about life in jupiters clouds given the planets dense atmospheric composition rich in organic molecules he studied the observed color variations on mars surface and concluded that they were not seasonal or vegetational changes as most believedclarification needed but shifts in surface dust caused by windstorms sagan is best known however for his research on the possibilities of extraterrestrial life including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation he is also the  recipient of the public welfare medal the highest award of the national academy of sciences for distinguished contributions in the application of science to the public welfare he was denied membership in the academy reportedly because his media activities made him unpopular with many other scientists cosmos popularizing science on tvedit sagan in cosmos  in  sagan cowrote and narrated the awardwinning part pbs television series cosmos a personal voyage which became the most widely watched series in the history of american public television the show has been seen by at least  million people across  different countries the book cosmos written by sagan was published to accompany the series because of his earlier popularity as a science writer from his bestselling books including the dragons of eden which won him a pulitzer prize in  he was asked to write and narrate the show it was targeted to a general audience of viewers who sagan felt had lost interest in science partly due to a stifled educational system each of the  episodes was created to focus on a particular subject or person thereby demonstrating the synergy of the universe they covered a wide range of scientific subjects including the origin of life and a perspective of humans place on earth the show won an emmy along with a peabody award and transformed sagan from an obscure astronomer into a popculture icon time magazine ran a cover story about sagan soon after the show broadcast referring to him as creator chief writer and hostnarrator of the show in  cosmos was released on a remastered set of dvds billions and billionsedit see also sagans number sagan with a model of the viking lander that would land on mars sagan examined possible landing sites for viking along with mike carr and hal masursky from cosmos he was invited to frequent appearances on the tonight show starring johnny carson sagan became jokingly associated with the catchphrase billions and billions although he never actually used the phrase in the cosmos series he rather used the term billions upon billions carson however would sometimes use the phrase during his parodies of sagana as a humorous tribute to sagan and his association with the catchphrase billions and billions a sagan has been defined as a unit of measurement equivalent to a very large number of anything scientific and critical thinking advocacyedit sagans ability to convey his ideas allowed many people to understand the cosmos better—simultaneously emphasizing the value and worthiness of the human race and the relative insignificance of the earth in comparison to the universe he delivered the  series of royal institution christmas lectures in london sagan was a proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life he urged the scientific community to listen with radio telescopes for signals from potential intelligent extraterrestrial lifeforms sagan was so persuasive that by  he was able to get a petition advocating seti published in the journal science and signed by  scientists including seven nobel prize winners this signaled a tremendous increase in the respectability of a thencontroversial field sagan also helped frank drake write the arecibo message a radio message beamed into space from the arecibo radio telescope on november   aimed at informing potential extraterrestrials about earth sagan was chief technology officer of the professional planetary research journal icarus for twelve years he cofounded the planetary society and a member of the seti institute board of trustees sagan served as chairman of the division for planetary science of the american astronomical society as president of the planetology section of the american geophysical union and as chairman of the astronomy section of the american association for the advancement of science aaas the planetary society members at the organizations founding carl sagan is seated on the right at the height of the cold war sagan became involved in nuclear disarmament efforts by promoting hypotheses on the effects of nuclear war when paul crutzens twilight at noon concept suggested that a substantial nuclear exchange could trigger a nuclear twilight and upset the delicate balance of life on earth by cooling the surface in  he was one of five authors—the s—in the followup ttaps model as the research paper came to be known which contained the first usage of the term nuclear winter which his colleague richard p turco coined in  he coauthored the book the cold and the dark the world after nuclear war and in  he coauthored the book a path where no man thought nuclear winter and the end of the arms race which explains the nuclear winter hypothesis and with that advocates nuclear disarmament sagan received a great deal of skepticism and disdain for the use of media to disseminate a very uncertain hypothesis in personal correspondence with edward teller c  although beginning amicably with teller expressing support for continued research to ascertain the credibility of the winter hypothesis sagan and tellers correspondence would ultimately result in teller writing a propagandist is one who uses incomplete information to produce maximum persuasion i can compliment you on being indeed an excellent propagandist remembering that a propagandist is the better the less he appears to be one biographers of sagan would also comment that from a scientific viewpoint nuclear winter was a low point for sagan although politically speaking it popularized his image amongst the public sagan also wrote books to popularize science such as cosmos which reflected and expanded upon some of the themes of a personal voyage and became the bestselling science book ever published in english the dragons of eden speculations on the evolution of human intelligence which won a pulitzer prize and brocas brain reflections on the romance of science sagan also wrote the bestselling science fiction novel contact in  based on a film treatment he wrote with his wife in  but he did not live to see the books  motion picture adaptation which starred jodie foster and won the  hugo award for best dramatic presentation pale blue dot earth is a bright pixel when photographed from voyager  six billion kilometers out beyond pluto sagan encouraged nasa to generate this image from pale blue dot  on it everyone you ever heard ofthe aggregate of all our joys and sufferings thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines every hunter and forager every hero and coward every creator and destroyer of civilizations every king and peasant every young couple in love every hopeful child every mother and father every inventor and explorer every teacher of morals every corrupt politician every superstar every supreme leader every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam    think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot carl sagan cornell lecture in  he wrote a sequel to cosmos pale blue dot a vision of the human future in space which was selected as a notable book of  by the new york times he appeared on pbs charlie rose program in january  sagan also wrote the introduction for stephen hawkings bestseller a brief history of time sagan was also known for his popularization of science his efforts to increase scientific understanding among the general public and his positions in favor of scientific skepticism and against pseudoscience such as his debunking of the betty and barney hill abduction to mark the tenth anniversary of sagans death david morrison a former student of sagans recalled sagans immense contributions to planetary research the public understanding of science and the skeptical movement in skeptical inquirer following saddam husseins threats to light kuwaits oil wells on fire in response to any physical challenge to iraqi control of the oil assets sagan together with his ttaps colleagues and paul crutzen warned in january  in the baltimore sun and wilmington morning star newspapers that if the fires were left to burn over a period of several months enough smoke from the  or so  kuwaiti oil fires might get so high as to disrupt agriculture in much of south asia  and that this possibility should affect the war plans these claims were also the subject of a televised debate between sagan and physicist fred singer on  january aired on the abc news program nightline sagan admitted he had overestimated the danger posed by the  kuwaiti oil fires in the televised debate sagan argued that the effects of the smoke would be similar to the effects of a nuclear winter with singer arguing to the contrary after the debate the fires burnt for many months before extinguishing efforts were complete the results of the smoke did not produce continentalsized cooling sagan later conceded in the demonhaunted world that the prediction did not turn out to be correct it was pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped °–° c over the persian gulf but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and asia was spared in his later years sagan advocated the creation of an organized search for asteroidsnearearth objects neo that might impact the earth but to forestall or postpone developing the technological methods that would be needed to defend against them he argued that all of the numerous methods proposed to alter the orbit of an asteroid including the employment of nuclear detonations created a deflection dilemma if the ability to deflect an asteroid away from the earth exists then one would also have the ability to divert a nonthreatening object towards earth creating an immensely destructive weapon in a  paper he coauthored he ridiculed a day long nearearth object interception workshop held by lanl in  that did not even in passing state that such interception and deflection technologies could have these ancillary dangers sagan however was hopeful that the natural neo impact threat and the intrinsically doubleedged essence of the methods to prevent these threats would serve as a new and potent motivation to maturing international relations later acknowledging that with sufficient international oversight in the future a work our way up approach to fielding nuclear explosive deflection methods could be fielded and when sufficient knowledge was gained to use them to aid in mining asteroids his interest in the use of nuclear detonations in space grew out of his work in  for the armour research foundations project a concerning the possibility of detonating a nuclear device on the lunar surface sagan was a critic of plato having said of the ancient greek philosopher science and mathematics were to be removed from the hands of the merchants and the artisans this tendency found its most effective advocate in a follower of pythagoras named plato and he plato believed that ideas were far more real than the natural world he advised the astronomers not to waste their time observing the stars and planets it was better he believed just to think about them plato expressed hostility to observation and experiment he taught contempt for the real world and disdain for the practical application of scientific knowledge platos followers succeeded in extinguishing the light of science and experiment that had been kindled by democritus and the other ionians popularizing scienceedit speaking about his activities in popularizing science sagan said that there were at least two reasons for scientists to share the purposes of science and its contemporary state simple selfinterest was one much of the funding for science came from the public and the public therefore had the right to know how the money was being spent if scientists increased public admiration for science there was a good chance of having more public supportersclarification needed the other reason was the excitement of communicating ones own excitement about science to others criticismsedit while sagan was widely adored by the general public his reputation in the scientific community was more polarized critics sometimes characterized his work as fanciful nonrigorous and selfaggrandizing and others complained in his later years that he neglected his role as a faculty member to foster his celebrity status one of sagans harshest critics harold urey felt that sagan was getting too much publicity for a scientist and was treating some scientific theories too casually urey and sagan were said to have different philosophies of science according to davidson while urey was an oldtime empiricist who avoided theorizing about the unknown sagan was by contrast willing to speculate openly about such matters fred whipple wanted harvard to keep sagan there but learned that because urey was a nobel laureate his opinion was an important factor in harvard denying sagan tenure sagans harvard friend lester grinspoon also stated i know harvard well enough to know there are people there who certainly do not like people who are outspoken grinspoon added wherever you turned there was one astronomer being quoted on everything one astronomer whose face you were seeing on tv and one astronomer whose books had the preferred display slot at the local bookstore some like urey later came to realize sagans popular brand of scientific advocacy was beneficial to the science as a whole urey especially liked sagans  book the dragons of eden and wrote sagan with his opinion i like it very much and am amazed that someone like you has such an intimate knowledge of the various features of the problemi congratulate youyou are a man of many talents sagan was accused of borrowing some ideas of others for his own benefit while sagan countered these claims by explaining that the misappropriation was an unfortunate side effect of his role as a science communicator and explainer and that he attempted to give proper credit whenever possible social concernsedit sagan believed that the drake equation on substitution of reasonable estimates suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form but that the lack of evidence of such civilizations highlighted by the fermi paradox suggests technological civilizations tend to selfdestruct this stimulated his interest in identifying and publicizing ways that humanity could destroy itself with the hope of avoiding such a cataclysm and eventually becoming a spacefaring species sagans deep concern regarding the potential destruction of human civilization in a nuclear holocaust was conveyed in a memorable cinematic sequence in the final episode of cosmos called who speaks for earth sagan had already resigneddate missing from the air force scientific advisory boards ufo investigating condon committee and voluntarily surrendered his top secret clearance in protest over the vietnam war following his marriage to his third wife novelist ann druyan in june  sagan became more politically active—particularly in opposing escalation of the nuclear arms race under president ronald reagan the united states and soviet unionrussia nuclear stockpiles in total number of nuclear bombswarheads in existence throughout the cold war and postcold war era in march  reagan announced the strategic defense initiative—a multibilliondollar project to develop a comprehensive defense against attack by nuclear missiles which was quickly dubbed the star wars program sagan spoke out against the project arguing that it was technically impossible to develop a system with the level of perfection required and far more expensive to build such a system than it would be for an enemy to defeat it through decoys and other means—and that its construction would seriously destabilize the nuclear balance between the united states and the soviet union making further progress toward nuclear disarmament impossible when soviet leader mikhail gorbachev declared a unilateral moratorium on the testing of nuclear weapons which would begin on august  —the th anniversary of the atomic bombing of hiroshima—the reagan administration dismissed the dramatic move as nothing more than propaganda and refused to follow suit in response us antinuclear and peace activists staged a series of protest actions at the nevada test site beginning on easter sunday in  and continuing through  hundreds of people in the nevada desert experience group were arrested including sagan who was arrested on two separate occasions as he climbed over a chainlink fence at the test site during the underground operation charioteer and united statess musketeer nuclear test series of detonations sagan was also a vocal advocate of the controversial notion of testosterone poisoning arguing in  that human males could become gripped by an unusually severe case of testosterone poisoning and this could compel them to become genocidal in his review of moondance magazine writer daniela gioseffis  book women on war he argues that females are the only half of humanity untainted by testosterone poisoning one chapter of his  book shadows of forgotten ancestors is dedicated to testosterone and its alleged poisonous effects personal life and beliefsedit i have just finished the cosmic connection and loved every word of it you are my idea of a good writer because you have an unmannered style and when i read what you write i hear you talking one thing about the book made me nervous it was entirely too obvious that you are smarter than i am i hate that isaac asimov in letter to sagan  sagan was married three times in  he married biologist lynn margulis the couple had two children jeremy and dorion sagan after carl sagan and margulis divorced he married artist linda salzman in  and they also had a child together nick sagan during these marriages carl sagan focused heavily on his career a factor which may have contributed to sagans first divorce in  sagan married author ann druyan and they later had two children alexandra and samuel sagan carl sagan and druyan remained married until his death in  he lived in an egyptian revival house in ithaca perched on the edge of a cliff that had formerly been the headquarters of a cornell secret society isaac asimov described sagan as one of only two people he ever met whose intellect surpassed his own the other he claimed was the computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert marvin minsky sagan wrote frequently about religion and the relationship between religion and science expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of god as a sapient being for example some people think god is an outsized lightskinned male with a long white beard sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky busily tallying the fall of every sparrow others—for example baruch spinoza and albert einstein—considered god to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe i do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws in another description of his view on the concept of god sagan emphatically wrote the idea that god is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous but if by god one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe then clearly there is such a god this god is emotionally unsatisfying  it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity on atheism sagan commented in  an atheist is someone who is certain that god does not exist someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of god i know of no such compelling evidence because god can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes we would have to know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such god exists to be certain of the existence of god and to be certain of the nonexistence of god seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed sagan also commented on christianity and the jefferson bible stating my longtime view about christianity is that it represents an amalgam of two seemingly immiscible parts the religion of jesus and the religion of paul thomas jefferson attempted to excise the pauline parts of the new testament there wasnt much left when he was done but it was an inspiring document regarding spirituality and its relationship with science sagan stated spirit comes from the latin word to breathe what we breathe is air which is certainly matter however thin despite usage to the contrary there is no necessary implication in the word spiritual that we are talking of anything other than matter including the matter of which the brain is made or anything outside the realm of science on occasion i will feel free to use the word science is not only compatible with spirituality it is a profound source of spirituality when we recognize our place in an immensity of lightyears and in the passage of ages when we grasp the intricacy beauty and subtlety of life then that soaring feeling that sense of elation and humility combined is surely spiritual an environmental appeal preserving and cherishing the earth signed by sagan with other noted scientists in january  stated that the historical record makes clear that religious teaching example and leadership are powerfully able to influence personal conduct and commitment thus there is a vital role for religion and science in reply to a question in  about his religious beliefs sagan answered im agnostic sagan maintained that the idea of a creator god of the universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe sagans views on religion have been interpreted as a form of pantheism comparable to einsteins belief in spinozas god his son dorion sagan said my father believed in the god of spinoza and einstein god not behind nature but as nature equivalent to it his last wife ann druyan stated when my husband died because he was so famous and known for not being a believer many people would come up to me—it still sometimes happens—and ask me if carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife they also frequently ask me if i think i will see him again carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions the tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again i dont ever expect to be reunited with carl in  ann druyan edited sagans  glasgow gifford lectures in natural theology into a book the varieties of scientific experience a personal view of the search for god in which he elaborates on his views of divinity in the natural world carl sagan center speaks with cdc employees in  sagan is also widely regarded as a freethinker or skeptic one of his most famous quotations in cosmos was extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence called the sagan standard by some this was based on a nearly identical statement by fellow founder of the committee for the scientific investigation of claims of the paranormal marcello truzzi an extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof this idea had been earlier aphorized in théodore flournoys work from india to the planet mars  from a longer quote by pierresimon laplace – a french mathematician and astronomer as the principle of laplace the weight of the evidence should be proportioned to the strangeness of the facts late in his life sagans books elaborated on his skeptical naturalistic view of the world in the demonhaunted world he presented tools for testing arguments and detecting fallacious or fraudulent ones essentially advocating wide use of critical thinking and the scientific method the compilation billions and billions thoughts on life and death at the brink of the millennium published in  after sagans death contains essays written by sagan such as his views on abortion and his widow ann druyans account of his death as a skeptic agnostic and freethinker sagan warned against humans tendency towards anthropocentrism he was the faculty adviser for the cornell students for the ethical treatment of animals in the cosmos chapter blues for a red planet sagan wrote if there is life on mars i believe we should do nothing with mars mars then belongs to the martians even if the martians are only microbes sagan was a user and advocate of marijuana under the pseudonym mr x he contributed an essay about smoking cannabis to the  book marihuana reconsidered the essay explained that marijuana use had helped to inspire some of sagans works and enhance sensual and intellectual experiences after sagans death his friend lester grinspoon disclosed this information to sagans biographer keay davidson the publishing of the biography carl sagan a life in  brought media attention to this aspect of sagans life not long after his death widow ann druyan had gone on to preside over the board of directors of the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws norml a nonprofit organization dedicated to reforming cannabis laws in  engineers at apple computer codenamed the power macintosh  carl sagan in the hope that apple would make billions and billions with the sale of the powermac  the name was only used internally but sagan was concerned that it would become a product endorsement and sent apple a ceaseanddesist letter apple complied but engineers retaliated by changing the internal codename to bha for “butthead astronomer” sagan then sued apple for libel in federal court the court granted apples motion to dismiss sagans claims and opined in dicta that a reader aware of the context would understand apple was clearly attempting to retaliate in a humorous and satirical way and that it strains reason to conclude that defendant was attempting to criticize plaintiffs reputation or competency as an astronomer one does not seriously attack the expertise of a scientist using the undefined phrase butthead sagan then sued for apples original use of his name and likeness but again lost sagan appealed the ruling in november  an outofcourt settlement was reached and apples office of trademarks and patents released a conciliatory statement that apple has always had great respect for dr sagan it was never apples intention to cause dr sagan or his family any embarrassment or concern apples third and final code name for the project was law short for lawyers are wimps sagan briefly served as an adviser on stanley kubricks film  a space odyssey sagan proposed that the film suggest rather than depict extraterrestrial superintelligence sagan and ufosedit in  the year that inaugurated the flying saucer craze the young sagan suspected the discs might be alien spaceships sagans interest in ufo reports prompted him on august   to write a letter to us secretary of state dean acheson to ask how the united states would respond if flying saucers turned out to be extraterrestrial– he later had several conversations on the subject in  with jacques vallée though quite skeptical of any extraordinary answer to the ufo question sagan thought scientists should study the phenomenon at least because there was widespread public interest in ufo reports stuart appelle notes that sagan wrote frequently on what he perceived as the logical and empirical fallacies regarding ufos and the abduction experience sagan rejected an extraterrestrial explanation for the phenomenon but felt there were both empirical and pedagogical benefits for examining ufo reports and that the subject was therefore a legitimate topic of study in  sagan was a member of the ad hoc committee to review project blue book the us air forces ufo investigation project the committee concluded blue book had been lacking as a scientific study and recommended a universitybased project to give the ufo phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny the result was the condon committee – led by physicist edward condon and in their final report they formally concluded that ufos regardless of what any of them actually were did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security sociologist ron westrum writes that the high point of sagans treatment of the ufo question was the aaas symposium in  a wide range of educated opinions on the subject were offered by participants including not only proponents such as james mcdonald and j allen hynek but also skeptics like astronomers william hartmann and donald menzel the roster of speakers was balanced and it is to sagans credit that this event was presented in spite of pressure from edward condon with physicist thornton page sagan edited the lectures and discussions given at the symposium these were published in  as ufos a scientific debate some of sagans many books examine ufos as did one episode of cosmos and he claimed a religious undercurrent to the phenomenon sagan again revealed his views on interstellar travel in his  cosmos series in one of his last written works sagan argued that the chances of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting earth are vanishingly small however sagan did think it plausible that cold war concerns contributed to governments misleading their citizens about ufos and wrote that some ufo reports and analyses and perhaps voluminous files have been made inaccessible to the public which pays the bills  its time for the files to be declassified and made generally available he cautioned against jumping to conclusions about suppressed ufo data and stressed that there was no strong evidence that aliens were visiting the earth either in the past or present sagans paradox sagans contribution to the  symposium was an attack on the belief that ufos are piloted by extraterrestrial beings applying several logical assumptions see drake equation sagan calculated the possible number of advanced civilizations capable of interstellar travel to be about one million he projected that any civilization wishing to check on all the others on a regular basis of say once a year would have to launch  spacecraft annually not only does that seem like an unreasonable number of launchings but it would take all the material in one percent of the universes stars to produce all the spaceships needed for all the civilizations to seek each other out to argue that the earth was being chosen for regular visitations sagan said one would have to assume that the planet is somehow unique and that assumption goes exactly against the idea that there are lots of civilizations around because if there are then our sort of civilization must be pretty common and if were not pretty common then there arent going to be many civilizations advanced enough to send visitors this argument which some called sagans paradox helped to establish a new school of thought the belief that extraterrestrial life exists but has nothing to do with ufos the new belief had a salutary effect on ufo studies it helped separate researchers who wanted to identify unidentified flying objects from those who wanted to identify their pilots and it gave scientists opportunities to search the universe for intelligent life unencumbered by the stigma associated with ufos deathedit stone dedicated to carl sagan in the celebrity path of the brooklyn botanic garden after suffering from myelodysplasia for two years and receiving three bone marrow

observed to have used the phrase billions and billions many times in his red books however sagans frequent use of the word billions and distinctive delivery emphasizing the b which he did intentionally in place of more cumbersome alternatives such as billions with a b in order to distinguish the word from millions made him a favorite target of comic performers including johnny carson gary kroeger mike myers bronson pinchot penn jillette harry shearer and others frank zappa satirized the line in the song be in my video noting as well atomic light sagan took this all in good humor and his final book was entitled billions and billions which opened with a tongueincheek discussion of this catchphrase observing that carson was an amateur astronomer and that carsons comic caricature

popularizer and science communicator in astronomy and other natural sciences he is best known for his work as a science popularizer and communicator his best known scientific contribution is research on extraterrestrial life including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation sagan assembled the first physical messages sent into space the pioneer plaque and the voyager golden record universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them sagan argued the now accepted hypothesis that the high surface temperatures of venus can be attributed to and calculated using the greenhouse effect sagan published more than  scientific papers and articles and was author coauthor or editor of more than  books he wrote many popular science books such as the dragons of eden brocas brain and pale blue dot and narrated and cowrote the awardwinning  television series cosmos a personal voyage the most widely watched series in the history of american public television cosmos has been seen by at least  million people across  different countries the book cosmos was published to accompany the series he also wrote the science fiction novel contact the basis for a  film of the same name his papers containing  items are archived at the library of congress sagan advocated scientific skeptical inquiry and the scientific method pioneered exobiology and promoted the search for extraterrestrial intelligence seti he spent most of his career as a professor of astronomy at cornell university

rachel molly gruber was a housewife from new york carl was named in honor of rachels biological mother chaiya clara in sagans words the mother she never knew he had a sister carol and the family lived in a modest apartment near the atlantic ocean in bensonhurst a brooklyn neighborhood according to sagan they were reform jews the most liberal of north american judaisms four main groups both sagan and his sister agreed that their father was not especially religious but that their mother definitely believed in god and was active in the temple  and served only kosher meat during the depths of the depression his father worked as a theater usher according to biographer keay davidson sagans inner war was a result of his close relationship with both of his parents who were in many ways opposites sagan traced his later analytical urges to his mother a woman who had been extremely poor as a child in new york city during world war i and the s as a young woman she had held her own intellectual ambitions but they were frustrated by social restrictions her poverty her status as a woman and a wife and her jewish ethnicity davidson notes that she therefore worshipped her only son carl he would fulfill her unfulfilled dreams however he claimed that his sense of wonder came from his father in his free time he gave apples to the poor or helped soothe labormanagement tensions within new yorks garment industry although he was awed by carls intellectual abilities he took his sons inquisitiveness in stride and saw it as part of his growing up in his later years as a writer and scientist sagan would often draw on his childhood memories to illustrate scientific points as he did in his book shadows of forgotten ancestors sagan describes his parents influence on his later thinking my parents were not scientists they knew almost nothing about science but in introducing me simultaneously to skepticism and to wonder they taught me the two uneasily cohabiting modes of thought that are central to the scientific method  worlds fairedit sagan recalls that one of his most defining moments was when his parents took him to the  new york worlds fair when he was four years old the exhibits became a turning point in his life he later recalled the moving map of the america of tomorrow exhibit it showed beautiful highways and cloverleaves and little general motors cars all carrying people to skyscrapers buildings with lovely spires flying buttresses—and it looked great at other exhibits he remembered how a flashlight that shone on a photoelectric cell created a crackling sound and how the sound from a tuning fork became a wave on an oscilloscope he also witnessed the future media technology that would replace radio television sagan wrote plainly the world held wonders of a kind i had never guessed how could a tone become a picture and light become a noise he also saw one of the fairs most publicized events the burial of a time capsule at flushing meadows which contained mementos of the s to be recovered by earths descendants in a future millennium the time capsule thrilled carl writes davidson as an adult sagan and his colleagues would create similar time capsules—capsules that would be sent out into the galaxy these were the pioneer plaque and the voyager golden record précis all of which were spinoffs of sagans memories of the worlds fair world war iiedit during world war ii sagans family worried about the fate of their european relatives sagan however was generally unaware of the details of the ongoing war he wrote sure we had relatives who were caught up in the holocaust hitler was not a popular fellow in our household but on the other hand i was fairly insulated from the horrors of the war his sister carol said that their mother above all wanted to protect carl she had an extraordinarily difficult time dealing with world war ii and the holocaust sagans book the demonhaunted world  included his memories of this conflicted period when his family dealt with the realities of the war in europe but tried to prevent it from undermining his optimistic spirit inquisitiveness about natureedit soon after entering elementary school he began to express a strong inquisitiveness about nature sagan recalled taking his first trips to the public library alone at the age of five when his mother got him a library card he wanted to learn what stars were since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer i went to the librarian and asked for a book about stars  and the answer was stunning it was that the sun was a star but really close the stars were suns but so far away they were just little points of light  the scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me it was a kind of religious experience there was a magnificence to it a grandeur a scale which has never left me never ever left me at about age six or seven he and a close friend took trips to the american museum of natural history across the east river in manhattan while there they went to the hayden planetarium and walked around the museums exhibits of space objects such as meteorites and displays of dinosaurs and animals in natural settings sagan writes about those visits i was transfixed by the dioramas—lifelike representations of animals and their habitats all over the world penguins on the dimly lit antarctic ice a family of gorillas the male beating his chest an american grizzly bear standing on his hind legs ten or twelve feet tall and staring me right in the eye his parents helped nurture his growing interest in science by buying him chemistry sets and reading materials his interest in space however was his primary focus especially after reading science fiction stories by writers such as h g wells and edgar rice burroughs which stirred his imagination about life on other planets such as mars according to biographer ray spangenburg these early years as sagan tried to understand the mysteries of the planets became a driving force in his life a continual spark to his intellect and a quest that would never be forgotten in  he discovered astounding science fiction magazine which introduced him to more hard science fiction speculations than those in burroughss novels that same year inaugurated the flying saucer mass hysteria with the young carl suspecting the discs might be alien spaceships high school yearsedit sagan had lived in bensonhurst where he went to david a boody junior high school he had his bar mitzvah in bensonhurst when he turned  the following year  his family moved to the nearby town of rahway new jersey for his fathers work where sagan then entered rahway high school he graduated in  rahway was an older industrial town and the sagans were among its few jewish families photo of sagan from high school yearbook  sagan was a straighta student but was bored due to unchallenging classes and uninspiring teachers his teachers realized this and tried to convince his parents to send him to a private school the administrator telling them this kid ought to go to a school for gifted children he has something really remarkable this they couldnt do partly because of the cost sagan was made president of the schools chemistry club and at home he set up his own laboratory he taught himself about molecules by making cardboard cutouts to help him visualize how molecules were formed i found that about as interesting as doing chemical experiments he said sagan remained mostly interested in astronomy as a hobby and in his junior year made it a career goal after he learned that astronomers were paid for doing what he always enjoyed that was a splendid day­­­­—when i began to suspect that if i tried hard i could do astronomy fulltime not just parttime before the end of high school he entered an essay contest in which he posed the question of whether human contact with advanced life forms from another planet might be as disastrous for people on earth as it was for native americans when they first had contact with europeans the subject was considered controversial but his rhetorical skill won over the judges and they awarded him first prize by graduation his classmates had voted him most likely to succeed and put him in line to be valedictorian educationedit sagan attended the university of chicago which was one of the few colleges he applied to that would consider admitting a sixteenyearold despite his excellent high school grades its chancellor robert hutchins structured the school as an ideal meritocracy with no age requirement the school also employed a number of the nations leading scientists including enrico fermi and edward teller along with operating the famous yerkes observatory during his time as an honors program undergraduate sagan worked in the laboratory of the geneticist h j muller and wrote a thesis on the origins of life with physical chemist harold urey sagan joined the ryerson astronomical society received a ba degree in selfproclaimed nothing with general and special honors in  and a bs degree in physics in  he went on to earn a ms degree in physics in  before earning a phd degree in  with the dissertation physical studies of planets submitted to the department of astronomy and astrophysics he used the summer months of his graduate studies to work with his dissertation director planetary scientist gerard kuiper as well as physicist george gamow and chemist melvin calvin the title of sagans dissertation reflects his shared interests with kuiper who throughout the s had been president of the international astronomical unions commission on physical studies of planets and satellites in  the two worked on the classified military project a the secret air force plan to detonate a nuclear warhead on the moon sagan had a top secret clearance at the us air force and a secret clearance with nasa while working on his doctoral dissertation sagan revealed us government classified titles of two project a papers when he applied for a university of california at berkeley scholarship in  the leak was not publicly revealed until  when it was published in the journal nature a followup letter to the journal by project leader leonard reiffel confirmed sagans security leak scientific careeredit from  to  sagan was a miller fellow at the university of california berkeley meanwhile he published an article in  in the journal science on the atmosphere of venus while also working with nasas mariner  team and served as a planetary sciences consultant to the rand corporation play media sagan is one of those discussing the likelihood of life on other planets in whos out there  an awardwinning nasa documentary film by robert drew after the publication of sagans science article in  harvard university astronomers fred whipple and donald menzel offered sagan the opportunity to give a colloquium at harvard and they subsequently offered him a lecturer position at the institution sagan instead asked to be made an assistant professor and eventually whipple and menzel were able to convince harvard to offer sagan the assistant professor position he requested sagan lectured performed research and advised graduate students at the institution from  until  as well as working at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory both located in cambridge massachusetts in  sagan was denied tenure at harvard he later indicated the decision was very much unexpected the tenure denial has been blamed on several factors including that he focused his interests too broadly across a number of areas while the norm in academia is to become a renowned expert in a narrow specialty and perhaps because of his wellpublicized scientific advocacy which some scientists perceived as borrowing the ideas of others for little more than selfpromotion an advisor from his years as an undergraduate student harold urey wrote a letter to the tenure committee recommending strongly against tenure for sagan science is more than a body of knowledge it is a way of thinking i have a foreboding of an america in my childrens or grandchildrens time — when the united states is a service and information economy when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority when clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes our critical faculties in decline unable to distinguish between what feels good and whats true we slide almost without noticing back into superstition and darkness carl sagan from demonhaunted world  long before the illfated tenure process cornell university astronomer thomas gold had courted sagan to move to ithaca new york and join the faculty at cornell following the denial of tenure from harvard sagan accepted golds offer and remained a faculty member at cornell for nearly  years until his death in  unlike harvard the smaller and more laidback astronomy department at cornell welcomed sagans growing celebrity status following two years as an associate professor sagan became a full professor at cornell in  and directed the laboratory for planetary studies there from  to  he was associate director of the center for radiophysics and space research crsr at cornell in  he became the david duncan professor of astronomy and space sciences a position he held for the remainder of his life sagan was associated with the us space program from its inception from the s onward he worked as an advisor to nasa where one of his duties included briefing the apollo astronauts before their flights to the moon sagan contributed to many of the robotic spacecraft missions that explored the solar system arranging experiments on many of the expeditions sagan assembled the first physical message that was sent into space a goldanodized plaque attached to the space probe pioneer  launched in  pioneer  also carrying another copy of the plaque was launched the following year he continued to refine his designs the most elaborate message he helped to develop and assemble was the voyager golden record that was sent out with the voyager space probes in  sagan often challenged the decisions to fund the space shuttle and the international space station at the expense of further robotic missions scientific achievementsedit former student david morrison describes sagan as an idea person and a master of intuitive physical arguments and back of the envelope calculations and gerard kuiper said that some persons work best in specializing on a major program in the laboratory others are best in liaison between sciences dr sagan belongs in the latter group sagans contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of the planet venus in the early s no one knew for certain the basic conditions of that planets surface and sagan listed the possibilities in a report later depicted for popularization in a time–life book planets his own view was that venus was dry and very hot as opposed to the balmy paradise others had imagined he had investigated radio emissions from venus and concluded that there was a surface temperature of  °c  °f as a visiting scientist to nasas jet propulsion laboratory he contributed to the first mariner missions to venus working on the design and management of the project mariner  confirmed his conclusions on the surface conditions of venus in  sagan was amongclarification needed the first to hypothesize that saturns moon titan might possess oceans of liquid compounds on its surface and that jupiters moon europa might possess subsurface oceans of water this would make europa potentially habitable europas subsurface ocean of water was later indirectly confirmed by the spacecraft galileo the mystery of titans reddish haze was also solved with sagans help the reddish haze was revealed to be due to complex organic molecules constantly raining down onto titans surface he further contributed insights regarding the atmospheres of venus and jupiter as well as seasonal changes on mars he also perceived global warming as a growing manmade danger and likened it to the natural development of venus into a hot lifehostile planet through a kind of runaway greenhouse effect sagan and his cornell colleague edwin ernest salpeter speculated about life in jupiters clouds given the planets dense atmospheric composition rich in organic molecules he studied the observed color variations on mars surface and concluded that they were not seasonal or vegetational changes as most believedclarification needed but shifts in surface dust caused by windstorms sagan is best known however for his research on the possibilities of extraterrestrial life including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation he is also the  recipient of the public welfare medal the highest award of the national academy of sciences for distinguished contributions in the application of science to the public welfare he was denied membership in the academy reportedly because his media activities made him unpopular with many other scientists cosmos popularizing science on tvedit sagan in cosmos  in  sagan cowrote and narrated the awardwinning part pbs television series cosmos a personal voyage which became the most widely watched series in the history of american public television the show has been seen by at least  million people across  different countries the book cosmos written by sagan was published to accompany the series because of his earlier popularity as a science writer from his bestselling books including the dragons of eden which won him a pulitzer prize in  he was asked to write and narrate the show it was targeted to a general audience of viewers who sagan felt had lost interest in science partly due to a stifled educational system each of the  episodes was created to focus on a particular subject or person thereby demonstrating the synergy of the universe they covered a wide range of scientific subjects including the origin of life and a perspective of humans place on earth the show won an emmy along with a peabody award and transformed sagan from an obscure astronomer into a popculture icon time magazine ran a cover story about sagan soon after the show broadcast referring to him as creator chief writer and hostnarrator of the show in  cosmos was released on a remastered set of dvds billions and billionsedit see also sagans number sagan with a model of the viking lander that would land on mars sagan examined possible landing sites for viking along with mike carr and hal masursky from cosmos he was invited to frequent appearances on the tonight show starring johnny carson sagan became jokingly associated with the catchphrase billions and billions although he never actually used the phrase in the cosmos series he rather used the term billions upon billions carson however would sometimes use the phrase during his parodies of sagana as a humorous tribute to sagan and his association with the catchphrase billions and billions a sagan has been defined as a unit of measurement equivalent to a very large number of anything scientific and critical thinking advocacyedit sagans ability to convey his ideas allowed many people to understand the cosmos better—simultaneously emphasizing the value and worthiness of the human race and the relative insignificance of the earth in comparison to the universe he delivered the  series of royal institution christmas lectures in london sagan was a proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life he urged the scientific community to listen with radio telescopes for signals from potential intelligent extraterrestrial lifeforms sagan was so persuasive that by  he was able to get a petition advocating seti published in the journal science and signed by  scientists including seven nobel prize winners this signaled a tremendous increase in the respectability of a thencontroversial field sagan also helped frank drake write the arecibo message a radio message beamed into space from the arecibo radio telescope on november   aimed at informing potential extraterrestrials about earth sagan was chief technology officer of the professional planetary research journal icarus for twelve years he cofounded the planetary society and a member of the seti institute board of trustees sagan served as chairman of the division for planetary science of the american astronomical society as president of the planetology section of the american geophysical union and as chairman of the astronomy section of the american association for the advancement of science aaas the planetary society members at the organizations founding carl sagan is seated on the right at the height of the cold war sagan became involved in nuclear disarmament efforts by promoting hypotheses on the effects of nuclear war when paul crutzens twilight at noon concept suggested that a substantial nuclear exchange could trigger a nuclear twilight and upset the delicate balance of life on earth by cooling the surface in  he was one of five authors—the s—in the followup ttaps model as the research paper came to be known which contained the first usage of the term nuclear winter which his colleague richard p turco coined in  he coauthored the book the cold and the dark the world after nuclear war and in  he coauthored the book a path where no man thought nuclear winter and the end of the arms race which explains the nuclear winter hypothesis and with that advocates nuclear disarmament sagan received a great deal of skepticism and disdain for the use of media to disseminate a very uncertain hypothesis in personal correspondence with edward teller c  although beginning amicably with teller expressing support for continued research to ascertain the credibility of the winter hypothesis sagan and tellers correspondence would ultimately result in teller writing a propagandist is one who uses incomplete information to produce maximum persuasion i can compliment you on being indeed an excellent propagandist remembering that a propagandist is the better the less he appears to be one biographers of sagan would also comment that from a scientific viewpoint nuclear winter was a low point for sagan although politically speaking it popularized his image amongst the public sagan also wrote books to popularize science such as cosmos which reflected and expanded upon some of the themes of a personal voyage and became the bestselling science book ever published in english the dragons of eden speculations on the evolution of human intelligence which won a pulitzer prize and brocas brain reflections on the romance of science sagan also wrote the bestselling science fiction novel contact in  based on a film treatment he wrote with his wife in  but he did not live to see the books  motion picture adaptation which starred jodie foster and won the  hugo award for best dramatic presentation pale blue dot earth is a bright pixel when photographed from voyager  six billion kilometers out beyond pluto sagan encouraged nasa to generate this image from pale blue dot  on it everyone you ever heard ofthe aggregate of all our joys and sufferings thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines every hunter and forager every hero and coward every creator and destroyer of civilizations every king and peasant every young couple in love every hopeful child every mother and father every inventor and explorer every teacher of morals every corrupt politician every superstar every supreme leader every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam    think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot carl sagan cornell lecture in  he wrote a sequel to cosmos pale blue dot a vision of the human future in space which was selected as a notable book of  by the new york times he appeared on pbs charlie rose program in january  sagan also wrote the introduction for stephen hawkings bestseller a brief history of time sagan was also known for his popularization of science his efforts to increase scientific understanding among the general public and his positions in favor of scientific skepticism and against pseudoscience such as his debunking of the betty and barney hill abduction to mark the tenth anniversary of sagans death david morrison a former student of sagans recalled sagans immense contributions to planetary research the public understanding of science and the skeptical movement in skeptical inquirer following saddam husseins threats to light kuwaits oil wells on fire in response to any physical challenge to iraqi control of the oil assets sagan together with his ttaps colleagues and paul crutzen warned in january  in the baltimore sun and wilmington morning star newspapers that if the fires were left to burn over a period of several months enough smoke from the  or so  kuwaiti oil fires might get so high as to disrupt agriculture in much of south asia  and that this possibility should affect the war plans these claims were also the subject of a televised debate between sagan and physicist fred singer on  january aired on the abc news program nightline sagan admitted he had overestimated the danger posed by the  kuwaiti oil fires in the televised debate sagan argued that the effects of the smoke would be similar to the effects of a nuclear winter with singer arguing to the contrary after the debate the fires burnt for many months before extinguishing efforts were complete the results of the smoke did not produce continentalsized cooling sagan later conceded in the demonhaunted world that the prediction did not turn out to be correct it was pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped °–° c over the persian gulf but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and asia was spared in his later years sagan advocated the creation of an organized search for asteroidsnearearth objects neo that might impact the earth but to forestall or postpone developing the technological methods that would be needed to defend against them he argued that all of the numerous methods proposed to alter the orbit of an asteroid including the employment of nuclear detonations created a deflection dilemma if the ability to deflect an asteroid away from the earth exists then one would also have the ability to divert a nonthreatening object towards earth creating an immensely destructive weapon in a  paper he coauthored he ridiculed a day long nearearth object interception workshop held by lanl in  that did not even in passing state that such interception and deflection technologies could have these ancillary dangers sagan however was hopeful that the natural neo impact threat and the intrinsically doubleedged essence of the methods to prevent these threats would serve as a new and potent motivation to maturing international relations later acknowledging that with sufficient international oversight in the future a work our way up approach to fielding nuclear explosive deflection methods could be fielded and when sufficient knowledge was gained to use them to aid in mining asteroids his interest in the use of nuclear detonations in space grew out of his work in  for the armour research foundations project a concerning the possibility of detonating a nuclear device on the lunar surface sagan was a critic of plato having said of the ancient greek philosopher science and mathematics were to be removed from the hands of the merchants and the artisans this tendency found its most effective advocate in a follower of pythagoras named plato and he plato believed that ideas were far more real than the natural world he advised the astronomers not to waste their time observing the stars and planets it was better he believed just to think about them plato expressed hostility to observation and experiment he taught contempt for the real world and disdain for the practical application of scientific knowledge platos followers succeeded in extinguishing the light of science and experiment that had been kindled by democritus and the other ionians popularizing scienceedit speaking about his activities in popularizing science sagan said that there were at least two reasons for scientists to share the purposes of science and its contemporary state simple selfinterest was one much of the funding for science came from the public and the public therefore had the right to know how the money was being spent if scientists increased public admiration for science there was a good chance of having more public supportersclarification needed the other reason was the excitement of communicating ones own excitement about science to others criticismsedit while sagan was widely adored by the general public his reputation in the scientific community was more polarized critics sometimes characterized his work as fanciful nonrigorous and selfaggrandizing and others complained in his later years that he neglected his role as a faculty member to foster his celebrity status one of sagans harshest critics harold urey felt that sagan was getting too much publicity for a scientist and was treating some scientific theories too casually urey and sagan were said to have different philosophies of science according to davidson while urey was an oldtime empiricist who avoided theorizing about the unknown sagan was by contrast willing to speculate openly about such matters fred whipple wanted harvard to keep sagan there but learned that because urey was a nobel laureate his opinion was an important factor in harvard denying sagan tenure sagans harvard friend lester grinspoon also stated i know harvard well enough to know there are people there who certainly do not like people who are outspoken grinspoon added wherever you turned there was one astronomer being quoted on everything one astronomer whose face you were seeing on tv and one astronomer whose books had the preferred display slot at the local bookstore some like urey later came to realize sagans popular brand of scientific advocacy was beneficial to the science as a whole urey especially liked sagans  book the dragons of eden and wrote sagan with his opinion i like it very much and am amazed that someone like you has such an intimate knowledge of the various features of the problemi congratulate youyou are a man of many talents sagan was accused of borrowing some ideas of others for his own benefit while sagan countered these claims by explaining that the misappropriation was an unfortunate side effect of his role as a science communicator and explainer and that he attempted to give proper credit whenever possible social concernsedit sagan believed that the drake equation on substitution of reasonable estimates suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form but that the lack of evidence of such civilizations highlighted by the fermi paradox suggests technological civilizations tend to selfdestruct this stimulated his interest in identifying and publicizing ways that humanity could destroy itself with the hope of avoiding such a cataclysm and eventually becoming a spacefaring species sagans deep concern regarding the potential destruction of human civilization in a nuclear holocaust was conveyed in a memorable cinematic sequence in the final episode of cosmos called who speaks for earth sagan had already resigneddate missing from the air force scientific advisory boards ufo investigating condon committee and voluntarily surrendered his top secret clearance in protest over the vietnam war following his marriage to his third wife novelist ann druyan in june  sagan became more politically active—particularly in opposing escalation of the nuclear arms race under president ronald reagan the united states and soviet unionrussia nuclear stockpiles in total number of nuclear bombswarheads in existence throughout the cold war and postcold war era in march  reagan announced the strategic defense initiative—a multibilliondollar project to develop a comprehensive defense against attack by nuclear missiles which was quickly dubbed the star wars program sagan spoke out against the project arguing that it was technically impossible to develop a system with the level of perfection required and far more expensive to build such a system than it would be for an enemy to defeat it through decoys and other means—and that its construction would seriously destabilize the nuclear balance between the united states and the soviet union making further progress toward nuclear disarmament impossible when soviet leader mikhail gorbachev declared a unilateral moratorium on the testing of nuclear weapons which would begin on august  —the th anniversary of the atomic bombing of hiroshima—the reagan administration dismissed the dramatic move as nothing more than propaganda and refused to follow suit in response us antinuclear and peace activists staged a series of protest actions at the nevada test site beginning on easter sunday in  and continuing through  hundreds of people in the nevada desert experience group were arrested including sagan who was arrested on two separate occasions as he climbed over a chainlink fence at the test site during the underground operation charioteer and united statess musketeer nuclear test series of detonations sagan was also a vocal advocate of the controversial notion of testosterone poisoning arguing in  that human males could become gripped by an unusually severe case of testosterone poisoning and this could compel them to become genocidal in his review of moondance magazine writer daniela gioseffis  book women on war he argues that females are the only half of humanity untainted by testosterone poisoning one chapter of his  book shadows of forgotten ancestors is dedicated to testosterone and its alleged poisonous effects personal life and beliefsedit i have just finished the cosmic connection and loved every word of it you are my idea of a good writer because you have an unmannered style and when i read what you write i hear you talking one thing about the book made me nervous it was entirely too obvious that you are smarter than i am i hate that isaac asimov in letter to sagan  sagan was married three times in  he married biologist lynn margulis the couple had two children jeremy and dorion sagan after carl sagan and margulis divorced he married artist linda salzman in  and they also had a child together nick sagan during these marriages carl sagan focused heavily on his career a factor which may have contributed to sagans first divorce in  sagan married author ann druyan and they later had two children alexandra and samuel sagan carl sagan and druyan remained married until his death in  he lived in an egyptian revival house in ithaca perched on the edge of a cliff that had formerly been the headquarters of a cornell secret society isaac asimov described sagan as one of only two people he ever met whose intellect surpassed his own the other he claimed was the computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert marvin minsky sagan wrote frequently about religion and the relationship between religion and science expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of god as a sapient being for example some people think god is an outsized lightskinned male with a long white beard sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky busily tallying the fall of every sparrow others—for example baruch spinoza and albert einstein—considered god to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe i do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws in another description of his view on the concept of god sagan emphatically wrote the idea that god is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous but if by god one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe then clearly there is such a god this god is emotionally unsatisfying  it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity on atheism sagan commented in  an atheist is someone who is certain that god does not exist someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of god i know of no such compelling evidence because god can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes we would have to know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such god exists to be certain of the existence of god and to be certain of the nonexistence of god seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed sagan also commented on christianity and the jefferson bible stating my longtime view about christianity is that it represents an amalgam of two seemingly immiscible parts the religion of jesus and the religion of paul thomas jefferson attempted to excise the pauline parts of the new testament there wasnt much left when he was done but it was an inspiring document regarding spirituality and its relationship with science sagan stated spirit comes from the latin word to breathe what we breathe is air which is certainly matter however thin despite usage to the contrary there is no necessary implication in the word spiritual that we are talking of anything other than matter including the matter of which the brain is made or anything outside the realm of science on occasion i will feel free to use the word science is not only compatible with spirituality it is a profound source of spirituality when we recognize our place in an immensity of lightyears and in the passage of ages when we grasp the intricacy beauty and subtlety of life then that soaring feeling that sense of elation and humility combined is surely spiritual an environmental appeal preserving and cherishing the earth signed by sagan with other noted scientists in january  stated that the historical record makes clear that religious teaching example and leadership are powerfully able to influence personal conduct and commitment thus there is a vital role for religion and science in reply to a question in  about his religious beliefs sagan answered im agnostic sagan maintained that the idea of a creator god of the universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe sagans views on religion have been interpreted as a form of pantheism comparable to einsteins belief in spinozas god his son dorion sagan said my father believed in the god of spinoza and einstein god not behind nature but as nature equivalent to it his last wife ann druyan stated when my husband died because he was so famous and known for not being a believer many people would come up to me—it still sometimes happens—and ask me if carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife they also frequently ask me if i think i will see him again carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions the tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again i dont ever expect to be reunited with carl in  ann druyan edited sagans  glasgow gifford lectures in natural theology into a book the varieties of scientific experience a personal view of the search for god in which he elaborates on his views of divinity in the natural world carl sagan center speaks with cdc employees in  sagan is also widely regarded as a freethinker or skeptic one of his most famous quotations in cosmos was extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence called the sagan standard by some this was based on a nearly identical statement by fellow founder of the committee for the scientific investigation of claims of the paranormal marcello truzzi an extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof this idea had been earlier aphorized in théodore flournoys work from india to the planet mars  from a longer quote by pierresimon laplace – a french mathematician and astronomer as the principle of laplace the weight of the evidence should be proportioned to the strangeness of the facts late in his life sagans books elaborated on his skeptical naturalistic view of the world in the demonhaunted world he presented tools for testing arguments and detecting fallacious or fraudulent ones essentially advocating wide use of critical thinking and the scientific method the compilation billions and billions thoughts on life and death at the brink of the millennium published in  after sagans death contains essays written by sagan such as his views on abortion and his widow ann druyans account of his death as a skeptic agnostic and freethinker sagan warned against humans tendency towards anthropocentrism he was the faculty adviser for the cornell students for the ethical treatment of animals in the cosmos chapter blues for a red planet sagan wrote if there is life on mars i believe we should do nothing with mars mars then belongs to the martians even if the martians are only microbes sagan was a user and advocate of marijuana under the pseudonym mr x he contributed an essay about smoking cannabis to the  book marihuana reconsidered the essay explained that marijuana use had helped to inspire some of sagans works and enhance sensual and intellectual experiences after sagans death his friend lester grinspoon disclosed this information to sagans biographer keay davidson the publishing of the biography carl sagan a life in  brought media attention to this aspect of sagans life not long after his death widow ann druyan had gone on to preside over the board of directors of the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws norml a nonprofit organization dedicated to reforming cannabis laws in  engineers at apple computer codenamed the power macintosh  carl sagan in the hope that apple would make billions and billions with the sale of the powermac  the name was only used internally but sagan was concerned that it would become a product endorsement and sent apple a ceaseanddesist letter apple complied but engineers retaliated by changing the internal codename to bha for “butthead astronomer” sagan then sued apple for libel in federal court the court granted apples motion to dismiss sagans claims and opined in dicta that a reader aware of the context would understand apple was clearly attempting to retaliate in a humorous and satirical way and that it strains reason to conclude that defendant was attempting to criticize plaintiffs reputation or competency as an astronomer one does not seriously attack the expertise of a scientist using the undefined phrase butthead sagan then sued for apples original use of his name and likeness but again lost sagan appealed the ruling in november  an outofcourt settlement was reached and apples office of trademarks and patents released a conciliatory statement that apple has always had great respect for dr sagan it was never apples intention to cause dr sagan or his family any embarrassment or concern apples third and final code name for the project was law short for lawyers are wimps sagan briefly served as an adviser on stanley kubricks film  a space odyssey sagan proposed that the film suggest rather than depict extraterrestrial superintelligence sagan and ufosedit in  the year that inaugurated the flying saucer craze the young sagan suspected the discs might be alien spaceships sagans interest in ufo reports prompted him on august   to write a letter to us secretary of state dean acheson to ask how the united states would respond if flying saucers turned out to be extraterrestrial– he later had several conversations on the subject in  with jacques vallée though quite skeptical of any extraordinary answer to the ufo question sagan thought scientists should study the phenomenon at least because there was widespread public interest in ufo reports stuart appelle notes that sagan wrote frequently on what he perceived as the logical and empirical fallacies regarding ufos and the abduction experience sagan rejected an extraterrestrial explanation for the phenomenon but felt there were both empirical and pedagogical benefits for examining ufo reports and that the subject was therefore a legitimate topic of study in  sagan was a member of the ad hoc committee to review project blue book the us air forces ufo investigation project the committee concluded blue book had been lacking as a scientific study and recommended a universitybased project to give the ufo phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny the result was the condon committee – led by physicist edward condon and in their final report they formally concluded that ufos regardless of what any of them actually were did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security sociologist ron westrum writes that the high point of sagans treatment of the ufo question was the aaas symposium in  a wide range of educated opinions on the subject were offered by participants including not only proponents such as james mcdonald and j allen hynek but also skeptics like astronomers william hartmann and donald menzel the roster of speakers was balanced and it is to sagans credit that this event was presented in spite of pressure from edward condon with physicist thornton page sagan edited the lectures and discussions given at the symposium these were published in  as ufos a scientific debate some of sagans many books examine ufos as did one episode of cosmos and he claimed a religious undercurrent to the phenomenon sagan again revealed his views on interstellar travel in his  cosmos series in one of his last written works sagan argued that the chances of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting earth are vanishingly small however sagan did think it plausible that cold war concerns contributed to governments misleading their citizens about ufos and wrote that some ufo reports and analyses and perhaps voluminous files have been made inaccessible to the public which pays the bills  its time for the files to be declassified and made generally available he cautioned against jumping to conclusions about suppressed ufo data and stressed that there was no strong evidence that aliens were visiting the earth either in the past or present sagans paradox sagans contribution to the  symposium was an attack on the belief that ufos are piloted by extraterrestrial beings applying several logical assumptions see drake equation sagan calculated the possible number of advanced civilizations capable of interstellar travel to be about one million he projected that any civilization wishing to check on all the others on a regular basis of say once a year would have to launch  spacecraft annually not only does that seem like an unreasonable number of launchings but it would take all the material in one percent of the universes stars to produce all the spaceships needed for all the civilizations to seek each other out to argue that the earth was being chosen for regular visitations sagan said one would have to assume that the planet is somehow unique and that assumption goes exactly against the idea that there are lots of civilizations around because if there are then our sort of civilization must be pretty common and if were not pretty common then there arent going to be many civilizations advanced enough to send visitors this argument which some called sagans paradox helped to establish a new school of thought the belief that extraterrestrial life exists but has nothing to do with ufos the new belief had a salutary effect on ufo studies it helped separate researchers who wanted to identify unidentified flying objects from those who wanted to identify their pilots and it gave scientists opportunities to search the universe for intelligent life unencumbered by the stigma associated with ufos deathedit stone dedicated to carl sagan in the celebrity path of the brooklyn botanic garden after suffering from myelodysplasia for two years and receiving three bone marrow

observed to have used the phrase billions and billions many times in his red books however sagans frequent use of the word billions and distinctive delivery emphasizing the b which he did intentionally in place of more cumbersome alternatives such as billions with a b in order to distinguish the word from millions made him a favorite target of comic performers including johnny carson gary kroeger mike myers bronson pinchot penn jillette harry shearer and others frank zappa satirized the line in the song be in my video noting as well atomic light sagan took this all in good humor and his final book was entitled billions and billions which opened with a tongueincheek discussion of this catchphrase observing that carson was an amateur astronomer and that carsons comic caricature

popularizer and science communicator in astronomy and other natural sciences he is best known for his work as a science popularizer and communicator his best known scientific contribution is research on extraterrestrial life including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation sagan assembled the first physical messages sent into space the pioneer plaque and the voyager golden record universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them sagan argued the now accepted hypothesis that the high surface temperatures of venus can be attributed to and calculated using the greenhouse effect sagan published more than  scientific papers and articles and was author coauthor or editor of more than  books he wrote many popular science books such as the dragons of eden brocas brain and pale blue dot and narrated and cowrote the awardwinning  television series cosmos a personal voyage the most widely watched series in the history of american public television cosmos has been seen by at least  million people across  different countries the book cosmos was published to accompany the series he also wrote the science fiction novel contact the basis for a  film of the same name his papers containing  items are archived at the library of congress sagan advocated scientific skeptical inquiry and the scientific method pioneered exobiology and promoted the search for extraterrestrial intelligence seti he spent most of his career as a professor of astronomy at cornell university where he directed the laboratory for planetary studies sagan and his works received numerous awards and honors including the nasa distinguished public service medal the national academy of sciences

links early lifeedit carl sagan was born in brooklyn new york his father samuel sagan was an immigrant garment worker from kamianetspodilskyi then in the russian empire in todays ukraine his mother rachel molly gruber was a housewife from new york carl was named in honor of rachels biological mother chaiya clara in sagans words the mother she never knew he had a sister carol and the family lived in a modest apartment near the atlantic ocean in bensonhurst a brooklyn neighborhood according to sagan they were reform jews the most liberal of north american judaisms four main groups both sagan and his sister agreed that their father was not especially religious but that their mother definitely believed in god and was active in the temple  and served only kosher meat during the depths of the depression his father worked as a theater usher according to biographer keay davidson sagans inner war was a result of his close relationship with both of his parents who were in many ways opposites sagan traced his later analytical urges to his mother a woman who had been extremely poor as a child in new york city during world war i and the s as a young woman she had held her own intellectual ambitions but they were frustrated by social restrictions her poverty her status as a woman and a wife and her jewish ethnicity davidson notes that she therefore worshipped her only son carl he would fulfill her unfulfilled dreams however he claimed that his sense of wonder came from his father in his free time he gave apples to the poor or helped soothe labormanagement tensions within new yorks garment industry although he was awed by carls intellectual abilities he took his sons inquisitiveness in stride and saw it as part of his growing up in his later years as a writer and scientist sagan would often draw on his childhood memories to illustrate scientific points as he did in his book shadows of forgotten ancestors sagan describes his parents influence on his later thinking my parents were not scientists they knew almost nothing about science but in introducing me simultaneously to skepticism and to wonder they taught me the two uneasily cohabiting modes of thought that are central to the scientific method  worlds fairedit sagan recalls that one of his most defining moments was when his parents took him to the  new york worlds fair when he was four years old the exhibits became a turning point in his life he later recalled the moving map of the america of tomorrow exhibit it showed beautiful highways and cloverleaves and little general motors cars all carrying people to skyscrapers buildings with lovely spires flying buttresses—and it looked great at other exhibits he remembered how a flashlight that shone on a photoelectric cell created a crackling sound and how the sound from a tuning fork became a wave on an oscilloscope he also witnessed the future media technology that would replace radio television sagan wrote plainly the world held wonders of a kind i had never guessed how could a tone become a picture and light become a noise he also saw one of the fairs most publicized events the burial of a time capsule at flushing meadows which contained mementos of the s to be recovered by earths descendants in a future millennium the time capsule thrilled carl writes davidson as an adult sagan and his colleagues would create similar time capsules—capsules that would be sent out into the galaxy these were the pioneer plaque and the voyager golden record précis all of which were spinoffs of sagans memories of the worlds fair world war iiedit during world war ii sagans family worried about the fate of their european relatives sagan however was generally unaware of the details of the ongoing war he wrote sure we had relatives who were caught up in the holocaust hitler was not a popular fellow in our household but on the other hand i was fairly insulated from the horrors of the war his sister carol said that their mother above all wanted to protect carl she had an extraordinarily difficult time dealing with world war ii and the holocaust sagans book the demonhaunted world  included his memories of this conflicted period when his family dealt with the realities of the war in europe but tried to prevent it from undermining his optimistic spirit inquisitiveness about natureedit soon after entering elementary school he began to express a strong inquisitiveness about nature sagan recalled taking his first trips to the public library alone at the age of five when his mother got him a library card he wanted to learn what stars were since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer i went to the librarian and asked for a book about stars  and the answer was stunning it was that the sun was a star but really close the stars were suns but so far away they were just little points of light  the scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me it was a kind of religious experience there was a magnificence to it a grandeur a scale which has never left me never ever left me at about age six or seven he and a close friend took trips to the american museum of natural history across the east river in manhattan while there they went to the hayden planetarium and walked around the museums exhibits of space objects such as meteorites and displays of dinosaurs and animals in natural settings sagan writes about those visits i was transfixed by the dioramas—lifelike representations of animals and their habitats all over the world penguins on the dimly lit antarctic ice a family of gorillas the male beating his chest an american grizzly bear standing on his hind legs ten or twelve feet tall and staring me right in the eye his parents helped nurture his growing interest in science by buying him chemistry sets and reading materials his interest in space however was his primary focus especially after reading science fiction stories by writers such as h g wells and edgar rice burroughs which stirred his imagination about life on other planets such as mars according to biographer ray spangenburg these early years as sagan tried to understand the mysteries of the planets became a driving force in his life a continual spark to his intellect and a quest that would never be forgotten in  he discovered astounding science fiction magazine which introduced him to more hard science fiction speculations than those in burroughss novels that same year inaugurated the flying saucer mass hysteria with the young carl suspecting the discs might be alien spaceships high school yearsedit sagan had lived in bensonhurst where he went to david a boody junior high school he had his bar mitzvah in bensonhurst when he turned  the following year  his family moved to the nearby town of rahway new jersey for his fathers work where sagan then entered rahway high school he graduated in  rahway was an older industrial town and the sagans were among its few jewish families photo of sagan from high school yearbook  sagan was a straighta student but was bored due to unchallenging classes and uninspiring teachers his teachers realized this and tried to convince his parents to send him to a private school the administrator telling them this kid ought to go to a school for gifted children he has something really remarkable this they couldnt do partly because of the cost sagan was made president of the schools chemistry club and at home he set up his own laboratory he taught himself about molecules by making cardboard cutouts to help him visualize how molecules were formed i found that about as interesting as doing chemical experiments he said sagan remained mostly interested in astronomy as a hobby and in his junior year made it a career goal after he learned that astronomers were paid for doing what he always enjoyed that was a splendid day­­­­—when i began to suspect that if i tried hard i could do astronomy fulltime not just parttime before the end of high school he entered an essay contest in which he posed the question of whether human contact with advanced life forms from another planet might be as disastrous for people on earth as it was for native americans when they first had contact with europeans the subject was considered controversial but his rhetorical skill won over the judges and they awarded him first prize by graduation his classmates had voted him most likely to succeed and put him in line to be valedictorian educationedit sagan attended the university of chicago which was one of the few colleges he applied to that would consider admitting a sixteenyearold despite his excellent high school grades its chancellor robert hutchins structured the school as an ideal meritocracy with no age requirement the school also employed a number of the nations leading scientists including enrico fermi and edward teller along with operating the famous yerkes observatory during his time as an honors program undergraduate sagan worked in the laboratory of the geneticist h j muller and wrote a thesis on the origins of life with physical chemist harold urey sagan joined the ryerson astronomical society received a ba degree in selfproclaimed nothing with general and special honors in  and a bs degree in physics in  he went on to earn a ms degree in physics in  before earning a phd degree in  with the dissertation physical studies of planets submitted to the department of astronomy and astrophysics he used the summer months of his graduate studies to work with his dissertation director planetary scientist gerard kuiper as well as physicist george gamow and chemist melvin calvin the title of sagans dissertation reflects his shared interests with kuiper who throughout the s had been president of the international astronomical unions commission on physical studies of planets and satellites in  the two worked on the classified military project a the secret air force plan to detonate a nuclear warhead on the moon sagan had a top secret clearance at the us air force and a secret clearance with nasa while working on his doctoral dissertation sagan revealed us government classified titles of two project a papers when he applied for a university of california at berkeley scholarship in  the leak was not publicly revealed until  when it was published in the journal nature a followup letter to the journal by project leader leonard reiffel confirmed sagans security leak scientific careeredit from  to  sagan was a miller fellow at the university of california berkeley meanwhile he published an article in  in the journal science on the atmosphere of venus while also working with nasas mariner  team and served as a planetary sciences consultant to the rand corporation play media sagan is one of those discussing the likelihood of life on other planets in whos out there  an awardwinning nasa documentary film by robert drew after the publication of sagans science article in  harvard university astronomers fred whipple and donald menzel offered sagan the opportunity to give a colloquium at harvard and they subsequently offered him a lecturer position at the institution sagan instead asked to be made an assistant professor and eventually whipple and menzel were able to convince harvard to offer sagan the assistant professor position he requested sagan lectured performed research and advised graduate students at the institution from  until  as well as working at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory both located in cambridge massachusetts in  sagan was denied tenure at harvard he later indicated the decision was very much unexpected the tenure denial has been blamed on several factors including that he focused his interests too broadly across a number of areas while the norm in academia is to become a renowned expert in a narrow specialty and perhaps because of his wellpublicized scientific advocacy which some scientists perceived as borrowing the ideas of others for little more than selfpromotion an advisor from his years as an undergraduate student harold urey wrote a letter to the tenure committee recommending strongly against tenure for sagan science is more than a body of knowledge it is a way of thinking i have a foreboding of an america in my childrens or grandchildrens time — when the united states is a service and information economy when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority when clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes our critical faculties in decline unable to distinguish between what feels good and whats true we slide almost without noticing back into superstition and darkness carl sagan from demonhaunted world  long before the illfated tenure process cornell university astronomer thomas gold had courted sagan to move to ithaca new york and join the faculty at cornell following the denial of tenure from harvard sagan accepted golds offer and remained a faculty member at cornell for nearly  years until his death in  unlike harvard the smaller and more laidback astronomy department at cornell welcomed sagans growing celebrity status following two years as an associate professor sagan became a full professor at cornell in  and directed the laboratory for planetary studies there from  to  he was associate director of the center for radiophysics and space research crsr at cornell in  he became the david duncan professor of astronomy and space sciences a position he held for the remainder of his life sagan was associated with the us space program from its inception from the s onward he worked as an advisor to nasa where one of his duties included briefing the apollo astronauts before their flights to the moon sagan contributed to many of the robotic spacecraft missions that explored the solar system arranging experiments on many of the expeditions sagan assembled the first physical message that was sent into space a goldanodized plaque attached to the space probe pioneer  launched in  pioneer  also carrying another copy of the plaque was launched the following year he continued to refine his designs the most elaborate message he helped to develop and assemble was the voyager golden record that was sent out with the voyager space probes in  sagan often challenged the decisions to fund the space shuttle and the international space station at the expense of further robotic missions scientific achievementsedit former student david morrison describes sagan as an idea person and a master of intuitive physical arguments and back of the envelope calculations and gerard kuiper said that some persons work best in specializing on a major program in the laboratory others are best in liaison between sciences dr sagan belongs in the latter group sagans contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of the planet venus in the early s no one knew for certain the basic conditions of that planets surface and sagan listed the possibilities in a report later depicted for popularization in a time–life book planets his own view was that venus was dry and very hot as opposed to the balmy paradise others had imagined he had investigated radio emissions from venus and concluded that there was a surface temperature of  °c  °f as a visiting scientist to nasas jet propulsion laboratory he contributed to the first mariner missions to venus working on the design and management of the project mariner  confirmed his conclusions on the surface conditions of venus in  sagan was amongclarification needed the first to hypothesize that saturns moon titan might possess oceans of liquid compounds on its surface and that jupiters moon europa might possess subsurface oceans of water this would make europa potentially habitable europas subsurface ocean of water was later indirectly confirmed by the spacecraft galileo the mystery of titans reddish haze was also solved with sagans help the reddish haze was revealed to be due to complex organic molecules constantly raining down onto titans surface he further contributed insights regarding the atmospheres of venus and jupiter as well as seasonal changes on mars he also perceived global warming as a growing manmade danger and likened it to the natural development of venus into a hot lifehostile planet through a kind of runaway greenhouse effect sagan and his cornell colleague edwin ernest salpeter speculated about life in jupiters clouds given the planets dense atmospheric composition rich in organic molecules he studied the observed color variations on mars surface and concluded that they were not seasonal or vegetational changes as most believedclarification needed but shifts in surface dust caused by windstorms sagan is best known however for his research on the possibilities of extraterrestrial life including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation he is also the  recipient of the public welfare medal the highest award of the national academy of sciences for distinguished contributions in the application of science to the public welfare he was denied membership in the academy reportedly because his media activities made him unpopular with many other scientists cosmos popularizing science on tvedit sagan in cosmos  in  sagan cowrote and narrated the awardwinning part pbs television series cosmos a personal voyage which became the most widely watched series in the history of american public television the show has been seen by at least  million people across  different countries the book cosmos written by sagan was published to accompany the series because of his earlier popularity as a science writer from his bestselling books including the dragons of eden which won him a pulitzer prize in  he was asked to write and narrate the show it was targeted to a general audience of viewers who sagan felt had lost interest in science partly due to a stifled educational system each of the  episodes was created to focus on a particular subject or person thereby demonstrating the synergy of the universe they covered a wide range of scientific subjects including the origin of life and a perspective of humans place on earth the show won an emmy along with a peabody award and transformed sagan from an obscure astronomer into a popculture icon time magazine ran a cover story about sagan soon after the show broadcast referring to him as creator chief writer and hostnarrator of the show in  cosmos was released on a remastered set of dvds billions and billionsedit see also sagans number sagan with a model of the viking lander that would land on mars sagan examined possible landing sites for viking along with mike carr and hal masursky from cosmos he was invited to frequent appearances on the tonight show starring johnny carson sagan became jokingly associated with the catchphrase billions and billions although he never actually used the phrase in the cosmos series he rather used the term billions upon billions carson however would sometimes use the phrase during his parodies of sagana as a humorous tribute to sagan and his association with the catchphrase billions and billions a sagan has been defined as a unit of measurement equivalent to a very large number of anything scientific and critical thinking advocacyedit sagans ability to convey his ideas allowed many people to understand the cosmos better—simultaneously emphasizing the value and worthiness of the human race and the relative insignificance of the earth in comparison to the universe he delivered the  series of royal institution christmas lectures in london sagan was a proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life he urged the scientific community to listen with radio telescopes for signals from potential intelligent extraterrestrial lifeforms sagan was so persuasive that by  he was able to get a petition advocating seti published in the journal science and signed by  scientists including seven nobel prize winners this signaled a tremendous increase in the respectability of a thencontroversial field sagan also helped frank drake write the arecibo message a radio message beamed into space from the arecibo radio telescope on november   aimed at informing potential extraterrestrials about earth sagan was chief technology officer of the professional planetary research journal icarus for twelve years he cofounded the planetary society and a member of the seti institute board of trustees sagan served as chairman of the division for planetary science of the american astronomical society as president of the planetology section of the american geophysical union and as chairman of the astronomy section of the american association for the advancement of science aaas the planetary society members at the organizations founding carl sagan is seated on the right at the height of the cold war sagan became involved in nuclear disarmament efforts by promoting hypotheses on the effects of nuclear war when paul crutzens twilight at noon concept suggested that a substantial nuclear exchange could trigger a nuclear twilight and upset the delicate balance of life on earth by cooling the surface in  he was one of five authors—the s—in the followup ttaps model as the research paper came to be known which contained the first usage of the term nuclear winter which his colleague richard p turco coined in  he coauthored the book the cold and the dark the world after nuclear war and in  he coauthored the book a path where no man thought nuclear winter and the end of the arms race which explains the nuclear winter hypothesis and with that advocates nuclear disarmament sagan received a great deal of skepticism and disdain for the use of media to disseminate a very uncertain hypothesis in personal correspondence with edward teller c  although beginning amicably with teller expressing support for continued research to ascertain the credibility of the winter hypothesis sagan and tellers correspondence would ultimately result in teller writing a propagandist is one who uses incomplete information to produce maximum persuasion i can compliment you on being indeed an excellent propagandist remembering that a propagandist is the better the less he appears to be one biographers of sagan would also comment that from a scientific viewpoint nuclear winter was a low point for sagan although politically speaking it popularized his image amongst the public sagan also wrote books to popularize science such as cosmos which reflected and expanded upon some of the themes of a personal voyage and became the bestselling science book ever published in english the dragons of eden speculations on the evolution of human intelligence which won a pulitzer prize and brocas brain reflections on the romance of science sagan also wrote the bestselling science fiction novel contact in  based on a film treatment he wrote with his wife in  but he did not live to see the books  motion picture adaptation which starred jodie foster and won the  hugo award for best dramatic presentation pale blue dot earth is a bright pixel when photographed from voyager  six billion kilometers out beyond pluto sagan encouraged nasa to generate this image from pale blue dot  on it everyone you ever heard ofthe aggregate of all our joys and sufferings thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines every hunter and forager every hero and coward every creator and destroyer of civilizations every king and peasant every young couple in love every hopeful child every mother and father every inventor and explorer every teacher of morals every corrupt politician every superstar every supreme leader every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam    think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot carl sagan cornell lecture in  he wrote a sequel to cosmos pale blue dot a vision of the human future in space which was selected as a notable book of  by the new york times he appeared on pbs charlie rose program in january  sagan also wrote the introduction for stephen hawkings bestseller a brief history of time sagan was also known for his popularization of science his efforts to increase scientific understanding among the general public and his positions in favor of scientific skepticism and against pseudoscience such as his debunking of the betty and barney hill abduction to mark the tenth anniversary of sagans death david morrison a former student of sagans recalled sagans immense contributions to planetary research the public understanding of science and the skeptical movement in skeptical inquirer following saddam husseins threats to light kuwaits oil wells on fire in response to any physical challenge to iraqi control of the oil assets sagan together with his ttaps colleagues and paul crutzen warned in january  in the baltimore sun and wilmington morning star newspapers that if the fires were left to burn over a period of several months enough smoke from the  or so  kuwaiti oil fires might get so high as to disrupt agriculture in much of south asia  and that this possibility should affect the war plans these claims were also the subject of a televised debate between sagan and physicist fred singer on  january aired on the abc news program nightline sagan admitted he had overestimated the danger posed by the  kuwaiti oil fires in the televised debate sagan argued that the effects of the smoke would be similar to the effects of a nuclear winter with singer arguing to the contrary after the debate the fires burnt for many months before extinguishing efforts were complete the results of the smoke did not produce continentalsized cooling sagan later conceded in the demonhaunted world that the prediction did not turn out to be correct it was pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped °–° c over the persian gulf but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and asia was spared in his later years sagan advocated the creation of an organized search for asteroidsnearearth objects neo that might impact the earth but to forestall or postpone developing the technological methods that would be needed to defend against them he argued that all of the numerous methods proposed to alter the orbit of an asteroid including the employment of nuclear detonations created a deflection dilemma if the ability to deflect an asteroid away from the earth exists then one would also have the ability to divert a nonthreatening object towards earth creating an immensely destructive weapon in a  paper he coauthored he ridiculed a day long nearearth object interception workshop held by lanl in  that did not even in passing state that such interception and deflection technologies could have these ancillary dangers sagan however was hopeful that the natural neo impact threat and the intrinsically doubleedged essence of the methods to prevent these threats would serve as a new and potent motivation to maturing international relations later acknowledging that with sufficient international oversight in the future a work our way up approach to fielding nuclear explosive deflection methods could be fielded and when sufficient knowledge was gained to use them to aid in mining asteroids his interest in the use of nuclear detonations in space grew out of his work in  for the armour research foundations project a concerning the possibility of detonating a nuclear device on the lunar surface sagan was a critic of plato having said of the ancient greek philosopher science and mathematics were to be removed from the hands of the merchants and the artisans this tendency found its most effective advocate in a follower of pythagoras named plato and he plato believed that ideas were far more real than the natural world he advised the astronomers not to waste their time observing the stars and planets it was better he believed just to think about them plato expressed hostility to observation and experiment he taught contempt for the real world and disdain for the practical application of scientific knowledge platos followers succeeded in extinguishing the light of science and experiment that had been kindled by democritus and the other ionians popularizing scienceedit speaking about his activities in popularizing science sagan said that there were at least two reasons for scientists to share the purposes of science and its contemporary state simple selfinterest was one much of the funding for science came from the public and the public therefore had the right to know how the money was being spent if scientists increased public admiration for science there was a good chance of having more public supportersclarification needed the other reason was the excitement of communicating ones own excitement about science to others criticismsedit while sagan was widely adored by the general public his reputation in the scientific community was more polarized critics sometimes characterized his work as fanciful nonrigorous and selfaggrandizing and others complained in his later years that he neglected his role as a faculty member to foster his celebrity status one of sagans harshest critics harold urey felt that sagan was getting too much publicity for a scientist and was treating some scientific theories too casually urey and sagan were said to have different philosophies of science according to davidson while urey was an oldtime empiricist who avoided theorizing about the unknown sagan was by contrast willing to speculate openly about such matters fred whipple wanted harvard to keep sagan there but learned that because urey was a nobel laureate his opinion was an important factor in harvard denying sagan tenure sagans harvard friend lester grinspoon also stated i know harvard well enough to know there are people there who certainly do not like people who are outspoken grinspoon added wherever you turned there was one astronomer being quoted on everything one astronomer whose face you were seeing on tv and one astronomer whose books had the preferred display slot at the local bookstore some like urey later came to realize sagans popular brand of scientific advocacy was beneficial to the science as a whole urey especially liked sagans  book the dragons of eden and wrote sagan with his opinion i like it very much and am amazed that someone like you has such an intimate knowledge of the various features of the problemi congratulate youyou are a man of many talents sagan was accused of borrowing some ideas of others for his own benefit while sagan countered these claims by explaining that the misappropriation was an unfortunate side effect of his role as a science communicator and explainer and that he attempted to give proper credit whenever possible social concernsedit sagan believed that the drake equation on substitution of reasonable estimates suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form but that the lack of evidence of such civilizations highlighted by the fermi paradox suggests technological civilizations tend to selfdestruct this stimulated his interest in identifying and publicizing ways that humanity could destroy itself with the hope of avoiding such a cataclysm and eventually becoming a spacefaring species sagans deep concern regarding the potential destruction of human civilization in a nuclear holocaust was conveyed in a memorable cinematic sequence in the final episode of cosmos called who speaks for earth sagan had already resigneddate missing from the air force scientific advisory boards ufo investigating condon committee and voluntarily surrendered his top secret clearance in protest over the vietnam war following his marriage to his third wife novelist ann druyan in june  sagan became more politically active—particularly in opposing escalation of the nuclear arms race under president ronald reagan the united states and soviet unionrussia nuclear stockpiles in total number of nuclear bombswarheads in existence throughout the cold war and postcold war era in march  reagan announced the strategic defense initiative—a multibilliondollar project to develop a comprehensive defense against attack by nuclear missiles which was quickly dubbed the star wars program sagan spoke out against the project arguing that it was technically impossible to develop a system with the level of perfection required and far more expensive to build such a system than it would be for an enemy to defeat it through decoys and other means—and that its construction would seriously destabilize the nuclear balance between the united states and the soviet union making further progress toward nuclear disarmament impossible when soviet leader mikhail gorbachev declared a unilateral moratorium on the testing of nuclear weapons which would begin on august  —the th anniversary of the atomic bombing of hiroshima—the reagan administration dismissed the dramatic move as nothing more than propaganda and refused to follow suit in response us antinuclear and peace activists staged a series of protest actions at the nevada test site beginning on easter sunday in  and continuing through  hundreds of people in the nevada desert experience group were arrested including sagan who was arrested on two separate occasions as he climbed over a chainlink fence at the test site during the underground operation charioteer and united statess musketeer nuclear test series of detonations sagan was also a vocal advocate of the controversial notion of testosterone poisoning arguing in  that human males could become gripped by an unusually severe case of testosterone poisoning and this could compel them to become genocidal in his review of moondance magazine writer daniela gioseffis  book women on war he argues that females are the only half of humanity untainted by testosterone poisoning one chapter of his  book shadows of forgotten ancestors is dedicated to testosterone and its alleged poisonous effects personal life and beliefsedit i have just finished the cosmic connection and loved every word of it you are my idea of a good writer because you have an unmannered style and when i read what you write i hear you talking one thing about the book made me nervous it was entirely too obvious that you are smarter than i am i hate that isaac asimov in letter to sagan  sagan was married three times in  he married biologist lynn margulis the couple had two children jeremy and dorion sagan after carl sagan and margulis divorced he married artist linda salzman in  and they also had a child together nick sagan during these marriages carl sagan focused heavily on his career a factor which may have contributed to sagans first divorce in  sagan married author ann druyan and they later had two children alexandra and samuel sagan carl sagan and druyan remained married until his death in  he lived in an egyptian revival house in ithaca perched on the edge of a cliff that had formerly been the headquarters of a cornell secret society isaac asimov described sagan as one of only two people he ever met whose intellect surpassed his own the other he claimed was the computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert marvin minsky sagan wrote frequently about religion and the relationship between religion and science expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of god as a sapient being for example some people think god is an outsized lightskinned male with a long white beard sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky busily tallying the fall of every sparrow others—for example baruch spinoza and albert einstein—considered god to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe i do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws in another description of his view on the concept of god sagan emphatically wrote the idea that god is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous but if by god one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe then clearly there is such a god this god is emotionally unsatisfying  it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity on atheism sagan commented in  an atheist is someone who is certain that god does not exist someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of god i know of no such compelling evidence because god can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes we would have to know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such god exists to be certain of the existence of god and to be certain of the nonexistence of god seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed sagan also commented on christianity and the jefferson bible stating my longtime view about christianity is that it represents an amalgam of two seemingly immiscible parts the religion of jesus and the religion of paul thomas jefferson attempted to excise the pauline parts of the new testament there wasnt much left when he was done but it was an inspiring document regarding spirituality and its relationship with science sagan stated spirit comes from the latin word to breathe what we breathe is air which is certainly matter however thin despite usage to the contrary there is no necessary implication in the word spiritual that we are talking of anything other than matter including the matter of which the brain is made or anything outside the realm of science on occasion i will feel free to use the word science is not only compatible with spirituality it is a profound source of spirituality when we recognize our place in an immensity of lightyears and in the passage of ages when we grasp the intricacy beauty and subtlety of life then that soaring feeling that sense of elation and humility combined is surely spiritual an environmental appeal preserving and cherishing the earth signed by sagan with other noted scientists in january  stated that the historical record makes clear that religious teaching example and leadership are powerfully able to influence personal conduct and commitment thus there is a vital role for religion and science in reply to a question in  about his religious beliefs sagan answered im agnostic sagan maintained that the idea of a creator god of the universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe sagans views on religion have been interpreted as a form of pantheism comparable to einsteins belief in spinozas god his son dorion sagan said my father believed in the god of spinoza and einstein god not behind nature but as nature equivalent to it his last wife ann druyan stated when my husband died because he was so famous and known for not being a believer many people would come up to me—it still sometimes happens—and ask me if carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife they also frequently ask me if i think i will see him again carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions the tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again i dont ever expect to be reunited with carl in  ann druyan edited sagans  glasgow gifford lectures in natural theology into a book the varieties of scientific experience a personal view of the search for god in which he elaborates on his views of divinity in the natural world carl sagan center speaks with cdc employees in  sagan is also widely regarded as a freethinker or skeptic one of his most famous quotations in cosmos was extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence called the sagan standard by some this was based on a nearly identical statement by fellow founder of the committee for the scientific investigation of claims of the paranormal marcello truzzi an extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof this idea had been earlier aphorized in théodore flournoys work from india to the planet mars  from a longer quote by pierresimon laplace – a french mathematician and astronomer as the principle of laplace the weight of the evidence should be proportioned to the strangeness of the facts late in his life sagans books elaborated on his skeptical naturalistic view of the world in the demonhaunted world he presented tools for testing arguments and detecting fallacious or fraudulent ones essentially advocating wide use of critical thinking and the scientific method the compilation billions and billions thoughts on life and death at the brink of the millennium published in  after sagans death contains essays written by sagan such as his views on abortion and his widow ann druyans account of his death as a skeptic agnostic and freethinker sagan warned against humans tendency towards anthropocentrism he was the faculty adviser for the cornell students for the ethical treatment of animals in the cosmos chapter blues for a red planet sagan wrote if there is life on mars i believe we should do nothing with mars mars then belongs to the martians even if the martians are only microbes sagan was a user and advocate of marijuana under the pseudonym mr x he contributed an essay about smoking cannabis to the  book marihuana reconsidered the essay explained that marijuana use had helped to inspire some of sagans works and enhance sensual and intellectual experiences after sagans death his friend lester grinspoon disclosed this information to sagans biographer keay davidson the publishing of the biography carl sagan a life in  brought media attention to this aspect of sagans life not long after his death widow ann druyan had gone on to preside over the board of directors of the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws norml a nonprofit organization dedicated to reforming cannabis laws in  engineers at apple computer codenamed the power macintosh  carl sagan in the hope that apple would make billions and billions with the sale of the powermac  the name was only used internally but sagan was concerned that it would become a product endorsement and sent apple a ceaseanddesist letter apple complied but engineers retaliated by changing the internal codename to bha for “butthead astronomer” sagan then sued apple for libel in federal court the court granted apples motion to dismiss sagans claims and opined in dicta that a reader aware of the context would understand apple was clearly attempting to retaliate in a humorous and satirical way and that it strains reason to conclude that defendant was attempting to criticize plaintiffs reputation or competency as an astronomer one does not seriously attack the expertise of a scientist using the undefined phrase butthead sagan then sued for apples original use of his name and likeness but again lost sagan appealed the ruling in november  an outofcourt settlement was reached and apples office of trademarks and patents released a conciliatory statement that apple has always had great respect for dr sagan it was never apples intention to cause dr sagan or his family any embarrassment or concern apples third and final code name for the project was law short for lawyers are wimps sagan briefly served as an adviser on stanley kubricks film  a space odyssey sagan proposed that the film suggest rather than depict extraterrestrial superintelligence sagan and ufosedit in  the year that inaugurated the flying saucer craze the young sagan suspected the discs might be alien spaceships sagans interest in ufo reports prompted him on august   to write a letter to us secretary of state dean acheson to ask how the united states would respond if flying saucers turned out to be extraterrestrial– he later had several conversations on the subject in  with jacques vallée though quite skeptical of any extraordinary answer to the ufo question sagan thought scientists should study the phenomenon at least because there was widespread public interest in ufo reports stuart appelle notes that sagan wrote frequently on what he perceived as the logical and empirical fallacies regarding ufos and the abduction experience sagan rejected an extraterrestrial explanation for the phenomenon but felt there were both empirical and pedagogical benefits for examining ufo reports and that the subject was therefore a legitimate topic of study in  sagan was a member of the ad hoc committee to review project blue book the us air forces ufo investigation project the committee concluded blue book had been lacking as a scientific study and recommended a universitybased project to give the ufo phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny the result was the condon committee – led by physicist edward condon and in their final report they formally concluded that ufos regardless of what any of them actually were did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security sociologist ron westrum writes that the high point of sagans treatment of the ufo question was the aaas symposium in  a wide range of educated opinions on the subject were offered by participants including not only proponents such as james mcdonald and j allen hynek but also skeptics like astronomers william hartmann and donald menzel the roster of speakers was balanced and it is to sagans credit that this event was presented in spite of pressure from edward condon with physicist thornton page sagan edited the lectures and discussions given at the symposium these were published in  as ufos a scientific debate some of sagans many books examine ufos as did one episode of cosmos and he claimed a religious undercurrent to the phenomenon sagan again revealed his views on interstellar travel in his  cosmos series in one of his last written works sagan argued that the chances of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting earth are vanishingly small however sagan did think it plausible that cold war concerns contributed to governments misleading their citizens about ufos and wrote that some ufo reports and analyses and perhaps voluminous files have been made inaccessible to the public which pays the bills  its time for the files to be declassified and made generally available he cautioned against jumping to conclusions about suppressed ufo data and stressed that there was no strong evidence that aliens were visiting the earth either in the past or present sagans paradox sagans contribution to the  symposium was an attack on the belief that ufos are piloted by extraterrestrial beings applying several logical assumptions see drake equation sagan calculated the possible number of advanced civilizations capable of interstellar travel to be about one million he projected that any civilization wishing to check on all the others on a regular basis of say once a year would have to launch  spacecraft annually not only does that seem like an unreasonable number of launchings but it would take all the material in one percent of the universes stars to produce all the spaceships needed for all the civilizations to seek each other out to argue that the earth was being chosen for regular visitations sagan said one would have to assume that the planet is somehow unique and that assumption goes exactly against the idea that there are lots of civilizations around because if there are then our sort of civilization must be pretty common and if were not pretty common then there arent going to be many civilizations advanced enough to send visitors this argument which some called sagans paradox helped to establish a new school of thought the belief that extraterrestrial life exists but has nothing to do with ufos the new belief had a salutary effect on ufo studies it helped separate researchers who wanted to identify unidentified flying objects from those who wanted to identify their pilots and it gave scientists opportunities to search the universe for intelligent life unencumbered by the stigma associated with ufos deathedit stone dedicated to carl sagan in the celebrity path of the brooklyn botanic garden after suffering from myelodysplasia for two years and receiving three bone marrow
