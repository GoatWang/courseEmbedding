was born in milwaukee and grew up in a jewish family his father ben selig had come to the united states from romania with his family when he was four years old selig graduated from the university of wisconsinmadison with a ba in american history and political science in  he served two years in the us army before working with his father who owned a car leasing business in milwaukee selig continues to be involved in the automotive industry serving as president of the selig executive lease company seligs interest in baseball came from his mother an immigrant from ukraine marie selig attended college a rare accomplishment for a woman in the early th century and became a school teacher when selig was only three marie began taking him and his older brother jerry to borchert field where the minor league milwaukee brewers played when the boston braves relocated to milwaukee in  selig switched allegiances and eventually became the teams largest public stockholder selig was devastated when he learned that the braves were going to leave milwaukee in favor of atlanta in  when the braves left milwaukee he divested his stock in the team as a youngster seligs favorite player was hershel martin milwaukee brewers owneredit see also milwaukee brewers as a minority owner of the milwaukee braves selig founded the organization teams inc in an attempt to prevent the majority owners based out of chicago from moving the club to a larger television market this was challenged legally on the basis that no prior team relocations in the modern era left a city without a team prior movements had all originated in cities which were home to at least two teams when his quest to keep the team in milwaukee finally failed after the  season he changed the groups name to milwaukee brewers baseball club inc after the minor league baseball team he grew up watching and devoted himself to returning major league baseball to milwaukee selig arranged for major league games to be played at milwaukee county stadium the first a preseason matchup between the chicago white sox and minnesota twins drew more than  spectators selig followed this up by hosting nine white sox regularseason games in  and eleven in  one of the games played in milwaukee that year was against the expansion seattle pilots the team that would become the brewers those milwaukee home games were phenomenally successful with the handful of games accounting for about onethird of total white sox home attendance to satisfy that fan base selig decided to purchase the white sox with the intention of moving them to milwaukee in  he entered into an agreement to buy the club but the american league vetoed the sale preferring to keep an american league team in chicago which at the time was still americas second largest city selig turned his attention to other franchises statue of selig outside of miller park in  he purchased the bankrupt seattle pilots franchise moving them to his hometown and officially renaming the team the brewers during seligs tenure as club president the brewers participated in postseason play in  when the team finished first in the american league east during the second half of the season and in  when the team made it to the world series under the leadership of future hall of famers robin yount and paul molitor under seligs watch the brewers also won seven organization of the year awards selig was part of the owners collusion in – resulting in the owners paying us million in damages to the players upon his assumption of the commissioners role selig transferred his ownership interest in the brewers to his daughter wendy seligprieb in order to remove any technical conflicts of interest though it was widely presumed he maintained some hand in team operations although the team has been sold to los angeles investor mark attanasio questions remain regarding seligs past involvement seligs defenders point to the poor management of the team after seligprieb took control as proof that selig was not working behind the scenes selig was elected to the wisconsin athletic hall of fame in  on august   a statue of selig commissioned by brewers owner mark attanasio and designed by artist brian maughan was unveiled outside miller park in milwaukee acting commissioner –edit selig became an increasingly vocal opponent of commissioner fay vincent and soon became the leader of a group of owners seeking his removal selig has never stated that the owners colluded while vincent has the union basically doesnt trust the ownership because collusion was a us million theft by selig and jerry reinsdorf of that money from the players i mean they rigged the signing of free agents they got caught they paid  million to the players and i think thats polluted labor relations in baseball ever since it happened i think its the reason mlbpa executive director donald fehr has no trust in selig — fay vincent following an  noconfidence vote vincent resigned selig had by this time become chairman of the executive council of major league baseball and as such became de facto acting commissioner his first major act was to institute the wild card and divisional playoff play which has created much controversy amongst baseball fans those against the wild card see it as diminishing the importance of the pennant race and the regular season with the true race often being for second rather than first place while those in favor of it view it as an opportunity for teams to have a shot at the playoffs even when they have no chance of a firstplace finish in their division thus maintaining fan interest later in the season selig suspended cincinnati reds owner marge schott for a year in  for repeated racially insensitive and prejudicial remarks and actions the same year new york yankees owner george steinbrenner was reinstated from a lifelong suspension that was instituted by seligs predecessor fay vincent pete rose has claimed that he applied for reinstatement over the years and received no such consideration rose along with his close friend and former teammate mike schmidt who is a strong supporter of roses reinstatement into baseball met with selig in  where rose privately admitted to selig two years before going public with his admission about betting on baseball bud selig was a close friend of the late bart giamatti who was the commissioner when rose was first banned from the sport in  as acting commissioner selig represented mlb during the  players strike and cancelled the world series marking the first time the annual event had not been staged since  commissioner –edit after a sixyear search for a new commissioner the owners voted to give selig the title on a permanent basis midway through the  season during his tenure the game avoided a third work stoppage in  and has seen the implementation of interleague play whereas in the past the national and american leagues had separate administrative organizations which for example allowed for the introduction of different rules such as the designated hitter under selig major league baseball consolidated the administrative functions of both leagues into the commissioners office in  the last official presidents of the nl and al were leonard s coleman jr and dr gene budig respectively reaction after september  edit on september   selig ordered all baseball games postponed for a week because of the terror attacks on new york and washington the games were postponed not only out of respect and mourning for the victims but also out of concern for the safety and security of fans and players  contraction attemptedit after the conclusion of the  world series selig held a vote on contracting two teams reportedly the minnesota twins and montreal expos this action led to selig along with former expos owner jeffrey loria being sued for racketeering and conspiring with loria to deliberately defraud the expos minority owners if found liable the league could have been ordered to pay as much as  million in total damages the judge also ruled that the expos could not be moved or contracted until the case was over the case eventually went to arbitration and was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum a week after selig’s announcement hennepin county judge harry seymour crump issued a temporary restraining order that forced the twins to honor their lease and play the  season at the metrodome in august  the effort to contract the twins officially fizzled as players and owners reached a consensus on a new labor agreement which extended the teams metrodome lease changes to the mlb allstar gameedit the  allstar game played in seligs hometown of milwaukee was tied  after  innings and remained tied after the bottom of the th inning due to the recent managerial trend of granting playing time to as many available players as possible within the regulation nine innings both managers had used their entire roster concerned for the arms of the pitchers currently on the mound selig made the controversial decision to declare the game a tie to the dissatisfaction of the milwaukee fans selig later said that this call was embarrassing and that he was tremendously saddened by the outcome of the game since  selig subsequently tried to reinvigorate the allstar game by awarding the winning league homefield advantage in the world series the  allstar game had the same us viewership as   rating  share and the ratings declined in   rating  share and   rating  share the american television audience increased in   rating  share disciplinary actionsedit on july   selig suspended texas rangers pitcher kenny rogers for  games and fined him us rogers got in trouble when on june   he purposely grabbed the camera of a cameraman resulting in one camera falling to the ground when the cameraman proceeded to pick up his camera rogers went back to him in an arguably threatening way one of the reporters then resumed filming and rogers knocked him down again while an appeal of his suspension was pending rogers appeared at the  allstar game in detroit where fans loudly booed him on july   selig heard rogers appeal of his suspension selig decided to uphold the  games however an independent arbitrator ruled that selig had exceeded his authority and reduced it to  games but upheld the fine performanceenhancing drugsedit main article  baseball steroids investigation in  selig faced congress on the issue of steroids after the congressional hearings in early  and with the scrutiny of the sports and national media upon this issue selig put forth a proposal for a stricter performanceenhancing drug testing regime to replace the current system this proposal also included the banning of amphetamines a first for the major north american sports leagues the mlb players association and mlb reached an agreement in november on the new policy seligs testimony on the subject has been contradictory in  selig told reporters i never even heard about them steroids until  or  i ran a team and nobody was closer to their players and i never heard any comment from them it wasnt until  or ’ that i heard the discussion but a year later testifying to congress in  selig claimed personal credit for spotting the problem early in  before anybody was really talking about steroids in baseball we proposed a program of testing for such substances to the mlbpa as early as  i began formulating a strategic plan to eliminate the use of performanceenhancing substances from the game during the  alcs oaklands jose canseco had been repeatedly taunted by boston fans with a chant of steroids steroids steroids speaking at the  allstar game selig complained people say ‘well you were slow to react’ we were not slow to react in fact i heard that this morning and it aggravated me all over again by early  selig was forced to deal with the issue of steroid use on march   as a response to the controversy of the use of performanceenhancing drugs and the anticipated career home run record to be set by barry bonds selig asked former us senator george j mitchell to lead an independent investigation into the use of steroids in baseballs recent past joe sheehan from baseball prospectus wrote that the commission has been focusing blame for the era exclusively on uniformed personnel and failing to investigate any role played by team ownership and management much controversy surrounded selig and his involvement in bonds alltime home run record chase for months speculation surrounded selig and the possibility that he and henry aaron would not attend bonds games as he closed in on the record selig announced in july  when bonds was near  home runs that he would attend the games selig was in attendance for bonds recordtying home run against the san diego padres sitting in padres owner john moores private suite when bonds hit his th home run selig refused to applaud bonds accomplishment instead choosing to keep his hands in his pockets and have a look of disdain on his face bud selig also did not attend the san francisco giants game on august  when barry bonds hit his recordbreaking th home run against the washington nationals after the event selig released a statement congratulating bonds on december   former senator mitchell released his report on the use of performanceenhancing substances by mlb players the report names many current and former players who allegedly used performanceenhancing drugs during their career selig has been widely criticized for not taking an active enough role to stem the tide of steroid use in baseball until it had blossomed into a debilitating problem for the industry chicago suntimes columnist jay mariotti called selig the steroids commissioner selig has been called to congress several times to testify on performanceenhancing drug use congressman cliff stearns said in december  that selig should resign because of use of performanceenhancing drugs in baseball during his tenure postseason scheduleedit seligs decision to extend the traditional postseason schedule into november in an attempt to increase nielsen ratings was met with widespread disdain both inside and outside the baseball community mike scioscia manager of the american league west division champion los angeles angels dismissed the decision as ridiculous i don’t know can i say it any clearer than that we should have never had a day off last wednesday we should never have three days off after the season you shouldn’t even have two days off after the season controversiesedit related to the contraction controversy in  rob dibble posted an open letter to bud selig criticizing his actions for benefiting only the milwaukee brewers dibble cites that the contraction of the twins would benefit the brewers as they would potentially claim the twins share of the upper midwest market selig has made some decisions involving the houston astros that were unpopular with their supporters he ordered the roof at minute maid park to be opened for games three and four of the  world series preempting the authority held by the astros the roof was closed for all prior playoff games and similar weather conditions for hurricane ike in  selig mandated that the astros play two home games against the chicago cubs in his hometown of milwaukee despite proximity to the visiting cubs the home ballparks for the texas rangers and atlanta braves were both available to host the games the astros subsequently were victims of a nohitter by carlos zambrano and recorded a single hit in the following game in the midst of the playoff race this decision and its impact deeply affected the playoff race and seedings with eight teams holding winning records at the moment the milwaukee brewers benefited from these events by qualifying in the playoffs as a wild card team only to lose in the nlds to the philadelphia phillies the eventual world series winner in  selig also demanded that the astros move to the american league west as a condition of the sale of the franchise to businessman jim crane the team switched leagues in  in return for  million discount in the purchase price united states bankruptcy judge kevin gross rendered a stern warning to selig in regards to the  los angeles dodgers ownership dispute treating other teams differently in regards to their media contracts drew accusations that selig did not act in good faith with respect to the los angeles dodgers selig rejected the television deal that frank mccourt negotiated that intended to bring the franchise out of bankruptcy claiming mccourt violated the baseball agreement in comparison no action was taken against new york mets owner fred wilpon despite being in a similar position gross stated should the commissioner falter in proving alleged wrongdoing the court may allow lad los angeles dodgers to take further limited discovery some critics have used seligs handling of the dodgers to point out a double standard in treatment of mlb owners more specifically in regards to the mets critics point out that with seligs personal relationship with wilpon has motivated him to stall any possible removal of wilpon as that clubs principal owner selig also notably failed to resolve a year conflict between the san francisco giants and the oakland athletics regarding the athletics proposed move to san jose selig established a blueribbon panel in  to resolve the dispute however despite years to find a resolution the blueribbon panel completely failed to make any progress toward resolving the issue

father ben selig had come to the united states from romania with his family when he was four years old selig graduated from the university of wisconsinmadison with a ba in american history and political science in  he served two years in the us army before working with his father who owned a car leasing business in milwaukee selig continues to be involved in the automotive industry serving as president of the selig executive lease company seligs interest in baseball came from his mother an immigrant from ukraine marie selig attended college a rare accomplishment for a woman in the early th century and became a school teacher when selig was only three marie began taking him and his older brother jerry to borchert field where the minor league milwaukee brewers played when the boston braves relocated to milwaukee in  selig switched allegiances and eventually became the teams largest public stockholder selig was devastated when he learned that the braves were going to leave milwaukee in favor of atlanta in  when the braves left milwaukee he divested his stock in the team as a youngster seligs favorite player was hershel martin milwaukee brewers owneredit see also milwaukee brewers as a minority owner of the milwaukee braves selig founded the organization teams inc in an attempt to prevent the majority owners based out of chicago from moving the club to a larger television market this was challenged legally on the basis that no prior team relocations in the modern era left a city without a team prior movements had all originated in cities which were home to at least two teams when his quest to keep the team in milwaukee finally failed after the  season he changed the groups name to milwaukee brewers baseball club inc after the minor league baseball team he grew up watching and devoted himself to returning major league baseball to milwaukee selig arranged for major league games to be played at milwaukee county stadium the first a preseason matchup between the chicago white sox and minnesota twins drew more than  spectators selig followed this up by hosting nine white sox regularseason games in  and eleven in  one of the games played in milwaukee that year was against the expansion seattle pilots the team that would become the brewers those milwaukee home games were phenomenally successful with the handful of games accounting for about onethird of total white sox home attendance to satisfy that fan base selig decided to purchase the white sox with the intention of moving them to milwaukee in  he entered into an agreement to buy the club but the american league vetoed the sale preferring to keep an american league team in chicago which at the time was still americas second largest city selig turned his attention to other franchises statue of selig outside of miller park in  he purchased the bankrupt seattle pilots franchise moving them to his hometown and officially renaming the team the brewers during seligs tenure as club president the brewers participated in postseason play in  when the team finished first in the american league east during the second half of the season and in  when the team made it to the world series under the leadership of future hall of famers robin yount and paul molitor under seligs watch the brewers also won seven organization of the year awards selig was part of the owners collusion in – resulting in the owners paying us million in damages to the players upon his assumption of the commissioners role selig transferred his ownership interest in the brewers to his daughter wendy seligprieb in order to remove any technical conflicts of interest though it was widely presumed he maintained some hand in team operations although the team has been sold to los angeles investor mark attanasio questions remain regarding seligs past involvement seligs defenders point to the poor management of the team after seligprieb took control as proof that selig was not working behind the scenes selig was elected to the wisconsin athletic hall of fame in  on august   a statue of selig commissioned by brewers owner mark attanasio and designed by artist brian maughan was unveiled outside miller park in milwaukee acting commissioner –edit selig became an increasingly vocal opponent of commissioner fay vincent and soon became the leader of a group of owners seeking his removal selig has never stated that the owners colluded while vincent has the union basically doesnt trust the ownership because collusion was a us million theft by selig and jerry reinsdorf of that money from the players i mean they rigged the signing of free agents they got caught they paid  million to the players and i think thats polluted labor relations in baseball ever since it happened i think its the reason mlbpa executive director donald fehr has no trust in selig — fay vincent following an  noconfidence vote vincent resigned selig had by this time become chairman of the executive council of major league baseball and as such became de facto acting commissioner his first major act was to institute the wild card and divisional playoff play which has created much controversy amongst baseball fans those against the wild card see it as diminishing the importance of the pennant race and the regular season with the true race often being for second rather than first place while those in favor of it view it as an opportunity for teams to have a shot at the playoffs even when they have no chance of a firstplace finish in their division thus maintaining fan interest later in the season selig suspended cincinnati reds owner marge schott for a year in  for repeated racially insensitive and prejudicial remarks and actions the same year new york yankees owner george steinbrenner was reinstated from a lifelong suspension that was instituted by seligs predecessor fay vincent pete rose has claimed that he applied for reinstatement over the years and received no such consideration rose along with his close friend and former teammate mike schmidt who is a strong supporter of roses reinstatement into baseball met with selig in  where rose privately admitted to selig two years before going public with his admission about betting on baseball bud selig was a close friend of the late bart giamatti who was the commissioner when rose was first banned from the sport in  as acting commissioner selig represented mlb during the  players strike and cancelled the world series marking the first time the annual event had not been staged since  commissioner –edit after a sixyear search for a new commissioner the owners voted to give selig the title on a permanent basis midway through the  season during his tenure the game avoided a third work stoppage in  and has seen the implementation of interleague play whereas in the past the national and american leagues had separate administrative organizations which for example allowed for the introduction of different rules such as the designated hitter under selig major league baseball consolidated the administrative functions of both leagues into the commissioners office in  the last official presidents of the nl and al were leonard s coleman jr and dr gene budig respectively reaction after september  edit on september   selig ordered all baseball games postponed for a week because of the terror attacks on new york and washington the games were postponed not only out of respect and mourning for the victims but also out of concern for the safety and security of fans and players  contraction attemptedit after the conclusion of the  world series selig held a vote on contracting two teams reportedly the minnesota twins and montreal expos this action led to selig along with former expos owner jeffrey loria being sued for racketeering and conspiring with loria to deliberately defraud the expos minority owners if found liable the league could have been ordered to pay as much as  million in total damages the judge also ruled that the expos could not be moved or contracted until the case was over the case eventually went to arbitration and was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum a week after selig’s announcement hennepin county judge harry seymour crump issued a temporary restraining order that forced the twins to honor their lease and play the  season at the metrodome in august  the effort to contract the twins officially fizzled as players and owners reached a consensus on a new labor agreement which extended the teams metrodome lease changes to the mlb allstar gameedit the  allstar game played in seligs hometown of milwaukee was tied  after  innings and remained tied after the bottom of the th inning due to the recent managerial trend of granting playing time to as many available players as possible within the regulation nine innings both managers had used their entire roster concerned for the arms of the pitchers currently on the mound selig made the controversial decision to declare the game a tie to the dissatisfaction of the milwaukee fans selig later said that this call was embarrassing and that he was tremendously saddened by the outcome of the game since  selig subsequently tried to reinvigorate the allstar game by awarding the winning league homefield advantage in the world series the  allstar game had the same us viewership as   rating  share and the ratings declined in   rating  share and   rating  share the american television audience increased in   rating  share disciplinary actionsedit on july   selig suspended texas rangers pitcher kenny rogers for  games and fined him us rogers got in trouble when on june   he purposely grabbed the camera of a cameraman resulting in one camera falling to the ground when the cameraman proceeded to pick up his camera rogers went back to him in an arguably threatening way one of the reporters then resumed filming and rogers knocked him down again while an appeal of his suspension was pending rogers appeared at the  allstar game in detroit where fans loudly booed him on july   selig heard rogers appeal of his suspension selig decided to uphold the  games however an independent arbitrator ruled that selig had exceeded his authority and reduced it to  games but upheld the fine performanceenhancing drugsedit main article  baseball steroids investigation in  selig faced congress on the issue of steroids after the congressional hearings in early  and with the scrutiny of the sports and national media upon this issue selig put forth a proposal for a stricter performanceenhancing drug testing regime to replace the current system this proposal also included the banning of amphetamines a first for the major north american sports leagues the mlb players association and mlb reached an agreement in november on the new policy seligs testimony on the subject has been contradictory in  selig told reporters i never even heard about them steroids until  or  i ran a team and nobody was closer to their players and i never heard any comment from them it wasnt until  or ’ that i heard the discussion but a year later testifying to congress in  selig claimed personal credit for spotting the problem early in  before anybody was really talking about steroids in baseball we proposed a program of testing for such substances to the mlbpa as early as  i began formulating a strategic plan to eliminate the use of performanceenhancing substances from the game during the  alcs oaklands jose canseco had been repeatedly taunted by boston fans with a chant of steroids steroids steroids speaking at the  allstar game selig complained people say ‘well you were slow to react’ we were not slow to react in fact i heard that this morning and it aggravated me all over again by early  selig was forced to deal with the issue of steroid use on march   as a response to the controversy of the use of performanceenhancing drugs and the anticipated career home run record to be set by barry bonds selig asked former us senator george j mitchell to lead an independent investigation into the use of steroids in baseballs recent past joe sheehan from baseball prospectus wrote that the commission has been focusing blame for the era exclusively on uniformed personnel and failing to investigate any role played by team ownership and management much controversy surrounded selig and his involvement in bonds alltime home run record chase for months speculation surrounded selig and the possibility that he and henry aaron would not attend bonds games as he closed in on the record selig announced in july  when bonds was near  home runs that he would attend the games selig was in attendance for bonds recordtying home run against the san diego padres sitting in padres owner john moores private suite when bonds hit his th home run selig refused to applaud bonds accomplishment instead choosing to keep his hands in his pockets and have a look of disdain on his face bud selig also did not attend the san francisco giants game on august  when barry bonds hit his recordbreaking th home run against the washington nationals after the event selig released a statement congratulating bonds on december   former senator mitchell released his report on the use of performanceenhancing substances by mlb players the report names many current and former players who allegedly used performanceenhancing drugs during their career selig has been widely criticized for not taking an active enough role to stem the tide of steroid use in baseball until it had blossomed into a debilitating problem for the industry chicago suntimes columnist jay mariotti called selig the steroids commissioner selig has been called to congress several times to testify on performanceenhancing drug use congressman cliff stearns said in december  that selig should resign because of use of performanceenhancing drugs in baseball during his tenure postseason scheduleedit seligs decision to extend the traditional postseason schedule into november in an attempt to increase nielsen ratings was met with widespread disdain both inside and outside the baseball community mike scioscia manager of the american league west division champion los angeles angels dismissed the decision as ridiculous i don’t know can i say it any clearer than that we should have never had a day off last wednesday we should never have three days off after the season you shouldn’t even have two days off after the season controversiesedit related to the contraction controversy in  rob dibble posted an open letter to bud selig criticizing his actions for benefiting only the milwaukee brewers dibble cites that the contraction of the twins would benefit the brewers as they would potentially claim the twins share of the upper midwest market selig has made some decisions involving the houston astros that were unpopular with their supporters he ordered the roof at minute maid park to be opened for games three and four of the  world series preempting the authority held by the astros the roof was closed for all prior playoff games and similar weather conditions for hurricane ike in  selig mandated that the astros play two home games against the chicago cubs in his hometown of milwaukee despite proximity to the visiting cubs the home ballparks for the texas rangers and atlanta braves were both available to host the games the astros subsequently were victims of a nohitter by carlos zambrano and recorded a single hit in the following game in the midst of the playoff race this decision and its impact deeply affected the playoff race and seedings with eight teams holding winning records at the moment the milwaukee brewers benefited from these events by qualifying in the playoffs as a wild card team only to lose in the nlds to the philadelphia phillies the eventual world series winner in  selig also demanded that the astros move to the american league west as a condition of the sale of the franchise to businessman jim crane the team switched leagues in  in return for  million discount in the purchase price united states bankruptcy judge kevin gross rendered a stern warning to selig in regards to the  los angeles dodgers ownership dispute treating other teams differently in regards to their media contracts drew accusations that selig did not act in good faith with respect to the los angeles dodgers selig rejected the television deal that frank mccourt negotiated that intended to bring the franchise out of bankruptcy claiming mccourt violated the baseball agreement in comparison no action was taken against new york mets owner fred wilpon despite being in a similar position gross stated should the commissioner falter in proving alleged wrongdoing the court may allow lad los angeles dodgers to take further limited discovery some critics have used seligs handling of the dodgers to point out a double standard in treatment of mlb owners more specifically in regards to the mets critics point out that with seligs personal relationship with wilpon has motivated him to stall any possible removal of wilpon as that clubs principal owner selig also notably failed to resolve a year conflict between the san francisco giants and the oakland athletics regarding the athletics proposed move to san jose selig established a blueribbon panel in  to resolve the dispute however despite years to find a resolution the blueribbon panel completely failed to make any progress toward resolving the issue leading san jose to sue mlb the lawsuit which is currently ongoing questions the leagues antitrust exemption and its ability to enforce particular clubs geographic territories term of serviceedit on december

father ben selig had come to the united states from romania with his family when he was four years old selig graduated from the university of wisconsinmadison with a ba in american history and political science in  he served two years in the us army before working with his father who owned a car leasing business in milwaukee selig continues to be involved in the automotive industry serving as president of the selig executive lease company seligs interest in baseball came from his mother an immigrant from ukraine marie selig attended college a rare accomplishment for a woman in the early th century and became a school teacher when selig was only three marie began taking him and his older brother jerry to borchert field where the minor league milwaukee brewers played when the boston braves relocated to milwaukee in  selig switched allegiances and eventually became the teams largest public stockholder selig was devastated when he learned that the braves were going to leave milwaukee in favor of atlanta in  when the braves left milwaukee he divested his stock in the team as a youngster seligs favorite player was hershel martin milwaukee brewers owneredit see also milwaukee brewers as a minority owner of the milwaukee braves selig founded the organization teams inc in an attempt to prevent the majority owners based out of chicago from moving the club to a larger television market this was challenged legally on the basis that no prior team relocations in the modern era left a city without a team prior movements had all originated in cities which were home to at least two teams when his quest to keep the team in milwaukee finally failed after the  season he changed the groups name to milwaukee brewers baseball club inc after the minor league baseball team he grew up watching and devoted himself to returning major league baseball to milwaukee selig arranged for major league games to be played at milwaukee county stadium the first a preseason matchup between the chicago white sox and minnesota twins drew more than  spectators selig followed this up by hosting nine white sox regularseason games in  and eleven in  one of the games played in milwaukee that year was against the expansion seattle pilots the team that would become the brewers those milwaukee home games were phenomenally successful with the handful of games accounting for about onethird of total white sox home attendance to satisfy that fan base selig decided to purchase the white sox with the intention of moving them to milwaukee in  he entered into an agreement to buy the club but the american league vetoed the sale preferring to keep an american league team in chicago which at the time was still americas second largest city selig turned his attention to other franchises statue of selig outside of miller park in  he purchased the bankrupt seattle pilots franchise moving them to his hometown and officially renaming the team the brewers during seligs tenure as club president the brewers participated in postseason play in  when the team finished first in the american league east during the second half of the season and in  when the team made it to the world series under the leadership of future hall of famers robin yount and paul molitor under seligs watch the brewers also won seven organization of the year awards selig was part of the owners collusion in – resulting in the owners paying us million in damages to the players upon his assumption of the commissioners role selig transferred his ownership interest in the brewers to his daughter wendy seligprieb in order to remove any technical conflicts of interest though it was widely presumed he maintained some hand in team operations although the team has been sold to los angeles investor mark attanasio questions remain regarding seligs past involvement seligs defenders point to the poor management of the team after seligprieb took control as proof that selig was not working behind the scenes selig was elected to the wisconsin athletic hall of fame in  on august   a statue of selig commissioned by brewers owner mark attanasio and designed by artist brian maughan was unveiled outside miller park in milwaukee acting commissioner –edit selig became an increasingly vocal opponent of commissioner fay vincent and soon became the leader of a group of owners seeking his removal selig has never stated that the owners colluded while vincent has the union basically doesnt trust the ownership because collusion was a us million theft by selig and jerry reinsdorf of that money from the players i mean they rigged the signing of free agents they got caught they paid  million to the players and i think thats polluted labor relations in baseball ever since it happened i think its the reason mlbpa executive director donald fehr has no trust in selig — fay vincent following an  noconfidence vote vincent resigned selig had by this time become chairman of the executive council of major league baseball and as such became de facto acting commissioner his first major act was to institute the wild card and divisional playoff play which has created much controversy amongst baseball fans those against the wild card see it as diminishing the importance of the pennant race and the regular season with the true race often being for second rather than first place while those in favor of it view it as an opportunity for teams to have a shot at the playoffs even when they have no chance of a firstplace finish in their division thus maintaining fan interest later in the season selig suspended cincinnati reds owner marge schott for a year in  for repeated racially insensitive and prejudicial remarks and actions the same year new york yankees owner george steinbrenner was reinstated from a lifelong suspension that was instituted by seligs predecessor fay vincent pete rose has claimed that he applied for reinstatement over the years and received no such consideration rose along with his close friend and former teammate mike schmidt who is a strong supporter of roses reinstatement into baseball met with selig in  where rose privately admitted to selig two years before going public with his admission about betting on baseball bud selig was a close friend of the late bart giamatti who was the commissioner when rose was first banned from the sport in  as acting commissioner selig represented mlb during the  players strike and cancelled the world series marking the first time the annual event had not been staged since  commissioner –edit after a sixyear search for a new commissioner the owners voted to give selig the title on a permanent basis midway through the  season during his tenure the game avoided a third work stoppage in  and has seen the implementation of interleague play whereas in the past the national and american leagues had separate administrative organizations which for example allowed for the introduction of different rules such as the designated hitter under selig major league baseball consolidated the administrative functions of both leagues into the commissioners office in  the last official presidents of the nl and al were leonard s coleman jr and dr gene budig respectively reaction after september  edit on september   selig ordered all baseball games postponed for a week because of the terror attacks on new york and washington the games were postponed not only out of respect and mourning for the victims but also out of concern for the safety and security of fans and players  contraction attemptedit after the conclusion of the  world series selig held a vote on contracting two teams reportedly the minnesota twins and montreal expos this action led to selig along with former expos owner jeffrey loria being sued for racketeering and conspiring with loria to deliberately defraud the expos minority owners if found liable the league could have been ordered to pay as much as  million in total damages the judge also ruled that the expos could not be moved or contracted until the case was over the case eventually went to arbitration and was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum a week after selig’s announcement hennepin county judge harry seymour crump issued a temporary restraining order that forced the twins to honor their lease and play the  season at the metrodome in august  the effort to contract the twins officially fizzled as players and owners reached a consensus on a new labor agreement which extended the teams metrodome lease changes to the mlb allstar gameedit the  allstar game played in seligs hometown of milwaukee was tied  after  innings and remained tied after the bottom of the th inning due to the recent managerial trend of granting playing time to as many available players as possible within the regulation nine innings both managers had used their entire roster concerned for the arms of the pitchers currently on the mound selig made the controversial decision to declare the game a tie to the dissatisfaction of the milwaukee fans selig later said that this call was embarrassing and that he was tremendously saddened by the outcome of the game since  selig subsequently tried to reinvigorate the allstar game by awarding the winning league homefield advantage in the world series the  allstar game had the same us viewership as   rating  share and the ratings declined in   rating  share and   rating  share the american television audience increased in   rating  share disciplinary actionsedit on july   selig suspended texas rangers pitcher kenny rogers for  games and fined him us rogers got in trouble when on june   he purposely grabbed the camera of a cameraman resulting in one camera falling to the ground when the cameraman proceeded to pick up his camera rogers went back to him in an arguably threatening way one of the reporters then resumed filming and rogers knocked him down again while an appeal of his suspension was pending rogers appeared at the  allstar game in detroit where fans loudly booed him on july   selig heard rogers appeal of his suspension selig decided to uphold the  games however an independent arbitrator ruled that selig had exceeded his authority and reduced it to  games but upheld the fine performanceenhancing drugsedit main article  baseball steroids investigation in  selig faced congress on the issue of steroids after the congressional hearings in early  and with the scrutiny of the sports and national media upon this issue selig put forth a proposal for a stricter performanceenhancing drug testing regime to replace the current system this proposal also included the banning of amphetamines a first for the major north american sports leagues the mlb players association and mlb reached an agreement in november on the new policy seligs testimony on the subject has been contradictory in  selig told reporters i never even heard about them steroids until  or  i ran a team and nobody was closer to their players and i never heard any comment from them it wasnt until  or ’ that i heard the discussion but a year later testifying to congress in  selig claimed personal credit for spotting the problem early in  before anybody was really talking about steroids in baseball we proposed a program of testing for such substances to the mlbpa as early as  i began formulating a strategic plan to eliminate the use of performanceenhancing substances from the game during the  alcs oaklands jose canseco had been repeatedly taunted by boston fans with a chant of steroids steroids steroids speaking at the  allstar game selig complained people say ‘well you were slow to react’ we were not slow to react in fact i heard that this morning and it aggravated me all over again by early  selig was forced to deal with the issue of steroid use on march   as a response to the controversy of the use of performanceenhancing drugs and the anticipated career home run record to be set by barry bonds selig asked former us senator george j mitchell to lead an independent investigation into the use of steroids in baseballs recent past joe sheehan from baseball prospectus wrote that the commission has been focusing blame for the era exclusively on uniformed personnel and failing to investigate any role played by team ownership and management much controversy surrounded selig and his involvement in bonds alltime home run record chase for months speculation surrounded selig and the possibility that he and henry aaron would not attend bonds games as he closed in on the record selig announced in july  when bonds was near  home runs that he would attend the games selig was in attendance for bonds recordtying home run against the san diego padres sitting in padres owner john moores private suite when bonds hit his th home run selig refused to applaud bonds accomplishment instead choosing to keep his hands in his pockets and have a look of disdain on his face bud selig also did not attend the san francisco giants game on august  when barry bonds hit his recordbreaking th home run against the washington nationals after the event selig released a statement congratulating bonds on december   former senator mitchell released his report on the use of performanceenhancing substances by mlb players the report names many current and former players who allegedly used performanceenhancing drugs during their career selig has been widely criticized for not taking an active enough role to stem the tide of steroid use in baseball until it had blossomed into a debilitating problem for the industry chicago suntimes columnist jay mariotti called selig the steroids commissioner selig has been called to congress several times to testify on performanceenhancing drug use congressman cliff stearns said in december  that selig should resign because of use of performanceenhancing drugs in baseball during his tenure postseason scheduleedit seligs decision to extend the traditional postseason schedule into november in an attempt to increase nielsen ratings was met with widespread disdain both inside and outside the baseball community mike scioscia manager of the american league west division champion los angeles angels dismissed the decision as ridiculous i don’t know can i say it any clearer than that we should have never had a day off last wednesday we should never have three days off after the season you shouldn’t even have two days off after the season controversiesedit related to the contraction controversy in  rob dibble posted an open letter to bud selig criticizing his actions for benefiting only the milwaukee brewers dibble cites that the contraction of the twins would benefit the brewers as they would potentially claim the twins share of the upper midwest market selig has made some decisions involving the houston astros that were unpopular with their supporters he ordered the roof at minute maid park to be opened for games three and four of the  world series preempting the authority held by the astros the roof was closed for all prior playoff games and similar weather conditions for hurricane ike in  selig mandated that the astros play two home games against the chicago cubs in his hometown of milwaukee despite proximity to the visiting cubs the home ballparks for the texas rangers and atlanta braves were both available to host the games the astros subsequently were victims of a nohitter by carlos zambrano and recorded a single hit in the following game in the midst of the playoff race this decision and its impact deeply affected the playoff race and seedings with eight teams holding winning records at the moment the milwaukee brewers benefited from these events by qualifying in the playoffs as a wild card team only to lose in the nlds to the philadelphia phillies the eventual world series winner in  selig also demanded that the astros move to the american league west as a condition of the sale of the franchise to businessman jim crane the team switched leagues in  in return for  million discount in the purchase price united states bankruptcy judge kevin gross rendered a stern warning to selig in regards to the  los angeles dodgers ownership dispute treating other teams differently in regards to their media contracts drew accusations that selig did not act in good faith with respect to the los angeles dodgers selig rejected the television deal that frank mccourt negotiated that intended to bring the franchise out of bankruptcy claiming mccourt violated the baseball agreement in comparison no action was taken against new york mets owner fred wilpon despite being in a similar position gross stated should the commissioner falter in proving alleged wrongdoing the court may allow lad los angeles dodgers to take further limited discovery some critics have used seligs handling of the dodgers to point out a double standard in treatment of mlb owners more specifically in regards to the mets critics point out that with seligs personal relationship with wilpon has motivated him to stall any possible removal of wilpon as that clubs principal owner selig also notably failed to resolve a year conflict between the san francisco giants and the oakland athletics regarding the athletics proposed move to san jose selig established a blueribbon panel in  to resolve the dispute however despite years to find a resolution the blueribbon panel completely failed to make any progress toward resolving the issue leading san jose to sue mlb the lawsuit which is currently ongoing questions the leagues antitrust exemption and its ability to enforce particular clubs geographic territories term of serviceedit on december

father ben selig had come to the united states from romania with his family when he was four years old selig graduated from the university of wisconsinmadison with a ba in american history and political science in  he served two years in the us army before working with his father who owned a car leasing business in milwaukee selig continues to be involved in the automotive industry serving as president of the selig executive lease company seligs interest in baseball came from his mother an immigrant from ukraine marie selig attended college a rare accomplishment for a woman in the early th century and became a school teacher when selig was only three marie began taking him and his older brother jerry to borchert field where the minor league milwaukee brewers played when the boston braves relocated to milwaukee in  selig switched allegiances and eventually became the teams largest public stockholder selig was devastated when he learned that the braves were going to leave milwaukee in favor of atlanta in  when the braves left milwaukee he divested his stock in the team as a youngster seligs favorite player was hershel martin milwaukee brewers owneredit see also milwaukee brewers as a minority owner of the milwaukee braves selig founded the organization teams inc in an attempt to prevent the majority owners based out of chicago from moving the club to a larger television market this was challenged legally on the basis that no prior team relocations in the modern era left a city without a team prior movements had all originated in cities which were home to at least two teams when his quest to keep the team in milwaukee finally failed after the  season he changed the groups name to milwaukee brewers baseball club inc after the minor league baseball team he grew up watching and devoted himself to returning major league baseball to milwaukee selig arranged for major league games to be played at milwaukee county stadium the first a preseason matchup between the chicago white sox and minnesota twins drew more than  spectators selig followed this up by hosting nine white sox regularseason games in  and eleven in  one of the games played in milwaukee that year was against the expansion seattle pilots the team that would become the brewers those milwaukee home games were phenomenally successful with the handful of games accounting for about onethird of total white sox home attendance to satisfy that fan base selig decided to purchase the white sox with the intention of moving them to milwaukee in  he entered into an agreement to buy the club but the american league vetoed the sale preferring to keep an american league team in chicago which at the time was still americas second largest city selig turned his attention to other franchises statue of selig outside of miller park in  he purchased the bankrupt seattle pilots franchise moving them to his hometown and officially renaming the team the brewers during seligs tenure as club president the brewers participated in postseason play in  when the team finished first in the american league east during the second half of the season and in  when the team made it to the world series under the leadership of future hall of famers robin yount and paul molitor under seligs watch the brewers also won seven organization of the year awards selig was part of the owners collusion in – resulting in the owners paying us million in damages to the players upon his assumption of the commissioners role selig transferred his ownership interest in the brewers to his daughter wendy seligprieb in order to remove any technical conflicts of interest though it was widely presumed he maintained some hand in team operations although the team has been sold to los angeles investor mark attanasio questions remain regarding seligs past involvement seligs defenders point to the poor management of the team after seligprieb took control as proof that selig was not working behind the scenes selig was elected to the wisconsin athletic hall of fame in  on august   a statue of selig commissioned by brewers owner mark attanasio and designed by artist brian maughan was unveiled outside miller park in milwaukee acting commissioner –edit selig became an increasingly vocal opponent of commissioner fay vincent and soon became the leader of a group of owners seeking his removal selig has never stated that the owners colluded while vincent has the union basically doesnt trust the ownership because collusion was a us million theft by selig and jerry reinsdorf of that money from the players i mean they rigged the signing of free agents they got caught they paid  million to the players and i think thats polluted labor relations in baseball ever since it happened i think its the reason mlbpa executive director donald fehr has no trust in selig — fay vincent following an  noconfidence vote vincent resigned selig had by this time become chairman of the executive council of major league baseball and as such became de facto acting commissioner his first major act was to institute the wild card and divisional playoff play which has created much controversy amongst baseball fans those against the wild card see it as diminishing the importance of the pennant race and the regular season with the true race often being for second rather than first place while those in favor of it view it as an opportunity for teams to have a shot at the playoffs even when they have no chance of a firstplace finish in their division thus maintaining fan interest later in the season selig suspended cincinnati reds owner marge schott for a year in  for repeated racially insensitive and prejudicial remarks and actions the same year new york yankees owner george steinbrenner was reinstated from a lifelong suspension that was instituted by seligs predecessor fay vincent pete rose has claimed that he applied for reinstatement over the years and received no such consideration rose along with his close friend and former teammate mike schmidt who is a strong supporter of roses reinstatement into baseball met with selig in  where rose privately admitted to selig two years before going public with his admission about betting on baseball bud selig was a close friend of the late bart giamatti who was the commissioner when rose was first banned from the sport in  as acting commissioner selig represented mlb during the  players strike and cancelled the world series marking the first time the annual event had not been staged since  commissioner –edit after a sixyear search for a new commissioner the owners voted to give selig the title on a permanent basis midway through the  season during his tenure the game avoided a third work stoppage in  and has seen the implementation of interleague play whereas in the past the national and american leagues had separate administrative organizations which for example allowed for the introduction of different rules such as the designated hitter under selig major league baseball consolidated the administrative functions of both leagues into the commissioners office in  the last official presidents of the nl and al were leonard s coleman jr and dr gene budig respectively reaction after september  edit on september   selig ordered all baseball games postponed for a week because of the terror attacks on new york and washington the games were postponed not only out of respect and mourning for the victims but also out of concern for the safety and security of fans and players  contraction attemptedit after the conclusion of the  world series selig held a vote on contracting two teams reportedly the minnesota twins and montreal expos this action led to selig along with former expos owner jeffrey loria being sued for racketeering and conspiring with loria to deliberately defraud the expos minority owners if found liable the league could have been ordered to pay as much as  million in total damages the judge also ruled that the expos could not be moved or contracted until the case was over the case eventually went to arbitration and was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum a week after selig’s announcement hennepin county judge harry seymour crump issued a temporary restraining order that forced the twins to honor their lease and play the  season at the metrodome in august  the effort to contract the twins officially fizzled as players and owners reached a consensus on a new labor agreement which extended the teams metrodome lease changes to the mlb allstar gameedit the  allstar game played in seligs hometown of milwaukee was tied  after  innings and remained tied after the bottom of the th inning due to the recent managerial trend of granting playing time to as many available players as possible within the regulation nine innings both managers had used their entire roster concerned for the arms of the pitchers currently on the mound selig made the controversial decision to declare the game a tie to the dissatisfaction of the milwaukee fans selig later said that this call was embarrassing and that he was tremendously saddened by the outcome of the game since  selig subsequently tried to reinvigorate the allstar game by awarding the winning league homefield advantage in the world series the  allstar game had the same us viewership as   rating  share and the ratings declined in   rating  share and   rating  share the american television audience increased in   rating  share disciplinary actionsedit on july   selig suspended texas rangers pitcher kenny rogers for  games and fined him us rogers got in trouble when on june   he purposely grabbed the camera of a cameraman resulting in one camera falling to the ground when the cameraman proceeded to pick up his camera rogers went back to him in an arguably threatening way one of the reporters then resumed filming and rogers knocked him down again while an appeal of his suspension was pending rogers appeared at the  allstar game in detroit where fans loudly booed him on july   selig heard rogers appeal of his suspension selig decided to uphold the  games however an independent arbitrator ruled that selig had exceeded his authority and reduced it to  games but upheld the fine performanceenhancing drugsedit main article  baseball steroids investigation in  selig faced congress on the issue of steroids after the congressional hearings in early  and with the scrutiny of the sports and national media upon this issue selig put forth a proposal for a stricter performanceenhancing drug testing regime to replace the current system this proposal also included the banning of amphetamines a first for the major north american sports leagues the mlb players association and mlb reached an agreement in november on the new policy seligs testimony on the subject has been contradictory in  selig told reporters i never even heard about them steroids until  or  i ran a team and nobody was closer to their players and i never heard any comment from them it wasnt until  or ’ that i heard the discussion but a year later testifying to congress in  selig claimed personal credit for spotting the problem early in  before anybody was really talking about steroids in baseball we proposed a program of testing for such substances to the mlbpa as early as  i began formulating a strategic plan to eliminate the use of performanceenhancing substances from the game during the  alcs oaklands jose canseco had been repeatedly taunted by boston fans with a chant of steroids steroids steroids speaking at the  allstar game selig complained people say ‘well you were slow to react’ we were not slow to react in fact i heard that this morning and it aggravated me all over again by early  selig was forced to deal with the issue of steroid use on march   as a response to the controversy of the use of performanceenhancing drugs and the anticipated career home run record to be set by barry bonds selig asked former us senator george j mitchell to lead an independent investigation into the use of steroids in baseballs recent past joe sheehan from baseball prospectus wrote that the commission has been focusing blame for the era exclusively on uniformed personnel and failing to investigate any role played by team ownership and management much controversy surrounded selig and his involvement in bonds alltime home run record chase for months speculation surrounded selig and the possibility that he and henry aaron would not attend bonds games as he closed in on the record selig announced in july  when bonds was near  home runs that he would attend the games selig was in attendance for bonds recordtying home run against the san diego padres sitting in padres owner john moores private suite when bonds hit his th home run selig refused to applaud bonds accomplishment instead choosing to keep his hands in his pockets and have a look of disdain on his face bud selig also did not attend the san francisco giants game on august  when barry bonds hit his recordbreaking th home run against the washington nationals after the event selig released a statement congratulating bonds on december   former senator mitchell released his report on the use of performanceenhancing substances by mlb players the report names many current and former players who allegedly used performanceenhancing drugs during their career selig has been widely criticized for not taking an active enough role to stem the tide of steroid use in baseball until it had blossomed into a debilitating problem for the industry chicago suntimes columnist jay mariotti called selig the steroids commissioner selig has been called to congress several times to testify on performanceenhancing drug use congressman cliff stearns said in december  that selig should resign because of use of performanceenhancing drugs in baseball during his tenure postseason scheduleedit seligs decision to extend the traditional postseason schedule into november in an attempt to increase nielsen ratings was met with widespread disdain both inside and outside the baseball community mike scioscia manager of the american league west division champion los angeles angels dismissed the decision as ridiculous i don’t know can i say it any clearer than that we should have never had a day off last wednesday we should never have three days off after the season you shouldn’t even have two days off after the season controversiesedit related to the contraction controversy in  rob dibble posted an open letter to bud selig criticizing his actions for benefiting only the milwaukee brewers dibble cites that the contraction of the twins would benefit the brewers as they would potentially claim the twins share of the upper midwest market selig has made some decisions involving the houston astros that were unpopular with their supporters he ordered the roof at minute maid park to be opened for games three and four of the  world series preempting the authority held by the astros the roof was closed for all prior playoff games and similar weather conditions for hurricane ike in  selig mandated that the astros play two home games against the chicago cubs in his hometown of milwaukee despite proximity to the visiting cubs the home ballparks for the texas rangers and atlanta braves were both available to host the games the astros subsequently were victims of a nohitter by carlos zambrano and recorded a single hit in the following game in the midst of the playoff race this decision and its impact deeply affected the playoff race and seedings with eight teams holding winning records at the moment the milwaukee brewers benefited from these events by qualifying in the playoffs as a wild card team only to lose in the nlds to the philadelphia phillies the eventual world series winner in  selig also demanded that the astros move to the american league west as a condition of the sale of the franchise to businessman jim crane the team switched leagues in  in return for  million discount in the purchase price united states bankruptcy judge kevin gross rendered a stern warning to selig in regards to the  los angeles dodgers ownership dispute treating other teams differently in regards to their media contracts drew accusations that selig did not act in good faith with respect to the los angeles dodgers selig rejected the television deal that frank mccourt negotiated that intended to bring the franchise out of bankruptcy claiming mccourt violated the baseball agreement in comparison no action was taken against new york mets owner fred wilpon despite being in a similar position gross stated should the commissioner falter in proving alleged wrongdoing the court may allow lad los angeles dodgers to take further limited discovery some critics have used seligs handling of the dodgers to point out a double standard in treatment of mlb owners more specifically in regards to the mets critics point out that with seligs personal relationship with wilpon has motivated him to stall any possible removal of wilpon as that clubs principal owner selig also notably failed to resolve a year conflict between the san francisco giants and the oakland athletics regarding the athletics proposed move to san jose selig established a blueribbon panel in  to resolve the dispute however despite years to find a resolution the blueribbon panel completely failed to make any progress toward resolving the issue leading san jose to sue mlb the lawsuit which is currently ongoing questions the leagues antitrust exemption and its ability to enforce particular clubs geographic territories term of serviceedit on december

as president of the selig executive lease company seligs interest in baseball came from his mother an immigrant from ukraine marie selig attended college a rare accomplishment for a woman in the early th century and became a school teacher when selig was only three marie began taking him and his older brother jerry to borchert field where the minor league milwaukee brewers played when the boston braves relocated to milwaukee in  selig switched allegiances and eventually became the teams largest public stockholder selig was devastated when he learned that the braves were going to leave milwaukee in favor of atlanta in  when the braves left milwaukee he divested his stock in the team as a youngster seligs favorite player was hershel martin milwaukee brewers owneredit see also milwaukee brewers as a minority owner of the milwaukee braves selig founded the organization teams inc in an attempt to prevent the majority owners based out of chicago from moving the club to a larger television market this was challenged legally on the basis that no prior team relocations in the modern era left a city without a team prior movements had all originated in cities which were home to at least two teams when his quest to keep the team in milwaukee finally failed after the  season he changed the groups name to milwaukee brewers baseball club inc after the minor league baseball team he grew up watching and devoted himself to returning major league baseball to milwaukee selig arranged for major league games to be played at milwaukee county stadium the first a preseason matchup between the chicago white sox and minnesota twins drew more than  spectators selig followed this up by hosting nine white sox regularseason games in  and eleven in  one of the games played in milwaukee that year was against the expansion seattle pilots the team that would become the brewers those milwaukee home games were phenomenally successful with the handful of games accounting for about onethird of total white sox home attendance to satisfy that fan base selig decided to purchase the white sox with the intention of moving them to milwaukee in  he entered into an agreement to buy the club but the american league vetoed the sale preferring to keep an american league team in chicago which at the time was still americas second largest city selig turned his attention to other franchises statue of selig outside of miller park in  he purchased the bankrupt seattle pilots franchise moving them to his hometown and officially renaming the team the brewers during seligs tenure as club president the brewers participated in postseason play in  when the team finished first in the american league east during the second half of the season and in  when the team made it to the world series under the leadership of future hall of famers robin yount and paul molitor under seligs watch the brewers also won seven organization of the year awards selig was part of the owners collusion in – resulting in the owners paying us million in damages to the players upon his assumption of the commissioners role selig transferred his ownership interest in the brewers to his daughter wendy seligprieb in order to remove any technical conflicts of interest though it was widely presumed he maintained some hand in team operations although the team has been sold to los angeles investor mark attanasio questions remain regarding seligs past involvement seligs defenders point to the poor management of the team after seligprieb took control as proof that selig was not working behind the scenes selig was elected to the wisconsin athletic hall of fame in  on august   a statue of selig commissioned by brewers owner mark attanasio and designed by artist brian maughan was unveiled outside miller park in milwaukee acting commissioner –edit selig became an increasingly vocal opponent of commissioner fay vincent and soon became the leader of a group of owners seeking his removal selig has never stated that the owners colluded while vincent has the union basically doesnt trust the ownership because collusion was a us million theft by selig and jerry reinsdorf of that money from the players i mean they rigged the signing of free agents they got caught they paid  million to the players and i think thats polluted labor relations in baseball ever since it happened i think its the reason mlbpa executive director donald fehr has no trust in selig — fay vincent following an  noconfidence vote vincent resigned selig had by this time become chairman of the executive council of major league baseball and as such became de facto acting commissioner his first major act was to institute the wild card and divisional playoff play which has created much controversy amongst baseball fans those against the wild card see it as diminishing the importance of the pennant race and the regular season with the true race often being for second rather than first place while those in favor of it view it as an opportunity for teams to have a shot at the playoffs even when they have no chance of a firstplace finish in their division thus maintaining fan interest later in the season selig suspended cincinnati reds owner marge schott for a year in  for repeated racially insensitive and prejudicial remarks and actions the same year new york yankees owner george steinbrenner was reinstated from a lifelong suspension that was instituted by seligs predecessor fay vincent pete rose has claimed that he applied for reinstatement over the years and received no such consideration rose along with his close friend and former teammate mike schmidt who is a strong supporter of roses reinstatement into baseball met with selig in  where rose privately admitted to selig two years before going public with his admission about betting on baseball bud selig was a close friend of the late bart giamatti who was the commissioner when rose was first banned from the sport in  as acting commissioner selig represented mlb during the  players strike and cancelled the world series marking the first time the annual event had not been staged since  commissioner –edit after a sixyear search for a new commissioner the owners voted to give selig the title on a permanent basis midway through the  season during his tenure the game avoided a third work stoppage in  and has seen the implementation of interleague play whereas in the past the national and american leagues had separate administrative organizations which for example allowed for the introduction of different rules such as the designated hitter under selig major league baseball consolidated the administrative functions of both leagues into the commissioners office in  the last official presidents of the nl and al were leonard s coleman jr and dr gene budig respectively reaction after september  edit on september   selig ordered all baseball games postponed for a week because of the terror attacks on new york and washington the games were postponed not only out of respect and mourning for the victims but also out of concern for the safety and security of fans and players  contraction attemptedit after the conclusion of the  world series selig held a vote on contracting two teams reportedly the minnesota twins and montreal expos this action led to selig along with former expos owner jeffrey loria being sued for racketeering and conspiring with loria to deliberately defraud the expos minority owners if found liable the league could have been ordered to pay as much as  million in total damages the judge also ruled that the expos could not be moved or contracted until the case was over the case eventually went to arbitration and was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum a week after selig’s announcement hennepin county judge harry seymour crump issued a temporary restraining order that forced the twins to honor their lease and play the  season at the metrodome in august  the effort to contract the twins officially fizzled as players and owners reached a consensus on a new labor agreement which extended the teams metrodome lease changes to the mlb allstar gameedit the  allstar game played in seligs hometown of milwaukee was tied  after  innings and remained tied after the bottom of the th inning due to the recent managerial trend of granting playing time to as many available players as possible within the regulation nine innings both managers had used their entire roster concerned for the arms of the pitchers currently on the mound selig made the controversial decision to declare the game a tie to the dissatisfaction of the milwaukee fans selig later said that this call was embarrassing and that he was tremendously saddened by the outcome of the game since  selig subsequently tried to reinvigorate the allstar game by awarding the winning league homefield advantage in the world series the  allstar game had the same us viewership as   rating  share and the ratings declined in   rating  share and   rating  share the american television audience increased in   rating  share disciplinary actionsedit on july   selig suspended texas rangers pitcher kenny rogers for  games and fined him us rogers got in trouble when on june   he purposely grabbed the camera of a cameraman resulting in one camera falling to the ground when the cameraman proceeded to pick up his camera rogers went back to him in an arguably threatening way one of the reporters then resumed filming and rogers knocked him down again while an appeal of his suspension was pending rogers appeared at the  allstar game in detroit where fans loudly booed him on july   selig heard rogers appeal of his suspension selig decided to uphold the  games however an independent arbitrator ruled that selig had exceeded his authority and reduced it to  games but upheld the fine performanceenhancing drugsedit main article  baseball steroids investigation in  selig faced congress on the issue of steroids after the congressional hearings in early  and with the scrutiny of the sports and national media upon this issue selig put forth a proposal for a stricter performanceenhancing drug testing regime to replace the current system this proposal also included the banning of amphetamines a first for the major north american sports leagues the mlb players association and mlb reached an agreement in november on the new policy seligs testimony on the subject has been contradictory in  selig told reporters i never even heard about them steroids until  or  i ran a team and nobody was closer to their players and i never heard any comment from them it wasnt until  or ’ that i heard the discussion but a year later testifying to congress in  selig claimed personal credit for spotting the problem early in  before anybody was really talking about steroids in baseball we proposed a program of testing for such substances to the mlbpa as early as  i began formulating a strategic plan to eliminate the use of performanceenhancing substances from the game during the  alcs oaklands jose canseco had been repeatedly taunted by boston fans with a chant of steroids steroids steroids speaking at the  allstar game selig complained people say ‘well you were slow to react’ we were not slow to react in fact i heard that this morning and it aggravated me all over again by early  selig was forced to deal with the issue of steroid use on march   as a response to the controversy of the use of performanceenhancing drugs and the anticipated career home run record to be set by barry bonds selig asked former us senator george j mitchell to lead an independent investigation into the use of steroids in baseballs recent past joe sheehan from baseball prospectus wrote that the commission has been focusing blame for the era exclusively on uniformed personnel and failing to investigate any role played by team ownership and management much controversy surrounded selig and his involvement in bonds alltime home run record chase for months speculation surrounded selig and the possibility that he and henry aaron would not attend bonds games as he closed in on the record selig announced in july  when bonds was near  home runs that he would attend the games selig was in attendance for bonds recordtying home run against the san diego padres sitting in padres owner john moores private suite when bonds hit his th home run selig refused to applaud bonds accomplishment instead choosing to keep his hands in his pockets and have a look of disdain on his face bud selig also did not attend the san francisco giants game on august  when barry bonds hit his recordbreaking th home run against the washington nationals after the event selig released a statement congratulating bonds on december   former senator mitchell released his report on the use of performanceenhancing substances by mlb players the report names many current and former players who allegedly used performanceenhancing drugs during their career selig has been widely criticized for not taking an active enough role to stem the tide of steroid use in baseball until it had blossomed into a debilitating problem for the industry chicago suntimes columnist jay mariotti called selig the steroids commissioner selig has been called to congress several times to testify on performanceenhancing drug use congressman cliff stearns said in december  that selig should resign because of use of performanceenhancing drugs in baseball during his tenure postseason scheduleedit seligs decision to extend the traditional postseason schedule into november in an attempt to increase nielsen ratings was met with widespread disdain both inside and outside the baseball community mike scioscia manager of the american league west division champion los angeles angels dismissed the decision as ridiculous i don’t know can i say it any clearer than that we should have never had a day off last wednesday we should never have three days off after the season you shouldn’t even have two days off after the season controversiesedit related to the contraction controversy in  rob dibble posted an open letter to bud selig criticizing his actions for benefiting only the milwaukee brewers dibble cites that the contraction of the twins would benefit the brewers as they would potentially claim the twins share of the upper midwest market selig has made some decisions involving the houston astros that were unpopular with their supporters he ordered the roof at minute maid park to be opened for games three and four of the  world series preempting the authority held by the astros the roof was closed for all prior playoff games and similar weather conditions for hurricane ike in  selig mandated that the astros play two home games against the chicago cubs in his hometown of milwaukee despite proximity to the visiting cubs the home ballparks for the texas rangers and atlanta braves were both available to host the games the astros subsequently were victims of a nohitter by carlos zambrano and recorded a single hit in the following game in the midst of the playoff race this decision and its impact deeply affected the playoff race and seedings with eight teams holding winning records at the moment the milwaukee brewers benefited from these events by qualifying in the playoffs as a wild card team only to lose in the nlds to the philadelphia phillies the eventual world series winner in  selig also demanded that the astros move to the american league west as a condition of the sale of the franchise to businessman jim crane the team switched leagues in  in return for  million discount in the purchase price united states bankruptcy judge kevin gross rendered a stern warning to selig in regards to the  los angeles dodgers ownership dispute treating other teams differently in regards to their media contracts drew accusations that selig did not act in good faith with respect to the los angeles dodgers selig rejected the television deal that frank mccourt negotiated that intended to bring the franchise out of bankruptcy claiming mccourt violated the baseball agreement in comparison no action was taken against new york mets owner fred wilpon despite being in a similar position gross stated should the commissioner falter in proving alleged wrongdoing the court may allow lad los angeles dodgers to take further limited discovery some critics have used seligs handling of the dodgers to point out a double standard in treatment of mlb owners more specifically in regards to the mets critics point out that with seligs personal relationship with wilpon has motivated him to stall any possible removal of wilpon as that clubs principal owner selig also notably failed to resolve a year conflict between the san francisco giants and the oakland athletics regarding the athletics proposed move to san jose selig established a blueribbon panel in  to resolve the dispute however despite years to find a resolution the blueribbon panel completely failed to make any progress toward resolving the issue leading san jose to sue mlb the lawsuit which is currently ongoing questions the leagues antitrust exemption and its ability to enforce particular clubs geographic territories term of serviceedit on december
