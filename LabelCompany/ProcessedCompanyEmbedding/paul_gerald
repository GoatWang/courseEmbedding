villa park january   by paul gerald i’ve been to games at  english soccer stadiums and toured about a dozen of them and i think my favorite is villa park home of aston villa football club the players’ tunnel at villa park that’s even more true now that i’ve toured it it’s big it’s old and it’s classy i like their colors i like their tour guides i like the occasional stained glass i like their tradition of having americans play for them including their current goalkeeper all in all i basically can’t get enough of the place even though when i toured there in december  they were about as lockedin to get relegated as a team could be i think they had one win the whole first half of the season i guess that just means tickets will be easier to come by next year even if the crowds will be smaller and the opponents less interesting i have been to a game there by the way — a good one against tottenham last year in which harry kane got the winner and i got a cracking video of it with the spurs fans going wild read that post here i’ve put together this list of frequently asked questions to help you get started planning your soccer adventure i also have a more detailed blog post full of starter tips but now i have something even cooler consulting services here’s a video from the tour walking out into the rainsoaked stadium the lights on the pitch are basically grow lights by the way impressive but they sure mess with a camera’s settings anyway some images from a tour of lovely villa park read all about my english soccer tour and the book i’m working on you might also want to
