methodology as proposed the changes could affect the ratings of gsms gs please see moodys proposes revised approach to rating structured finance interestonly io securities which is available at wwwmoodyscom for more information about the implications of the proposed changes to the methodology on moodys ratings description of models used moodys review used the excelbased cmbs conduit model which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions credit enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type moodys actual and stressed dscr and moodys property quality grade which reflects the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys uses a variation of herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes where a higher number represents greater diversity loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances the credit neutral herf score is  the pool has a herf of  unchanged from moodys securitization when the herf falls below  moodys uses the excelbased large loan model and then reconciles and weights the results from the conduit and large loan models in formulating a rating recommendation the large loan model derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted loanlevel proceeds derived from moodys loanlevel ltv ratios major adjustments to determining proceeds include leverage loan structure and property type moodys also further adjusts these aggregated proceeds for any pooling benefits associated with loan level diversity and other concentrations and correlations deal performance as of the april   distribution date the transactions aggregate certificate balance has decreased by  to  million from  million at
