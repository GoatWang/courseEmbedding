that are attractive as compared to those of traditional public equity and fixed income markets  there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its objective  the investment objective is not fundamental and the board may change the fund’s investment objective without shareholder approval   the fund pursues its investment objective using a multimanager fundoffunds approach by investing predominantly in nonaffiliated collective investment vehicles including privatelyoffered investment funds commonly known as hedge funds and publicly traded funds including exchangetraded funds and mutual funds  underlying funds  which utilize one or more investment or trading strategies including without limitation longonly equity andor fixed income relative value event driven longshort equity andor fixed income managed futures and global macro strategies   table of contents  part a prospectus  underlying funds are managed by other advisors the  underlying fund managers  that invest in or trade in a range of investments that is without limit but may include equities and fixed income securities currencies derivative instruments including but not limited to futures and forward contracts swaps and call and put options and commodities  underlying funds may employ leverage and hedging strategies as well as pay their underlying fund managers performance fees or a performance allocation on gains   the fund invests without restriction as to underlying fund legal entity type market capitalization or country of domicile  the fund also invests without restriction as to the country capitalization credit quality currency or debt maturity and structure of individual securities or derivatives held through underlying funds  the majority of the funds investments will be purchased in private placements and are not publicly traded or are traded in overthecounter markets that have less liquidity than exchangetraded securities  consequently the majority of the funds investments are illiquid   in addition to or in lieu of investing in an underlying fund the advisor may from time to time seek to engage one or more investment subadvisors  any subadvisor chosen by the advisor will be paid by the fund on only the portion of fund assets allocated to each such subadvisor   the advisor and the fund have engaged each of anchor capital advisors llc  anchor capital  and skba capital management llc  skba capital  as subadvisors to the fund   anchor capital intends to invest according to a midcap value oriented investment strategy  anchor capital targets midcap equity securities

meaningful current income by investing in equities with dividend yields in excess of the market   additionally the fund may under limited circumstances invest or trade directly in securities and financial instruments for hedging or liquidity purposes   the advisor believes that the fund’s investment program offers eligible investors the following potential features the spreading of risk across a number of investment strategies underlying fund managers underlying funds and markets professional identification research evaluation selection and monitoring of the services of a select group of traditional and nontraditional underlying fund managers the ability to invest with established underlying fund managers who may be generally unavailable to new investors or who require a minimum account size that is higher than most individual investors would be willing or able to commit to and administrative convenience   investment process  the advisor selects underlying funds that it believes present the best opportunity for achieving longterm riskadjusted returns   the underlying fund selection process begins with an analysis of the record of past underlying fund performance and a thorough understanding of the underlying fund managers and their investment style  the advisor has developed a robust process for evaluating selecting and monitoring underlying fund managers  the advisor currently intends to consider the following factors as part of its screening process for the selection of underlying funds although the factors considered from time to time or with respect to any one or more underlying funds may vary and may include only some or none of the factors listed below or other factors that are not listed below   · underlying fund and underlying fund manager riskadjusted performance over various time periods and market cycles   · underlying fund manager reputation experience stability and training   table of contents  part a prospectus  · underlying fund manager’s articulation of and adherence to its clearly defined investment philosophy   · underlying fund manager’s skill knowledge and use of traditional andor nontraditional investment techniques   · underlying fund manager’s adherence to and effectiveness of its risk management process and   · underlying funds liquidity terms and fee structure   the advisor monitors each underlying fund and maintains contact with each underlying fund manager in order to continually assess its strategy and results  the advisor may redeem from an underlying fund and reallocate assets among other strategies and managers when a better underlying fund becomes available or if an underlying funds performance or management is deemed unsatisfactory   this summary does not contain all of the information that you should consider before investing in the shares  you should review the more detailed information contained or incorporated by reference in this memorandum particularly the information set forth under the heading risk factors   summary of risks   investing in the fund involves risks including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose a significant part of your investment  therefore before investing you should carefully consider the following risks that you assume when you invest in the funds shares  see risk factors  the following describes the indirect risks faced by the fund though investing in underlying funds as well as its direct risks faced by investing directly in securities credit risk   issuers of debt securities may not make scheduled interest and principal payments resulting in losses to the fund  in addition the credit quality of securities held may be lowered if an issuers financial condition changes which may result in the price for such securities declining and losses to the fund   derivatives risk   underlying funds will invest a percentage of their assets in derivatives which may be used for hedging speculation or as substitutes for traditional securities such as futures swaps and options contracts  the use of such derivatives may indirectly expose the fund to additional risks that it would not be subject to if it invested directly in the securities and commodities underlying those derivatives  derivative risks include i imperfect correlation between the changes in market value of derivatives and the securities or indices on which they are based ii illiquidity under certain market conditions iii trading restrictions or limitations imposed by an exchange or government regulations that may restrict trading and iv leverage which will magnify losses  underlying funds may utilize overthecounter derivatives as part of their investment program and to the extent they do they will be subject to counterparty risk ie the risk that the counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with agreed terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract or because of a credit or liquidity problem   emerging markets risk  some underlying funds may invest in securities located in emerging industrialized or less developed countries  risks particularly relevant to such emerging markets may include greater dependence on exports and the corresponding importance of international trade higher risk of inflation more extensive controls on foreign investment and limitations on repatriation of invested capital increased likelihood of governmental involvement in and control over the economies decisions by the relevant government to cease its support of economic reform programs or to impose restrictions and less established laws and regulations regarding fiduciary duties of officers and directors and protection of investors   table of contents  part a prospectus  equity risk   common and preferred stock markets can be volatile  in other words the prices of stocks can fall rapidly in response to developments affecting a specific company or industry or to changing economic political or market conditions  preferred stock prices generally decline when interest rates rise   fixed income risk   typically a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities  recently interest rates have been historically low  current conditions may result in a rise in interest rates which in turn may result in a decline in the value of the fixed income investments  as a result for the present interest rate risk may be heightened   foreign investment risk   foreign investing involves risks not typically associated with us investments including adverse fluctuations in foreign currency values adverse political social and economic developments less liquidity greater volatility less developed or less efficient trading markets political instability and differing auditing and legal standards   high yield risk   lowerquality debt securities known as high yield or junk bonds present greater risk than bonds of higher quality including an increased risk of default  an economic downturn or period of rising interest rates could adversely affect the market for these bonds and reduce the funds ability to sell its bonds  the lack of a liquid market for these bonds could decrease the funds share price  additionally high yield issuers may seek bankruptcy protection which will delay resolution of bond holder claims and may eliminate or materially reduce liquidity   issuer and nondiversification risk   the value of a specific security can perform differently from the market as a whole for reasons related to the investment manager or issuer such as management performance financial leverage and reduced demand for the respective products and services  the funds performance may be more sensitive to any single economic business political or regulatory occurrence because the fund may invest more than  of its total assets in the securities of one or more issuers   leveraging risk   the use of leverage such as borrowing money to purchase securities will cause the fund or an underlying fund to incur additional expenses and significantly magnify losses in the event of underperformance of the assets purchased with borrowed money  underlying funds may employ leverage as part of their strategies and are not limited in the amount of leverage that they may employ   liquidity risk    there is currently no secondary market for the shares and the fund expects that no secondary market will develop  limited liquidity is provided to shareholders only through the funds repurchase offers  there is no guarantee that shareholders will be able to sell all of the shares they desire in a repurchase offer  the funds investments are also subject to liquidity risk because they generally offer only periodic liquidity  limitations on the fund’s ability to liquidate its investments in underlying funds will limit the fund’s ability to repurchase its shares  for example many underlying funds impose minimum hold or lockup periods prior to allowing investors to redeem their interests therein which can be one year or longer  after expiration of the holding period redemptions typically are permitted only on a limited basis such as quarterly semiannually or annually and in certain cases are limited to a specified percentage of the fund’s investment therein  in addition underlying funds may at times elect to suspend completely or limit redemption rights for an indefinite period of time in response to market turmoil or other adverse conditions   management risk   the advisors or any subadvisor’s judgments about the attractiveness value and potential appreciation of securities in which the fund invests may prove to be incorrect and may not produce the desired results  the advisor has no experience managing a closedend fund   market risk   an investment in the funds shares is subject to investment risk including significant loss of the principal amount invested  an investment in the funds shares represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the fund  the value of these securities like other market investments may move up or down sometimes rapidly and unpredictably   table of contents  part a prospectus  relatively new offering with limited operating history    if the fund continues operations under inopportune market or economic conditions it may not be able to achieve its investment objective  the advisor has no prior experience managing a closedend fund  if the fund fails to achieve its estimated size it will be difficult to implement the funds strategy and if the expense limitation agreement as defined below is not renewed expenses will be higher than expected   repurchase policy risks  repurchases by the fund of its shares typically will be funded from sales of portfolio securities or borrowings from a line of credit  however payment for repurchased shares may require the fund to liquidate portfolio holdings earlier than the advisor otherwise would liquidate such holdings potentially resulting in losses and may increase the funds portfolio turnover  if the fund borrows to finance repurchases interest on any such borrowing will negatively affect shareholders who do not tender their shares in a repurchase offer by increasing the funds expenses and reducing any net investment income  the funds repurchase offers are a shareholders only means of liquidity with respect to his or her shares   small and medium capitalization company risk   compared to investment companies that focus only on securities of large capitalization companies the funds nav may be more volatile because it also invests in medium and small capitalization companies  compared to larger companies medium and small capitalization companies are more likely to have i more limited product lines or markets and less mature businesses ii fewer capital resources iii more limited management depth and iv shorter operating histories  further compared to larger companies the securities of small and medium capitalization companies are more likely to be harder to sell   underlying funds risk   fund shareholders will bear two layers of fees and expenses assetbased fees and expenses at the fund level and assetbased fees incentive allocations or fees and expenses at the underlying fund level  underlying funds are subject to liquidity risk valuation risk leverage risk and investors in underlying funds are not afforded the protections of the  act   including custody of assets protections  underlying funds may have limited operating histories underlying funds are subject to specific investment strategybased risks such as shortselling depending on the nature of the fund  short selling is inherently leveraged and may result in significant losses if securities sold short increase in value  underlying funds may concentrate their investments in a particular industry or economic sector to the extent an underlying fund invests a significant portion of its assets in securities of companies in the same industry or economic sector such underlying fund is more susceptible to economic political regulatory and other occurrences influencing that industry or sector there is no guarantee that any of the trading strategies used by an underlying fund manager will be profitable or avoid losses   investment advisor subadvisors and

offering expenses but excluding interest brokerage commissions extraordinary expenses and the fees of any subadvisor to the fund and underlying fund fees and expenses to the extent that they exceed  per annum of the funds average monthly net assets through july   the  expense limitation   in consideration of the advisors agreement to limit expenses the fund has agreed to repay the advisor in the amount of any fees waived and fund expenses paid or absorbed subject to the limitations that  the reimbursement for fees and expenses will be made only if payable not more than three years from the end of the fiscal year in which they were incurred and  the reimbursement may not be made if it would cause the expense limitation to be exceeded  the expense limitation agreement will remain in effect at least until july   unless the board approves its modification or termination  after july   the expense limitation agreement may be renewed upon the mutual agreement of the advisor and the board in their sole discretion  see management of the fund below   table of contents  part a prospectus  conflicts of interest   as a general matter certain conflicts of interest may arise in connection with a portfolio managers management of a funds investments on the one hand and the investments of other accounts for which the portfolio manager is responsible on the other  for example it is possible that the various accounts managed could have different investment strategies that at times might conflict with one another to the possible detriment of the fund  alternatively to the extent that the same investment opportunities might be desirable for more than one account possible conflicts could arise in determining how to allocate them  the advisor has adopted policies and procedures and structured portfolio manager compensation in a manner reasonably designed to safeguard the fund from being negatively affected as a result of any such potential conflicts

fund shares typically trade in the secondary market via a stock exchange  unlike many closedend funds however the funds shares will not be listed on a stock exchange  instead the fund will provide limited liquidity to shareholders by offering to repurchase a limited amount of shares generally up to  quarterly which is discussed in more detail below  investors in the fund will not be permitted to redeem their investment in the fund outside of the fund’s repurchase program which may be temporarily suspended by the board  additionally shares may only be transferred in limited circumstances

shares of the fund is determined monthly as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange nyse normally  pm eastern time on the last business day of each calendar month  the funds board has approved procedures pursuant to which the fund will value its investments in underlying funds at fair value  in accordance with these procedures fair value as of the last business day of each calendar month ordinarily will be the value most recently determined and reported to the fund by each underlying fund in accordance with the underlying funds valuation policies  as a general matter the fair value of the funds interest in an underlying fund will represent the amount that the fund could reasonably expect to receive from an underlying fund if the funds interest were redeemed at the time of valuation based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that the fund believes to be reliable  prior to investing in any underlying fund the advisor will conduct a due diligence review of the valuation methodology utilized by the underlying fund which as a general matter will utilize market values when available and otherwise utilize principles of fair value that the advisor reasonably believes to be consistent with those used by the fund for valuing its own investments  in addition the procedures approved by the board provide in part that the advisor will review the valuations provided by the managers to the underlying funds  however neither the advisor nor the board will be able to confirm independently the accuracy of valuations provided by such underlying fund managers which are unaudited  accordingly the valuations of the underlying fund managers generally will be relied upon by the fund in addition the net asset values and other valuation information received from the underlying funds will typically be subject to revision through the end of each underlying funds annual audit  other securities held by the fund will be valued at current market values determined on the basis of market quotations if available see determination of net asset value below   distribution policy    the fund has no present intention of making periodic distributions of net income or gains if any to investors  the amount and times of distributions if any will be determined in the sole discretion of the board  whether or not distributions are made investors will be required each year to report their distributive share of the fund’s taxable income or loss on their individual tax filings   repurchases of shares   shareholders do not have the right to require the fund to redeem their shares  however the fund may from time to time provide liquidity to shareholders by offering to repurchase shares pursuant to written tender offers  repurchases will be made at such times in such amounts and on such terms as may be determined by the board in its sole discretion  the advisor expects that generally it will recommend to the board that the fund offer to repurchase up to  of shares from shareholders on a quarterly basis with such repurchases to occur as of the first business day following each march  june  september  and december  based upon among other things the liquidity of the fund’s assets  each repurchase offer will generally commence approximately  days prior to the applicable repurchase date  if a repurchase offer is oversubscribed by shareholders who tender shares the fund may extend the repurchase offer if necessary and increase the amount of shares that the fund is offering to purchase to an amount it believes sufficient to accommodate the excess shares tendered as well as any shares tendered during the extended offer repurchase a pro rata portion of the shares tendered or take any other action permitted by applicable law  in addition the fund may repurchase shares of certain shareholders if among other reasons the fund determines that such repurchase would be in the interest of the fund  underlying funds may impose minimum hold or lockup periods prior to allowing investors to redeem their interests therein which can be one year or longer  after expiration of the holding period redemptions typically are permitted only on a limited basis such as quarterly semiannually or annually and in certain cases are limited to a specified percentage of the fund’s investment therein  in addition underlying funds may at times elect to suspend completely or limit redemption rights for an indefinite period of time in response to market turmoil or other adverse conditions  because of these limitations and restrictions the fund may not be able to liquidate its holdings in these underlying funds to meet repurchase requests  as a result the fund may not be able to offer liquidity to shareholders through repurchase offers  furthermore if the fund seeks to liquidate its investment in an underlying fund that maintains a side pocket in general a type of account utilized by private funds to segregate illiquid assets from those that have more liquidity the fund may not be able to fully liquidate its investment without delay and such delay could be substantial  accordingly the fund may need to suspend or postpone repurchase offers if it is not able to dispose of its interests in underlying funds in a timely manner  additionally the board may temporarily suspend the repurchase program at any time and shareholders cannot require the fund to repurchase their shares  see repurchases of shares below   table of contents  part a prospectus  the board will typically consider the following factors among others in making its repurchase determination i whether any shareholders have requested that the fund repurchase their shares ii the liquidity of the fund’s assets iii the investment plans and working capital requirements of the fund iv the relative economies of scale with respect to the size of the fund v the history of the fund in repurchasing shares vi the condition of the securities markets and vii the anticipated tax consequences of any proposed repurchases of shares   although the fund intends to engage in periodic repurchases as described herein no assurances can be given that such repurchases will occur or that any shares you tender will be repurchased  if the fund does not at least once during any month period offer to repurchase any of the shares tendered in accordance with the procedures determined by the board from time to time the board will call a meeting of shareholders for the purpose of determining whether the fund should be

fund   the fund is a continuously offered nondiversified closedend management investment company  the fund was organized as a delaware statutory trust on january    the fund privately offers and sells its shares in large minimum denominations to certain investors each such eligible investor a  shareholder   the fund makes periodic tender offers generally up to  quarterly of its shares or at such times and in such amounts as the board may determine  the board may temporarily suspend this repurchase program at any time and shareholders cannot require the fund to repurchase their shares  the

monthly offering of shares will be invested in accordance with the funds investment objective and policies as stated below as soon as practicable after each closing date  the fund will pay the organizational costs and offering expenses incurred with respect to its initial and continuous offering less amounts advanced pursuant to the expense limitation agreement  pending investment of the net proceeds in accordance with the funds investment objective and policies the fund will invest up to  of its assets in cash money market or shortterm fixedincome funds  shareholders should expect therefore that before the fund has fully invested the proceeds of the offering in accordance with its investment objective and policies the funds assets would earn interest income at the then prevailing rates   structure   the fund is a specialized investment vehicle that combines many of the features of an investment fund not registered under the  act often referred to as a private investment fund or a hedge fund with those of a registered closedend investment fund  the fund is similar to a private investment fund in that it will be actively managed and shares will be sold in relatively large minimum denominations in private placements solely to eligible investors  in addition managers of underlying funds will typically be entitled to receive incentivebased compensation  unlike many private investment funds however the fund as a registered closedend investment fund can offer shares without limiting the number of eligible investors that can participate in its investment program  the structure of the fund is designed to permit sophisticated investors that desire to invest in a portfolio of investment funds to do so without making the more substantial capital commitment that would be required to invest directly in multiple investment funds and without subjecting the fund to the limitations on the number of eligible investors faced by many of those funds   investment objective policies and strategies the funds investment objective is to seek longterm riskadjusted returns that are attractive as compared to those of traditional public equity and fixed income markets  there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its objective  the investment objective is not fundamental and the board may change the funds investment objective without shareholder approval   the fund pursues its investment objective using a multimanager fundoffunds approach by investing predominantly in nonaffiliated collective investment vehicles including privatelyoffered investment funds commonly known as hedge funds and publicly traded funds including exchangetraded funds and mutual funds  underlying funds  which utilize one or more investment or trading strategies including without limitation longonly equity andor fixed income relative value event driven longshort equity andor fixed income managed futures and global macro strategies   underlying funds are managed by outside parties the  underlying fund managers  that invest in or trade in a range of investments that is without limit but may include equities and fixed income securities currencies derivative instruments including but not limited to futures and forward contracts swaps and call and put options and commodities  underlying funds may employ leverage and hedging strategies as well as pay their underlying fund managers performance fees or a performance allocation on gains   the fund invests without restriction as to underlying fund legal entity type market capitalization or country of domicile  the fund also invests without restriction as to the country capitalization credit quality currency or debt maturity and structure of individual securities or derivatives held through underlying funds  the majority of the funds investments will be purchased in private placements and are not publicly traded or are traded in overthecounter markets that have less liquidity than exchangetraded securities  consequently the majority of the funds investments are illiquid   table of contents  part a prospectus  in addition to or in lieu of investing in an underlying fund the advisor may from time to time seek to engage one or more investment subadvisors  any subadvisor chosen by the advisor will be paid by the fund on only the portion of fund assets allocated to any such subadvisor   the fund has engaged anchor capital and skba capital as subadvisors   anchor capital intends to invest according to a midcap valueoriented investment strategy  anchor capital targets midcap equity securities stocks with market capitalizations between  billion and  billion which its investment committee believes provide a strong business outlook at attractive prices   skba capital intends to invest according to a valueoriented investment strategy and seeks to achieve longterm capital appreciation by investing in what they believe are undervalued equity securities  skba capitals strategy is also designed to provide meaningful current income by investing in equities with dividend yields in excess of the market   additionally the fund may under limited circumstances invest or trade directly in securities and financial instruments for hedging or liquidity purposes   the advisor believes that the funds investment program offers eligible investors the following potential features the spreading of risk across a number of investment strategies underlying fund managers underlying funds and markets professional identification research evaluation selection and monitoring of the services of a select group of underlying fund managers the ability to invest with established underlying fund managers who may be generally unavailable to new investors or who require a minimum account size that is higher than most individual investors would be willing or able to commit to and administrative convenience   investment process the advisor selects underlying funds that it believes present the best opportunity for achieving longterm riskadjusted returns   selection   the underlying fund selection process begins with an analysis of the record of past underlying fund performance and a thorough understanding of the underlying fund managers and their investment style  the advisor has developed a robust process for evaluating selecting and monitoring underlying fund managers   the advisor currently intends to consider the following factors as part of its screening process for the selection of underlying funds although the factors considered from time to time or with respect to any one or more underlying funds may vary and may include only some or none of the factors listed below or other factors that are not listed below   · underlying fund and underlying fund managers risk adjusted performance over various time periods and market cycles   · underlying fund managers reputation experience stability and training   · underlying fund managers articulation of and adherence to its clearly defined investment philosophy   table of contents  part a prospectus  · underlying fund managers skill knowledge and use of traditional andor nontraditional investment techniques   · underlying fund managers adherence to and effectiveness of its risk management process and   · underlying funds liquidity terms and fee structure   attractive longterm riskadjusted investment performance   the advisor seeks to choose underlying fund managers that it believes will produce attractive longterm riskadjusted performance returns over a full market cycle   clearly defined investment philosophy   the advisors experience is that understanding an underlying fund managers investment philosophy not only allows a better understanding of that underlying fund managers expected rate of return but it will also advance the funds overall portfolio construction  generally the more clearly defined the investment philosophy the more comfortable the advisor is with its decision to invest the funds assets with a given underlying fund manager   management stability and committed investment professionals   the advisor believes the ability to generate attractive riskadjusted returns over a full market cycle especially when the application of sophisticated nontraditional investment techniques is involved is dependent upon the performance of committed investment professionals  no matter how appealing the investment concept attractive riskadjusted returns can only be generated by committed people operating in a stable environment   skilled application of nontraditional investment techniques   the advisor believes that attractive riskadjusted investment returns can sometimes be found outside traditional investment strategies that rely on relative performance against public market equity and fixed income benchmarks  where applicable the fund generally invests its assets with underlying fund managers who use nontraditional investment approaches which often seek to take advantage of market inefficiencies and other factors in order to outperform the underlying markets of their investments monitoring   once selected the performance of each underlying fund manager is regularly reviewed and new underlying fund managers are identified and considered on an ongoing basis  additionally the allocation of the funds assets among underlying funds underlying fund managers approaches and styles will be regularly monitored and when required by performance results or changing economic conditions adjusted  ongoing monitoring activities to be performed by the advisor may include   · review current status and developments in underlying funds and their investments   · monitor changes in underlying fund portfolio management teams   · attend conference calls andor meetings with underlying fund managers   · monitor underlying fund managers for compliance with applicable terms and conditions and   table of contents  part a prospectus  · monitor underlying fund managers for strategy drift   the advisor monitors each underlying fund and maintains contact with each underlying fund manager in order to continually assess its strategy and results  the advisor may redeem from an underlying fund and reallocate assets among other strategies and managers when a better underlying fund or strategy becomes available or if an underlying funds performance or underlying fund manager is deemed unsatisfactory   underlying fund strategies   the underlying fund managers employ a variety of investment strategies to generate investment returns  underlying funds may employ leverage and derivativesbased or securitiesbased hedging strategies  although the scope of underlying funds strategies is wide and new strategies in which the fund may invest may emerge in the future the target strategies of the fund presently include but are not limited to the following strategies   relative value   relative value strategies attempt to take advantage of relative pricing discrepancies between various instruments including equities fixed income options and futures  underlying fund managers may use mathematical fundamental or technical analysis to determine misvaluations  securities may be mispriced relative to an underlying security related securities groups of securities or the overall market  relative value investments may be available only cyclically or not at all  furthermore if assumptions used in the research and analysis of relative value investments are incorrect or if the model used to evaluate such investments is flawed relative value strategies may be unsuccessful  substrategies include without limitation the following   equity market neutral or statistical arbitrage  underlying funds that employ equity market neutral or statistical arbitrage strategies purchase certain equity securities and simultaneously sell short other equity securities in an attempt to isolate risk to the relative value of one security or basket of securities as compared to another security or basket of securities and eliminate general market risk  generally underlying fund managers that use fundamental analysis to establish the relative values of the securities in their portfolios are categorized as equity market neutral while those who use quantitative models to establish the relative values are categorized as statistical arbitrage   capital structure arbitrage is utilized by underlying fund managers to exploit perceived pricing inefficiencies within a companys capital structure  an underlying fund manager employing capital structure arbitrage analyzes the various securities issued by a company including common and preferred equity convertible securities various forms of senior and junior typically unsecured fixed income and then establishes a long position in a security that is more attractive on a relative basis to another security in which a short position is established  in a successful trade the long security appreciates in price relative to the shorted security and the underlying fund manager then closes the trade at a profit  this strategy is market neutral because it can be profitable even if both securities decline in value as long as the shorted security declines more than the purchased security  companies that are distressed are often targets of this strategy because of the potential for significantly different recovery values for different types of securities in the event of a bankruptcy but healthy companies with complex balance sheets are also fertile ground for capital structure arbitrage trades   convertible arbitrage involves the purchase of a convertible fixed income or preferred equity instrument an instrument that is effectively a bond or has a fixed obligation of repayment with an embedded equity option nondetachable warrant or equitylinked or equityindexed note concurrent with the short sale of or a short overthecounter derivative position in the common stock of the issuer of such fixed income instrument  investment returns are driven by a combination of an attractive coupon or dividend yield interest on the short position and the level of the underlying stocks volatility which directly affects the option value of the securitys conversion feature   table of contents  part a prospectus  volatility arbitrage entails the use of derivative investments and can be used on both a standalone basis and as a hedging strategy in conjunction with other investment strategies as a standalone strategy domestic or global single security options index options andor options on futures contracts are used to exploit anomalies in the pricing of volatility in related assets  there are several welldefined related securities andor asset classes that volatility arbitrage underlying fund managers typically follow to determine when they are out of their historical trading ranges  by continually monitoring these relationships an underlying fund manager can identify when the securities or asset classes trade out of their normal trading range and can put a trade on when there has not been a fundamental or exogenous change in the relationship  as an adjunct strategy these same derivative instruments can be used to manage risk and enhance returns on investments made utilizing other strategies  use of derivatives often relies on extensive quantitative modeling volatility estimation and proprietary inhouse trading models   fixed income arbitrage is designed to identify and exploit anomalous typically based on historical trading ranges spreads in the prices of functionally equivalent or substitutable securities  such disparities or spreads are often created by imbalances in supply and demand of different types of issues for example us government agency securities relative to us treasuries  an example of a fixed income arbitrage position consists of a long position in the higher yielding and therefore lower priced security and a short position in the lower yielding higher priced security  for example us government agency securities of a similar duration to us treasuries have over time established a relatively welldefined trading range and carry a higher interest rate or yield  when us government agency securities trade at a discount to this range eg when there is discussion about whether us government agency securities should continue to receive a us government guarantee us government agency securities will trade at a higher than normal discount to us treasuries reflected by a higher current yield in us government agency securities  accordingly an underlying fund manager may buy the us government agency securities and then short the us treasuries  if the spread narrows or becomes more in line with historical norms the underlying fund manager generates a profit by closing its position  in general these fixed income investments are structured with the expectation that they will be nondirectional and independent of the absolute levels of interest rates  as this interest rate exposure is hedged out these strategies generally exhibit little to no correlation to the broader equity and bond markets  there can be no assurance that any such hedging techniques will be successful or that the hedging employed by an underlying fund manager will not have the negative effect of lowering overall returns or creating losses in the portfolio or with respect to the applicable position  investment banks may allow an underlying fund to use significant leverage in these positions particularly if the instruments are investment grade corporate securities or government securities  depending on the level of leverage and the duration of the positions the resulting loss of capital could be significant   event driven   eventdriven strategies are designed to profit from changes in the prices of securities of companies facing a major corporate event  the goal of an eventdriven strategy is to identify securities which may include common or preferred stock as well as many types of fixed income with a favorable riskreward ratio based on the probability that a particular event will occur  such events include mergers and acquisitions as well as restructurings spinoffs and significant litigation eg tobacco or patent litigation  substrategies include without limitation the following   merger or risk arbitrage involves taking short and long investment positions respectively in the stock of acquiring and target companies upon the announcement of an acquisition offer acquisitions are typically paid for in stock cash or a combination thereof thus when an acquisition is announced the acquiring company acquirer will establish a price per share of the company being acquired target in cash per share cash price stock a share ratio is established or a combination thereof  typically the target traded for less than the price being paid in either cash or stock prior to the announcement when the announcement is made the targets stock price will typically increase but still trade at a discount to the price being offered by the acquirer this discount – and the size of the discount – is principally a function of three factors a the risk that the acquisition will close b the timeframe for closing ie the time value of money and c the amount of liquidity or capital being deployed by merger arbitrageurs and other investors accordingly if a merger arbitrageur or investor believes that the risk of the acquisition not closing is not significant relative to the returns that can be generated by the spread between the current stock price of the target and the price being offered by the acquirer the merger arbitrageur or investor will generally buy shares of the target and short shares of the acquirer in a stock for stock transaction when the deal closes the risk premium vanishes and the profit is the spread this strategy is somewhat cyclical since it requires a supply of corporate mergers and acquisitions to deploy capital   table of contents  part a prospectus  distressed or special situation investments include investments in securities issued by companies that are experiencing difficult business conditions including bankruptcy in many cases securities issued by such companies overcorrect and trade at levels below their value in a liquidation or acquisition scenario special situations investments are similar to distressed investments in that they are typically made in securities that the buyer perceives to be undervalued for one reason or another however these companies are not in and do not appear to be on the brink of bankruptcy an example of a special situations trade is the purchase of a security issued by a company that an underlying fund manager believes is a likely acquisition target   substantial transaction failure risks are involved in eventdriven strategies  similarly substantial risks are involved in investments in companies facing negative publicity or uncertain litigation thus there can be no assurance that any expected transaction will take place that negative publicity will not continue to affect a company or that litigation will be resolved in a companys favor certain transactions are dependent on one or more factors to become effective such as market conditions which may lead to unexpected positive or negative changes in a company profile shareholder approval regulatory and various other third party constraints changes in earnings or business lines or shareholder activism as well as many other factors  no assurance can be given that the transactions entered into will result in a profitable investment or that it will not result in substantial losses   longshort equity and fixed income   longshort equityfixed income strategies generally seek to produce returns from investments in the global equity andor fixed income markets  these strategies are generally focused on absolute returns and the trades implemented in the strategy generally capitalize on the underlying fund managers views and outlooks for specific markets regions sectors or securities while these strategies involve both long and short positions in various equity andor fixed income securities the underlying fund managers positions will generally reflect a specific view about the direction of a market  unlike traditional equity or fixed income funds the directional view relates less to the absolute direction of the market and more toward the specific positions longs versus shorts held within a portfolio nonetheless an underlying fund manager may take a directional position that relates to the absolute direction of the market  in addition to making shifts in markets regions sectors or securities underlying fund managers have the flexibility to shift from a net long to a net short position but in general will maintain a net long exposure  an exception is for those underlying fund managers that are classified as short sellers who maintain a consistent net short exposure in their portfolio meaning that significantly more capital supports short positions than is invested in long positions if any is invested in long positions at all  unlike long positions which one expects to rise in value short positions are taken in those securities the portfolio manager anticipates will decrease in value  longshort equityfixed income underlying fund managers may be generalists or may specialize in various areas including but not limited to market sectors geographies or a certain segment of the market  there can be no assurance that the valuation assumptions utilized in establishing a long andor short position in a particular security will prove to be correct or that the strategy will be implemented correctly   long equity and fixed income   similar to longshort equity andor fixed income described above underlying fund managers employing this strategy generally do not engage in short selling or hedging of the market risks associated with their investments but rather inherent in these strategies is the risk associated with the equity andor fixed income markets as a whole in addition to the risks described in longshort equity and fixed income described above  in certain instances an underlying fund manager may raise cash as a means of taking a negative view on the market in an attempt to mitigate a portion of the market risk associated with this strategy   table of contents  part a prospectus  managed futures   managed futures strategies involve speculative trading in futures forwards and options thereon  underlying fund managers may trade portfolios of instruments in us and nonus markets in an effort to capture passive risk premiums and attempt to profit from anticipated trends in market prices these underlying fund managers generally rely on either technical or fundamental analysis or a combination thereof in making trading decisions and attempting to identify price trends they may attempt to structure a diversified portfolio of liquid futures contracts including but not limited to stock index interest rate metals energy and agricultural futures markets  participation in a market that is either volatile or trendless could produce substantial losses for an underlying fund  failure to identify trends or to exit a market position after a trend matures could also produce substantial losses for an underlying fund   global macro   global macro strategies typically seek to generate income andor capital appreciation through a portfolio of investments focused on macroeconomic opportunities across numerous markets and instruments  these strategies rely on the use of among other things cash and derivative markets each of which bear their own risks as well as certain assumptions about global macroeconomic trends there can be no assurance that such macroeconomic assumptions will prove to be correct  global macro managers may employ relative value event driven longshort and other strategies or trading approaches  trading positions are generally held both long andor short in both us and nonus markets global macro strategies are generally categorized as either discretionary or systematic in nature and may assume aggressive investment postures with respect to position concentrations use of leverage portfolio turnover and the various investment instruments used   the descriptions above reflect the advisors current expectations regarding the strategies that may be used by the underlying funds in which the fund plans to invest an underlying fund manager has significant latitude when managing an underlying fund it oversees and the underlying fund manager could make changes to the strategy used by an underlying fund or the way the strategy is implemented while the fund is invested in the underlying fund   the fund may invest in securities and utilize financial instruments including but not limited to forward contracts currency options and interest rate swaps caps and floors for hedging purposes i in order to protect against possible changes in the market value of portfolio positions resulting from fluctuations in the securities markets and changes in interest rates ii in order to protect the unrealized gains in the value of portfolio positions iii in order to facilitate the sale of any such investments iv enhance or preserve returns spreads or gains on any investment in a portfolio v in order to hedge the interest rate or currency exchange rate on any liabilities or assets vi in order to protect against any increase in the price of any securities which purchase is anticipated at a later date or vii for any other reason that usca deems appropriate the fund may also use derivatives principally put options and futures contracts and make direct investments to obtain market exposure  the fund can use both europeanstyle and americanstyle options  the fund may purchase and sell both exchange traded and overthecounter options   this memorandum contains a list of the fundamental those that may not be changed without a shareholder vote investment policies of the fund under the heading investment objective and policies   other information regarding investment strategy   the fund may from time to time take defensive positions that are inconsistent with the funds principal investment strategy in attempting to respond to adverse market economic political or other conditions during such times the advisor may determine that the fund should invest up to  of its assets in cash or cash equivalents including money market instruments prime commercial paper repurchase agreements treasury bills and other shortterm obligations of the us government its agencies or instrumentalities  in these and in other cases the fund may not achieve its investment objective  the advisor may invest the funds cash balances in any investments they deem appropriate  the advisor expects that such investments will be made without limitation and as permitted under the  act in money market funds repurchase agreements us treasury and us government agency securities municipal bonds and bank accounts  any income earned from such investments is ordinarily reinvested by the fund in accordance with its investment program  notwithstanding the foregoing given the illiquid nature of the funds investments in underlying funds the funds ability to take defensive positions may be substantially limited  many of the considerations entering into recommendations and decisions of the advisor and the funds portfolio managers are subjective   table of contents  part a prospectus  the fund has no current intent to sell securities short although underlying funds may do so  the fund does not intend to use leverage through issuing preferred shares or issuing debt instruments  however the board may decide to issue preferred shares or issue debt instruments in the future subject to the asset coverage requirements of the  act  the fund may borrow for investment purposes for temporary liquidity or to finance repurchases of its shares as permitted under the  act  in addition the fund may be deemed to incur economic leverage embedded in instruments in which it may invest for example the fund may utilize options or futures to obtain exposure to a security or market at a fraction of the cost ie the premium or margin that the fund would otherwise have invested had it chosen to invest directly in that security or market   the frequency and amount of portfolio purchases and sales known as the portfolio turnover rate will vary from year to year the portfolio turnover rate is not expected to exceed  but may vary greatly from year to year and will not be a limiting factor when the advisor deems portfolio changes appropriate  although the fund generally does not intend to trade for shortterm profits the fund may engage in shortterm trading strategies and securities may be sold without regard to the length of time held when in the opinion of the advisor investment considerations warrant such action  these policies may have the effect of increasing the annual rate of portfolio turnover of the fund  higher rates of portfolio turnover would likely result in higher brokerage or placement agent commissions and may generate shortterm capital gains taxable as ordinary income  see tax status   risk factors   an investment in the funds shares is subject to risks  the value of the funds investments will increase or decrease based on changes in the prices of the investments it holds  this will cause the value of the funds shares to increase or decrease  you could lose money by investing in the fund  by itself the fund does not constitute a complete investment program  before investing in the fund you should carefully consider the following risks the fund faces through its investments in underlying funds as well as its direct risks   faced by investing directly in securities  there may be additional risks that the fund does not currently foresee or consider material  you may wish to consult with your legal or tax advisors before deciding whether to invest in the fund   credit risk   there is a risk that debt issuers or obligors will not make payments resulting in losses to the fund  in addition the credit quality of securities may be lowered if an issuers financial condition changes which may result in the price for such securities declining and losses to the fund  lower credit quality may lead to greater volatility in the price of a security and in shares of the fund  lower credit quality also may affect liquidity and make it difficult to sell the security  default or the markets perception that an issuer is likely to default could reduce the value and liquidity of securities thereby reducing the value of your investment in fund shares  in addition default may cause the fund to incur expenses in seeking recovery of principal or interest on its portfolio holdings   derivatives risk   underlying funds may invest a percentage of their assets in derivatives such as futures and options contracts the use of such derivatives may expose the fund to additional risks to which it would not be subject if it invested directly in the securities and commodities underlying those derivatives  the risks associated with the underlying funds and indirectly the funds use of futures swaps and options contracts include   table of contents  part a prospectus  · experiencing losses that exceed losses experienced by funds that do not use derivatives   · there may be an imperfect correlation between the changes in market value of the securities held and the prices of derivatives   · although futures and options contracts are generally liquid instruments under certain market conditions there may not always be a liquid secondary market as a result the underlying fund may be unable to close out its contracts at a time which is advantageous   · trading restrictions or limitations may be imposed by an exchange and government regulations may restrict trading in derivatives   · because option premiums paid or received by the underlying fund are small in relation to the market value of the investments underlying the options buying and selling put and call options can be more speculative than investing directly in securities   · counterparties to overthecounter derivatives such as most swaps and certain options may default resulting in losses   underlying funds may utilize overthecounter derivatives as part of their investment program and to the extent they do they will be subject to counterparty risk ie the risk that the counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with agreed terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract or because of a credit or liquidity problem   emerging markets risk  some underlying funds may invest in securities located in emerging industrialized or less developed countries risks particularly relevant to such emerging markets may include greater dependence on exports and the corresponding importance of international trade higher risk of inflation more extensive controls on foreign investment and limitations on repatriation of invested capital increased likelihood of governmental involvement in and control over the economies decisions by the relevant government to cease its support of economic reform programs or to impose restrictions and less established laws and regulations regarding fiduciary duties of officers and directors and protection of investors   equity risk   common and preferred stock markets can be volatile in other words the prices of equity securities can fall rapidly in response to developments affecting a specific company or industry or to changing economic political or market conditions  the funds investments may decline in value if the equity markets perform poorly  there is also a risk that the funds investments will underperform either the securities markets generally or particular segments of the securities markets  market prices of equity securities in broad market segments may be adversely affected by a prominent issuer having experienced losses by the lack of earnings by an issuers failure to meet the markets expectations with respect to new products or services or even by factors wholly unrelated to the value or condition of the issuer such as changes in interest rates  preferred stocks pay a fixed stream of income to investors and this income stream is a primary source of the longterm investment return on preferred stocks  as a result the market value of preferred stocks is generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the market value of common stocks  in this respect preferred stocks share many investment characteristics with debt securities   fixed income risk   when the fund invests in fixed income securities or obligations the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate with changes in interest rates  recently interest rates have been historically low  current conditions may result in a rise in interest rates which in turn may result in a decline in the value of the fixed income investments  as a result for the present interest rate risk may be heightened  typically a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities in general the market price of debt securities with longer maturities will increase or decrease more in response to changes in interest rates than shorterterm securities  other risk factors include credit risk the debtor may default and prepayment risk the debtor may pay its obligation early reducing the amount of interest payments  these risks could affect the value of a particular investment possibly causing the funds share price and total return to be reduced and fluctuate more than other types of investments   table of contents  part a prospectus  foreign investment risk   foreign investing involves risks not typically associated with us investments including adverse fluctuations in foreign currency values adverse political social and economic developments less liquidity greater volatility less developed or less efficient trading markets political instability and differing auditing and legal standards  investing in emerging markets imposes risks different from or greater than risks of investing in foreign developed countries  currency market risk results from the price movement of foreign currency values in response to shifting market supply and demand  interest rate risk arises whenever a country changes its stated interest rate target associated with its currency  country risk arises because virtually every country has interfered with international transactions in its currency interference has taken the form of regulation of the local exchange market restrictions on foreign investment by residents or limits on inflows of investment funds from abroad  restrictions on the exchange market or on international transactions are intended to affect the level or movement of the exchange rate this risk could include the country issuing a new currency effectively making the old currency worthless   high yield risk    lowerquality bonds known as high yield or junk bonds present a significant risk for loss of principal and interest  these bonds offer the potential for higher return but also involve greater risk than bonds of higher quality including an increased possibility that the bonds issuer obligor or guarantor may not be able to make its payments of interest and principal  if that happens the value of the bond may decrease the funds share price may decrease and its income may be reduced  an economic downturn or period of rising interest rates could adversely affect the market for these bonds and reduce the funds ability to sell its bonds  such securities also may include rule a securities which are subject to resale restrictions  the lack of a liquid market for these bonds could decrease the funds share price   issuer and nondiversification risk   the value of a specific security can perform differently from the market as a whole for reasons related to the investment manager or issuer such as management performance financial leverage and reduced demand for the respective products and services  the funds performance may be more sensitive to any single economic business political or regulatory occurrence than the value of shares of a diversified investment company because as a nondiversified fund the fund may invest more than  of its total assets in the securities of one or more issuers   leveraging risk   the use of leverage such as borrowing money to purchase properties or securities will cause the fund or an underlying funds to incur additional expenses and significantly magnify losses in the event of underperformance of the assets purchased with borrowed money  generally the use of leverage also will cause the fund or an underlying fund to have higher expenses primarily interest expenses than those of funds that do not use such techniques  in addition a lender may terminate or refuse to renew any credit facility  if the fund or an underlying fund is unable to access additional credit it may be forced to sell investments at inopportune times which may further depress the returns of the fund underlying funds may employ unlimited leverage as part of their strategies   liquidity risk    the fund is structured as a nondiversified closedend management investment company designed primarily for longterm investors and is not intended to be a trading vehicle an investor should not invest in the fund if the investor needs a liquid investment closedend funds differ from openend management investment companies commonly known as mutual funds in that investors in a closedend fund do not have the right to redeem their shares on a daily basis at a price based on net asset value   unlike many closedend investment companies the funds shares are not listed on any securities exchange and are not publicly traded there is currently no secondary market for the shares and the fund will not support a secondary market and does not expect that a secondary market will develop  limited liquidity is provided to shareholders only through the funds repurchase offers there is no guarantee that shareholders will be able to sell all of the shares they desire in a repurchase offer  the funds investments are also subject to liquidity risk  liquidity risk exists when particular investments of the fund would be difficult to purchase or sell possibly preventing the fund from selling such illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price or possibly requiring the fund to dispose of other investments at unfavorable times or prices in order to satisfy its obligations limitations on the funds ability to liquidate its investments in underlying funds will limit the funds ability to repurchase its shares  for example many underlying funds impose minimum hold or lockup periods prior to allowing investors to redeem their interests therein which can be one year or longer  after expiration of the holding period redemptions typically are permitted only on a limited basis such as quarterly semiannually or annually and in certain cases are limited to a specified percentage of the funds investment therein  in addition underlying funds may at times elect to suspend completely or limit redemption rights for an indefinite period of time in response to market turmoil or other adverse conditions   table of contents  part a prospectus  management risk   the advisors judgments about the attractiveness value and potential appreciation of securities in which the fund invests may prove to be incorrect and may not produce the desired results  the advisor has no prior experience managing a closedend fund  the advisors investment strategy is subject to risk because underlying funds may have lower andor more volatile returns than other types of investments  the advisors allocation of assets between underlying funds may not produce the desired returns   market risk   an investment in the funds shares is subject to investment risk including significant loss of the principal amount invested  an investment in the funds shares represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the fund  the value of these securities like other market investments may move up or down sometimes rapidly and unpredictably  underlying fund investments may be more volatile andor lower than other segments of the securities market   relatively new offering with limited operating history    if the fund continues operations under inopportune market or economic conditions it may not be able to achieve its investment objective  the advisor has no prior experience managing a closedend fund  if the fund fails to achieve its estimated size and the expense limitation agreement is not renewed expenses will be higher than expected  in addition it may be difficult to implement the funds strategy unless the fund raises a meaningful amount of assets  the fund and its advisor are subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by the investment company act of  as amended and the internal revenue code that do not apply to management of individual and institutional accounts and funds   repurchase policy risks  quarterly repurchases by the fund of its shares typically will be funded from available cash or sales of portfolio securities or through a line of credit  however payment for repurchased shares may require the fund to liquidate portfolio holdings earlier than the advisor otherwise would liquidate such holdings potentially resulting in losses and may increase the funds portfolio turnover the advisor may take measures to attempt to avoid or minimize such potential losses and turnover and instead of liquidating portfolio holdings may borrow money to finance repurchases of shares if the fund borrows to finance repurchases interest on any such borrowing will negatively affect shareholders who do not tender their shares in a repurchase offer by increasing the funds expenses and reducing any net investment income to the extent the fund finances repurchase proceeds by selling investments the fund may hold a larger proportion of its net assets in less liquid securities  the funds quarterly repurchase offers are a shareholders only means of liquidity with respect to his or her shares   repurchase of shares will tend to reduce the amount of outstanding shares and depending upon the funds investment performance its net assets a reduction in the funds net assets may increase the funds expense ratio to the extent that additional shares are not sold in addition the repurchase of shares by the fund may be a taxable event to shareholders  the funds quarterly repurchase offers are a shareholders only means of liquidity with respect to his or her shares  the shares are not traded on a national securities exchange and no secondary market exists for the shares nor does the fund expect a secondary market for its shares to exist in the future table of contents  part a prospectus  small and medium capitalization company risk many small or small capitalization companies may be newly formed or have limited product lines distribution channels and financial and managerial resources the risks associated with these investments are generally greater than those associated with investments in the securities of larger moreestablished companies this may cause the funds nav to be more volatile when compared to investment companies that focus only on large capitalization companies generally securities of medium and small capitalization companies are more likely to experience sharper swings in market values less liquid markets in which it may be more difficult for the advisor to sell at times and at prices that the advisor believes appropriate and generally are more volatile than those of larger companies compared to large companies smaller companies are more likely to have i less information publicly available ii more limited product lines or markets and less mature businesses iii fewer capital resources iv more limited management depth and v shorter operating histories further the equity securities of smaller companies are often traded overthecounter and generally experience a lower trading volume than is typical for securities that are traded on a national securities exchange consequently an underlying fund may be required to dispose of these securities over a longer period of time and potentially at less favorable prices than would be the case for securities of larger companies offering greater potential for gains and losses and associated tax consequences   underlying funds risk   fund shareholders will bear two layers of fees and expenses assetbased fees and expenses at the fund level and assetbased fees incentive allocations performance fees or fees and expenses at the underlying fund level  underlying funds are subject to liquidity risk because they typically only offer periodic redemptions on a monthly quarterly or annual basis  they are subject to valuation risk because they will be priced in the absence of a readily available market based on determinations of fair value which may prove to be inaccurate  they are subject to leverage risk because there is no regulatory limit on certain types of leverage  underlying funds are not afforded the protections of the  act  underlying funds may have limited operating histories for example they need not have independent boards may not require shareholder approval of advisory contracts may change investment objective without notice to investors may employ leverage higher than other investment vehicles such as a mutual fund may engage in joint transactions with affiliates may not have custody of assets protections and are not obligated to file financial reports with the sec  underlying funds are subject to specific investment strategybased risks depending on the nature of the fund  they often engage in speculative investment practices such as leverage shortselling arbitrage hedging derivatives and other strategies that may increase investment losses  short selling is inherently leveraged and may result in significant losses if securities sold short increase in value underlying funds may concentrate their investments in a particular industry or economic sector to the extent an underlying fund invests a significant portion of its assets in securities of companies in the same industry or economic sector such underlying fund is more susceptible to economic political regulatory and other occurrences influencing that industry or sector there is no guarantee that any of the trading strategies used by the managers retained by an underlying fund will be profitable or avoid losses   management of the fund   trustees and officers   the board is responsible for the overall management of the fund

control person is one who owns either directly or indirectly more than  of the voting securities of a company or acknowledges the existence of control  as of june   no shareholder controlled the fund   determination of net asset value   the net asset value of shares of the fund is determined monthly as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange nyse normally  pm eastern time on the last business day of each calendar month  each share will be offered at net asset value  during the continuous monthly offering the price of the shares will increase or decrease according to the net asset value of the shares  in computing net asset value portfolio securities of the fund are valued at their current market values determined on the basis of market quotations if available  because market quotations are not typically readily available for the majority of the funds securities they are valued at fair value as determined by the board  the board has delegated the day to day responsibility for determining these fair values in accordance with the policies it has approved to a fair value team of one or more representatives of the advisor and officer representatives of the fund  fair valuation involves subjective judgments and it is possible that the fair value determined for a security may differ materially from the value that could be realized upon the sale of the security  there is no single standard for determining fair value of a security  rather in determining the fair value of a security for which there are no readily available market quotations the fair value team may consider several factors including fundamental analytical data relating to the investment in the security the nature and duration of any restriction on the disposition of the security the cost of the security at the date of purchase the liquidity of the market for the security and the recommendation of the funds portfolio managers  the team may also enlist thirdparty consultants such as an audit firm or financial officer of a security issuer on an asneeded basis to assist in determining a securityspecific fair value   the fair value team will provide the board with periodic reports no less frequently than quarterly that discuss the functioning of the valuation process if applicable to that period and that identify issues and valuations problems that have arisen if any  to the extent deemed necessary the board will review any securities valued by the fair value team in accordance with the funds valuation policies  the board reviews and ratifies the execution of this process and the resultant fair value prices at least quarterly to assure the process produces reliable results   nondollardenominated securities if any are valued as of the close of the nyse at the closing price of such securities in their principal trading market but may be valued at fair value if subsequent events occurring before the computation of net asset value have materially affected the value of the securities  trading may take place in foreign issues held by the fund if any at times when the fund is not open for business  as a result the funds net asset value may change at times when it is not possible to purchase or sell shares of the fund  the fund may use a thirdparty pricing service to assist it in determining the market value of securities in the funds portfolio  the funds net asset value per share is calculated by dividing the value of the funds total assets the value of the securities the fund holds plus cash or other assets including interest accrued but not yet received less accrued expenses of the fund less the funds other liabilities by the total number of shares outstanding   table of contents  part a prospectus  for purposes of determining the net asset value of the fund readily marketable portfolio securities listed on the nyse are valued except as indicated below at the last sale price reflected on the consolidated tape at the close of the nyse on the business day as of which such value is being determined  if there has been no sale on such day the securities are valued at the mean of the closing bid and asked prices on such day  if no bid or asked prices are quoted on such day or if market prices may be unreliable because of events occurring after the close of trading then the security is valued by such method as the board shall determine in good faith to reflect its fair market value  readily marketable securities not listed on the nyse but listed on other domestic or foreign securities exchanges are valued in a like manner  portfolio securities traded on more than one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of which such value is being determined as reflected on the consolidated tape at the close of the exchange representing the principal market for such securities  securities trading on the nasdaq are valued at the closing price   readily marketable securities traded in the overthecounter market including listed securities whose primary market is believed by the advisor to be overthecounter are valued at the mean of the current bid and asked prices as reported by the nasdaq or in the case of securities not reported by the nasdaq or a comparable source as the board deems appropriate to reflect their fair market value  where securities are traded on more than one exchange and also overthecounter the securities will generally be valued using the quotations the board believes reflect most closely the value of such securities   the valuation of the funds investments in underlying funds is ordinarily determined based upon valuations provided by the underlying fund managers  certain securities in which the underlying funds invest may not have a readily ascertainable market price and will be valued by the underlying fund managers at fair value in accordance with procedures adopted by the underlying funds  in this regard an underlying fund manager may face a conflict of interest in valuing the securities as their value will affect the underlying fund managers compensation  although the advisor will review the valuation procedures used by all underlying fund managers the advisor will not be able to confirm the accuracy of valuations provided by the underlying fund manager and valuations provided by the underlying fund manager generally will be conclusive with respect to the fund  in addition the net asset values or other valuation information received by the fund from an underlying fund and used in calculating the funds net asset value will include estimates that may be subject to later adjustment or revision by the underlying fund manager  any such adjustment or revision will either increase or decrease the net asset value of the fund at the time that the fund is provided with information regarding the adjustment  the fund does not expect to restate its previous net asset values to reflect an adjustment or revision by an underlying fund  in the unlikely event that an underlying fund does not report a fiscal period end value to a fund on a timely basis the fund would determine the fair value of the underlying fund based on the most recent value reported by the underlying fund as well as any other relevant information available at the time the fund values its portfolio   with respect to any portion of the funds assets that are invested in one or more openend management investment companies registered under the  act each mutual funds net asset value is calculated based upon the net asset values of those openend management investment companies and the prospectuses for these companies explain the circumstances under which those companies will use fair value pricing and the effects of using fair value pricing   conflicts of interest as a general matter certain conflicts of interest may arise in connection with a portfolio managers management of a funds investments on the one hand and the investments of other accounts for which the portfolio manager is responsible on the other  for example it is possible that the various accounts managed could have different investment strategies that at times might conflict with one another to the possible detriment of the fund  alternatively to the extent that the same investment opportunities might be desirable for more than one account possible conflicts could arise in determining how to allocate them  other potential conflicts might include conflicts created by specific portfolio manager compensation arrangements and conflicts relating to selection of brokers or dealers to execute fund portfolio trades andor specific uses of commissions from fund portfolio trades for example research or soft dollars if any  the advisor has adopted policies and procedures and where possible has structured portfolio manager compensation in a manner reasonably designed to safeguard the fund from being negatively affected as a result of any such potential conflicts   table of contents  part a prospectus  repurchases and transfers of shares   no right of redemption   no shareholder will have the right to require the fund to redeem its shares no public market exists for the shares and none is expected to develop  consequently shareholders will not be able to liquidate their investment other than as a result of repurchases of shares by the fund as described below  an investment in the fund is therefore suitable only for investors who can bear the risks associated with the limited liquidity of the shares   repurchases of shares   the fund may from time to time repurchase shares from shareholders in accordance with written tenders by shareholders at those times in those amounts and on those terms and conditions as the board may determine in its sole discretion  each such repurchase offer will generally be limited to up to  of the net assets of the fund  in determining whether the fund should offer to repurchase shares from shareholders the board will consider the recommendations of the advisor  notwithstanding the foregoing the board may temporarily suspend the repurchase program at any time and shareholders cannot require the fund to repurchase their shares  the advisor expects that generally it will recommend to the board that the fund offer to repurchase shares from shareholders quarterly with such repurchases to occur on the first business day following each march  june  september  and december   each repurchase offer will generally commence approximately  days prior to the applicable repurchase date   in determining whether to accept a recommendation to conduct a repurchase offer at any such time the board will consider the following factors among others   · whether any shareholders have requested to tender shares to the fund   · the liquidity of the funds assets including fees and costs associated with redeeming or otherwise withdrawing from underlying funds   · the investment plans and working capital and reserve requirements of the fund   · the relative economies of scale of the tenders with respect to the size of the fund   · the history of the fund in repurchasing shares   · the availability of information as to the value of the funds investments in underlying funds   · the existing conditions of the securities markets and the economy generally as well as political national or international developments or current affairs   · any anticipated tax consequences to the fund of any proposed repurchases of shares and   · the recommendations of the advisor   the fund will repurchase shares from shareholders pursuant to written tenders on terms and conditions that the board determines to be fair to the fund and to all shareholders  when the board determines that the fund will repurchase shares notice will be provided to shareholders describing the terms of the offer containing information shareholders should consider in deciding whether to participate in the repurchase opportunity and containing information on how to participate  shareholders deciding whether to tender their shares during the period that a repurchase offer is open may obtain the funds net asset value per share by contacting the advisor during the period  if a repurchase offer is oversubscribed by shareholders who tender shares the fund may repurchase a pro rata portion of the shares tendered by each shareholder extend the repurchase offer if necessary and increase the amount of shares that the fund is offering to purchase to an amount it believes sufficient to accommodate the excess shares tendered as well as any shares tendered during the extended offer or take any other action with respect to the repurchase offer permitted by applicable law   table of contents  part a prospectus  repurchases of shares from shareholders by the fund will be paid in cash following issuance of notes as described below  repurchases will be effective after receipt and acceptance by the fund of eligible written tenders of shares from shareholders by the applicable repurchase offer deadline  the fund does not impose any charges in connection with repurchases of shares   in light of liquidity constraints associated with the funds investments in underlying funds and the fact that the fund may have to effect redemptions from underlying funds in order to pay for shares being repurchased the fund expects to employ the following repurchase procedures   · each repurchase offer will generally commence approximately  days prior to the applicable repurchase date  a shareholder choosing to tender shares for repurchase must do so by the applicable deadline which generally will be  to  days before the date as of which shares are to be repurchased the  notice date deadline   shares will be valued as of the valuation date which is generally expected to be the last business day of each calendar quarter ie march  june  september  and december   tenders will be revocable upon written notice to the fund up to the notice date deadline  if a repurchase offer is extended the notice date deadline will be extended accordingly   · promptly after the notice date deadline the fund will give to each shareholder whose shares have been accepted for repurchase a promissory note the  promissory note  entitling the shareholder to be paid an amount equal to the value determined as of the valuation date of the repurchased shares  the determination of the value of shares as of the valuation date is subject to adjustment based upon the results of the next annual audit of the funds financial statements   · the promissory note which will be noninterest bearing and nontransferable is expected to contain terms providing for payment at two separate times   · the initial payment in respect of the promissory note the  initial payment  will be in an amount equal to at least  of the estimated value of the repurchased shares determined as of the valuation date  the initial payment will be made as of the later of  a period of within  days after the valuation date or  if the fund has requested redemptions of its capital from any underlying funds in order to fund the repurchase of shares within ten business days after the fund has received at least  of the aggregate amount redeemed by the fund from the underlying funds   · the second and final payment in respect of the promissory note the  postaudit payment  is expected to be in an amount equal to the excess if any of  the value of the repurchased shares determined as of the valuation date and based upon the results of the annual audit of the funds financial statements for the year in which the valuation date occurs over  the initial payment  it is anticipated that the annual audit of the funds financial statements will be completed within  days after the end of each fiscal year of the fund and that the postaudit payment will be made promptly after the completion of the audit   given the repurchase procedures described above i shareholders will have to decide whether to request that the fund repurchase their shares without the benefit of knowing the value of their shares on the repurchase date ii there will be a substantial period of time between the date on which shareholders must submit a request to have their shares repurchased and the date by which they can expect to receive payment for their shares from the fund and iii shareholders whose shares are accepted for repurchase bear the risk that the funds net asset value may fluctuate significantly between the time that they submit their repurchase request and the repurchase date   if modification of the funds repurchase procedures as described above is deemed necessary to comply with regulatory requirements the board will adopt revised procedures reasonably designed to provide shareholders substantially the same liquidity for shares as would be available under the procedures described above  the fund is subject to certain underlying funds initial holding periods beginning at the time of the funds initial investment in an underlying fund during which the fund may not redeem its investment and certain underlying funds may limit the timing and the amount the fund may redeem from an underlying fund  in addition certain underlying funds may at times elect to suspend completely or limit withdrawal rights for an indefinite period of time in response to market turmoil or other adverse conditions  during such periods the fund thus may not be able to liquidate its holdings in such underlying funds in order to meet repurchase requests  in addition should the fund seek to liquidate its investment in an underlying fund that maintains a side pocket arrangement in general a type of account utilized by private funds to segregate illiquid assets from those that have more liquidity the fund might not be able to fully liquidate its investment without delay which could be considerable  the fund may need to suspend or postpone repurchase offers if it is not able to dispose of its interests in underlying funds in a timely manner   table of contents  part a prospectus  upon its acceptance of tendered shares for repurchase the fund will monitor the balance of cash liquid securities and interests in underlying funds that the fund has requested be redeemed or any combination of them relative to the unpaid dollar amount of promissory notes issued to shareholders tendering shares and may need to adjust the amount of liquid securities andor interests in underlying funds to be sold to satisfy payment to of such promissory notes due to fluctuations in the value of such liquid securities and interests in underlying funds  payment for repurchased shares may require the fund to liquidate portfolio holdings earlier than the advisor would otherwise have caused these holdings to be liquidated potentially resulting in losses and may increase the funds investmentrelated expenses as a result of higher portfolio turnover rates early redemption penalties and other costs and expenses  the advisor intends to take measures subject to policies as may be established by the board to attempt to avoid or minimize potential losses and expenses resulting from the repurchase of shares   a shareholder tendering for repurchase only a portion of the shareholders shares will be required to maintain an account balance of at least  after giving effect to the repurchase  if a shareholder tenders an amount that would cause the shareholders account balance to fall below the required minimum the fund reserves the right to repurchase all of a shareholders shares at any time if the aggregate value of such shareholders shares is at the time of such compulsory repurchase less than the minimum initial investment applicable for the fund  this right of the fund to repurchase shares compulsorily may be a factor which shareholders may wish to consider when determining the extent of any tender for purchase by the fund   the fund may also repurchase shares of a shareholder without consent or other action by the shareholder or other person if the fund determines that   · the shares have been transferred or have vested in any person other than by operation of law as a result of the death bankruptcy insolvency adjudicated incompetence or dissolution of the shareholder   · ownership of shares by a shareholder or other person is likely to cause the fund to be in violation of require registration of any shares under or subject the fund to additional registration or

aspects of the taxation of the fund that should be considered by a potential purchaser of shares in the fund  a complete discussion of all tax aspects of an investment in the fund is beyond the scope of this memorandum  the following summary is only intended to identify and discuss certain tax issues   this summary of certain tax considerations applicable to the fund is considered to be a correct interpretation of existing laws and regulations in force on the date of this memorandum  no assurance can be given that changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation will not occur after the date of this memorandum or that any such future guidance or interpretation will not be applied retroactively   the following summary is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning  the tax matters relating to the fund are complex and are subject to varying interpretations  moreover the effect of existing income tax laws and of proposed changes in income tax laws on shareholders will vary with the particular circumstances of each shareholder  accordingly each prospective investor must consult with and rely solely on the prospective investors professional tax advisers with respect to the tax results of the prospective investors investment in the fund  in no event will the advisor their respective affiliates counsel or other professional advisers be liable to any shareholder for any federal state local or other tax consequences of an investment in the fund whether or not such consequences are as described below   notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this memorandum each shareholder and each employee representative or other agent of such shareholder as applicable may disclose to any and all persons without limitation of any kind the us federal and state tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions described herein or contemplated hereunder and all materials of any kind that are provided to the shareholder relating to such tax treatment

treasury regulations promulgated thereunder  regulations  as in effect on the date of this memorandum so long as the fund complies with the memorandum and does not make an election to be taxed as a corporation the fund expects to be classified for us federal income tax purposes as a partnership and not as an association taxable as a corporation   the fund has not sought and will not seek a ruling from the irs or a tax opinion with respect to its status as a partnership  if the fund were to be classified as an association taxable as a corporation the taxable income of the fund would be subject to corporate income taxation when recognized by the fund and distributions from the fund to the shareholders would be treated as dividend income when received by the shareholders to the extent of the current or accumulated earnings and profits of the fund  in addition profits and losses realized by the fund would not directly flow through to the shareholders   certain publicly traded partnerships are treated as associations that are taxable as corporations for us federal income tax purposes  a publicly traded partnership is any partnership the interests in which are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof  under the regulations interests in a partnership are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof if taking into account all of the facts and circumstances the partners are readily able to buy sell or exchange their partnership interests in a manner that is economically comparable to trading on an established securities market   shares in the fund will not be traded on an established securities market  regulations concerning the classification of partnerships as publicly traded partnerships provide certain safe harbors under which interests in a partnership will not be considered readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof  depending on the number of shareholders the fund may qualify for a safe harbor exemption for partnerships that are offered to investors in a private placement  the fund will not qualify for this safe harbor under the regulations if the fund has more than one hundred  shareholders taking into account as shareholders persons who are owners of trusts partnerships and other pass through entities that hold shares  under the regulations certain plans of withdrawal of partnership interests may cause a partnership to be treated as a publicly traded partnership  under the memorandum the fund has sole discretion to refuse to allow a shareholder to withdraw its shares if such withdrawal would in the funds opinion cause the fund to be treated as a publicly traded partnership  the fund expects that under the facts and circumstances test set forth in the regulations the shares should not be readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and therefore the fund expects not to be treated as a publicly traded partnership under the regulations  however the fund has not sought and will not seek a ruling from irs or a tax opinion with respect to whether the fund is a publicly traded partnership if the fund were treated as a publicly traded partnership then the shareholders would be subject to the tax consequences discussed in the preceding paragraph regarding additional taxes imposed on the funds income its distributions being treated as dividends and the inability of the shareholders to deduct losses of the fund   in addition the board believes that the fund will avoid treatment as a publicly traded partnership by qualifying for the passivetype income exception found in the code  in order to meet the exception the advisor intends that at least ninety percent  of the funds gross income for any taxable year will consist of qualifying income  qualifying income for the purposes of the exception includes interest dividends and gains from the sale or disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies   it is assumed in the following discussion of tax considerations that the fund will be taxed as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes   table of contents  part a prospectus  taxation of fund operations   if the fund is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes the fund will not be subject to us federal income tax  the fund will file an annual partnership information return with the irs  each shareholder is required to report separately on the shareholders income tax return the respective distributive share of the funds net long‑term capital gain or loss net short‑term capital gain or loss net ordinary income deductions and credits  the fund may utilize a variety of investment and trading strategies which produce both short‑term and long‑term capital gain or loss as well as ordinary income or loss  the fund will send annually to each shareholder a form showing its respective distributive share of the fund items of income gain loss deduction or credit   each shareholder will be subject to tax and liable for such tax on its distributive share of the funds taxable income or gains regardless of whether the shareholder has received or will receive any distribution of cash from the fund  the fund is not obligated and does not intend to make any cash distributions to the shareholder each year  thus in any particular year a shareholders distributive share of taxable income or gain from the fund and possibly the taxes imposed on that income could exceed the amount of cash if any it receives or is entitled to withdraw from the fund   under section  of the code a shareholders distributive share of any fund item of income gain loss deduction or credit is governed by the memorandum unless the allocation provided by the memorandum does not have substantial economic effect the regulations promulgated under section b of the code provide certain safe harbors with respect to allocations which under the regulations will be deemed to have substantial economic effect  the validity of an allocation which does not satisfy any of the safe harbors of these regulations is determined by taking into account all facts and circumstances relating to the economic arrangements among the shareholders  while no assurance can be given the allocations provided by the memorandum should have substantial economic effect and should be sustained under the facts and circumstances test  however if it were determined by the irs or otherwise that the allocations provided in the memorandum with respect to a particular item do not have substantial economic effect each shareholders distributive share of that item would be determined for tax purposes in accordance with that shareholders interest in the fund taking into account all facts and circumstances   a shareholders distributive share of the funds losses including a capital loss will be allowed only to the extent of the adjusted tax basis of such shareholders interest in the fund at the end of such funds tax year in which such loss occurred  any excess of such loss over such adjusted tax basis will be allowed as a deduction at the end of the funds tax year in which the shareholders adjusted tax basis is increased by a capital contribution or an allocation of income or gain   cash distributions and withdrawals to the extent they i do not exceed a shareholders adjusted tax basis in its interest in the fund and ii do not represent a relinquishment of a shareholders interest in unrealized receivables including untaxed market discount as determined under the regulations should not result in taxable gain to that shareholder but will reduce the adjusted tax basis in the shareholders interest in the fund by the amount distributed or withdrawn  cash distributed to a shareholder in excess of the adjusted tax basis of the respective shareholders interest in the fund is generally taxable either as capital gain or ordinary income depending on the circumstances   a distribution of property from a partnership is generally not taxable except that a distribution consisting of marketable securitiesas defined under section c of the code generally is recharacterized as a distribution of cash rather than property unless the distributing partnership is an investment partnership and the recipient is an eligible partner within the meaning of section cc of the code  the fund will determine at the appropriate time whether the fund qualifies as an investment partnership and if the shareholder is an eligible partner  a shareholder will qualify as an eligible partner if prior to the funds distribution of marketable securities the shareholders contributions to the fund consisted solely of cash if the fund qualifies as an investment partnership a distribution of marketable securities to a shareholder who is an eligible partner will be treated as a distribution of property and not recharacterized as a distribution of cash   table of contents  part a prospectus  in the event a shareholder withdraws all of the capital in its capital account from the fund the board may in its sole discretion allocate specially an amount of the funds taxable gains or losses to the withdrawing shareholder to the extent that the shareholders capital account exceeds or is less than its federal income tax basis in its interest in the fund  there can be no assurance that if the fund makes such a special allocation the irs will accept such allocation  if such allocation is successfully challenged by the irs the funds gains allocable to the remaining shareholders would be increased   a shareholder receiving a cash liquidating distribution from the fund in connection with a complete withdrawal from the fund generally will recognize capital gain or loss to the extent of the difference between the proceeds received by the shareholder and the shareholders adjusted tax basis in its interest in the fund  the capital gain or loss will be shortterm or longterm depending upon the shareholders holding period for its fund interest  a withdrawing shareholder will however recognize ordinary income to the extent the shareholders allocable share of the funds unrealized receivables exceeds the shareholders basis in the unrealized receivables as determined under the regulations  for these purposes accrued but untaxed market discount if any on securities held by the fund will be treated as an unrealized receivable with respect to which a withdrawing shareholder would recognize ordinary income moreover interest may be imputed as ordinary income on the amount of any promissory note received by a shareholder in exchange for some or all of its shares   pursuant to various antideferral provisions of the code the subpart f and passive foreign investment company  pfic  provisions investments by the fund in certain foreign corporations may cause a shareholder to i recognize taxable income prior to the funds receipt of distributable proceeds ii pay an interest charge on receipts that are deemed as having been deferred or iii recognize ordinary income that but for the antideferral provisions would have been treated as longterm or shortterm capital gain  in particular although the fund will attempt to monitor its investments in order to determine whether or not it has invested in any pfics it is not always possible to determine whether or not a particular nonus company is a pfic   if the fund invests in a pfic a shareholder may be able to make an election to have the pfic treated as a qualified electing fund  qef  in which event such shareholder will avoid certain of the potential adverse consequences referred to above and instead will be taxed currently on its proportionate share of the ordinary earnings and net long term capital gains of the pfic whether or not the earnings or gains are distributed  however there is no assurance that the fund will be able to obtain from any company that is a pfic the necessary information on an annual basis in order to permit shareholders in the fund to file an election with the irs to treat any such pfic as a qef  a shareholder also may have the option to elect to mark stock in a pfic to market at the end of every year provided the pfic stock is considered marketable under applicable regulations  all such marktomarket gains and losses to the extent allowed will be considered ordinary income  however this election may not be available for certain types of investments made by the fund   the foreign account tax compliance act  fatca  imposes withholding at a  rate on certain payments to i a foreign financial institution unless such foreign financial institution agrees to verify report and disclose its us accountholders and meet certain other specified requirements or ii a nonfinancial foreign entity that is the beneficial owner of the payment unless a such entity is a publicly traded corporation or other exempt payee or b such entity certifies that it does not have any substantial us owners or provides the name address and taxpayer identification number of each substantial us owner and such entity meets certain other specified requirements transition relief i exempts certain grandfathered obligations outstanding on july   from fatca withholding and ii delays fatca withholding on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of stock or debt to amounts paid after december    potential investors must consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of fatca for their investment in the funds stock   limitations on losses and deductions   section  of the code limits certain taxpayers losses from certain activities to the amount they are at risk in the activities  taxpayers subject to the at risk rules are individuals s corporations and certain closely‑held corporations  the activities subject to the at risk limitations are all activities engaged in by a taxpayer in carrying on a trade or business or for the production of income  a shareholder subject to the at risk rules will not be permitted to deduct in any year losses arising from such shareholders interest in the fund to the extent the losses exceed the amount he is considered to have at risk in the fund at the close of that year   table of contents  part a prospectus  a taxpayer is considered to be at risk in any activity to the extent of its cash contribution to the activity its adjusted tax basis in other property contributed to the activity and its personal liability for repayments of amounts borrowed for use in the activity  with respect to amounts borrowed for use in the activity the taxpayer is not considered to be at risk even if its is personally liable for repayment if the borrowing was from a person who has an interest in the activity other than an interest as a creditor  even if a taxpayer is personally liable for repayment of amounts borrowed for use in the activity and even if the amount borrowed is borrowed from a person whose only interest in the activity is an interest as a creditor a taxpayer will not be considered at risk in the activity to the extent its investment in the activity is protected against loss through nonrecourse financing guarantees stop loss agreements or other similar arrangements   each shareholder will be at risk initially for the amount of his capital contribution  a shareholders amount at risk will be increased by its income from the fund and will be decreased by its losses from the fund and distributions to it  if a shareholders amount at risk decreases to zero it can take no further losses until it has an at risk amount to cover the losses  a shareholder is subject to a recapture of losses previously allowed to the extent that its amount at risk is reduced below zero limited to loss amounts previously allowed to the shareholder over any amounts previously recaptured  the potential recapture effects of distributions of fund debts if any are uncertain   the code restricts the deductibility of losses from a passive activity against certain income that is not derived from a passive activity  this restriction applies to individuals personal service corporations and certain closely held corporations  under regulations portfolio income earned by the fund generally will not constitute income or loss from a passive activity  generally portfolio income includes  interest dividends annuities and royalties not derived from an ordinary trade or business  gains and losses other than derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business from the disposition of property that either produces the kind of income described in  above or is held for investment  passive losses from other sources generally may not be deducted against a shareholders share of such income and gain from the fund  income or loss attributable to the funds investment in a partnership engaged in a nonsecurities trade or business may however constitute passive activity income or loss   all securities held by the fund will be marked to market at the end of each accounting period and the net gain or loss from marking to market will be reported as income or loss for financial statement presentation and capital account maintenance purposes  this treatment is inconsistent with the general tax rule applicable to many securities transactions that a transaction does not result in gain or loss until it is closed by an actual sale or other disposition  the divergence between such accounting and general tax treatments frequently may result in substantial variation between financial statement income or loss and taxable income or loss reported by the fund   to the extent that the fund has interest expense a non‑corporate shareholder will likely be subject to the investment interest expense limitations of section d of the code  investment interest expense is interest paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry property held for investment  the deduction for investment interest expense is limited to net investment income ie the excess of investment income over investment expenses  excess investment interest expense that is disallowed is not lost permanently but may be carried forward to succeeding years subject to the section d limitation  net capital gain ie net long‑term capital gain over net short‑term capital loss on property held for investment and qualified dividends are only included in investment income to the extent the taxpayer elects to subject some or all of such gain to taxation at ordinary income tax rates  if some or all of the funds operations do not constitute a trade or business for purposes of section d of the code then the section d limitations will apply at the partner level with regard to the funds interest expense  whether all or any portion of the funds operations constitutes a trade or business is a question of fact  as the funds operations may encompass a variety of strategies the fund cannot predict to what extent its operations will constitute a trade or business  further even if the funds operations constitute a trade or business the position may possibly be taken by irs that the investment interest expense while subject to the section d limitation is not an itemized deduction   table of contents  part a prospectus  section a of the code disallows any deduction for interest paid by a taxpayer on indebtedness incurred or continued for the purpose of purchasing or carrying tax‑exempt obligations  the irs has announced that such purpose will be deemed to exist with respect to indebtedness incurred to finance a portfolio investment and that a limited partnership interest will be regarded as a portfolio investment  therefore if the fund holds tax‑exempt obligations the irs might take the position that all or part of the interest paid by such shareholder in connection with the purchase of each respective shareholders shares should be viewed as incurred to enable such shareholder to continue carrying tax‑exempt obligations and that such shareholder should not be allowed to deduct all or a portion of such interest   under section  of the code for a noncorporate shareholder certain miscellaneous itemized deductions are allowed only to the extent they exceed a floor amount equal to  of adjusted gross income  if or to the extent that the funds operations do not constitute a trade or business within the meaning of section  and other provisions of the code a noncorporate shareholders distributive share of the funds investment expenses other than investment interest expense would be deductible only as miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the  floor  in addition under section  of the code the ability of an individual with an adjusted gross income in excess of specified amounts to deduct certain itemized deductions is restricted  under such provision investment expenses in excess of  of adjusted gross income may only be deducted to the extent such excess expenses along with certain other itemized deductions not including investment interest expense exceed the lesser of i  of the excess of the individuals adjusted gross income over the specified amount or ii  of the amount of such itemized deductions otherwise allowable for the taxable year  moreover investment interest expenses which are miscellaneous itemized deductions are not deductible by a noncorporate taxpayer in calculating its alternative minimum tax liability   a shareholder may only deduct the shareholders share of the funds losses including capital losses only to the extent of such shareholders adjusted tax basis in the shareholders interest in the fund  capital losses generally may be deducted only to the extent of capital gains except for non‑corporate taxpayers who are allowed to deduct   for married taxpayers filing separate returns of excess capital losses per year against ordinary income  corporate taxpayers may carry back unused capital losses for three  years and may carry forward such losses for five  years non‑corporate taxpayers may not carry back unused capital losses but may carry forward unused capital losses indefinitely   the fund is generally required to adjust its tax basis in its assets in respect of all shareholders in the case of distributions that result in a substantial basis reduction ie in excess of  in respect of the funds property  the fund is also required to adjust its tax basis in its assets in respect of a transferee shareholder in the case of a sale or exchange of an interest or a transfer upon death when there exists a substantial built in loss ie in excess of  in respect of fund property immediately after the transfer  for this reason the fund will require i a shareholder who receives a distribution from the fund in connection with a complete withdrawal ii a transferee of an interest including a transferee in case of death and iii any other shareholder in appropriate circumstances to provide the fund with any information necessary to allow the fund to comply with its obligations to make basis adjustments   tax treatment of funds investments   the fund is expected to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  assuming that the fund is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes it will not be subject to federal income tax but it will be required to file an annual partnership information return with irs reporting the results of its operations  the funds income will include its allocable share of the income gain loss deduction and credit of its partnership investments   table of contents  part a prospectus  the fund expects that the fund will act as a trader or investor and not as a dealer with respect to the funds securities transactions  a trader and an investor are persons who buy and sell securities for their own accounts whereas a dealer is a person who purchases securities for resale to customers rather than for investment or speculation  as noted above unless otherwise indicated references in the discussion to the tax consequences of the funds investments activities income gain and loss include the direct investments activities income gain and loss of the fund  if the fund were considered a dealer or trader in commodities the fund generally would be eligible to use mark to market accounting for federal income tax purposes with respect to the funds commodities investments under section  of the code  if the fund were considered a dealer in securities it would generally be required to use marktomarket accounting and if the fund were considered a trader in securities the fund generally would be eligible to elect to use mark to market accounting for federal income tax purposes with respect to the funds investments under section  of the code  if the fund were required to use marktomarket accounting or if the fund were to elect for the fund to use marktomarket accounting for federal income tax purposes gains and losses from the funds commodities andor securities investments would generally be treated as ordinary income and loss for federal income tax purposes  the following discussion assumes that the fund acts as a trader or as an investor and is not required to and does not elect to use marktomarket accounting for federal income tax purposes under section  of the code   generally gains and losses realized by a trader or an investor on the sale of securities are capital gains and losses  the fund thus expects that the funds gains and losses from its securities transactions typically will be capital gains and capital losses  these capital gains and losses may be longterm or shortterm depending in general upon the length of time the fund maintains a particular investment position and in some cases upon the nature of the transaction  property held for more than one year generally will be eligible for longterm capital gain or loss treatment  special rules however apply to the characterization of capital gain realized with respect to certain regulated futures contracts nonus currency forward contracts and certain options contracts that qualify as or qualify for treatment as section  contracts which are described below  the application of certain rules relating to short sales to socalled straddle and wash sale transactions and to certain nonus regulated contracts and options contracts may serve to alter the manner in which the funds holding period for a security is determined or may otherwise affect the characterization as shortterm or longterm and also the timing of the realization of certain gains or losses  moreover the straddle rules and short sale rules may require the capitalization of certain related expenses of the fund   gain or loss from a short sale of property is generally considered as capital gain or loss to the extent the property used to close the short sale constitutes a capital asset in the funds hands  except with respect to certain situations where the property used by the fund to close a short sale has a long‑term holding period on the date of the short sale special rules would generally treat the gains on short sales as short‑term capital gains  these rules may also terminate the running of the holding period of substantially identical property held by the fund  moreover a loss on a short sale will be treated as a long‑term capital loss if on the date of the short sale substantially identical property has been held by the fund for more than twelve  months   in the case of section  contracts the code generally applies a marktomarket system of taxing unrealized gains and losses on such contracts and otherwise provides for special rules of taxation  a section  contract includes certain regulated futures contracts certain foreign currency contracts and certain options contracts   section  contracts  a regulated futures contract means a contract  with respect to which the amount required to be deposited and the amount which may be withdrawn depends upon a system of marking to market and  which is traded on or subject to the rules of a qualified board or exchange  a foreign currency contract means a contract  which requires delivery of or the settlement of which depends on the value of a foreign currency which is a currency in which positions are also traded through regulated futures contracts  which is traded on the interbank market and  which is entered into at arms length at a price determined by reference to the price on the interbank market  a nonequity option means any listed option which is not an equity option  ie  an option to buy or sell stock or the value of which is determined directly or indirectly by reference to any stock or any narrowly based security index as defined in section a of the securities exchange act of    table of contents  part a prospectus  the doddfrank act provides that all standardized swap transactions between swap dealers and major swap participants must be cleared and traded on an exchange or electronic platform  the fund may be treated as either a swap dealer or a major swap participant  section  of the doddfrank act defines a swap as including among others the following types of derivatives  a put call cap floor collar or similar option of any kind that is for the purchase or sale or based on the value of one or more interest or other rates currencies commodities securities instruments of indebtedness indices quantitative measures or other financial or economic interests or property of any kind   any agreement contract or transaction commonly known as an interest rate swap a rate floor a rate cap a rate collar a crosscurrency rate swap a basis swap a currency swap a foreign exchange swap a total return swap an equity index swap a debt index swap a debt swap a credit spread a credit default swap a credit swap a weather swap an energy swap a metal swap an agricultural swap an emissions swap and a commodity swap or  an agreement contract or transaction that is or in the future becomes commonly known to the trade as a swap  as a result of being traded on or subject to an exchange these types of derivatives may be treated as section  contracts   however section  of the doddfrank act amended section  of the code to provide that a section  contract does not include  any securities futures contract or option on such contract unless such contract or option is a dealer securities futures contract or  any interest rate swap currency swap basis swap interest rate cap interest rate floor commodity swap equity swap equity index swap credit default swap or similar agreement   under these rules section  contracts held by the fund at the end of each taxable year of the fund are treated for federal income tax purposes as if they were sold by the fund for their fair market value on the last business day of such taxable year  the net gain or loss if any resulting from such deemed sales known as marktomarket together with any gain or loss resulting from termination or transfer of the taxpayers obligations or rights with respect to a section  contract by offsetting by taking or making delivery by exercise or being exercised by assignment or being assigned by lapse or otherwise must be taken into account by the fund in computing its taxable income for such year  if a section  contract held by the fund at the end of a taxable year is sold in the following year the amount of any gain or loss realized on such sale will be adjusted to reflect the gain or loss previously taken into account under the mark to market rules   capital gains and losses from section  contracts generally are characterized as short‑term capital gains or losses to the extent of forty percent  thereof and as long‑term capital gains or losses to the extent of sixty percent  thereof  such gains and losses will be taxed under the general rules described above   the code allows a taxpayer to elect to offset gains and losses from positions that are part of a mixed straddle a mixed straddle is any straddle in which one or more but not all positions are section  contracts and with respect to each position forming part of such straddle is clearly identified before the close of the day on which the first section  contract forming part of the straddle is acquired or such earlier time as the secretary may prescribe by regulations as being part of such straddle  the fund may be eligible to elect to establish one or more mixed straddle accounts for certain of its mixed straddle trading positions   section  of the code states that any foreign currency gain or loss attributable to a section  transaction will be computed separately and treated as ordinary income or loss  included in a section  transaction is the acquisition of or becoming an obligor under a debt instrument accruing an item of expense or income which is to be paid or received after the date of such accrual or entering into or acquiring any forward contract futures contract option or similar financial instrument where the taxpayer as a result is entitled to receive or required to pay an amount which is denominated in a foreign currency or is determined by reference to one or more foreign currencies  in order to avoid the potential of ordinary income treatment an election can be made to treat any foreign currency gain or loss attributable to a forward contract a futures contract or option which is a capital asset but not part of a straddle as capital gain or loss  the fund may make such election so as to avoid ordinary income treatment   table of contents  part a prospectus  the code also provides that entering into a regulated futures contract or nonequity option which would be marked to market under section  of the code shall not be considered a section  transaction so long as the regulated futures contract or nonequity option is held on the last day of the taxable year section  exception  the code allows taxpayers to elect out of the aforesaid section  exception and the fund will make any decision concerning the section  exception in its sole and absolute discretion   if any section  transaction is part of a section  hedging transaction as defined below all transactions which are a part of such section  hedging transactions shall be integrated and treated as a single transaction or otherwise treated consistently under the code  the determination of whether any transaction is a section  transaction shall be determined without regard to whether such transaction would otherwise be markedtomarket under sections  or  of the code and such term shall not include any transaction with respect to whether an election is made to treat a forward contract a futures contract or option as capital gain or loss  a section  hedging transaction means any transaction  entered into by the taxpayer primarily either a to manage the risk of currency fluctuations with respect to property which is held or to be held by the taxpayer or b to manage the risk of currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made or obligations incurred or to be incurred by the taxpayer and  identified by the treasury secretary or the taxpayer as being a section  hedging transaction  if a qualifying debt instrument and a hedging transaction qualify for integrated treatment then the two are treated as a single synthetic debt instrument that is subject to the original issue discount rules under section e and sections  of the code   section  of the code requires that the fund recognize gain on the constructive sale of any appreciated financial position in stock a partnership interest or certain debt instruments  a constructive sale of an appreciated financial position occurs if among other things the fund  enters into a short sale of the same or substantially identical property a transaction commonly known as a short sale against the box  enters into an offsetting notional principal contract with respect to the same or substantially identical property  enters into a futures or forward contract to deliver the same or substantially identical property  in the case of an appreciated financial position that is a short sale or a contract described in subparagraphs  or  above with respect to any property acquires the same or substantially identical property or  to the extent prescribed by the secretary of the treasury in regulations enters into one or more transactions or acquires one or more positions that have substantially the same effect as the transaction described in any of subparagraphs    or  above  exceptions to the foregoing apply to certain transactions if i the transaction closed within  days after the close of the taxable year  the taxpayer holds the appreciated financial position throughout the day period beginning on the date such transaction is closed and  at no time during such day period is the taxpayers risk of loss with respect to such position reduced by reason of a circumstance which would be described in section c of the code if references to stock included references to such positions  an exception also applies to transactions involving contracts to sell stock debt instruments or partnership interests which are not marketable securities as defined in section f of the code if the contract settles within one year   the irs may treat certain positions in securities held directly or indirectly by a shareholder and its indirect interest in similar securities held by the fund as straddles for federal income tax purposes  the application of the straddle rules in such a case could affect a shareholders holding period for the securities involved and may defer the recognition of losses with respect to such securities  in addition if either of the shareholders positions in such a transaction is an appreciated financial position application of the straddle rules may trigger a constructive sale of that position under the rules described above   section  of the code recharacterizes capital gain from a conversion transaction as ordinary income with certain limitations  conversion transactions are defined as transactions in which substantially all the expected return is attributable to the time value of money and a the transaction consists of the acquisition of property by the taxpayer and a substantially contemporaneous agreement to sell the same or substantially identical property in the future but only if such property was acquired and such contract was entered into on a substantially contemporaneous basis b the transaction qualifies as a straddle within the meaning of section c of the code c the transaction is one that was marketed or sold to the taxpayer on the basis that it would have the economic characteristics of a loan but the interest‑like return would be taxed as capital gain or d the transaction is described as a conversion transaction in regulations  the amount of gain so recharacterized will not exceed applicable imputed income amount as defined under section b of the code   table of contents  part a prospectus  payments of interest on a note including qualified stated interest on a discount note each as defined below generally will be taxable to a us holder as ordinary interest income at the time such payments are accrued or received in accordance with the us holders method of accounting for federal income tax purposes   a note with a term greater than one year may be issued with original issue discount for federal income tax purposes ie a discount note  generally original issue discount will arise if the stated redemption price at maturity generally the payments to be made under the note other than payments of qualified stated interest of a note exceeds its issue price by more than a de minimis amount of at least a quarter of one percent  of the stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity or if the note has certain interest payment characteristics eg interest holidays interest payable in debt of the issuer stepped interest rates or interest rates based upon multiple indices  the issue price of notes that are issued for cash will be the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes in the issue are sold for money for this purpose sales to bond houses brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters placement agents or wholesalers are ignored   qualified stated interest generally is stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or property other than a debt instrument of the issuer at least annually at a single fixed rate appropriately taking into account the length of the intervals of the payments with certain exceptions for lower rates paid during some periods  if a note is with original issue discount a us holder will be required to include original issue discount amounts in gross income on an accrual basis using the constant yield to maturity method and as a result a shareholder may be required to include these amounts in income in advance of the funds receipt of cash payments to which such amounts are attributable  any amounts included in income as original issue discount with respect to a note will increase a shareholders adjusted tax basis in his interest in the fund  correspondingly any payments of original issue discount by the fund will reduce a shareholders adjusted tax basis in his interest in the fund   the amount of original issue discount includible in income by a us holder of a note having original issue discount is determined under section a of the code  however regulations provide special rules for notes that provide for one or more alternative payment schedules applicable upon the occurrence of a contingency or contingencies including optional redemption and for notes that are floating rate notes contingent payment debt instruments or shortterm obligations  additionally a us holder who purchases a discount note for an amount that is greater than its adjusted issue price but equal to or less than its stated redemption price at maturity will be considered to have purchased the note at an acquisition premium  under the acquisition premium rules the amount of original issue discount which the us holder must include in its gross income with respect to the note for any taxable year will be reduced by the portion of the acquisition premium properly allocable to the taxable year  a us holder who purchases a note for an amount in excess of the notes stated redemption price at maturity or earlier call date as applicable will be considered to have purchased the note at a premium  a us holder may generally elect to amortize this premium over the remaining term of the note or until the earlier call date on a constant yield method with a corresponding decrease in its tax basis in the note  investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules   if a note is issued with de minimis original issue discount the us holder generally must include any de minimis original issue discount in income at maturity unless the us holder elects to treat all interest as original issue discount  under the regulations a us holder may elect to treat all interest on any note as original issue discount and calculate the amount includable in gross income under the constant yield method  for the purposes of this election interest includes stated interest acquisition discount original issue discount de minimis original issue discount market discount de minimis market discount and unstated interest as adjusted by any amortizable bond premium or acquisition premium  if the fund makes this election for a note with market discount or amortizable bond premium the election is treated as an election under the market discount or amortizable bond premium provisions and the fund will be required to amortize bond premium or include market discount in income currently for all of the funds other debt instruments with market discount or amortizable bond premium  the election is to be made for the taxable year in which the fund acquired the note and may not be revoked without the consent of the irs  investors should consult with their own tax advisors about this election  any amount of de minimis original issue discount that has not been included in income prior to sale exchange or retirement of a note will be treated as capital gain   table of contents  part a prospectus  if the fund purchases a note other than a discount note for an amount that is less than its issue price or in the case of a discount note for an amount that is less than its adjusted issue price as of the purchase date ie revised issue price the amount of the difference will be treated as market discount for federal income tax purposes unless the difference is less than a specified de minimis amount  under the market discount rules of the code the fund will be required to treat any partial principal payment on or any gain on the sale exchange retirement or other taxable disposition of a note as ordinary income to the extent that any market discount has accrued with respect to the note and was not previously included in income pursuant to an election by the fund to include any market discount in income as it accrues at the time of such disposition  market discount is accrued on a straightline basis unless the fund elects to accrue market discount under a constant yield method  if the note is disposed of in a nontaxable transaction other than a nonrecognition transaction described in section c of the code the fund will include any accrued market discount in ordinary income generally as interest as if the fund had sold the note at its then fair market value  in addition the fund may be required to defer until the maturity of the note or its earlier disposition in a taxable transaction deductions for all or a portion of the interest expense on any indebtedness incurred or maintained to purchase or carry the note unless the fund elects to include market discount in income currently as it accrues  if an election were made to include market discount in income currently as it accrues that election would apply to all debt instruments with market discount acquired by the fund on or after the first day of the first taxable year to which the election applies and may not be revoked without the consent of the irs   except as discussed above upon the sale exchange or retirement of a note held by the fund a shareholder generally will recognize taxable capital gain or loss equal the shareholders distributive share of the difference between the amount realized by the fund on the sale exchange or retirement of the note and the funds adjusted tax basis in the note  the funds adjusted tax basis in a note will equal the funds initial investment in the note increased by any original issue discount included in income and accrued market discount if any if the fund has elected to include market discount in income and decreased by the amount of any payments made with respect to the note other than payments of qualified stated interest and the amount of any amortizable bond premium offset against qualified stated interest with respect to the note  except as described above the gain or loss generally will be long term capital gain or loss if the note is held by the fund for more than one year   under existing case law a debt instrument issued with a lengthy term for example up to fifty  years may be treated as a debt for federal income tax purposes  however the irs has issued a notice that it will scrutinize debt instruments with long maturities particularly those with substantial equity characteristics   tax‑exempt investors   if the fund derives income which would be considered unrelated business taxable income  ubti  as defined in section  of the code if derived directly by a shareholder which is an organization exempt from tax under section a of the code or an ira such shareholders allocable share of the funds income would be subject to tax  a tax‑exempt organization which is subject to tax on its allocable share of the funds ubti including an ira may also be subject to the alternative minimum tax with respect to items of tax preference which enter into the computation of ubti   ubti is generally the excess of gross income from any unrelated trade or business conducted by an exempt organization or by a partnership of which the exempt organization is a member over the deductions attributable to such trade or business  ubti generally does not include dividends interest annuities royalties and gain or loss from the disposition of property other than stock in trade or property held for sale in the ordinary course of the trade or business   table of contents  part a prospectus  while ubti itself is taxable the receipt of ubti by a tax‑exempt entity generally has no effect upon that entitys tax‑exempt status or upon the exemption from tax of its other income  however for certain types of tax‑exempt entities the receipt of any ubti may have extremely adverse consequences  in particular for charitable remainder trusts defined under section  of the code the receipt of any taxable income from ubti during a taxable year will result in the imposition of an excise tax on the trust equal to the amount of the ubti   a tax‑exempt organization under section  a of the code and an ira is also taxed on its and its allocable share of the funds unrelated debtfinanced income pursuant to section  of the code  udfi   in general udfi consists of i income derived by a tax‑exempt organization directly or through a partnership from income producing property with respect to which there is acquisition indebtedness at any time during the taxable year and ii gains derived by a tax‑exempt organization directly or through a partnership from the disposition of property with respect to which there is acquisition indebtedness  such income and gains derived by a tax‑exempt organization from the ownership and sale of debt‑financed property are taxable in the proportion to which such property is financed by acquisition indebtedness during the relevant period of time   the fund or an underlying fund may use leverage with the result that a shareholder which is a taxexempt organization or an ira should expect to be subject to tax on the proportion of its distributive share of the funds income that is udfi  in addition to the extent a taxexempt organization borrows money to finance its investment in the fund such organization would be subject to tax on the portion of its income which is udfi even though such income may constitute an item otherwise excludable from ubti such as dividends   state taxes   in addition to the federal income tax consequences described above prospective investors should consider potential state tax consequences of an investment in the fund  no attempt is made herein to provide a discussion of such state tax consequences  state laws often differ from federal income tax laws with respect to the treatment of specific items of income gain loss deduction and credit  a shareholders distributive share of the taxable income or loss of the fund generally will be required to be included in determining the reportable income for state tax purposes in the jurisdiction in which he or she is a resident  some states require partnerships to withhold state taxes on distributions to shareholders  each prospective investor must consult the prospective investors own tax advisers regarding such state tax consequences   other taxes   for taxable years beginning after december   certain us persons including individuals estates and trusts will be subject to an additional  medicare tax on unearned income  for individuals the additional medicare tax applies to the lesser of i net investment income or ii the excess of modified adjusted gross income over   if married and filing jointly or  if married and filing separately  a us persons net investment income will generally include its interest dividends and capital gains unless such interest dividends or capital gains are derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business other than a trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities  if you are a us person that is an individual estate or trust you must consult your tax advisors regarding the applicability of the medicare tax to your income and gains in respect of your investment in the fund   shareholders may be subject to other taxes such as the alternative minimum tax state and local income taxes and estate inheritance or intangible property taxes that may be imposed by various jurisdictions  each prospective investor should consider the potential consequences of such taxes on an investment in the fund  it is the responsibility of each prospective investor to become satisfied as to the legal and tax consequences of an investment in the fund under state law including the laws of the states of the prospective investors domicile and residence by obtaining advice from the prospective investors own tax advisers and to file all appropriate tax returns that may be required   table of contents  part a prospectus  tax elections returns tax audits   the code provides for optional adjustments to the basis of partnership property upon distributions of partnership property to a shareholder and transfers of shares including by reason of death provided that a partnership election has been made pursuant to section  of the code  the board in its sole and reasonable discretion may cause the fund to make such an election any such election once made cannot be revoked without the irss consent   additionally section  of the code provides for a mandatory basis adjustment on distributions by partnerships with substantial built in losses which could cause the fund to decrease the basis of assets in such circumstances   if the fund is treated as a securities trader for federal income tax purposes the fund may elect to marktomarket its securities at the end of each taxable year in which case such securities would be treated for federal income tax purposes as though sold for fair market value on the last day of such taxable year  such an election would apply to the taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years unless revoked with the consent of the irs  if the fund were to make such an election a portion of the funds gains and losses would be considered ordinary income or loss rather than capital gain or loss  since for federal income tax purposes capital losses generally may be deducted only against capital gains a shareholder may be unable to deduct capital losses realized from other investments and transactions in a taxable year against his share of the funds income   the fund will decide how to report partnership items on the funds tax returns  since the fund may engage in transactions whose treatment for tax purposes is not clear there is a risk that a claim of tax liability could be asserted against the fund or its shareholders  in the event the income tax returns of the fund are audited by the irs the tax treatment of fund income and deductions generally is determined at the partnership level in a single proceeding rather than by individual audits of the shareholders  the individual selected by the board as the tax matters partner has considerable authority to make decisions affecting the tax treatment and procedural rights of all shareholders  in addition the tax matters partner has the authority to bind certain shareholders to settlement agreements and the right on behalf of all shareholders to extend the statute of limitations relating to the shareholders tax liabilities with respect to fund items   the treasury department has adopted regulations designed to assist the irs in identifying abusive tax shelter transactions  in general the regulations require investors in specified transactions to satisfy certain special tax filing and record retention requirements the regulations in their current form are extraordinarily broad in scope and could apply to a holder of an interest in a hedge fund or other ordinary pooled investment vehicle even though the fund or vehicle like the fund has not been organized to create any tax benefits for its shareholders  significant monetary penalties apply to a failure to comply with these tax filing and record retention rules  in addition states may have similar tax filing and record retention requirements   the treasury department has indicated that it may issue additional guidance designed to limit the application of the regulations to investors in nontax motivated investment vehicles such as the fund  however no assurance can be provided that such regulations will be issued or will apply to exclude investors in the fund from the requirements of the regulations  in the absence of additional favorable guidance shareholders in the fund should assume they could be subject to the special tax filing and record retention rules of the regulations and should consult their own tax advisors about any applicable tax filing and record retention requirements  the fund intends to provide information to shareholders necessary to satisfy any tax filing requirements that may arise as a result of an investment in the fund   table of contents  part a prospectus  in addition if the fund participates in a transaction that requires disclosure to the irs the fund and other material advisors to the fund may each be required to file information returns with the irs and it may be necessary to maintain a list of investors and a detailed description of the fund its activities and the expected us federal income tax consequences to its investors in addition to certain other information  if such lists and information must be maintained under the regulations it must be available to the irs for inspection upon its written request   other matters   the fund may incur certain expenses in connection with its organization of interests  the fund may elect to claim a deduction in the taxable year it begins business equal to the lesser of a the organizational expenses paid or incurred or b five thousand dollars  reduced but not below zero by the amount of organizational expenses exceeding fifty thousand dollars  the remaining organizational expenses will be amortized over a period of twelve  months from the date the fund commences operations amounts paid or incurred to market interests in a partnership syndication expenses are not deductible   special considerations for shareholders who are not us persons   a us person is a a citizen or resident of the united states b a corporation partnership or other entity organized under the laws of the united states any state or the district of columbia other than a partnership that is not treated as a us person under the regulations c an estate whose income is subject to united states income tax regardless of its source or d a trust if a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or to the extent provided in the regulations certain trusts in existence on august   and treated as us persons prior to such date that elect to be treated as us persons   assuming that the fund complies with certain rules and procedures pertaining to the conduct of its affairs including the assumptions indicated above it is anticipated that the income of the shareholders who are not us persons will not be subject to regular us federal income taxes on the basis of net income  but shareholders who are not us persons will be directly or indirectly subject to us withholding taxes on some of their income including fixed or determinable annual or periodical income such as dividend income considered to be from us sources  generally capital gains and qualified interest such as portfolio interest as defined in section h of the code should not be subject to us withholding tax  the us withholding tax rate is generally thirty percent  subject to reduction under applicable tax treaties  to qualify for the benefits of a tax treaty between the united states and a foreign country the shareholder claiming the benefits provisions must both be a resident of the treaty country and satisfy the limitation on benefits provisions as described in the applicable treaty  a shareholder must provide a completed irs form wben or irs form wbene as applicable to the fund to claim treaty benefits  although capital gains from the sale of securities should generally not be subject to us withholding tax the sale of certain securities classified as united states real property interests within the meaning of section  of the code including us real property holding corporations may be subject to us income and withholding taxes   future tax legislation   future amendments to the code other legislation new or amended regulations administrative rulings or guidance by the irs or judicial decisions may adversely affect the

nondiversified investment company under the  act there are no percentage limitations imposed by the  act on the percentage of the funds assets that may be invested in the securities of any one issuer   additional information about principal investment strategies special investment techniques   underlying funds may use a variety of special investment instruments and techniques to hedge against various risks or other factors and variables that may affect the values of the underlying funds portfolio securities and assets  underlying funds may also use these techniques including the use of derivative transactions as substitutes for securities in pursuing their respective investment objectives  the underlying funds may employ different techniques over time as new instruments and techniques are introduced or as a result of regulatory developments  some special investment techniques that underlying funds may use may involve a high degree of risk particularly when used for nonhedging purposes  a hedging transaction may not perform as anticipated and an underlying fund may suffer losses as a result of its hedging activities   derivatives   underlying funds may engage in transactions involving options futures swaps and other derivative financial instruments primarily as hedging instruments or substitutes for assets derivatives can be volatile and involve various types and degrees of risk  by using derivatives underlying funds may be permitted to increase or decrease the level of risk or change the character of the risk to which their portfolios are exposed   a small investment in derivatives could have a substantial impact on an underlying funds performance  the market for many derivatives is or suddenly can become illiquid  changes in liquidity may result in significant and rapid changes in the prices for derivatives  if an underlying fund were to invest in derivatives at an inopportune time or the underlying fund manager evaluates market conditions incorrectly the underlying funds derivative investment could negatively impact the underlying funds return or result in a loss  in addition an underlying fund could experience a loss if its derivatives were poorly correlated with its other investments or if the underlying fund were unable to liquidate its position because of an illiquid secondary market   options and futures  underlying funds may engage in the use of options and futures contracts including options on baskets of specific securities or other derivative instruments written by brokerdealers or other financial intermediaries  these transactions may be effected on securities exchanges or in the overthecounter market or they may be negotiated directly with counterparties in cases where instruments are purchased overthecounter or negotiated directly with counterparties an underlying fund is subject to the risk that the counterparty will be unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the contract these transactions may also be illiquid and if so it might be difficult to close out an underlying funds position   an underlying fund may purchase call and put options on specific securities or indices such as an interest rate index  an underlying fund may also write and sell covered or uncovered call and put options for hedging purposes and as a substitute for an asset to pursue the underlying funds investment objectives a put option gives the purchaser of the option the right to sell and obligates the writer to buy the reference security or index at a stated price at any time before the option expires similarly a call option gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy and obligates the writer to sell the underlying security or index at a stated price at any time before the option expires  indexbased options typically involve a cash payment rather than the purchase of a security   in a covered call option an underlying fund owns the underlying security the sale of such an option exposes the underlying fund to a potential loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the reference security during the term of the option  using covered call options might expose an underlying fund to other risks as well  for example an underlying fund might be required to continue holding a security that the underlying fund might otherwise have sold to protect against depreciation in the market price of the security   table of contents  part b statement of additional information  in a covered put option cash or liquid securities are placed in a segregated account on an underlying funds books the sale of such an option exposes the seller during the term of the option to a decline in price of the reference security while also depriving the seller of the opportunity to invest the segregated assets   when writing options an underlying fund may close its position by purchasing an option on the same security with the same exercise price and expiration date as the option that it has previously written on the security  if the amount paid to purchase an option is less or more than the amount received from the sale the underlying fund will accordingly realize a profit or loss to close out a position as a purchaser of an option the underlying fund would liquidate the position by selling the option previously purchased   the use of derivatives that are subject to regulation by the commodity futures trading commission the  cftc  by underlying funds could cause the fund to be a commodity pool which absent an available exemption would require the fund to comply with certain rules of the cftc   underlying funds may enter into futures contracts in us domestic markets or on exchanges located outside the united states foreign markets may offer advantages such as trading opportunities or arbitrage possibilities not available in the united states but they also may subject the underlying funds to greater risk than domestic markets for example common clearing facilities may not exist in markets where foreign exchanges are the principal markets and investors may look only to the broker to perform the contract adverse changes in the exchange rate could eliminate any profits that might be realized in trading or a loss could be incurred as a result of those changes transactions on foreign exchanges may include both commodities traded on domestic exchanges and those that are not unlike trading on domestic commodity exchanges trading on foreign commodity exchanges is not regulated by the cftc   engaging in these transactions involves risk of loss which could adversely affect the value of the funds net assets no assurance can be made that a liquid market will exist for any particular futures contract at any particular time many futures exchanges and boards of trade limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day once the daily limit has been reached in a particular contract no trades may be made that day at a price beyond that limit or trading may be suspended for specified periods during the trading day futures contract prices could move to the limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading thereby preventing prompt liquidation of positions and potentially subjecting an underlying fund to substantial losses   successful use of futures also is subject to an underlying fund managers ability to correctly predict movements in the relevant market  to the extent that a transaction is entered into for hedging purposes successful use is also subject to an underlying fund managers ability to evaluate the appropriate correlation between the transaction being hedged and the price movements of the futures contract   an underlying fund may also purchase and sell stock index futures contracts a stock index futures contract obligates an underlying fund to pay or receive an amount of cash equal to a fixed dollar amount specified in the futures contract multiplied by the difference between the settlement price of the contract on the contracts last trading day and the value of the index based on the stock prices of the securities that comprise it at the opening of trading in those securities on the next business day  an underlying fund may purchase and sell interest rate futures contracts which represent obligations to purchase or sell an amount of a specific debt security at a future date at a specific price in addition an underlying fund may purchase and sell currency futures or commodity futures a

into a variety of swap agreements including equity interest rate and index and currency rate swap agreements an underlying fund is not limited to any particular form of swap agreement if the relevant underlying fund manager determines that other forms are consistent with that underlying funds investment objectives and policies  swap agreements are contracts entered into by two parties primarily institutional investors for periods ranging from a few weeks to more than a year in a standard swap transaction the parties agree to exchange the returns or differentials in rates of return earned or realized on particular predetermined investments or instruments which may be adjusted for an interest factor the gross returns to be exchanged or swapped between the parties are generally calculated with respect to a notional amount ie  the return on or increase in value of a particular dollar amount invested at a particular interest rate in a particular foreign currency or in a basket of securities representing a particular index additional forms of swap agreements include i interest rate caps under which in return for a premium one party agrees to make payments to the other to the extent interest rates exceed a specified rate or cap ii interest rate floors under which in return for a premium one party agrees to make payments to the other to the extent interest rates fall below a specified level or floor and iii interest rate collars under which a party sells a cap and purchases a floor or vice versa in an attempt to protect itself against interest rate movements exceeding certain minimum or maximum levels   generally an underlying funds obligations or rights under a swap agreement will be equal only to the net amount to be paid or received under the agreement based on

commodity pool operator   on november   the cftc staff issued a temporary noaction relief from commodity pool operator  cpo  registration to operators of funds of funds  temporary cftc relief   the temporary relief expires six months after the cftc staff issues revised guidance on the application of the trading restrictions applicable to operators of funds of funds registered with the sec that wish to qualify for the exclusion from the definition of a cpo under cftc regulation   the cftc has not yet proposed any guidance on the application of cftc regulation  to funds of funds and as a result the ongoing compliance implications are still uncertain  it is possible that the advisor could be limited in its ability to invest in underlying funds that use futures or options on futures or engage in swaps transactions to qualify for the exclusion under cftc regulation    in the event the advisor fails to qualify for the exclusion from cpo registration requirements under cftc regulation  upon expiration of the temporary cftc relief and is required to register with the cftc as a cpo it will become subject to various disclosure recordkeeping and reporting requirements applicable to registered cpos and will likely be required to provide to the investors certified annual reports prepared in accordance with the relevant cftc regulations which may increase the funds expenses   table

participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk for example the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value including such a pricing model andor the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique inputs may be observable or unobservable observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants

surrounding circumstances which may include i the nature and pricing history if any of the security ii whether any dealer quotations for the security are available iii possible valuation methodologies that could be used to determine the fair value of the security iv the recommendation of a portfolio manager of the fund with respect to the valuation of the security v whether the same or similar securities are held by other funds managed by the advisor or other funds and the method used to price the security in those funds vi the extent to which the fair value to be determined for the

that the funds investments will be made without the services of a broker  however the advisor has adopted best execution policies and procedures with respect to using the services of any broker to execute securities trades with respect to the funds investment portfolio specific decisions to purchase or sell securities for the fund are made by the portfolio managers who are employees of the advisor the advisor is authorized by the trustees to allocate the orders placed on behalf of the fund to brokers or dealers who may but need not provide research or statistical material or other services to the fund or the advisor for the funds use such allocation is to be in such amounts and proportions as the advisor may determine  in selecting a broker or dealer to execute each particular transaction the advisor will take the following into consideration the best net price available the reliability integrity and financial condition of the broker or dealer the size of and difficulty in executing the order and the value of the expected contribution of the broker or dealer to the investment performance of the fund on a continuing basis   tax status the following is a summary of certain aspects of the taxation of the fund that should be considered by a potential purchaser of shares in the fund  a complete discussion of all tax aspects of an investment in the fund is beyond the scope of this memorandum  the following summary is only intended to identify and discuss certain tax issues   this summary of certain tax considerations applicable to the fund is considered to be a correct interpretation of existing laws and regulations in force on the date of this memorandum  no assurance can be given that changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation will not occur after the date of this memorandum or that any such future guidance or interpretation will not be applied retroactively   the following summary is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning  the tax matters relating to the fund are complex and are subject to varying interpretations  moreover the effect of existing income tax laws and of proposed changes in income tax laws on shareholders will vary with the particular circumstances of each shareholder  accordingly each prospective investor must consult with and rely solely on the prospective investors professional tax advisers with respect to the tax results of the prospective investors investment in the fund  in no event will the advisor their respective affiliates counsel or other professional advisers be liable to any shareholder for any federal state local or other tax consequences of an investment in the fund whether or not such consequences are as described below   notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this memorandum each shareholder and each employee representative or other agent of such shareholder as applicable may disclose to any and all persons without limitation of any kind the us federal and state tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions described herein or contemplated hereunder and all materials of any kind that are provided to the shareholder relating to such tax treatment and tax structure  for this purpose tax structure is limited to facts relevant to the us federal and state tax treatment of the transaction and does not include information relating to the identity of the parties their affiliates agents or advisers   classification of the fund   under the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the  code  and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder  regulations  as in effect on the date of this memorandum so long as the fund complies with the memorandum and does not make an election to be taxed as a corporation the fund expects to be classified for us federal income tax purposes as a partnership and not as an association taxable as a corporation table of contents  part b statement of additional information  the fund has not sought and will not seek a ruling from the irs or a tax opinion with respect to its status as a partnership if the fund were to be classified as an association taxable as a corporation the taxable income of the fund would be subject to corporate income taxation when recognized by the fund and distributions from the fund to the shareholders would be treated as dividend income when received by the shareholders to the extent of the current or accumulated earnings and profits of the fund  in addition shareholders would not be able to report profits and losses realized by the fund   certain publicly traded partnerships are treated as associations that are taxable as corporations for us federal income tax purposes  a publicly traded partnership is any partnership the interests in which are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof  under the regulations interests in a partnership are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof if taking into account all of the facts and circumstances the partners are readily able to buy sell or exchange their partnership interests in a manner that is economically comparable to trading on an established securities market   shares in the fund will not be traded on an established securities market  regulations concerning the classification of partnerships as publicly traded partnerships provide certain safe harbors under which interests in a partnership will not be considered readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof  depending on the number of shareholders the fund may qualify for a safe harbor exemption for partnerships that are offered to investors in a private placement  the fund will not qualify for this safe harbor under the regulations if the fund has more than one hundred  shareholders taking into account as shareholders persons who are owners of trusts partnerships and other pass through entities that hold shares  under the regulations certain plans of withdrawal of partnership interests may cause a partnership to be treated as a publicly traded partnership  under the memorandum the fund has sole discretion to refuse to allow a shareholder to withdraw its shares if such withdrawal would in the funds opinion cause the fund to be treated as a publicly traded partnership  the fund expects that under the facts and circumstances test set forth in the regulations the shares should not be readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and therefore the fund expects not to be treated as a publicly traded partnership under the regulations  however the fund has not sought and will not seek a ruling from irs or a tax opinion with respect to whether the fund is a publicly traded partnership    if the fund were treated as a publicly traded partnership then the shareholders would be subject to the tax consequences discussed in the preceding paragraph regarding additional taxes imposed on the funds income its distributions being treated as dividends and the inability of the shareholders to deduct losses of the fund   in addition the board believes that the fund will avoid treatment as a publicly traded partnership by qualifying for the passivetype income exception found in the code  in order to meet the exception the advisor intends that at least ninety percent  of the funds gross income for any taxable year will consist of qualifying income  qualifying income for the purposes of the exception includes interest dividends and gains from the sale or disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies   it is assumed in the following discussion of tax considerations that the fund will be taxed as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes   taxation of fund operations   if the fund is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes the fund will not be subject to us federal income tax  the fund will file an annual partnership information return with the irs  each shareholder is required to report separately on the shareholders income tax return the respective distributive share of the funds net long‑term capital gain or loss net short‑term capital gain or loss net ordinary income deductions and credits  the fund may utilize a variety of investment and trading strategies which produce both short‑term and long‑term capital gain or loss as well as ordinary income or loss  the fund will send annually to each shareholder a form showing its respective distributive share of the fund items of income gain loss deduction or credit   table of contents  part b statement of additional information  each shareholder will be subject to tax and liable for such tax on its distributive share of the funds taxable income or gains regardless of whether the shareholder has received or will receive any distribution of cash from the fund  the fund is not obligated and does not intend to make any cash distributions to the shareholder each year  thus in any particular year a shareholders distributive share of taxable income or gain from the fund and possibly the taxes imposed on that income could exceed the amount of cash if any it receives or is entitled to withdraw from the fund   under section  of the code a shareholders distributive share of any fund item of income gain loss deduction or credit is governed by the memorandum unless the allocation provided by the memorandum does not have substantial economic effect the regulations promulgated under section b of the code provide certain safe harbors with respect to allocations which under the regulations will be deemed to have substantial economic effect  the validity of an allocation which does not satisfy any of the safe harbors of these regulations is determined by taking into account all facts and circumstances relating to the economic arrangements among the partners  while no assurance can be given the allocations provided by the memorandum should have substantial economic effect and should be sustained under the facts and circumstances test  however if it were determined by the irs or otherwise that the allocations provided in the memorandum with respect to a particular item do not have substantial economic effect each shareholders distributive share of that item would be determined for tax purposes in accordance with that shareholders interest in the fund taking into account all facts and circumstances   a shareholders distributive share of the funds losses including a capital loss will be allowed only to the extent of the adjusted tax basis of such shareholders interest in the fund at the end of such funds tax year in which such loss occurred  any excess of such loss over such adjusted tax basis will be allowed as a deduction at the end of the funds tax year in which the shareholders adjusted tax basis is increased by a capital contribution or an allocation of income or gain   cash distributions and withdrawals to the extent they i do not exceed a shareholders adjusted tax basis in its interest in the fund and ii do not represent a relinquishment of a shareholders interest in unrealized receivables including untaxed market discount as determined under the regulations should not result in taxable gain to that shareholder but will reduce the adjusted tax basis in the shareholders interest in the fund by the amount distributed or withdrawn  cash distributed to a shareholder in excess of the adjusted tax basis of the respective shareholders interest in the fund is generally taxable either as capital gain or ordinary income depending on the circumstances   a distribution of property from a partnership is generally not taxable except that a distribution consisting of marketable securitiesas defined under section c of the code generally is recharacterized as a distribution of cash rather than property unless the distributing partnership is an investment partnership and the recipient is an eligible partner within the meaning of section cc of the code  the fund will determine at the appropriate time whether the fund qualifies as an investment partnership and if the shareholder is an eligible partner  a shareholder will qualify as an eligible partner if prior to the funds distribution of marketable securities the shareholders contributions to the fund consisted solely of cash if the fund qualifies as an investment partnership a distribution of marketable securities to a shareholder who is an eligible partner will be treated as a distribution of property and not recharacterized as a distribution of cash   in the event a shareholder withdraws all of the capital in its capital account from the fund the board may in its sole discretion allocate specially an amount of the funds taxable gains or losses to the withdrawing shareholder to the extent that the shareholders capital account exceeds or is less than its federal income tax basis in its interest in the fund  there can be no assurance that if the fund makes such a special allocation the irs will accept such allocation  if such allocation is successfully challenged by the irs the funds gains allocable to the remaining shareholders would be increased   table of contents  part b statement of additional information  a shareholder receiving a cash liquidating distribution from the fund in connection with a complete withdrawal from the fund generally will recognize capital gain or loss to the extent of the difference between the proceeds received by the shareholder and the shareholders adjusted tax basis in its interest in the fund  the capital gain or loss will be shortterm or longterm depending upon the shareholders holding period for its fund interest  a withdrawing shareholder will however recognize ordinary income to the extent the shareholders allocable share of the funds unrealized receivables exceeds the shareholders basis in the unrealized receivables as determined under the regulations  for these purposes accrued but untaxed market discount if any on securities held by the fund will be treated as an unrealized receivable with respect to which a withdrawing shareholder would recognize ordinary income   pursuant to various antideferral provisions of the code the subpart f and passive foreign investment company  pfic  provisions investments by the fund in certain foreign corporations may cause a shareholder to i recognize taxable income prior to the funds receipt of distributable proceeds ii pay an interest charge on receipts that are deemed as having been deferred or iii recognize ordinary income that but for the antideferral provisions would have been treated as longterm or shortterm capital gain  in particular although the fund will attempt to monitor its investments in order to determine whether or not it has invested in any pfics it is not always possible to determine whether or not a particular nonus company is a pfic   if the fund invests in a pfic a shareholder may be able to make an election to have the pfic treated as a qualified electing fund  qef  in which event such shareholder will avoid certain of the potential adverse consequences referred to above and instead will be taxed currently on its proportionate share of the ordinary earnings and net long term capital gains of the pfic whether or not the earnings or gains are distributed  however there is no assurance that the fund will be able to obtain from any company that is a pfic the necessary information on an annual basis in order to permit shareholders in the fund to file an election with the irs to treat any such pfic as a qef  a shareholder also may have the option to elect to mark stock in a pfic to market at the end of every year provided the pfic stock is considered marketable under applicable regulations  all such marktomarket gains and losses to the extent allowed will be considered ordinary income  however this election may not be available for certain types of investments made by the fund  effective for payments after december   subject to a limited transition rule the foreign account tax compliance act  fatca  imposes withholding at a  rate on payments to i a foreign financial institution unless such foreign financial institution agrees to verify report and disclose its us accountholders and meet certain other specified requirements or ii a nonfinancial foreign entity that is the beneficial owner of the payment unless a such entity is a publicly traded corporation or other exempt payee or b such entity certifies that it does not have any substantial us owners or provides the name address and taxpayer identification number of each substantial us owner and such entity meets certain other specified requirements transition relief i exempts certain grandfathered obligations outstanding on january   from fatca withholding and ii delays fatca withholding on interest and dividends to interest and dividends paid after december   and on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of stock to amounts paid after december    potential investors must consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of fatca for their investment in the funds stock   limitations on losses and deductions   section  of the code limits certain taxpayers losses from certain activities to the amount they are at risk in the activities  taxpayers subject to the at risk rules are individuals s corporations and certain closely‑held corporations  the activities subject to the at risk limitations are all activities engaged in by a taxpayer in carrying on a trade or business or for the production of income  a shareholder subject to the at risk rules will not be permitted to deduct in any year losses arising from such shareholders interest in the fund to the extent the losses exceed the amount he is considered to have at risk in the fund at the close of that year   a taxpayer is considered to be at risk in any activity to the extent of its cash contribution to the activity its adjusted tax basis in other property contributed to the activity and its personal liability for repayments of amounts borrowed for use in the activity  with respect to amounts borrowed for use in the activity the taxpayer is not considered to be at risk even if its is personally liable for repayment if the borrowing was from a person who has an interest in the activity other than an interest as a creditor  even if a taxpayer is personally liable for repayment of amounts borrowed for use in the activity and even if the amount borrowed is borrowed from a person whose only interest in the activity is an interest as a creditor a taxpayer will not be considered at risk in the activity to the extent its investment in the activity is protected against loss through nonrecourse financing guarantees stop loss agreements or other similar arrangements   table of contents  part b statement of additional information  each shareholder will be at risk initially for the amount of his capital contribution  a shareholders amount at risk will be increased by its income from the fund and will be decreased by its losses from the fund and distributions to it  if a shareholders amount at risk decreases to zero it can take no further losses until it has an at risk amount to cover the losses  a shareholder is subject to a recapture of losses previously allowed to the extent that its amount at risk is reduced below zero limited to loss amounts previously allowed to the shareholder over any amounts previously recaptured  the potential recapture effects of distributions of fund debts if any are uncertain the code restricts the deductibility of losses from a passive activity against certain income that is not derived from a passive activity  this restriction applies to individuals personal service corporations and certain closely held corporations  under regulations portfolio income earned by the fund generally will not constitute income or loss from a passive activity  generally portfolio income includes  interest dividends annuities and royalties not derived from an ordinary trade or business  gains and losses other than derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business from the disposition of property that either produces the kind of income described in  above or is held for investment  passive losses from other sources generally may not be deducted against a shareholders share of such income and gain from the fund  income or loss attributable to the funds investment in a partnership engaged in a nonsecurities trade or business may however constitute passive activity income or loss   all securities held by the fund will be marked to market at the end of each accounting period and the net gain or loss from marking to market will be reported as income or loss for financial statement presentation and capital account maintenance purposes  this treatment is inconsistent with the general tax rule applicable to many securities transactions that a transaction does not result in gain or loss until it is closed by an actual sale or other disposition  the divergence between such accounting and general tax treatments frequently may result in substantial variation between financial statement income or loss and taxable income or loss reported by the fund   to the extent that the fund has interest expense a non‑corporate shareholder will likely be subject to the investment interest expense limitations of section d of the code  investment interest expense is interest paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry property held for investment  the deduction for investment interest expense is limited to net investment income ie the excess of investment income over investment expenses  excess investment interest expense that is disallowed is not lost permanently but may be carried forward to succeeding years subject to the section d limitation  net capital gain ie net long‑term capital gain over net short‑term capital loss on property held for investment and qualified dividends are only included in investment income to the extent the taxpayer elects to subject some or all of such gain to taxation at ordinary income tax rates  if some or all of the funds operations do not constitute a trade or business for purposes of section d of the code then the section d limitations will apply at the partner level with regard to the funds interest expense  whether all or any portion of the funds operations constitutes a trade or business is a question of fact  as the funds operations may encompass a variety of strategies the fund cannot predict to what extent its operations will constitute a trade or business  further even if the funds operations constitute a trade or business the position may possibly be taken by irs that the investment interest expense while subject to the section d limitation is not an itemized deduction   section a of the code disallows any deduction for interest paid by a taxpayer on indebtedness incurred or continued for the purpose of purchasing or carrying tax‑exempt obligations  the irs has announced that such purpose will be deemed to exist with respect to indebtedness incurred to finance a portfolio investment and that a limited partnership interest will be regarded as a portfolio investment  therefore if the fund holds tax‑exempt obligations the irs might take the position that all or part of the interest paid by such shareholder in connection with the purchase of each respective shareholders shares should be viewed as incurred to enable such shareholder to continue carrying tax‑exempt obligations and that such shareholder should not be allowed to deduct all or a portion of such interest   table of contents  part b statement of additional information  under section  of the code for a noncorporate shareholder certain miscellaneous itemized deductions are allowed only to the extent they exceed a floor amount equal to  of adjusted gross income  if or to the extent that the funds operations do not constitute a trade or business within the meaning of section  and other provisions of the code a noncorporate shareholders distributive share of the funds investment expenses other than investment interest expense would be deductible only as miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the  floor  in addition under section  of the code the ability of an individual with an adjusted gross income in excess of specified amounts to deduct certain itemized deductions is restricted  under such provision investment expenses in excess of  of adjusted gross income may only be deducted to the extent such excess expenses along with certain other itemized deductions not including investment interest expense exceed the lesser of i  of the excess of the individuals adjusted gross income over the specified amount or ii  of the amount of such itemized deductions otherwise allowable for the taxable year  moreover investment interest expenses which are miscellaneous itemized deductions are not deductible by a noncorporate taxpayer in calculating its alternative minimum tax liability   a shareholder may only deduct the shareholders share of the funds losses including capital losses only to the extent of such shareholders adjusted tax basis in the shareholders interest in the fund  capital losses generally may be deducted only to the extent of capital gains except for non‑corporate taxpayers who are allowed to deduct   for married taxpayers filing separate returns of excess capital losses per year against ordinary income  corporate taxpayers may carry back unused capital losses for three  years and may carry forward such losses for five  years non‑corporate taxpayers may not carry back unused capital losses but may carry forward unused capital losses indefinitely   the fund is generally required to adjust its tax basis in its assets in respect of all shareholders in the case of distributions that result in a substantial basis reduction ie in excess of  in respect of the funds property  the fund is also required to adjust its tax basis in its assets in respect of a transferee shareholder in the case of a sale or exchange of an interest or a transfer upon death when there exists a substantial built in loss ie in excess of  in respect of fund property immediately after the transfer  for this reason the fund will require i a shareholder who receives a distribution from the fund in connection with a complete withdrawal ii a transferee of an interest including a transferee in case of death and iii any other shareholder in appropriate circumstances to provide the fund with any information necessary to allow the fund to comply with its obligations to make basis adjustments   tax treatment of funds investments   the fund is expected to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  assuming that the fund is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes it will not be subject to federal income tax but it will be required to file an annual partnership information return with irs reporting the results of its operations  the funds income will include its allocable share of the income gain loss deduction and credit of its partnership investments   the fund expects that the fund will act as a trader or investor and not as a dealer with respect to the funds securities transactions  a trader and an investor are persons who buy and sell securities for their own accounts whereas a dealer is a person who purchases securities for resale to customers rather than for investment or speculation  as noted above unless otherwise indicated references in the discussion to the tax consequences of the funds investments activities income gain and loss include the direct investments activities income gain and loss of the fund  if the fund were considered a dealer or trader in commodities the fund generally would be eligible to use mark to market accounting for federal income tax purposes with respect to the funds commodities investments under section  of the code  if the fund were considered a dealer in securities it would generally be required to use marktomarket accounting and if the fund were considered a trader in securities the fund generally would be eligible to elect to use mark to market accounting for federal income tax purposes with respect to the funds investments under section  of the code  if the fund were required to use marktomarket accounting or if the fund were to elect for the fund to use marktomarket accounting for federal income tax purposes gains and losses from the funds commodities andor securities investments would generally be treated as ordinary income and loss for federal income tax purposes  the following discussion assumes that the fund acts as an investor and is not required to and does not elect to use marktomarket accounting for federal income tax purposes under section  of the code   table of contents  part b statement of additional information  generally gains and losses realized by a trader or an investor on the sale of securities are capital gains and losses  the fund thus expects that the funds gains and losses from its securities transactions typically will be capital gains and capital losses  these capital gains and losses may be longterm or shortterm depending in general upon the length of time the fund maintains a particular investment position and in some cases upon the nature of the transaction  property held for more than one year generally will be eligible for longterm capital gain or loss treatment  special rules however apply to the characterization of capital gain realized with respect to certain regulated futures contracts nonus currency forward contracts and certain options contracts that qualify as or qualify for treatment as section  contracts which are described below  the application of certain rules relating to short sales to socalled straddle and wash sale transactions and to certain nonus regulated contracts and options contracts may serve to alter the manner in which the funds holding period for a security is determined or may otherwise affect the characterization as shortterm or longterm and also the timing of the realization of certain gains or losses  moreover the straddle rules and short sale rules may require the capitalization of certain related expenses of the fund   gain or loss from a short sale of property is generally considered as capital gain or loss to the extent the property used to close the short sale constitutes a capital asset in the funds hands  except with respect to certain situations where the property used by the fund to close a short sale has a long‑term holding period on the date of the short sale special rules would generally treat the gains on short sales as short‑term capital gains  these rules may also terminate the running of the holding period of substantially identical property held by the fund  moreover a loss on a short sale will be treated as a long‑term capital loss if on the date of the short sale substantially identical property has been held by the fund for more than twelve  months   in the case of section  contracts the code generally applies a marktomarket system of taxing unrealized gains and losses on such contracts and otherwise provides for special rules of taxation  a section  contract includes certain regulated futures contracts certain foreign currency contracts and certain options contracts  section  contracts   a regulated futures contract means a contract  with respect to which the amount required to be deposited and the amount which may be withdrawn depends upon a system of marking to market and  which is traded on or subject to the rules of a qualified board or exchange  a foreign currency contract means a contract  which requires delivery of or the settlement of which depends on the value of a foreign currency which is a currency in which positions are also traded through regulated futures contracts  which is traded on the interbank market and  which is entered into at arms length at a price determined by reference to the price on the interbank market  a nonequity option means any listed option which is not an equity option  ie  an option to buy or sell stock or the value of which is determined directly or indirectly by reference to any stock or any narrowly based security index as defined in section a of the securities exchange act of    the doddfrank act provides that all standardized swap transactions between swap dealers and major swap participants must be cleared and traded on an exchange or electronic platform  the fund may be treated as either a swap dealer or a major swap participant  section  of the doddfrank act defines a swap as including among others the following types of derivatives  a put call cap floor collar or similar option of any kind that is for the purchase or sale or based on the value of one or more interest or other rates currencies commodities securities instruments of indebtedness indices quantitative measures or other financial or economic interests or property of any kind   any agreement contract or transaction commonly known as an interest rate swap a rate floor a rate cap a rate collar a crosscurrency rate swap a basis swap a currency swap a foreign exchange swap a total return swap an equity index swap a debt index swap a debt swap a credit spread a credit default swap a credit swap a weather swap an energy swap a metal swap an agricultural swap an emissions swap and a commodity swap or  an agreement contract or transaction that is or in the future becomes commonly known to the trade as a swap  as a result of being traded on or subject to an exchange these types of derivatives may be treated as section  contracts   table of contents  part b statement of additional information  however section  of the doddfrank act amended section  of the code to provide that a section  contract does not include  any securities futures contract or option on such contract unless such contract or option is a dealer securities futures contract or  any interest rate swap currency swap basis swap interest rate cap interest rate floor commodity swap equity swap equity index swap credit default swap or similar agreement   under these rules section  contracts held by the fund at the end of each taxable year of the fund are treated for federal income tax purposes as if they were sold by the fund for their fair market value on the last business day of such taxable year  the net gain or loss if any resulting from such deemed sales known as marktomarket together with any gain or loss resulting from termination or transfer of the taxpayers obligations or rights with respect to a section  contract by offsetting by taking or making delivery by exercise or being exercised by assignment or being assigned by lapse or otherwise must be taken into account by the fund in computing its taxable income for such year  if a section  contract held by the fund at the end of a taxable year is sold in the following year the amount of any gain or loss realized on such sale will be adjusted to reflect the gain or loss previously taken into account under the mark to market rules   capital gains and losses from section  contracts generally are characterized as short‑term capital gains or losses to the extent of forty percent  thereof and as long‑term capital gains or losses to the extent of sixty percent  thereof  such gains and losses will be taxed under the general rules described above   the code allows a taxpayer to elect to offset gains and losses from positions that are part of a mixed straddle a mixed straddle is any straddle in which one or more but not all positions are section  contracts and with respect to each position forming part of such straddle is clearly identified before the close of the day on which the first section  contract forming part of the straddle is acquired or such earlier time as the secretary may prescribe by regulations as being part of such straddle  the fund may be eligible to elect to establish one or more mixed straddle accounts for certain of its mixed straddle trading positions   section  of the code states that any foreign currency gain or loss attributable to a section  transaction will be computed separately and treated as ordinary income or loss  included in a section  transaction is the acquisition of or becoming an obligor under a debt instrument accruing an item of expense or income which is to be paid or received after the date of such accrual or entering into or acquiring any forward contract futures contract option or similar financial instrument where the taxpayer as a result is entitled to receive or required to pay an amount which is denominated in a foreign currency or is determined by reference to one or more foreign currencies  in order to avoid the potential of ordinary income treatment an election can be made to treat any foreign currency gain or loss attributable to a forward contract a futures contract or option which is a capital asset but not part of a straddle as capital gain or loss  the fund may make such election so as to avoid ordinary income treatment   the code also provides that entering into a regulated futures contract or nonequity option which would be marked to market under section  of the code shall not be considered a section  transaction so long as the regulated futures contract or nonequity option is held on the last day of the taxable year  section  exception   the code allows taxpayers to elect out of the aforesaid section  exception and the fund will make any decision concerning the section  exception in its sole and absolute discretion   table of contents  part b statement of additional information  if any section  transaction is part of a section  hedging transaction as defined below all transactions which are a part of such section  hedging transactions shall be integrated and treated as a single transaction or otherwise treated consistently under the code  the determination of whether any transaction is a section  transaction shall be determined without regard to whether such transaction would otherwise be markedtomarket under sections  or  of the code and such term shall not include any transaction with respect to whether an election is made to treat a forward contract a futures contract or option as capital gain or loss  a section  hedging transaction means any transaction  entered into by the taxpayer primarily either a to manage the risk of currency fluctuations with respect to property which is held or to be held by the taxpayer or b to manage the risk of currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made or obligations incurred or to be incurred by the taxpayer and  identified by the treasury secretary or the taxpayer as being a section  hedging transaction  if a qualifying debt instrument and a hedging transaction qualify for integrated treatment then the two are treated as a single synthetic debt instrument that is subject to the original issue discount rules under section e and sections  of the code   section  of the code requires that the fund recognize gain on the constructive sale of any appreciated financial position in stock a partnership interest or certain debt instruments  a constructive sale of an appreciated financial position occurs if among other things the fund  enters into a short sale of the same or substantially identical property a transaction commonly known as a short sale against the box  enters into an offsetting notional principal contract with respect to the same or substantially identical property  enters into a futures or forward contract to deliver the same or substantially identical property  in the case of an appreciated financial position that is a short sale or a contract described in subparagraphs  or  above with respect to any property acquires the same or substantially identical property or  to the extent prescribed by the secretary of the treasury in regulations enters into one or more transactions or acquires one or more positions that have substantially the same effect as the transaction described in any of subparagraphs    or  above  exceptions to the foregoing apply to certain transactions if i the transaction closed within  days after the close of the taxable year  the taxpayer holds the appreciated financial position throughout the day period beginning on the date such transaction is closed and  at no time during such day period is the taxpayers risk of loss with respect to such position reduced by reason of a circumstance which would be described in section c of the code if references to stock included references to such positions  an exception also applies to transactions involving contracts to sell stock debt instruments or partnership interests which are not marketable securities as defined in section f of the code if the contract settles within one year   the irs may treat certain positions in securities held directly or indirectly by a shareholder and its indirect interest in similar securities held by the fund as straddles for federal income tax purposes  the application of the straddle rules in such a case could affect a shareholders holding period for the securities involved and may defer the recognition of losses with respect to such securities  in addition if either of the shareholders positions in such a transaction is an appreciated financial position application of the straddle rules may trigger a constructive sale of that position under the rules described above   section  of the code recharacterizes capital gain from a conversion transaction as ordinary income with certain limitations  conversion transactions are defined as transactions in which substantially all the expected return is attributable to the time value of money and a the transaction consists of the acquisition of property by the taxpayer and a substantially contemporaneous agreement to sell the same or substantially identical property in the future but only if such property was acquired and such contract was entered into on a substantially contemporaneous basis b the transaction qualifies as a straddle within the meaning of section c of the code c the transaction is one that was marketed or sold to the taxpayer on the basis that it would have the economic characteristics of a loan but the interest‑like return would be taxed as capital gain or d the transaction is described as a conversion transaction in regulations  the amount of gain so recharacterized will not exceed applicable imputed income amount as defined under section b of the code   table of contents  part b statement of additional information  payments of interest on a note including qualified stated interest on a discount note each as defined below generally will be taxable to a us holder as ordinary interest income at the time such payments are accrued or received in accordance with the us holders method of accounting for federal income tax purposes   a note with a term greater than one year may be issued with original issue discount for federal income tax purposes ie a discount note  generally original issue discount will arise if the stated redemption price at maturity generally the payments to be made under the note other than payments of qualified stated interest of a note exceeds its issue price by more than a de minimis amount of at least a quarter of one percent  of the stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity or if the note has certain interest payment characteristics eg interest holidays interest payable in debt of the issuer stepped interest rates or interest rates based upon multiple indices  the issue price of notes that are issued for cash will be the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes in the issue are sold for money for this purpose sales to bond houses brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters placement agents or wholesalers are ignored   qualified stated interest generally is stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or property other than a debt instrument of the issuer at least annually at a single fixed rate appropriately taking into account the length of the intervals of the payments with certain exceptions for lower rates paid during some periods  if a note is with original issue discount a us holder will be required to include original issue discount amounts in gross income on an accrual basis using the constant yield to maturity method and as a result a shareholder may be required to include these amounts in income in advance of the funds receipt of cash payments to which such amounts are attributable  any amounts included in income as original issue discount with respect to a note will increase a shareholders adjusted tax basis in his interest in the fund  correspondingly any payments of original issue discount by the fund will reduce a shareholders adjusted tax basis in his interest in the fund   the amount of original issue discount includible in income by a us holder of a note having original issue discount is determined under section a of the code  however regulations provide special rules for notes that provide for one or more alternative payment schedules applicable upon the occurrence of a contingency or contingencies including optional redemption and for notes that are floating rate notes contingent payment debt instruments or shortterm obligations  additionally a us holder who purchases a discount note for an amount that is greater than its adjusted issue price but equal to or less than its stated redemption price at maturity will be considered to have purchased the note at an acquisition premium  under the acquisition premium rules the amount of original issue discount which the us holder must include in its gross income with respect to the note for any taxable year will be reduced by the portion of the acquisition premium properly allocable to the taxable year  a us holder who purchases a note for an amount in excess of the notes stated redemption price at maturity or earlier call date as applicable will be considered to have purchased the note at a premium  a us holder may generally elect to amortize this premium over the remaining term of the note or until the earlier call date on a constant yield method with a corresponding decrease in its tax basis in the note  investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules   if a note is issued with de minimis original issue discount the us holder generally must include any de minimis original issue discount in income at maturity unless the us holder elects to treat all interest as original issue discount  under the regulations a us holder may elect to treat all interest on any note as original issue discount and calculate the amount includable in gross income under the constant yield method  for the purposes of this election interest includes stated interest acquisition discount original issue discount de minimis original issue discount market discount de minimis market discount and unstated interest as adjusted by any amortizable bond premium or acquisition premium  if the fund makes this election for a note with market discount or amortizable bond premium the election is treated as an election under the market discount or amortizable bond premium provisions and the fund will be required to amortize bond premium or include market discount in income currently for all of the funds other debt instruments with market discount or amortizable bond premium  the election is to be made for the taxable year in which the fund acquired the note and may not be revoked without the consent of the irs  investors should consult with their own tax advisors about this election  any amount of de minimis original issue discount that has not been included in income prior to sale exchange or retirement of a note will be treated as capital gain   table of contents  part b statement of additional information  if the fund purchases a note other than a discount note for an amount that is less than its issue price or in the case of a discount note for an amount that is less than its adjusted issue price as of the purchase date ie revised issue price the amount of the difference will be treated as market discount for federal income tax purposes unless the difference is less than a specified de minimis amount  under the market discount rules of the code the fund will be required to treat any partial principal payment on or any gain on the sale exchange retirement or other taxable disposition of a note as ordinary income to the extent that any market discount has accrued with respect to the note and was not previously included in income pursuant to an election by the fund to include any market discount in income as it accrues at the time of such disposition  market discount is accrued on a straightline basis unless the fund elects to accrue market discount under a constant yield method  if the note is disposed of in a nontaxable transaction other than a nonrecognition transaction described in section c of the code the fund will include any accrued market discount in ordinary income generally as interest as if the fund had sold the note at its then fair market value  in addition the fund may be required to defer until the maturity of the note or its earlier disposition in a taxable transaction deductions for all or a portion of the interest expense on any indebtedness incurred or maintained to purchase or carry the note unless the fund elects to include market discount in income currently as it accrues  if an election were made to include market discount in income currently as it accrues that election would apply to all debt instruments with market discount acquired by the fund on or after the first day of the first taxable year to which the election applies and may not be revoked without the consent of the irs   except as discussed above upon the sale exchange or retirement of a note held by the fund a shareholder generally will recognize taxable capital gain or loss equal the shareholders distributive share of the difference between the amount realized by the fund on the sale exchange or retirement of the note and the funds adjusted tax basis in the note  the funds adjusted tax basis in a note will equal the funds initial investment in the note increased by any original issue discount included in income and accrued market discount if any if the fund has elected to include market discount in income and decreased by the amount of any payments made with respect to the note other than payments of qualified stated interest and the amount of any amortizable bond premium offset against qualified stated interest with respect to the note  except as described above the gain or loss generally will be long term capital gain or loss if the note is held by the fund for more than one year   under existing case law a debt instrument issued with a lengthy term for example up to fifty  years may be treated as a debt for federal income tax purposes  however the irs has issued a notice that it will scrutinize debt instruments with long maturities particularly those with substantial equity characteristics   tax‑exempt investors   if the fund derives income which would be considered unrelated business taxable income  ubti  as defined in section  of the code if derived directly by a shareholder which is an organization exempt from tax under section a of the code or an ira such shareholders allocable share of the funds income would be subject to tax  a tax‑exempt organization which is subject to tax on its allocable share of the funds ubti including an ira may also be subject to the alternative minimum tax with respect to items of tax preference which enter into the computation of ubti   ubti is generally the excess of gross income from any unrelated trade or business conducted by an exempt organization or by a partnership of which the exempt organization is a member over the deductions attributable to such trade or business  ubti generally does not include dividends interest annuities royalties and gain or loss from the disposition of property other than stock in trade or property held for sale in the ordinary course of the trade or business   while ubti itself is taxable the receipt of ubti by a tax‑exempt entity generally has no effect upon that entitys tax‑exempt status or upon the exemption from tax of its other income  however for certain types of tax‑exempt entities the receipt of any ubti may have extremely adverse consequences  in particular for charitable remainder trusts defined under section  of the code the receipt of any taxable income from ubti during a taxable year will result in the imposition of an excise tax on the trust equal to the amount of the ubti   table of contents  part b statement of additional information  a tax‑exempt organization under section  a of the code and an ira is also taxed on its and its allocable share of the funds unrelated debtfinanced income pursuant to section  of the code  udfi   in general udfi consists of i income derived by a tax‑exempt organization directly or through a partnership from income producing property with respect to which there is acquisition indebtedness at any time during the taxable year and ii gains derived by a tax‑exempt organization directly or through a partnership from the disposition of property with respect to which there is acquisition indebtedness  such income and gains derived by a tax‑exempt organization from the ownership and sale of debt‑financed property are taxable in the proportion to which such property is financed by acquisition indebtedness during the relevant period of time   the fund or an underlying fund may use leverage with the result that a shareholder which is a taxexempt organization or an ira should expect to be subject to tax on the proportion of its distributive share of the funds income that is udfi  in addition to the extent a taxexempt organization borrows money to finance its investment in the fund such organization would be subject to tax on the portion of its income which is udfi even though such income may constitute an item otherwise excludable from ubti such as dividends   state taxes   in addition to the federal income tax consequences described above prospective investors should consider potential state tax consequences of an investment in the fund  no attempt is made herein to provide a discussion of such state tax consequences  state laws often differ from federal income tax laws with respect to the treatment of specific items of income gain loss deduction and credit  each prospective investor must consult the prospective investors own tax advisers regarding such state tax consequences   other taxes   certain us persons including individuals estates and trusts may be subject to an additional  medicare tax on unearned income  for individuals the additional medicare tax applies to the lesser of i net investment income or ii the excess of modified adjusted gross income over   if married and filing jointly or  if married and filing separately  a us persons net investment income will generally include its interest dividends and capital gains unless such interest dividends or capital gains are derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business other than a trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities  if you are a us person that is an individual estate or trust you must consult your tax advisors regarding the applicability of the medicare tax to your income and gains in respect of your investment in the fund   shareholders may be subject to other taxes such as the alternative minimum tax state and local income taxes and estate inheritance or intangible property taxes that may be imposed by various jurisdictions  each prospective investor should consider the potential consequences of such taxes on an investment in the fund  it is the responsibility of each prospective investor to become satisfied as to the legal and tax consequences of an investment in the fund under state law including the laws of the states of the prospective investors domicile and residence by obtaining advice from the prospective investors own tax advisers and to file all appropriate tax returns that may be required   tax elections returns tax audits   the code provides for optional adjustments to the basis of partnership property upon distributions of partnership property to a shareholder and transfers of shares including by reason of death provided that a partnership election has been made pursuant to section  of the code  the board in its sole and reasonable discretion may cause the fund to make such an election any such election once made cannot be revoked without the irss consent   table of contents  part b statement of additional information  additionally section  of the code provides for a mandatory basis adjustment on distributions by partnerships with substantial built in losses which could cause the fund to decrease the basis of assets in such circumstances   if the fund is treated as a securities trader for federal income tax purposes the fund may elect to marktomarket its securities at the end of each taxable year in which case such securities would be treated for federal income tax purposes as though sold for fair market value on the last day of such taxable year  such an election would apply to the taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years unless revoked with the consent of the irs  if the fund were to make such an election a portion of the funds gains and losses would be considered ordinary income or loss rather than capital gain or loss  since for federal income tax purposes capital losses generally may be deducted only against capital gains a shareholder may be unable to deduct capital losses realized from other investments and transactions in a taxable year against his share of the funds income   the fund will decide how to report partnership items on the funds tax returns  since the fund may engage in transactions whose treatment for tax purposes is not clear there is a risk that a claim of tax liability could be asserted against the fund or its partners  in the event the income tax returns of the fund are audited by the irs the tax treatment of fund income and deductions generally is determined at the partnership level in a single proceeding rather than by individual audits of the shareholders  the individual selected by the board as the tax matters partner has considerable authority to make decisions affecting the tax treatment and procedural rights of all shareholders  in addition the tax matters partner has the authority to bind certain shareholders to settlement agreements and the right on behalf of all shareholders to extend the statute of limitations relating to the shareholders tax liabilities with respect to fund items   the treasury department has adopted regulations designed to assist the irs in identifying abusive tax shelter transactions  in general the regulations require investors in specified transactions to satisfy certain special tax filing and record retention requirements the regulations in their current form are extraordinarily broad in scope and could apply to a holder of an interest in a hedge fund or other ordinary pooled investment vehicle even though the fund or vehicle like the fund has not been organized to create any tax benefits for its shareholders  significant monetary penalties apply to a failure to comply with these tax filing and record retention rules  in addition states may have similar tax filing and record retention requirements   the treasury department has indicated that it may issue additional guidance designed to limit the application of the regulations to investors in nontax motivated investment vehicles such as the fund  however no assurance can be provided that such regulations will be issued or will apply to exclude investors in the fund from the requirements of the regulations  in the absence of additional favorable guidance shareholders in the fund should assume they could be subject to the special tax filing and record retention rules of the regulations and should consult their own tax advisors about any applicable tax filing and record retention requirements  the fund intends to provide information to shareholders necessary to satisfy any tax filing requirements that may arise as a result of an investment in the fund   in addition if the fund participates in a transaction that requires disclosure to the irs the fund and other material advisors to the fund may each be required to file information returns with the irs and it may be necessary to maintain a list of investors and a detailed description of the fund its activities and the expected us federal income tax consequences to its investors in addition to certain other information  if such lists and information must be maintained under the regulations it must be available to the irs for inspection upon its written request   table of contents  part b statement of additional information  other matters   the fund may incur certain expenses in connection with its organization of interests  the fund may elect to claim a deduction in the taxable year it begins business equal to the lesser of a the organizational expenses paid or incurred or b five thousand dollars  reduced but not below zero by the amount of organizational expenses exceeding fifty thousand dollars  the remaining organizational expenses will be amortized over a period of twelve  months from the date the fund commences operations amounts paid or incurred to market interests in a partnership syndication expenses are not deductible   special considerations for partners who are not us persons   a us person is a a citizen or resident of the united states b a corporation partnership or other entity organized under the laws of the united states any state or the district of columbia other than a partnership that is not treated as a us person under the regulations c an estate whose income is subject to united states income tax regardless of its source or d a trust if a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or to the extent provided in the regulations certain trusts in existence on august   and treated as us persons prior to such date that elect to be treated as us persons   assuming that the fund complies with certain rules and procedures pertaining to the conduct of its affairs including the assumptions indicated above it is anticipated that the income of the shareholders who are not us persons will not be subject to regular us federal income taxes on the basis of net income  but shareholder s who are not us persons will be directly or indirectly subject to us withholding taxes on some of their income including fixed or determinable annual or periodical income such as dividend income considered to be from us sources  generally capital gains and qualified interest such as portfolio interest as defined in section h of the code should not be subject to us withholding tax  the us withholding tax rate is generally thirty percent  subject to reduction under applicable tax treaties  to qualify for the benefits of a tax treaty between the united states and a foreign country the shareholder claiming the benefits provisions must both be a resident of the treaty country and satisfy the limitation on benefits provisions as described in the applicable treaty  a shareholder must provide a completed irs form wben to the fund to claim treaty benefits  although capital gains from the sale of securities should generally not be subject to us withholding tax the sale of certain securities classified as united states real property interests within the meaning of section  of the code including us real property holding corporations may be subject to us income and withholding taxes   future tax legislation   future amendments to the code other legislation new or amended regulations administrative rulings or guidance by the irs or
