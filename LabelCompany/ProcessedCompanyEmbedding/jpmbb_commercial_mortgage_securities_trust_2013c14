base expected losses for conduit and fusion cmbs transactions on moodyscom at httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously expected factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant amount of loan paydowns or amortization an increase in the pools share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the performance of the pool

property quality grade which reflects the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys uses a variation of herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes where a higher number represents greater diversity loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances the credit neutral
