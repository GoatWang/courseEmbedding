of our services there is little precedent or basis of comparison for the aggregated platformbased services that we provide although we have identified what we believe to be a need in the market for our services there can be no assurance that demand or a market will develop or that we will be able to create a viable business our future financial performance will depend at least in part upon the introduction and market acceptance of our services potential customers may be unwilling to accept utilize or recommend any of our proposed services if we are unable to commercialize and market our proposed services when planned we may not achieve any market acceptance or generate revenue we have yet to generate any generated revenue and do not foresee generating any revenue in the near future consequently we will be reliant on external financing we are a startup company and our business model currently focuses obtaining  over the next two months from this offering rather than generating revenue while we intend to generate revenue in the future we cannot assure you when or if we will be able to do so we rely on external financing to fund our operations we anticipate based on our current proposed plans and assumptions relating to our operations including the timetable of and costs associated with new product development that if the minimum amount is raised in this offering it will be sufficient to satisfy our contemplated cash requirements through approximately two months assuming that we do not accelerate the development of other opportunities available to us engage in an extraordinary transaction or otherwise face unexpected events costs or contingencies any of which could affect our cash requirements we expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we expand our infrastructure commercial operations development activities and establish offices our future funding requirements will depend on many factors including but not limited to the following  the cost of expanding our operations  the financial terms and timing of any collaborations licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter  the rate of progress and cost of development activities  the need to respond to technological changes and increased competition  the costs of filing prosecuting defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the cost and delays in product development that may result from changes in regulatory requirements applicable to our products  sales and marketing efforts to bring these new product candidates to market  unforeseen difficulties in establishing and maintaining an effective sales and distribution network and  lack of demand for and market acceptance of our products and technologies we may have difficulty obtaining additional funding and we cannot assure you that additional capital will be available to us when needed if at all or if available will be obtained on terms acceptable to us if we raise additional funds by issuing additional debt securities such debt instruments may provide for rights preferences or privileges senior to the securities in addition the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations if we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us if adequate funds are not available we may have to delay scale back or eliminate some of our operations or our research development and commercialization activities under these circumstances if the company is unable to acquire additional capital or is required to raise it on terms that are less satisfactory than desired it may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition we have no operating history upon which you can evaluate our performance and accordingly our prospects must be considered in light of the risks that any new company encounters we were organized under the laws of delaware on june   accordingly we have no history upon which an evaluation of our prospects and future performance can be made our proposed operations are subject to all business risks associated with new enterprises the likelihood of our creation of a viable business must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the inception of a business operation in a competitive industry and the continued development of advertising promotions and a corresponding client base we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase for the near future there can be no assurances that we will ever operate profitably you should consider the companys business operations and prospects in light of the risks expenses and challenges faced as an earlystage company in order for the company to compete and grow it must attract recruit retain and develop the necessary personnel who have the needed experience recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel is critical to our success these demands may require us to hire additional personnel and will require our existing management personnel to develop additional expertise we face intense competition for personnel the failure to attract and retain personnel or to develop such expertise could delay or halt the development and commercialization of our product candidates if we experience difficulties in hiring and retaining personnel in key positions we could suffer from delays in product development loss of customers and sales and diversion of management resources which could adversely affect operating results our consultants and advisors may be employed by third parties and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with third parties that may limit their availability to us the development and commercialization of our services is highly competitive we face competition with respect to any products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future our competitors include major companies worldwide many of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and human resources than we have and superior expertise in developing and marketing entrepreneurs and startup companies and thus may be better equipped than us to develop and commercialize these services these competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies accordingly our competitors may commercialize products more rapidly or effectively than we are able to which would adversely affect our competitive position the likelihood that our services will achieve initial market acceptance and our ability to generate meaningful additional revenues from our products we plan to implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed in developing and marketing new lines of business andor new products and services we may invest significant time and resources initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible we may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or developments in technology or those new products may not achieve market acceptance as a result we could lose business be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients or be subject to cost increases as a result our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected the companys success depends on the experience and skill of the board of directors its executive officers and key employees the company is a startup company and currently only employs two individuals the success of the company will depend on the performance and continued retention of these key employees particularly its president ash kumra the company has or intends to enter into an employment agreement with mr kumra although there can be no assurance that it will do so or that mr kumra or any member of the board of directors or executive officer will continue to be employed or engaged by the company for a particular period of time the loss of mr kumra or any member of the board of directors or executive officer would adversely affect the companys business operations financial condition and cash flow the amount of capital the company is attempting to raise in the offering is not enough to sustain the companys current business plan in order to achieve the companys near and longterm goals the company will need to procure funds in addition to the amount raised in the offering there is no guarantee the company will be able to raise such funds on acceptable terms or at all if we are not able to raise sufficient capital in the future we will not be able to execute our business plan our continued operations will be in jeopardy and we may be forced to cease operations and sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our remaining assets which could cause a purchaser to lose all or a portion of his or her investment although dependent on certain key personnel the company does not have any key man life insurance policies on any such individuals while the company is dependent on its two employees in particular its president ash kumra in order to conduct its operations and execute its business plan the company has not purchased any insurance policies with respect to the death or disability of those individuals therefore in the event that any of the companys employees die or become disabled the company will not receive any insurance proceeds as compensation for such persons absence the loss of such person could would negatively affect the company and its operations the proceeds from the offering are necessary to the companys operations without the proceeds of the offering the company will not be able to sustain its operations the company does not have adequate alternative sources of capital and therefore is entirely dependent on this offering if the company has misjudged the amount of capital it needs or needs additional capital in the future it may not be able to obtain such capital and would not be able to continue operations this provides the company with very little financial flexibility to adapt to the market and industry in which it operates this lack of capital and flexibility could harm the company and cause a purchaser to lose all or a portion of his or her investment we have not prepared any audited financial statements investors have no audited financial information regarding the companys capitalization or assets or liabilities on which to make an investment decision if you feel the information provided in this offering is insufficient to make a sound and informed investment you should not invest in the company we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable i there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our income tax provisions expense amounts for nonincome based taxes and accruals and ii any material differences could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in the period or periods for which determination is made we are not subject to sarbanesoxley regulations and lack the financial controls and safeguards required of public companies we do not have the internal infrastructure necessary and are not required to complete an attestation about our financial controls that would be required under section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  there can be no assurance that there are no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the quality of our financial controls we expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of managements time if and when it becomes necessary to perform the system and process evaluation testing and remediation required in order to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements changes in employment laws or regulation could harm our performance various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs these laws include minimum wage requirements overtime pay healthcare reform and the implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act unemployment tax rates workers compensation rates citizenship requirements union membership and sales taxes a number of factors could adversely affect our operating results including additional governmentimposed increases in minimum wages overtime pay paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits mandated training for employees increased tax reporting and tax payment changing regulations from the national labor relations board and increased employee litigation including claims relating to the fair labor standards act maintaining extending and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business success we seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and product innovation increasing attention on marketing could adversely affect our brand image it could also lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of marketing practices existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment we increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media whether or not valid could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not establish maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected the companys products may be generated by thirdparty vendors over which the company has little control product quality concerns could negatively affect the companys business the companys success depends in large part on sales of ecommerce and entertainment products such as digital books and live webinars and other events these products may be manufactured or tickets to company events may be sold by thirdparty vendors instead of by the companys employees while the company intends to implement rigorous standards in selecting vendors and enforcing product quality standards if products taken to market are of poor quality the companys product sales and reputation will suffer we must correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand offer new products to meet those changes and respond to competitive innovation consumer preferences our products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers our sales and market share will decrease we must distinguish between shortterm fads midterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied customer base we must offer an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories demand for our products could decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations in addition achieving growth depends on our successful development introduction and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance to obtain protect and maintain necessary intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of others and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our business evolving tax environmental and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing labeling trade and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition our activities or products both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us federal communications division “fcc” us federal trade commission and the us departments of commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities outside of the united states international accords and treaties and others including voluntary regulation by other bodies these laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change sometimes dramatically as a result of a variety of factors including political economic or social events we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices tax anticorruption standards advertising and claims and environmental matters the need to comply with new evolving or revised tax environmental labeling or other laws or regulations or new or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations further if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions termination of necessary licenses or permits or recalls as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have an adverse effect on our business even if regulatory review does not result in these types of determinations it could potentially create negative publicity or perceptions which could harm our business or reputation changes in government regulation could adversely impact our business the media television internet and entertainment industries are subject to extensive legislation and regulation at the federal and local levels and in some instances at the state level many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial and administrative proceedings legislative and administrative proposals and lobbying efforts by us and our competitors legislation under consideration could entirely rewrite our principal regulatory statute and the fcc andor congress may attempt to change the classification of or change the way that our platform and ecommerce products are regulated andor change the framework under which broadcast signals are carried remove the copyright compulsory license and changing rights and obligations of our competitors we expect that court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to refine our rights and obligations under applicable federal state and local laws which cannot be predicted modifications to existing requirements or imposition of new requirements or limitations could have an adverse impact on our business net neutrality could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations on february   the fcc ruled in favor of net neutrality by reclassifying internet broadband access as a telecommunications service and thus applying title ii common carrier of the communications act of  to internet service providers this new classification could result in increased barriers to entry and costs that we may by necessity pass off to our customers therefore the fcc ruling and its consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations we may not be able to adapt to new content distribution platforms and to changes in consumer behavior resulting from these new technologies we must successfully adapt to technological advances in our industry including the emergence of alternative distribution platforms our ability to exploit new distribution platforms and viewing technologies will affect our ability to maintain or grow our business and may increase our capital expenditures additionally we must adapt to changing consumer behavior driven by advances such as dvrs videoondemand online based content delivery bluray™ players game consoles and mobile devices such changes may impact the revenue we are able to generate from our traditional distribution methods by decreasing the viewership of our networks on cable and other mvpd systems if we fail to adapt our distribution methods and content to emerging technologies our appeal to our targeted audiences might decline and there would be a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations new technologies may make our products and services obsolete or unneeded new and emerging technological advances such as mobile computing devices that allow consumers to obtain information and view content may adversely impact or eliminate the demand for our products and services the increasing availability of content on such devices the improved video quality of the content on such devices and faster wireless delivery speeds may make individuals less likely to purchase our services our success can depend on new product development the entertainment and communications industry is everchanging as new technologies are introduced advances in technology such as new video formats downloading or alternative methods of product delivery and distribution channels such as the internet or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery could have a negative effect on our business these changes could lower cost barriers for our competitors desiring to enter into or expand their presence in the interactive services business increased competition may adversely affect our business and results of operations we face risks relating to competition for the leisure time and discretionary spending of audiences which has intensified in part due to advances in technology and changes in consumer expectations and behavior our business is subject to risks relating to increasing competition for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers we compete with all other sources of entertainment and information delivery technological advancements such as new video formats and internet streaming and downloading of programming that can be viewed on televisions computers and mobile devices have increased the number of entertainment and information delivery choices available to consumers and intensified the challenges posed by audience fragmentation the increasing number of choices available to audiences including lowcost or free choices could negatively impact not only consumer demand for our products and services but also advertisers willingness to purchase advertising from us our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new technologies and changes in consumer expectations and behavior could significantly adversely affect our competitive position and its business and results of operations piracy of the companys content may decrease the revenues received from the sale of our content and adversely affect our businesses the piracy of our content products and other intellectual property poses significant challenges for us technological developments such as the proliferation of cloudbased storage and streaming increased broadband internet speed and penetration and increased speed of mobile data transmission have made it easier to create transmit distribute and store high quality unauthorized copies of content in unprotected digital formats which has in turn encouraged the creation of highly scalable businesses that facilitate and in many instances financially benefit from such piracy piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack effective copyright and technical legal protections or enforcement measures and illegitimate operators based in these parts of the world can attract viewers from anywhere in the world the proliferation of unauthorized copies and piracy of the companys content products and intellectual property or the products it licenses from others could result in a reduction of the revenues that the company receives from the legitimate sale licensing and distribution of its content and products the company devotes substantial resources to protecting its content products and intellectual property but there can be no assurance that the companys efforts to enforce its rights and combat piracy will be successful our success depends on consumer acceptance of our content and we may be adversely affected if our content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase we create and acquire media and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways the success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create acquire market and distribute video streams webinars digital books and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer market we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amounts in our content including in the production of original content before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance we also obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties such as streaming media services freelance writers photographers and other suppliers competition for popular content is intense and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs there can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our cost for the rights as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the content if our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms or at all our businesses may be adversely affected our business could be adversely affected if there is a decline in advertising spending a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could cause current or prospective advertisers to spend less on advertising or spend their advertising dollars in other media advertising expenditures also could be negatively affected by i increasing audience fragmentation caused by increased availability of alternative forms of leisure and entertainment activities ii the increased use of digital video recorders to skip advertisements iii pressure from public interest groups to reduce or eliminate advertising of certain products iv new laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict certain types of advertisements and v natural disasters extreme weather acts of terrorism political uncertainty or hostilities because there may be uninterrupted news coverage of such events that disrupts regular ad placement in addition advertisers willingness to purchase advertising time from the company may be adversely affected by a decline in customers and audience ratings for our content we derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising and a decrease in overall advertising expenditures could lead to a reduction in the amount of advertising that companies are willing to purchase and the price at which they purchase it expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical and have become less predictable in recent years reflecting domestic and global economic conditions if the economic prospects of advertisers or current economic conditions worsen such conditions could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities in particular advertisers in certain industries that are more susceptible to weakness in domestic and global economic conditions such as beauty fashion and retail and food account for a significant portion of our advertising revenues and weakness in these industries could have a disproportionate negative impact on our advertising revenues declines in consumer spending on advertisers products due to weak economic conditions could also indirectly negatively impact our advertising revenues as advertisers may not perceive as much value from advertising if consumers are purchasing fewer of their products or services as a result our advertising revenues are less predictable fluctuations in the mix of customer demand for our various types of solution offerings could impact our financial performance and ability to forecast performance due to fluctuations in customer tastes and general economic conditions customer demand for the range of our offerings varies from time to time and is not predictable for example demand for ecommerce products relating to one particular entrepreneur will depend on a myriad of factors including the success of that entrepreneur amount of publicity and support engendered by the company and the nature of the entrepreneurs business in addition our gross margins vary by customer and by segment and the mix of services provided to our customers could impact our results of operations as certain of our customers and segments have different gross margin profiles generally the profitability of an account increases over time as a result the mix of solutions we provide to our customers varies at any given time both within a quarter and from quartertoquarter these variations in service mix impact gross margins and the predictability of gross margins for any period you should not rely on the results of any one quarter as an indication of our future performance our operating results may fluctuate due to factors that are difficult to forecast and not within our control our past operating results may not be accurate indicators of future performance and you should not rely on such results to predict our future performance our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and could fluctuate in the future factors that may contribute to fluctuations include  changes in aggregate capital spending cyclicality and other economic conditions or domestic and international demand in the industries we serve  our ability to effectively manage our working capital  our ability to satisfy consumer demands in a timely and costeffective manner  pricing and availability of labor and materials  our inability to adjust certain fixed costs and expenses for changes in demand  shifts in geographic concentration of customers supplies and labor pools and  seasonal fluctuations in demand and our revenue if we fail to attract and retain enough sufficiently trained customer service associates and other personnel to support our operations our business and results of operations will be seriously harmed we rely on customer service associates and our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract hire train and retain qualified customer service associates companies in our industry including us experience high employee attrition our attrition rate for our customer service associates who remained with us following a day training and orientation period was on average approximately  per month a significant increase in the attrition rate among our customer service associates could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity our failure to attract train and retain customer service associates with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future clients would seriously harm our business and results of operations our ability to sell our products and services is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and our failure to offer high quality technical support services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations once our products are deployed within our endcustomers operations endcustomers depend on our technical support services to resolve any issues relating to these products if we do not effectively assist our customers in deploying these products succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve postdeployment issues and provide effective ongoing support our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged as a result our failure to maintain high quality support services would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we may be adversely affected by cyclicality volatility or an extended downturn in the united states or worldwide economy or in or related to the industries we serve our revenues are generated primarily from servicing entrepreneurs seeking to hire qualified marketing professionals in the media industry and from customers seeking to purchase ecommerce products relating to such entrepreneurs demand for these professionals tends to be tied to economic and business cycles increases in the unemployment rate specifically in the technology and other vertical industries we serve cyclicality or an extended downturn in the economy could cause our revenues to decline therefore our operating results business and financial condition could be significantly harmed by an extended economic downturn or future downturns especially in regions or industries where our operations are heavily concentrated further we may face increased pricing pressures during such periods as customers seek to use lower cost or fee services which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we are subject to rapid technological change and dependence on new product development our industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological developments frequent new product introductions and enhancements continually evolving business expectations and swift changes to compete effectively in such markets we must continually improve and enhance its products and services and develop new technologies and services that incorporate technological advances satisfy increasing customer expectations and compete effectively on the basis of performance and price our success will also depend substantially upon our ability to anticipate and to adapt our products and services to our collaborative partners preferences there can be no assurance that technological developments will not render some of our products and services obsolete or that we will be able to respond with improved or new products services and technology that satisfy evolving customers expectations failure to acquire develop or introduce new products services and enhancements in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations also to the extent one or more of our competitors introduces products and services that better address a customers needs our business would be adversely affected failure to obtain new clients or renew client contracts on favorable terms could adversely affect results of operations we may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining our entrepreneur and startup clients our clients may be able to seek price reductions from us when they renew a contract when a contract is extended or when the clients business has significant volume changes they may also reduce services if they decide to move services inhouse on some occasions this pricing pressure results in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client this reduction in revenue could result in an adverse effect on our business and results of operations further failure to renew client contracts on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our business our contracts with clients generally run for several years and include liquidated damage provisions that provide for early termination fees terms are generally renegotiated prior to the end of a contracts term if we are not successful in achieving a high rate of contract renewals on favorable terms our business and results of operations could be adversely affected show all risks
