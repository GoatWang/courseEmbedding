certain of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor the depositor has no obligation or ability to ensure that any rating agency performs ratings surveillance in addition a rating agency may cease ratings surveillance if the information furnished to that rating agency is insufficient to allow it to perform surveillance           additionally other nationally recognized statistical rating organizations that we have not engaged to rate the offered certificates may nevertheless issue unsolicited credit ratings on one or more classes of certificates relying on information they receive pursuant to rule g under the securities exchange act of  as amended or otherwise if any such unsolicited ratings are issued we cannot assure you that they will not be different from or lower than any ratings assigned to the offered certificates by any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization the issuance of an unsolicited rating of a class of the offered certificates that is lower than the ratings assigned by the rating agencies engaged by the depositor may adversely impact the liquidity market value and regulatory characteristics of that class as part of the process of obtaining ratings for the offered certificates the depositor had initial discussions with and         s               submitted certain materials to dbrs inc fitch ratings inc kroll bond rating agency inc moody’s investors service inc and morningstar credit ratings llc based on preliminary feedback from those nationally recognized statistical rating organizations at that time the depositor selected moody’s investors service inc fitch ratings inc dbrs inc and kroll bond rating agency inc to rate the offered certificates and not the other nationally recognized statistical rating organization due in part to their initial subordination levels for the various classes of offered and nonoffered certificates had the depositor selected such other nationally recognized statistical rating organization to rate the offered certificates we cannot assure you as to the ratings that such other nationally recognized statistical rating organization would ultimately have assigned to the offered certificates in the case of moody’s investors service inc and fitch ratings inc the depositor only requested ratings for certain classes of rated certificates due in part to the final subordination levels provided by moody’s investors service inc or fitch ratings inc as applicable for such classes of certificates if the depositor had selected either moody’s investors service inc or fitch ratings inc to rate those other classes of rated certificates not rated by it its ratings of those other certificates may have been different and potentially lower than those ratings ultimately assigned to those certificates by dbrs inc and kroll bond rating agency inc although unsolicited ratings may be issued by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization a nationally recognized statistical rating organization might be more likely to issue an unsolicited rating if it was not selected after having provided preliminary feedback to the depositor in addition the decision not to engage moody’s investors service inc and fitch ratings inc in the rating of certain classes of the offered certificates to be issued in connection with this transaction may negatively impact the liquidity market value and regulatory characteristics of those classes of certificates see “risk factors—ratings of the certificates” and “ratings” in this free writing prospectus           in addition neither the depositor nor any other person or entity will be required to monitor any changes to any ratings of the offered certificates or will have any duty to notify you if any other nationally recognized

no event will rating agency confirmations from any such other nationally recognized statistical rating organization except insofar as the matter involves a mortgage loan with a split loan structure and such other rating organization is hired to rate securities backed by the related pari passu companion loan be a condition to any action or the exercise of any right power or privilege by any

organizations engaged by the depositor to rate the offered certificates no longer qualifies as a nationally recognized         s               statistical rating organization or is no longer qualified to rate the offered certificates and that determination may have an adverse effect on the liquidity market value and regulatory characteristics of the offered certificates see “risk factors—ratings of the certificates” and “ratings” in this free writing prospectus          s     risk factors   you should carefully consider the following risks and those risks described in “risk factors” in the accompanying prospectus before making an investment decision in particular distributions on your certificates will depend on payments received on and other recoveries with respect to the mortgage loans therefore you should carefully consider the risk factors relating to the mortgage loans and the mortgaged properties   the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones relating to the offered certificates additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair your investment if any of the following events or circumstances identified as risks actually occur or materialize your investment could be materially and adversely affected this free writing prospectus also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including the risks described below and elsewhere in this free writing prospectus   in connection with the information presented in this free writing prospectus relating to risks that may relate to certain of the mortgage loans or the mortgage loans in general examples are sometimes given with respect to a particular risk and a particular mortgage loan however the fact that examples are given should not be interpreted as meaning that such examples reflect all of the mortgage loans in the trust to which such risk is applicable or that the identified mortgage loan is not subject to other risk factors described in this free writing prospectus   combination or “layering” of multiple risks may significantly increase risk of loss   although the various risks discussed in this free writing prospectus are generally described separately you should consider the potential effects of the interplay of multiple risk factors where more than one significant risk factor is present the risk of loss to an investor in the certificates may be significantly increased   the offered certificates may not be a suitable investment for you   the offered certificates are not suitable investments for all investors in particular you should not purchase any class of offered certificates unless you understand and are able to bear the prepayment credit liquidity and market risks associated with that class of certificates for the reasons set forth in these “risk factors” the yield to maturity and the aggregate amount and timing of distributions on the offered certificates are subject to material variability from period to period and over the life of those certificates the interaction of the foregoing factors and their effects are impossible to predict and are likely to change from time to time as a result an investment in the offered certificates involves substantial risks and uncertainties and should be considered only by sophisticated institutional investors with substantial investment experience with similar types of securities and who have conducted appropriate diligence on the mortgage loans and the offered certificates   the credit crisis and downturn in the real estate market have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the value of commercial mortgagebacked securities   in recent years the real estate and securitization markets including the market for commercial mortgagebacked securities as well as the debt markets global financial markets and the economy generally experienced significant dislocations illiquidity and volatility declining real estate values coupled with diminished availability of leverage andor refinancings for commercial real estate resulted in increased delinquencies and defaults on commercial mortgage loans in addition the most recent downturn in the general economy affected the financial strength of many commercial real estate tenants and resulted in increased rent delinquencies and increased vacancies particularly in the retail sector   any further economic downturn may lead to increased vacancies decreased rents or other declines in income from or the value of commercial real estate which would likely have an adverse effect on the value andor liquidity of commercial mortgagebacked securities that are backed by loans secured by   s     such commercial real estate we cannot assure you that the dislocation in the commercial mortgagebacked securities market will not continue to occur or become more severe even if the commercial mortgagebacked securities market does recover the mortgaged properties and therefore the mortgage loans and the offered certificates may decline in value any further economic downturn may adversely affect the financial resources of the related borrower under the mortgage loans and may result in the inability of the related borrower to make principal and interest payments on or refinance the outstanding debt when due or to sell the mortgaged properties for an aggregate amount sufficient to pay off the outstanding debt when due in the event of default by a borrower under any of the mortgage loans the trust may suffer a partial or total loss with respect to such mortgage loan and consequently the offered certificates any delinquency or loss on the mortgage loans may have an adverse effect on the distributions of principal and interest received by holders of the certificates   even if commercial mortgagebacked securities are performing as anticipated the value of such commercial mortgagebacked securities in the secondary market may nevertheless decline as a result of a deterioration in general market conditions for other asset backed securities or structured products trading activity associated with commercial mortgagebacked securities indices may also drive spreads on those indices wider than spreads on commercial mortgagebacked securities thereby resulting in a decrease in value of such commercial mortgagebacked securities   market considerations and limited liquidity   the offered certificates will not be listed on any national securities exchange or traded on any automated quotation systems of any registered securities association and there is currently no secondary market for the offered certificates while the underwriters currently intend to make a secondary market in the offered certificates no underwriter is obligated to do so any marketmaking may be discontinued at any time and we cannot assure you that an active secondary market for the offered certificates will develop additionally one or more purchasers may purchase substantial portions of one or more classes of offered certificates accordingly you may not have an active or liquid secondary market for the offered certificates lack of liquidity could result in a substantial decrease in the market value and may adversely affect the regulatory characteristics of the offered certificates the market value of the offered certificates also may be affected by many other factors including the thenprevailing interest rates and market perceptions of risks associated with commercial mortgage lending no representation is made by any person or entity as to what the market value of any offered certificate will be at any time furthermore you should be aware that the market for securities of the same type as the offered certificates has in the past been volatile and offered very limited liquidity from time to time see “risk factors—your ability to resell certificates may be limited because of their characteristics” in the prospectus   the market value of the offered certificates can decline even if the offered certificates and the mortgage loans are performing at or above your expectations the market value of the offered certificates will be sensitive to fluctuations in current interest rates however any change in the market value of the offered certificates may be disproportionately impacted by upward or downward movement in current interest rates   in particular the market value of the offered certificates will also be influenced by the supply of and demand for commercial mortgagebacked securities generally the supply of commercial mortgagebacked securities will depend on among other things the amount of commercial mortgage loans whether newly originated or held in portfolios that are available for securitization in addition financial reform legislation enacted in the united states could adversely affect the availability of credit for commercial real estate a number of factors will affect investors’ demand for commercial mortgagebacked securities including   ·the availability of alternative investments that offer higher yields or are perceived as being a better credit risk having a less volatile market value or being more liquid   ·legal and other restrictions that prohibit a particular entity from investing in commercial mortgagebacked securities limit the amount or types of commercial mortgagebacked securities   s       that it may acquire or require it to maintain increased capital or reserves as a result of its investment in commercial mortgagebacked securities   ·investors’ perceptions regarding the commercial real estate markets which may be adversely affected by among other things a decline in real estate values or an increase in defaults and foreclosures on commercial mortgage loans secured by income producing properties   ·investors’ perceptions regarding the capital markets in general which may be adversely affected by political social and economic events completely unrelated to the commercial real estate markets and   ·the impact on demand generally for commercial mortgagebacked securities as a result of the existence or cancellation of governmentsponsored economic programs   if you decide to sell any offered certificates the ability to sell those certificates will depend on among other things whether and to what extent a secondary market then exists for those certificates and you may have to sell at a discount from the price you paid for reasons unrelated to the performance of the certificates or the mortgage loans   the liquidity of the offered certificates may also be affected by present uncertainties and future unfavorable determinations concerning legal investment no class of the offered certificates will constitute “mortgage related securities” for purposes of the secondary mortgage market enhancement act of  as amended see “legal investment” in this free writing prospectus   legal and regulatory provisions affecting investors could adversely affect the liquidity of the certificates   we make no representation as to the proper characterization of the offered certificates for legal investment financial institution regulatory financial reporting or other purposes as to the ability of particular investors to purchase the offered certificates under applicable legal investment or other restrictions or as to the consequences of an investment in the offered certificates for such purposes or under such restrictions we note that regulatory or legislative provisions applicable to certain investors may have the effect of limiting or restricting their ability to hold or acquire commercial mortgagebacked securities which in turn may adversely affect the ability of investors in the offered certificates who are not subject to those provisions to resell such certificates in the secondary market for example   ·effective january   eu regulation  the “crr” imposes on european economic area “eea” credit institutions and investment firms investing in securitizations issued on or after january   or in securitizations issued prior to that date where new assets are added or substituted after december   a a requirement the “retention requirement” that the originator sponsor or original lender of such securitization has explicitly disclosed to the investor that it will retain on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest which in any

securitization and the underlying exposures and has established procedures for monitoring them on an ongoing basis   national regulators in eea member states impose penal risk weights on securitization investments in respect of which the retention requirement or the due diligence requirement has not been satisfied in any material respect by reason of the negligence or omission of the

intends to retain a material net economic interest in the securitization constituted by the issue of the offered certificates in accordance with retention requirement or to take any other action which may be required by eearegulated investors for the purposes of their compliance with retention requirement the due diligence requirement or similar requirements consequently the offered certificates are not a suitable investment for eea credit institutions investment firms or the other types of eea regulated investors mentioned above as a result the price and liquidity of the offered certificates in the secondary market may be adversely affected eearegulated investors are encouraged to consult with their own investment and legal advisors regarding the suitability of the offered certificates

reference to or reliance on credit agency ratings including but not limited to those found in the federal banking agencies’ riskbased capital regulations new capital regulations were issued by the banking regulators in july  and began phasing in on january   these regulations implement the increased capital requirements established under the basel accord these new capital regulations eliminate reliance on credit ratings and otherwise alter and in most cases increase the capital requirements imposed on depository institutions and their holding companies including with respect to ownership of assetbacked securities such as cmbs as a result of these regulations investments in commercial mortgagebacked securities like the certificates by institutions subject to the riskbased capital

volcker rule’s provisions may adversely affect the ability of banking entities to purchase and sell the offered certificates however the general effects of the volcker rule remain uncertain any prospective investor in the certificates including a us or foreign bank or a subsidiary or other affiliate thereof should consult its own legal advisors regarding such matters and other effects of the volcker rule   s     ·the financial accounting standards board has adopted changes to the accounting standards for structured products these changes or any future changes may affect the accounting for

or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal accounting and other advisors in determining whether and to what extent the offered certificates will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other restrictions unfavorable accounting treatment capital charges or reserve requirements   the volatile economy and credit crisis may increase loan defaults and affect the value and liquidity of your investment   in recent years the global economy experienced a significant recession as well as a severe ongoing disruption in the credit markets including the general absence of investor demand for and purchases of commercial mortgagebacked securities and other assetbacked securities and structured financial products while the united states economy may technically be out of the recession any recovery could be fragile and may not be sustainable for any specific period of time and the global or united states economy could slip into an even more significant recession continued downward price pressures and increasing defaults and foreclosures in residential real estate or other conditions that severely depressed the overall economy and contributed to the credit crisis have also led to increased vacancies decreased rents or otherdeclines in income from or the value of commercial real estate   additionally decreases in the value of commercial properties and the tightening by commercial real estate lenders of underwriting standards have prevented many commercial borrowers from refinancing their mortgages a substantial amount of us mortgage loans with balloon payment obligations in excess of their respective current property values are maturing over the coming three years these circumstances have increased delinquency and default rates of securitized commercial mortgage loans and lead to widespread commercial mortgage defaults   in addition the declines in commercial real estate values have resulted in reduced borrower equity hindering such borrower’s ability to refinance in an environment of increasingly restrictive lending standards and giving them less incentive to cure delinquencies and avoid foreclosure higher loantovalue ratios are likely to result in lower recoveries on foreclosure and an increase in loss severities above those that would have been realized had commercial property values remained the same or continued to increase defaults delinquencies and losses have further decreased property values thereby resulting in additional defaults by commercial mortgage borrowers further credit constraints further declines in property values and further adverse effects on the perception of the value of commercial mortgagebacked securities even if the real estate market does recover the mortgaged property underlying the mortgage loans and therefore the certificates may decline in value any further economic downturn may adversely affect the financial resources of the related borrowers and may result in the inability of the related borrowers to make interest payments on the related mortgage loans and repayment at maturity in the event of default by the related borrowers under the related mortgage loans the certificateholders would likely suffer a loss on their investment   in addition the global financial markets have experienced increased volatility due to uncertainty surrounding the level and sustainability of the sovereign debt of various countries much of this uncertainty has related to certain countries including greece ireland spain portugal and italy that participate in the european monetary union and whose sovereign debt is generally denominated in euros the common currency shared by members of that union in addition some economists observers and market participants have expressed concerns regarding the sustainability of the monetary union and the common currency in their current form   s     concerns regarding sovereign debt may spread to other countries at any time furthermore many state and local governments in the united states are experiencing and are expected to continue to experience severe budgetary constraints market volatility or disruption could result if a state were to default on its debt or a significant local government were to default on its debt or seek relief from their debt in bankruptcy or by agreement with their creditors in addition recentlyenacted financial reform legislation in the united states could adversely affect the availability of credit for commercial real estate   any or all of the circumstances described above may lead to further volatility in or disruption of the credit markets at any time moreover other types of events domestic or international may affect general economic conditions and financial markets such as wars revolts insurrections armed conflicts energy supply or price disruptions terrorism political crises natural disasters and manmade disasters we cannot predict such matters or their effect on the value or performance of the certificates   investors should consider that general conditions in the commercial real estate and mortgage markets may adversely affect the performance of the mortgage loans and accordingly the performance of the offered certificates in addition in connection with all the circumstances described above you should be aware in particular that   ·such circumstances may result in substantial delinquencies and defaults on the mortgage loans and adversely affect the amount of liquidation proceeds that would be realized in the event of foreclosures and liquidations   ·defaults on the mortgage loans may occur in large concentrations over a period of time which might result in rapid declines in the value of your certificates   ·notwithstanding that the mortgage loans were recently underwritten and originated or acquired the values of the mortgaged properties may have declined since the related mortgage loans were originated or acquired and may decline following the issuance of the offered certificates and such declines may be substantial and occur in a relatively short period following the issuance of the offered certificates and such declines may or may not occur for reasons largely unrelated to the circumstances of the particular property   ·if you determine to sell offered certificates you may be unable to do so or you may be able to do so only at a substantial discount from the price you paid which may be the case for reasons unrelated to the thencurrent performance of the offered certificates or the mortgage loans and which may be the case within a relatively short period following the issuance of the offered certificates   ·if the mortgage loans default then the yield on your investment may be substantially reduced notwithstanding that liquidation proceeds may be sufficient to result in the repayment of the principal of and accrued interest on your certificates an earlier than anticipated repayment of principal even in the absence of losses in the event of a default in advance of the maturity date would tend to shorten the weighted average period during which you earn interest on your investment and a later than anticipated repayment of principal even in the absence of losses in the event of a default upon the maturity date would tend to delay your receipt of principal and the interest on your investment may be insufficient to compensate you for that delay   ·even if liquidation proceeds received on defaulted mortgage loans are sufficient to cover the principal and accrued interest on those mortgage loans the trust fund may experience losses in the form of special servicing fees and other expenses and you may bear losses as a result or your yield may be adversely affected by such losses   ·the time periods to resolve defaulted mortgage loans may be long and those periods may be further extended because of borrower bankruptcies judicial foreclosure and related litigation and this may be especially true in the case of loans made to borrowers that have or whose affiliates have substantial debts other than the mortgage loan including related subordinate or mezzanine financing see “—potential conflicts of interest” in this free writing prospectus   s     ·if foreclosure or similar proceedings involve mortgaged properties across multiple states resolution may take a longer time period and involve greater expenses resulting in a lower recovery than may have been realized than if foreclosure or similar proceedings were instituted in a single jurisdiction   ·trading activity associated with indices of commercial mortgagebacked securities may also drive spreads on those indices wider than spreads on commercial mortgagebacked securities thereby resulting in a decrease in value of such commercial mortgagebacked securities including your certificates and spreads on those indices may be affected by a variety of factors and may or may not be affected for reasons involving the commercial real estate markets and may be affected for reasons that are unknown and cannot be discerned and   ·even if you intend to hold your certificates depending on your circumstances you may be required to report declines in the value of your certificates andor record losses on your financial statements or regulatory or supervisory reports andor repay or post additional collateral for any secured financing hedging arrangements repurchase transactions or other financial transactions that you have entered into that are backed by or make reference to your certificates in each case as if your certificates were to be sold immediately   in connection with all the circumstances described above the risks we describe elsewhere under “risk factors” in this free writing prospectus and the accompanying prospectus are heightened substantially and you should review and carefully consider such risk factors in light of such circumstances   the prospective performance of the mortgage loans included in the trust fund should be evaluated separately from the performance of the mortgage loans in any of our other trusts   while there may be certain common factors affecting the performance and value of incomeproducing real properties in general those factors do not apply equally to all incomeproducing real properties and in many cases there are unique factors that will affect the performance andor value of a particular incomeproducing real property moreover the effect of a given factor on a particular real property will depend on a number of variables including but not limited to property type geographic location competition sponsorship and other characteristics of the property and the related commercial mortgage loan each incomeproducing real property represents a separate and distinct business venture and as a result each of the mortgage loans requires a unique underwriting analysis furthermore economic and other conditions affecting real properties whether worldwide national regional or local vary over time the performance of a pool of mortgage loans originated and outstanding under a given set of economic conditions may vary significantly from the performance of an otherwise comparable mortgage pool originated and outstanding under a different set of economic conditions accordingly investors should evaluate the mortgage loans underlying the offered certificates independently from the performance of commercial mortgage loans underlying any other series of certificates   as a result of the distinct nature of each pool of commercial mortgage loans and the separate mortgage loans within the pool this free writing prospectus does not include disclosure concerning the delinquency and loss experience of static pools of periodic originations by the sponsor of assets of the type to be securitized known as “static pool data” because of the highly heterogeneous nature of the assets in commercial mortgage backed securities transactions static pool data for prior securitized pools even those involving the same asset types eg hotels or office buildings may be misleading since the economics of the properties and terms of the loans may be materially different in particular static pool data that may show a low level of delinquencies and defaults would not be indicative of the performance of this pool or any other pools of mortgage loans originated by the same sponsor or sponsors therefore investors should evaluate this offering on the basis of the information set forth in this free writing prospectus with respect to the mortgage loans and not on the basis of any successful performance of other pools of securitized commercial mortgage loans   s     commercial lending is dependent upon net operating income   the liquidation value of a commercial property is determined in substantial part by the capitalization of the property’s cash flow however net operating income can be volatile and may be insufficient to cover debt service on the commercial mortgage loan at any given time   for historical financial information relating to the mortgaged properties including net operating income for the most recent reporting period and prior three calendar years to the extent available prospective investors should review annex a and annex a to this free writing prospectus certain mortgage loans are secured in whole or in part by mortgaged properties that have no prior operating history available or otherwise lack or have limited historical financial figures and information a mortgaged property may lack or have limited prior operating history or historical financial information because it is newly constructed it is a recent acquisition by the related borrower or it is a singletenant property that is subject to a triple net lease in addition a tenant’s lease may contain confidentiality provisions that restrict the mortgage loan sellers’ access to or disclosure of such tenant’s financial information the underwritten net cash flows and underwritten net operating income for such mortgaged properties are derived principally from current rent rolls or tenant leases or in some cases based on leases that are not yet in place and may still be under negotiation or on tenants that may have signed a lease or lease amendment expanding the leased space but are not yet in occupancy in all or a portion of their space andor paying rent and historical expenses adjusted to account for inflation significant occupancy increases and a market rate management fee however we cannot assure you that such tenants will execute leases or expand their space or in any event that actual cash flows from such mortgaged properties will meet such projected cash flows income and expense levels or that those funds will be sufficient to meet the payment obligations of the related mortgage loans see “description of the mortgage pool—additional mortgage loan information” and “—net cash flow and certain underwriting considerations” in this free writing prospectus and “risk factors—commercial and multifamily mortgage loans have risks that may affect payments on your certificates” in the prospectus   the volatility of net operating income will be influenced by many of the foregoing factors as well as by   ·the length of tenant leases including that in certain cases all or substantially all of the tenants or one or more sole anchor or other major tenant at a particular mortgaged property have leases that expire or permit the tenants to terminate its or their leases during the term of the related mortgage loan   ·the creditworthiness of tenants   ·tenant defaults   ·in the case of rental properties the rate at which new rentals occur and   ·the property’s “operating leverage” which is generally the percentage of total property expenses in relation to revenue the ratio of fixed operating expenses to those that vary with revenues and the level of capital expenditures required to maintain the property and to retain or replace tenants   a decline in the real estate market or in the financial condition of a major tenant will tend to have a more immediate effect on the net operating income of properties with shortterm revenue sources such as shortterm or monthtomonth leases and may lead to higher rates of delinquency or defaults   in addition underwritten or adjusted cash flows by their nature are speculative and are based upon certain assumptions and projections the failure of such assumptions or projections in whole or in part could cause the underwritten net operating income calculated as described in “description of the mortgage pool—additional mortgage loan information” in this free writing prospectus to vary substantially from the actual net operating income of a mortgaged property see “—risks relating to underwritten net cash flow” below   s     risks relating to underwritten net cash flow   as described under “description of the mortgage pool—additional mortgage loan information” in this free writing prospectus underwritten net cash flow generally includes cash flow including any cash flow from master leases adjusted based on a number of assumptions used by the mortgage loan sellers no representation is made that the underwritten net cash flow set forth in this free writing prospectus as of the cutoff date or any other date represents actual future net cash flows for example with respect to certain mortgage loans included in the trust the occupancy of the related mortgaged property reflects tenants that i may not have yet actually executed leases ii have signed leases but have not yet taken occupancy andor are not paying full contractual rent iii are seeking or may in the future seek to sublet all or a portion of their respective spaces iv are “dark” tenants but paying rent or v are affiliates of the related borrower and are leasing space pursuant to a master lease or a space lease similarly with respect to certain mortgage loans included in the trust the underwritten net cash flow may be based on certain tenants that have not yet executed leases and may still be under negotiation or that have signed leases but are not yet in place andor are not yet paying rent or have a signed lease or lease amendment expanding the leased space but are not yet in occupancy in all or a portion of their space andor paying rent or may assume that future contractual rent steps during some or all of the remaining term of a lease have occurred each investor should review these and other similar assumptions and make its own determination of the appropriate assumptions to be used in determining underwritten net cash flow in many cases cotenancy provisions were assumed to be satisfied and vacant space was assumed to be occupied and space that was due to expire was assumed to have been relet in each case at market rates that may have exceeded current rent   in the event of the inaccuracy of any assumptions or projections used in connection with the calculation of underwritten net cash flow the actual net cash flow could be significantly adversely affected   in addition the debt service coverage ratios set forth in this free writing prospectus for the mortgage loans and the mortgaged properties vary and may vary substantially from the debt service coverage ratios for the mortgage loans and the mortgaged properties as calculated pursuant to the definition of such ratios as set forth in the related mortgage loan documents see “description of the mortgage pool—net cash flow and certain underwriting considerations” and the charts entitled “operating history and underwritten net cash flow” and the related footnotes in “description of top ten mortgage loans and additional mortgage loan information” in annex a to this free writing prospectus for additional information on certain of the mortgage loans in the trust   limited information causes uncertainty   some of the mortgage loans that we intend to include in the trust are mortgage loans that were made to enable the related borrower to acquire the related mortgaged property and certain mortgage loans may be secured by recently constructed properties accordingly for certain of these mortgage loans limited or no historical operating information is available with respect to the related mortgaged properties as a result you may find it difficult to analyze the historical performance of those mortgaged properties   no reunderwriting of the mortgage loans   we have not reunderwritten the mortgage loans instead we have relied on the representations and warranties made by the mortgage loan sellers and the applicable mortgage loan seller’s obligation to repurchase substitute for or cure a mortgage loan in the event that a representation or warranty was not true when made and such breach materially and adversely affects the value of the mortgage loan the value of the related mortgaged property or the interests of the certificateholders these representations and warranties do not cover all of the matters that we would review in underwriting a mortgage loan and you should not view them as a substitute for reunderwriting the mortgage loans furthermore these representations and warranties in some respects represent an allocation of risk rather than a confirmed description of the mortgage loans although none of the mortgage loan sellers have made representations and warranties that they know to be untrue subject to the exceptions to the representations and   s     warranties described in the purchase agreement and this free writing prospectus if we had reunderwritten the mortgage loans it is possible that the reunderwriting process may have revealed problems with a mortgage loan not covered by a representation or warranty in addition we can give no assurance that the applicable mortgage loan seller will be able to repurchase a mortgage loan if a representation or warranty has been breached see “description of the mortgage pool—representations and warranties repurchases and substitutions” in this free writing prospectus   risks associated with commercial real estate lending   the borrower’s ability to make payments due on its related mortgage loan will be subject to the risks generally associated with real estate investments these risks include adverse changes in general or local economic conditions real estate values generally and in the locales of the related mortgaged properties interest rates real estate tax rates other operating expenses including costs of energy inflation the supply of and demand for properties of the type involved zoning laws or other governmental rules and policies including environmental restrictions competitive conditions including changes in land use and construction of new competitive properties that may affect the ability of a borrower to obtain or maintain full occupancy of the related mortgaged properties bankruptcy or other events adversely affecting the tenants or prospective tenants at such mortgaged properties civil disorder acts of war or of terrorists acts of god such as floods or earthquakes and other factors beyond the control of the related borrower due to these and other factors the performance of real estate has historically been cyclical such factors may make it difficult for the mortgaged properties to generate sufficient net operating income to make full and timely payments on the related mortgage loans also if any major repair or improvement is required at a mortgaged property we cannot assure you that the related borrower or tenant if required under its lease will be able to obtain funds to make such repair or improvement as with all real estate if reconstruction for example following fire or other casualty or any major repair or improvement is required at a mortgaged property changes in governmental approvals may be applicable and may materially affect the cost to or ability of the related borrower to effect such reconstruction major repair or improvement furthermore certain of the reciprocal easement and operating agreements or anchor tenant leases may provide that the anchor tenant is permitted to terminate its lease or operating covenant in certain circumstances including if a mortgaged property is substantially damaged or taken by condemnation see “—retail properties have special risks” below   office properties have special risks   thirteen  of the mortgaged properties securing twelve  mortgage loans representing approximately  of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cutoff date by allocated loan amount are office properties   a large number of factors may adversely affect the value of office properties including   ·the quality of an office building’s tenants   ·an economic decline in the business operated by the tenants   ·the physical attributes of the building in relation to competing buildings eg age condition design appearance location access to transportation and ability to offer certain amenities such as sophisticated building systems andor business wiring requirements   ·the physical attributes of the building with respect to the technological needs of the tenants including the adaptability of the building to changes in the technological needs of the tenants   ·the diversity of an office building’s tenants or reliance on a single or dominant tenant   ·the desirability of the area as a business location   ·the strength and nature of the local economy including labor costs tax environment and the quality of life for employees and   s     ·an adverse change in population patterns of telecommuting or sharing of office space and employment growth all of which affect the demand for office space   certain of the mortgage loans identified as being secured by office properties are medical office properties which are subject to certain additional risks the performance of a medical office property may depend on i the proximity of such property to a hospital or other health care establishment and ii reimbursements for patient fees from private or governmentsponsored insurers the performance of a medical or dental office property may depend on i its ability to attract doctors and nurses to be on staff ii its ability to afford and acquire the latest medical or dental equipment iii a sufficient patient base and iv reimbursements for patient fees and other charges from private or government sponsored insurers issues related to reimbursement ranging from nonpayment to delays in payment from insurers could adversely impact cash flow at such mortgaged property   certain of the mortgage loans identified as being secured by office properties may include parking garages which present certain risks parking garages present risks not associated with other properties the primary source of income for parking garages is the rental fees charged for parking spaces factors affecting the success of a parking garage include the number of rentable parking spaces and rates charged and the amount of alternative parking spaces in the area in addition because of the unique construction requirements of many parking garages a parking garage may not be easily converted to other uses see “—some mortgaged properties may not be readily convertible to alternative uses” in this free writing prospectus   moreover the cost of refitting office space for a new tenant is often higher than the cost of refitting other types of properties for new tenants see “—risks relating to mortgage loan concentrations and borrowersponsor concentrations” below and “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property type concentrations” in this free writing prospectus   retail properties have special risks   ninetyfour  of the mortgaged properties securing twentyone  mortgage loans representing approximately  of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cutoff date by allocated loan amount are retail properties sixteen  of these mortgaged properties identified as “frandor shopping center” “the outlet shoppes at gettysburg” “langhorne shopping center” “town  country shopping center” “premiere place” “emerson pointe” “big curve shopping center” “falcon gateway” “southwest plaza” “mattoon market place” “freeway crossing” “market square at montrose” “heritage shopping center” “chippewa towne centre” “frankford square” and “pine tree square” on annex a to this free writing prospectus securing sixteen  mortgage loans representing approximately  of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cutoff date by allocated loan amount may have one or more “anchor tenants” or “shadow anchor tenants” which may or may not be tenants at the mortgaged properties that represent collateral for the related mortgage loan the value of retail properties is significantly affected by the quality of the tenants as well as fundamental aspects of real estate such as location and market demographics the correlation between success of tenant businesses and a retail property’s value may be more direct with respect to retail properties than other types of commercial property because a component of the total rent paid by certain retail tenants is often tied to a percentage of gross sales   whether a retail property is “anchored” “shadow anchored” or “unanchored” is also an important consideration the presence or absence of an “anchor tenant” or a “shadow anchor tenant” in or near a retail property also can be important because anchors play a key role in generating customer traffic and making a center desirable for other tenants an “anchor tenant” located on a related property is usually proportionately larger in size than most other tenants in the property and is vital in attracting customers to a retail property a “shadow anchor tenant” is usually proportionally larger in size than most tenants in the property is important in attracting customers to a retail property and is located sufficiently close and convenient to the property so as to influence and attract potential customers but is not located on the mortgaged property the economic performance of an anchored or shadow anchored retail property will consequently be adversely affected by   s     ·an anchor tenant’s or shadow anchor tenant’s failure to renew or extend its lease   ·termination of an anchor tenant’s or shadow anchor tenant’s lease or if the anchor tenant or shadow anchor tenant owns its own site a decision to vacate   ·the bankruptcy or economic decline of an anchor tenant shadow anchor tenant or selfowned anchor or   ·the cessation of the business of an anchor tenant a shadow anchor tenant or of a selfowned anchor notwithstanding its continued payment of rent   in certain instances with respect to the mortgaged properties anchor tenant leases expire during the term of the related mortgage loan or such tenants may have the option to terminate their respective leases early see “description of top ten mortgage loans and additional mortgage loan information” in annex a to this free writing prospectus for the lease rollover schedules for certain of the mortgage loans and see annex a to this free writing prospectus for the lease expiration dates for the five  largest tenants based on net rentable area leased at each mortgaged property to the extent applicable we cannot assure you that if anchor tenants or shadow anchor tenants at a particular mortgaged property were to close or remain vacant such anchor tenants or shadow anchor tenants as applicable would be replaced in a timely manner or if part of the collateral for the related mortgage loan without incurring material additional costs to the related borrower or resulting in adverse economic effects see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgaged property considerations—tenant issues—terminations” and “—expirations” in this free writing prospectus   in addition various anchor parcels andor anchor improvements at a mortgaged property may be owned by the anchor tenant or an affiliate of the anchor tenant or by a third party and therefore not be part of the related mortgaged property and the related borrower may not receive rental income from such anchor tenant   retail properties that have anchor tenantowned stores often have reciprocal easement and operating agreements between the retail property owner and such anchor tenants containing certain operating and maintenance covenants we cannot assure you that the reciprocal easement or operating agreements as applicable will not expire prior to the maturity date of the related mortgage loan although an anchor tenant that owns its own parcel does not pay rent it generally is required to pay a contribution toward common area maintenance and real estate taxes on the improvements and related real property anchor tenants that lease their stores often have operating covenants as well such operating covenants may be provided for in the anchor tenant lease or in the reciprocal easement and operating agreement if any affecting the mortgaged property anchor tenants that have no operating covenants or whose covenants have expired previously or will expire during the term of the related mortgage loan are or will not be contractually obligated to operate their stores at the applicable mortgaged property a number of the tenant leases and reciprocal easement and operating agreements at the mortgaged properties have cotenancy clauses which permit such stores to abate the rent payable refrain from opening for business cease operating andor terminate their leases if certain anchor or other major tenants andor if a specified percentage of the stores at the related mortgaged property are not occupied and operating certain tenants may also have certain other termination rights related to sales targets certain of the operating covenants with respect to the mortgaged properties have expired or will expire prior to the maturity date of the related mortgage loan we cannot assure you that operating covenants will be obtained in the future for these or any of the anchor tenants   certain tenant including anchor tenant estoppels obtained in connection with the origination of the mortgage loans identified disputes between the related borrower and the applicable tenant or alleged defaults or potential defaults by the applicable property owner under the lease or reciprocal easement and operating agreement such disputes defaults or potential defaults could result in a tenant offsetting rent or could lead to a termination or attempted termination of the applicable lease or reciprocal easement and operating agreement by the tenant or to litigation against the related borrower we cannot assure you that the identified tenant disputes will not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the related   s     borrowers to repay the mortgage loan in addition we cannot assure you that the tenant estoppels obtained identify all potential disputes that may arise with tenants   in addition certain tenants may not provide estoppels or the estoppels obtained may not be timely in such cases material information about the related leases may not have been available for loan underwriting purposes at origination we cannot assure you that the failure to obtain related estoppel information will not have a material adverse effect on the related mortgage loans   rental payments from tenants of retail properties typically comprise the largest portion of the net operating income of those mortgaged properties certain tenants at the mortgaged properties may be paying rent but are not yet in occupancy or have signed leases but have not yet started paying rent andor are not yet in occupancy see “—certain additional risks relating to tenants” in this free writing prospectus risks applicable to anchor tenants such as bankruptcy failure to renew leases early terminations of leases and vacancies also apply to other tenants we cannot assure you that the rate of occupancy at the stores will remain at the current levels or that the net operating income contributed by the mortgaged properties will remain at its current or past levels see “—risks of lease early termination options” in this free writing prospectus   borrowers property managers and their affiliates of mortgaged properties may currently own and in the future property managers of mortgaged properties and affiliates of borrowers may develop or acquire additional properties and lease space in other properties in the same market areas where the mortgaged properties are located property managers at the related mortgaged properties also may manage competing properties none of the property managers or any other party has any duty to favor the leasing of space in the mortgaged properties over the leasing of space in other properties one or more of which may be adjacent to or near the mortgaged properties see “description of the mortgage pool–mortgage pool characteristics—property type concentrations” in this free writing prospectus   retail properties also face competition from sources outside a given real estate market factory outlet centers discount shopping centers and clubs video shopping networks catalogue retailers home shopping networks direct mail internet selling and telemarketing all compete with more traditional retail properties for consumer dollars continued growth of these and other alternative retail outlets could adversely affect the rents collectible at the mortgaged properties secured by retail properties increased competition could adversely affect income from and market value of those mortgaged properties   in some cases the leases of certain anchor and other significant tenants prohibit the landlord from leasing space at or near the related mortgaged property to a competitor of the subject tenant thereby adversely affecting the potential tenant pool andor the value of the related mortgaged property in a foreclosure scenario   in addition certain of the retail properties have tenants that are subject to risks unique to their business such as theaters bowling alleys gas stations educational facilities fitness centers and restaurants see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property type concentrations” in this free writing prospectus in such cases aspects of building site design and adaptability affect the value of such properties and other retailers at the mortgaged property for example the limited adaptability of certain shopping malls that have proven unprofitable has recently resulted in extremely high loss severities on mortgage loans secured by those shopping malls which mortgage loans were owned by commercial mortgagebacked securitization trusts in one particular case a significant amount of advances made by the applicable servicers of a mortgage loan secured by a shopping mall property combined with low liquidation proceeds in respect of that property resulted in a loss severity exceeding  of the outstanding principal balance of that mortgage loan see “—some mortgaged properties may not be readily convertible to alternative uses” below   in addition decreasing patronage at such properties could adversely affect revenue of the property which may in turn cause the tenants to experience financial difficulties resulting in downgrades in their credit lease defaults ratings and in certain cases bankruptcy filings see “—tenant bankruptcy entails risks” below additionally receipts at such properties are also affected not only by objective factors but by subjective factors for instance restaurant receipts are affected by such varied influences as the   s     current personal income levels in the community an individual consumer’s preference for type of food style of dining and restaurant atmosphere the perceived popularity of the restaurant food safety concerns related to personal health with the handling of food items at the restaurant or by food suppliers and the actions andor behaviors of staff and management and level of service to the customers in addition because of unique construction requirements of such properties any vacant space would not easily be converted to other uses   certain retail properties may have other nonretail types of tenants including medical office tenants for risks related to these types of tenants see “—office properties have special risks” in this free writing prospectus   multifamily properties have special risks   thirtysix  of the mortgaged properties partially securing thirtyfour  mortgage loans representing approximately  of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cutoff date by allocated loan amount are multifamily properties   a large number of factors may adversely affect the value and successful operation of a multifamily property including   ·the physical attributes of the apartment or student housing building eg its age appearance and construction quality   ·the quality of property management   ·the location of the property eg a change in the neighborhood over time or increased crime in the neighborhood   ·the ability of management to provide adequate security maintenance and insurance   ·the types of services the property provides   ·the property’s reputation   ·the level of mortgage interest rates which may encourage tenants to purchase rather than rent housing   ·the generally short term of residential leases and the need for continued reletting   ·rent concessions and monthtomonth leases which may impact cash flow on the property   ·in the case of student housing facilities which may be more susceptible to damage or wear and tear than other types of multifamily housing the reliance on the financial wellbeing of the college or university to which it relates competition from oncampus housing units which may adversely affect occupancy the physical layout of the housing which may not be readily convertible to traditional multifamily use and the fact that student tenants have a higher turnover rate and may be financially less able to make rent payments than other types of multifamily tenants which in certain cases is compounded by the fact that student leases are available for periods of less than  months   ·restrictions on the age of tenants who may reside at the property   ·receipt of rent subsidies from the united states department of housing and urban development under its section  tenantbased assistance rental certificate program   ·state and local regulations including rent control and rent stabilization ordinances and regulations   s     ·whether the property is subject to low income housing use restrictions that limit income of tenants and rent for units   ·the presence of competing properties and residential developments in the local market   ·the existence of corporate tenants renting large blocks of units at the property which in the event such tenant vacates would leave the property with a significant percentage of unoccupied space and in the event such tenant was renting at an abovemarket rent may make finding replacement tenants difficult   ·the tenant mix particularly if the tenants are predominantly students personnel from or workers related to a military base or workers from a particular business or industry   ·adverse local regional or national economic conditions which may limit the amount of rent that can be charged and may result in a reduction in timely rent payments or a reduction in occupancy   ·state and local regulations   ·government assistancerent subsidy programs and   ·national state or local politics   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property type concentrations” in this free writing prospectus   hotel properties have special risks   eleven  of the mortgaged properties partially securing nine  mortgage loans representing approximately  of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cutoff date by allocated loan amount are hotel properties see “risk factors—commercial and multifamily mortgage loans have risks that may affect payments on your certificates” in the prospectus   because rooms are generally rented for short periods of time the financial performance of hospitality properties tends to be affected by adverse economic conditions and competition more quickly than other commercial properties additionally as a result of high operating costs relatively small decreases in revenue can cause significant stress on a property’s cash flow   moreover the hospitality and lodging industry is generally seasonal in nature and different seasons affect different hospitality properties differently depending on type and location this seasonality can be expected to cause periodic fluctuations in a hospitality property’s room and restaurant revenues occupancy levels room rates and operating expenses we cannot assure you that cash flow will be sufficient to offset any shortfalls that occur at the mortgaged property during slower periods or that the related mortgage loans provide for seasonality reserves or if seasonality reserves are provided for that such reserves will be funded or will be sufficient or available to fund such shortfalls   in addition some of the hospitality mortgaged properties are limitedservice hotels hospitality properties that are limitedservice hotels may subject a lender to more risk than fullservice hotels as they generally require less capital for construction than fullservice hotels in addition as limitedservice hotels generally offer fewer amenities than fullservice hotels they are less distinguishable from each other as a result it is easier for limitedservice hotels to experience increased or unforeseen competition   in addition to hotel operations some hospitality properties also operate entertainment complexes that include restaurants lounges nightclubs andor banquet and meeting spaces and may derive a significant portion of the related property’s revenue from such operations consumer demand for entertainment resorts is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer   s     preferences could be driven by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions high energy fuel and food costs the increased cost of travel the potential for bank failures the weakened job market perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth fears of recession and changes in consumer confidence in the economy or fears of war and future acts of terrorism these factors could reduce consumer demand for the leisure activities that the property offers thus imposing practical limits on pricing and harming operations restaurants and nightclubs are particularly vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences in addition a nightclub’s restaurant’s or bar’s revenue is extremely dependent on its popularity and perception these characteristics are subject to change rapidly and we cannot assure you that any of a hospitality property’s nightclubs restaurants or bars will maintain their current level of popularity or perception in the market any such change could have a material adverse effect on the net cash flow of the property   some of the hotels have liquor licenses associated with the mortgaged property the liquor licenses for these mortgaged properties are generally held by affiliates of the related borrowers unaffiliated managers or operating lessees the laws and regulations relating to liquor licenses generally prohibit the transfer of such licenses to any person or condition such transfer on the prior approval of the governmental authority that issued the license in the event of a foreclosure of a hotel property that holds a liquor license the special servicer on behalf of the trust or a purchaser in a foreclosure sale would likely have to apply for a new license which might not be granted or might be granted only after a delay that could be significant we cannot assure you that a new license could be obtained promptly or at all the lack of a liquor license in a hotel could have an adverse impact on the revenue from the related mortgaged property or on the hotel’s occupancy rate   additionally certain of these mortgaged properties may have been designated as historic or landmark buildings or may be located in areas designated as historic or landmark such properties may have restrictions related to renovations construction or other restrictions see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property type concentrations” in this free writing prospectus   risks relating to affiliation with a franchise or hotel management company   eleven  mortgaged properties identified as

aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cutoff date are affiliated with a franchise licensing or hotel management company through a franchise membership or management agreement see “risk factors—commercial and multifamily mortgage loans have risks that may affect payments on your certificates” in the prospectus   the continuation of a franchise agreement licensing agreement membership agreement or management agreement is typically subject to specified operating standards property improvement plans and other terms and conditions set forth in such agreements the failure of a borrower to maintain such standards or adhere to other applicable terms and conditions could result in the loss or cancellation of their rights under the franchise agreement licensing agreement membership agreement or management agreement in addition some of these agreements applicable to the hotel mortgaged properties expire or grant the franchisorlicensormember a termination right that is exercisable during the term of the related mortgage loan we cannot assure you that a replacement franchise or license could be obtained in the event of a termination in addition replacement franchiseslicensesmemberships may require significantly higher fees as well as the investment of capital to bring the hotel into compliance with the requirements of the replacement franchisorlicensormember any provision in a franchise agreement licensing agreement membership agreement or management agreement providing for termination because of a bankruptcy of a franchisor or manager generally will not be enforceable   the franchise agreements license agreements membership agreements and the property management agreements generally restrict transfers of the subject agreement transfers of the ownership   s     interests of the related borrower andor transfers of the subject hospitality mortgaged property and generally a contain certain approval rights regarding the transferee andor b prohibit certain transfers for various reasons including without limitation that i the transferee does not have sufficient financial resources to fulfill the owner’s obligations under the franchise agreement licensing agreement membership agreement or management agreement as applicable ii the transferee is among a group of specifically designated prohibited transferees andor iii the transferee is a competitor as defined in the franchise agreement licensing agreement membership agreement or management agreement such restrictions may impact a foreclosure sale or a sale of an reo property in the event of a foreclosure the lender may not have the right to use the franchise license without the franchisor’s consent or the manager might be able to terminate the management agreement conversely in the case of certain mortgage loans the lender may be unable to remove a franchisorlicensor or a hotel management company that it desires to replace following a foreclosure and further may be limited as regards the pool of potential transferees for a foreclosure or real estate owned property   in some cases where a hospitality property is subject to a license or franchise agreement the licensor or franchisor has required the completion of various repairs andor renovations pursuant to a property improvement plan issued by the franchisor failure to complete those repairs andor renovations in accordance with the plan could result in the hospitality property losing its license or franchise annex a and the related footnotes set forth the amount of reserves if any established under the related mortgage loans in connection with any of those repairs andor renovations we cannot assure you that any amounts reserved will be sufficient to complete the repairs andor renovations required with respect to any affected hospitality property in addition in some cases those reserves will be maintained by the franchisor or property manager furthermore the lender may not require a reserve for repairs andor renovations in all instances   in addition there may be risks associated with hospitality properties that have not entered into or become a party to any franchise agreement license agreement membership agreement or other “flag” hospitality properties often enter into these types of agreements in order to align the hospitality property with a certain public perception or to benefit from a centralized reservation system we cannot assure you that hospitality properties that lack such benefits will be able to operate successfully on an independent basis see “description of top ten mortgage loans and additional mortgage loan information” in annex a to this free writing prospectus   see also “—hotel properties have special risks” above and “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property type concentrations” in this free writing prospectus   mixed use facilities have special risks   four  of the mortgaged properties securing four  mortgage loans representing approximately  of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cutoff date are mixed use properties the value of mixed use facilities with retail components is significantly affected by the quality of the tenants as well as fundamental aspects of real estate such as location and market demographics the correlation between success of tenant businesses and a retail property’s value may be more direct with respect to retail properties than other types of commercial property because a component of the total rent paid by certain retail tenants is often tied to a percentage of gross sales   the mixed use mortgaged properties consist of parking garage retail office andor industrial components and as such the mortgage loans secured by the mixed use mortgaged properties will share risks associated with such underlying components in addition a mixed use property may be managed by a manager that is not experienced in managing all of the property types comprising the mortgaged property   see “—office properties have special risks” “—retail properties have special risks” “—industrial properties have special risks” and “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property type concentrations” in this free writing prospectus   s     self storage properties have special risks   one hundred and ten  of the mortgaged properties securing four  mortgage loans representing approximately  of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cutoff date by allocated loan amount are self storage properties   the self storage facilities market contains low barriers to entry in addition due to the shortterm nature of self storage leases self storage properties also may be subject to more volatility in terms of supply and demand than loans secured by other types of properties   because of the construction utilized in connection with certain self storage facilities it might be difficult or costly to convert such a facility to an alternative use thus the liquidation value of self storage properties may be substantially less than would be the case if the same were readily adaptable to other uses   in addition it is difficult to assess the environmental risks posed by self storage facilities due to tenant privacy anonymity and unsupervised access to these facilities therefore these types of facilities may pose additional environmental risks to investors the environmental site assessments discussed in this free writing prospectus did not include an inspection of the contents of the self storage units included in the self storage properties we therefore cannot provide assurance that all of the units included in the self storage properties are free from hazardous materials or that they will remain so in the future   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property type concentrations” in this free writing prospectus   industrial properties have special risks   three  of the mortgaged properties securing three  mortgage loans representing approximately  of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cutoff date are industrial properties significant factors determining the value of industrial properties are   ·the quality of tenants   ·reduced demand for industrial space because of a decline in a particular industry segment   ·the property becoming functionally obsolete   ·building design and adaptability   ·unavailability of labor sources   ·changes in access energy prices strikes relocation of highways the construction of additional highways or other factors   ·changes in proximity of supply sources   ·the expenses of converting a previously adapted space to general use and   ·the location of the property   concerns about the quality of tenants particularly major tenants are similar in both office properties and industrial properties although industrial properties may be more frequently dependent on a single or a few tenants   industrial properties may be adversely affected by reduced demand for industrial space occasioned by a decline in a particular industry segment for example a decline in defense spending and a particular industrial or warehouse property that suited the needs of its original tenant may be difficult to   s     relet to another tenant or may become functionally obsolete relative to newer properties in addition lease terms with respect to industrial properties are generally for shorter periods of time and may result in a substantial percentage of leases expiring in the same year at any particular industrial property in addition mortgaged properties used for many industrial purposes are more prone to environmental concerns than other property types   aspects of building site design and adaptability affect the value of an industrial property site characteristics that are generally desirable for a warehouseindustrial property include high clear ceiling heights wide column spacing a large number of bays loading docks and large bay depths divisibility a layout that can accommodate large truck minimum turning radii and overall functionality and accessibility   in addition because of unique construction requirements of many industrial properties any vacant industrial property space may not be easily converted to other uses thus if the operation of any of the industrial properties becomes unprofitable due to competition age of the improvements or other factors such that the borrower becomes unable to meet its obligations on the related mortgage loan the liquidation value of that industrial property may be substantially less relative to the amount owing on the related mortgage loan than would be the case if the industrial property were readily adaptable to other uses   location is also important because an industrial property requires the availability of labor sources proximity to supply sources and customers and accessibility to rail lines major roadways and other distribution channels   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property type concentrations” in this free writing prospectus   manufactured housing community properties have special risks   two  of the mortgaged properties securing two  mortgage loans representing approximately  of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cutoff date are manufactured housing community properties   commercial mortgage loans secured by liens on manufactured housing community properties pose risks not associated with commercial mortgage loans secured by liens on other types of incomeproducing real estate the successful operation of a manufactured housing community property may depend upon the number of other competing residential developments in the local market such as   ·other manufactured housing community properties   ·apartment buildings and   ·sitebuilt single family homes   other factors affecting the successful operation of a manufactured housing community property may also include   ·the physical attributes of the community including its age and appearance   ·location of the manufactured housing community property including the seasonal effect upon occupancy particularly with respect to seasonal sites occupied by recreational vehicles and traveltrailers which often have short term rental contracts   ·the percentage of owneroccupied homes versus rental homes   ·any restrictions on the age of tenants who may reside at the property   ·the ability of management to provide adequate maintenance and insurance   s     ·the types of services or amenities provided   ·the property’s reputation and   ·state and local regulations including rent control and rent stabilization as well as tenant association rights   in general a manufactured housing community property is a “singlepurpose” property that could not be readily converted to general residential retail or office use thus if the operation of the manufactured housing community property becomes unprofitable due to competition age of the improvements or other factors such that the borrower becomes unable to meet its obligations on the mortgage loan the liquidation value of that manufactured housing community property may be substantially less relative to the amount owing on the mortgage loan than would be the case if the manufactured housing community property were readily adaptable to other uses   some of the manufactured housing community mortgaged properties securing mortgage loans in the issuing entity   ·may be subject to rent control and other laws regulating the relationship between a property owner and its residential tenants   ·may not be connected to public water and sewer systems   ·have tenants that may not have leases or have short term or monthtomonth leases and accordingly that are not obligated to remain at such mortgaged property for any extended period   ·are located in whole or in part in a flood zone that requires the related borrower to maintain flood insurance if it owns any material structures located in a flood zone or   ·may be deemed legally nonconforming for zoning purposes as to the underlying manufactured housing community use   certain manufactured housing community properties securing mortgage loans in the issuing entity are in whole or in part agerestricted to individuals that in general are  years of age or older such restrictions limit the potential residents of the related mortgaged properties and may affect property performance   in the case of manufactured housing community mortgaged properties that are not connected to public water and sewer systems the borrower could incur a substantial expense in connection with either the repair maintenance or replacement of the existing system or the required connection to such public systems in the future in addition the use of well water andor septic systems or private sewage treatment facilities enhances the likelihood that the property could be adversely affected by a recognized environmental condition that impacts soil and groundwater   in the case of manufactured housing community mortgaged properties that are located in whole or in part in a flood zone flood insurance may not be available and even if there are no material borrowerowned structures located in that flood zone the potential for flooding may be a deterrent to tenants see also representation number  in annex d and the identified exceptions to that representation in annex d to this free writing prospectus   in the case of manufactured housing community mortgaged properties for which the current use or building conformation is deemed legally nonconforming for zoning purposes limitations on rebuilding following a casualty can have significant and adverse economic effect on the related mortgaged property first zoning ordinances frequently establish a damage threshold beyond which the current use or conformation has to conform to current requirements where the units themselves are included in the calculation of the damage threshold as opposed to the calculation being based solely on the underlying pads or where the units themselves are separately subject to the damage threshold it is more probable   s     that the damage threshold will be exceeded by manufactured housing community mortgaged properties than for other types of mortgaged properties under comparable circumstances and property value may be impaired by restrictions on replacing the units second even where proceeds from casualty insurance including law and ordinance coverage are available the value of insured improvements is generally much less than the loan amount we cannot assure you that if a casualty results in the manufactured housing community uses or other zoning characteristics such as setbacks no longer being permitted by the applicable zoning regulations the lender will be able to recognize sufficient proceeds from the exercise of foreclosure or equivalent remedies or available insurance to avoid losses on the manufactured housing community mortgage loan see “—zoning compliance use restrictions and condemnation may adversely affect property value” in this free writing prospectus   depending on the location of a manufactured housing community property occupancy and collections may be highly seasonal for example a manufactured housing community in a warm weather state might earn most of its income from late fall to early spring   some of the manufactured housing community mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans in the issuing entity may have a material number of leased homes that are owned currently or in the future by the related borrower or an affiliate of the related borrower and rented by the respective tenants like apartments in circumstances where the leased homes are owned by an affiliate of the borrower the related pads may in some cases be subject to a master lease with that affiliate in such cases the tenants will tend to be more transient and less tied to the property than if they owned their own home such leased homes may in certain cases constitute collateral for the related mortgage loan the borrower or an affiliate of the related borrower may acquire own lease sell andor finance the ownership of homes at a manufactured housing community mortgaged property   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property type concentrations” in this free writing prospectus   risks of lease early termination options   retail leases often give tenants the right to terminate the related lease or abate or reduce the related rent at the applicable mortgaged property i if the borrower allows uses at the mortgaged property in violation of use restrictions in current tenant leases ii if the borrower or a prior owner of the mortgaged property or any of their respective affiliates owns other properties within a certain radius of the mortgaged property and allows uses at those properties in violation of use restrictions iii if the

mortgaged property v upon casualty or condemnation with respect to all or a portion of the mortgaged property that renders such mortgaged property unsuitable for a tenant’s use or if the borrower fails to rebuild such mortgaged property within a certain time or if the casualty or condemnation occurs near the end of the lease vi if a tenant’s use is not permitted by zoning or applicable law vii if a tenant is not permitted to exercise expansion rights at the mortgaged property viii if the landlord fails to undertake various property renovations or improvement ix if a tenant fails to meet certain sales criteria or x if the landlord defaults on its obligations under the lease in each identified instance the borrower may have interests adverse to the mortgagee and we cannot assure you that the borrower will not violate those restrictions if it feels that such violation may otherwise benefit it or its affiliates to do so even where such action is to the detriment of the mortgaged property   in addition it is common for other tenants at anchored or shadowanchored retail centers to have the right to terminate their lease or abate or reduce rent if an anchor or shadow anchor tenant goes dark or for anchor tenants to have such rights if other anchor tenants or shadow anchor tenants go dark even if other tenants do not have termination or rent abatement rights because an anchor or shadow anchor tenant plays a key role in generating customer traffic and making a center desirable for other tenants we cannot assure you that any loss of an anchor tenant or shadow anchor tenant will not have a material   s     adverse impact on the nonanchor tenants’ ability to operate which may in turn adversely impact the borrower’s ability to meet its obligations under the related mortgage loan documents if an anchor tenant or shadow anchor tenant goes dark generally the borrower’s only remedy is to terminate that lease after the anchor tenant or shadow anchor tenant has been dark for a specified amount of time   in addition certain of the tenant leases for the mortgaged properties permit the related tenant to terminate its lease andor abate or reduce rent if the tenant fails to meet certain sales targets or other business objectives for a specified period of time we cannot assure you that all or any of these tenants will meet the sales targets or business objectives required to avoid the exercise of any termination andor abatement rights   in addition certain of the tenant leases for the mortgaged properties permit the affected tenants to terminate their leases andor abate or reduce rent if a certain number of anchor tenants shadow anchors or particular significant tenants andor a percentage of the tenants cease to operate or a certain percentage of the space at the property becomes vacant at the applicable mortgaged property further certain of the tenant leases for the other mortgaged properties may permit affected tenants to terminate their leases or reduce their rent if a tenant at an adjacent or nearby property terminates its lease or goes dark   in addition to termination options tied to certain triggers described above that are common with respect to retail properties certain tenant leases of other property types permit the related tenant to unilaterally terminate its lease or contract for its leased space without the occurrence of any trigger generally any tenants that hold termination options are required to provide advance notice and in some instances pay a termination fee to the related borrowers we cannot assure you that tenants at any of the mortgaged properties will not exercise any such early termination and contraction rights or will honor their obligations to pay a termination fee and we cannot assure you that the absence or reduced presence of any such tenants at the related mortgaged properties will not have a material adverse impact on the related mortgaged properties see “description of top ten mortgage

secured by mortgaged properties located in any such jurisdiction   repayments by borrowers and the market value of the related mortgaged properties could be affected by economic conditions generally or specific to geographic areas or the regions of the united states and concentrations of mortgaged properties in particular geographic areas may increase the risk that adverse economic or other developments or natural disasters affecting a particular region of the country could increase the frequency and severity of losses on mortgage loans secured by those properties in recent periods several regions of the united states have experienced significant real estate downturns regional economic declines or conditions in regional real estate markets could adversely affect the income from and market value of the mortgaged properties in addition local or regional   s     economies may be adversely affected to a greater degree than other areas of the country by developments affecting industries concentrated in such area a decline in the general economic condition in the region in which mortgaged properties securing the related mortgage loans are located would result in a decrease in consumer demand in the region and the income from and market value of the mortgaged properties may be adversely affected   several mortgaged properties are located in areas that based on low population density poor economic demographics such as higher than average unemployment rates lower than average annual household income andor overall loss of jobs andor negative trends in such regards would be considered secondary or tertiary markets mortgage loans secured by mortgaged properties in these secondary or tertiary markets may be more susceptible to the impacts of risks disclosed in this free writing prospectus   other regional factors—eg earthquakes floods forest fires or hurricanes or changes in governmental rules or fiscal policies—also may adversely affect the mortgaged properties mortgaged properties in certain regional areas are more susceptible to certain hazards such as earthquakes mudslides wildfires hurricanes or floods than properties in other parts of the country and properties located in coastal states or territories are generally more susceptible to hurricanes than properties in other parts of the country as a result areas affected by such events often experience disruptions in travel transportation and tourism loss of jobs and an overall decrease in consumer activity and often a decline in real estaterelated investments we cannot assure you that the economies in such impacted areas will recover sufficiently to support income producing real estate at preevent levels or that the costs of the related cleanup will not have a material adverse effect on the local or national economy furthermore the mortgage loans do not all require flood insurance on the related mortgaged property unless they have material improvements that are in flood zones and flood insurance is available we cannot assure you that any hurricane damage would be covered by insurance see “servicing of the mortgage loans—maintenance of insurance” and “certain legal aspects of the mortgage loans” in this free writing prospectus and “description of the pooling agreements—hazard insurance policies” in the prospectus   in addition certain cities states or regions of the country are currently facing or may face a depressed real estate market which is not due to any natural disaster but which may cause an overall decline in property values certain of the mortgaged

disproportionately large impact on the pool of mortgage loans see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property type concentrations” in this free writing prospectus for information related to property type concentrations   certain of the mortgage loans have borrowers that are related to each other mortgage loans with related borrowers are identified under “related borrower” on annex a to this free writing prospectus   a concentration of mortgage loans with the same borrower or related borrowers can also pose increased risks any adverse circumstances relating to a borrower or an affiliate of the borrower and affecting one of the related mortgage loans or mortgaged properties could also affect other mortgage loans or mortgaged properties of the related borrower for example if a borrower that owns or controls several properties whether or not all of them secure mortgage loans in the pool experiences financial difficulty at one property it could defer maintenance at a mortgaged property in order to satisfy current expenses with respect to the other properties or they could attempt to avert a foreclosure by filing a bankruptcy petition that might have the effect of interrupting payments for an indefinite period on all of the related mortgage loans see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—crosscollateralized mortgage loans multiproperty mortgage loans and related borrower mortgage loans” in this free writing prospectus   in addition it is possible that some or all of the properties owned or controlled by a borrower or related borrower will be managed by the same property manager whether or not all of the properties secure mortgage loans in the pool a concentration of mortgaged properties with a common property manager may result in a conflict of interest in that the property manager may have interests in other competing properties that may be adverse to the mortgaged properties in the pool   mortgaged properties owned by related borrowers are likely to   •have common management increasing the risk that financial or other difficulties experienced by the property manager could have a greater impact on the pool of mortgage loans and   •have common general partners or managing members which could increase the risk that a financial failure or bankruptcy filing would have a greater impact on the pool of mortgage loans   mortgage loans involving more than one borrower could be challenged as fraudulent conveyances by creditors of the respective borrowers in an action brought outside a bankruptcy case or if a borrower were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case by a borrower’s representative see “certain legal   s     aspects of mortgage loans—bankruptcy laws” in the prospectus this is particularly the case where multiple borrowers with respect to a mortgage loan have differing ownership structures having different ownership structures poses a greater risk that borrowers who own different properties securing one loan did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value when they allowed their respective mortgaged properties to be encumbered by a lien securing the entire indebtedness and that the lien is an avoidable fraudulent conveyance   a lien granted by a borrower could be avoided if a court were to determine that i the borrower was insolvent when it granted the lien was rendered insolvent by the granting of the lien was left with inadequate capital when it allowed its mortgaged property or properties to be encumbered by a lien securing the entire indebtedness or was not able to pay its debts as they matured when it granted the lien and ii the borrower did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value when it allowed its mortgaged property or properties to be encumbered by a lien securing the entire indebtedness among other things a legal challenge to the granting of the liens may focus on the benefits realized by that borrower from the respective mortgage loan proceeds as well as the overall crosscollateralization if a court were to conclude that the granting of the liens was an avoidable fraudulent conveyance that court could i subordinate all or part of the pertinent mortgage loan to existing or future indebtedness of that borrower ii recover payments made under that mortgage loan or iii take other actions detrimental to the holders of the certificates including under certain circumstances invalidating the mortgage loan or the mortgages securing the crosscollateralization   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—crosscollateralized mortgage loans multiproperty mortgage loans and related borrower mortgage loans” in this free writing prospectus for information relating to mortgage loans secured by multiple mortgaged properties and mortgage loans with related borrowers   the borrower’s form of entity may cause special risks   the borrowers are legal entities rather than individuals mortgage loans made to legal entities may entail risks of loss greater than those of mortgage loans made to individuals for example a legal entity as opposed to an individual may be more inclined to seek legal protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy laws unlike individuals involved in bankruptcies most of the entities generally but not in all cases do not have personal assets and creditworthiness at stake aside from their interest in the properties the terms of the mortgage loans generally but not in all cases require that the borrowers covenant to be singlepurpose entities although in many cases the borrowers are not required to observe all covenants and conditions that typically are required in order for them to be viewed under standard rating agency criteria as “singlepurpose entities” in general but not in all cases borrowers’ organizational documents or the terms of the mortgage loans limit their activities to the ownership of only the related mortgaged property or properties and related ancillary activities and limit the borrowers’ ability to incur additional indebtedness or create or allow any encumbrance on the mortgaged properties to secure additional indebtedness or obligations of other entities these provisions are designed to mitigate the possibility that the borrowers’ financial condition would be adversely impacted by factors unrelated to the mortgaged property and the mortgage loan in the pool however we cannot assure you that the related borrowers will comply with these requirements see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—bankruptcy laws” in the prospectus also although a borrower may currently be a single purpose entity in certain cases that borrower was not originally a singlepurpose entity but at origination of the related mortgage loan its organizational documents were amended that borrower may also have previously owned property other than the related mortgaged property or be a “recycled” singlepurpose vehicle that previously had other liabilities see representation number  in annex d and the identified exceptions to that representation in annex d to this free writing prospectus in addition that borrower may not have observed all covenants that typically are required to consider a borrower a “single purpose entity” the bankruptcy of a borrower or a general partner or managing member of a borrower may impair the ability of the lender to enforce its rights and remedies under the related mortgage borrowers that are not singlepurpose entities structured to limit the possibility of becoming insolvent or bankrupt may be more likely to become insolvent or the subject of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding because the borrowers may be   s     •operating entities with a business distinct from the operation of the mortgaged property with the associated liabilities and risks of operating an ongoing business or   •entities or individuals that have personal liabilities unrelated to the mortgaged property   however any borrower even a singlepurpose entity structured to be bankruptcyremote as an owner of real estate will be subject to certain potential liabilities and risks we cannot assure you that any borrower will not file for bankruptcy protection or that creditors of a borrower or a corporate or individual general partner or managing member of a borrower will not initiate a bankruptcy or similar proceeding against the borrower or corporate or individual general partner or managing member   certain borrowers’ organizational documents or the terms of certain mortgage loans permit an affiliated property manager to maintain a custodial account on behalf of such borrower and certain affiliates of such borrower into which funds available to such borrower under the terms of the related mortgage loans and funds of such affiliates are held but which funds are and will continue to be separately accounted for as to each item of income and expense for each related mortgaged property and each related borrower a custodial account structure for affiliated entities while common among certain reits institutions or independent owners of multiple properties presents a risk for consolidation of the assets of such affiliates as commingling of funds is a factor a court may consider in considering a request by other creditors for substantive consolidation substantive consolidation is an equitable remedy that could result in an otherwise solvent company becoming subject to the bankruptcy proceedings of an insolvent affiliate making its assets available to repay the debts of affiliated companies a court has the discretion to order substantive consolidation in whole or in part and may include nondebtor affiliates of the bankrupt entity in the proceedings in particular consolidation may be ordered when corporate funds are commingled and used for a principal’s personal purposes inadequate records of transfers are made and corporate entities are deemed an alter ego of a principal strict adherence to maintaining separate books and records avoiding commingling of assets and otherwise maintaining corporate policies designed to preserve the separateness of corporate assets and liabilities make it less likely that a court would order substantive consolidation but we cannot assure you that the related borrowers property managers or affiliates will comply with these requirements as set forth in the related mortgage loans   furthermore with respect to any affiliated borrowers creditors of a common parent in bankruptcy may seek to consolidate the assets of such borrowers with those of the parent in addition where a mortgage loan includes provisions imposing recourse liability on an affiliate or sponsor there is greater risk of consolidation in such event consolidation of the assets of such borrowers would likely have an adverse effect on the funds available to make distributions on your certificates and may lead to a downgrade withdrawal or qualification of the ratings of your certificates   the organizational documents of a borrower generally but not in all cases under a mortgage loan that has an original principal balance in excess of  may also contain requirements that there be one or two independent directors managers or trustees depending on the entity form of such borrower whose vote is required before the borrower files a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency petition or otherwise institutes insolvency proceedings generally but not always the independent directors managers or trustees may only be replaced by certain other independent successors although the requirement of having independent directors managers or trustees is designed to mitigate the risk of a voluntary bankruptcy filing by a solvent borrower a borrower could file for bankruptcy without obtaining the consent of its independent directors managers or trustees and we cannot assure you that such bankruptcy would be dismissed as an unauthorized filing and in any case the independent directors managers or trustees may determine in the exercise of their fiduciary duties to the applicable borrower that a bankruptcy filing is an appropriate course of action to be taken by such borrower such determination might take into account the interests and financial condition of such borrower’s parent entities and such parent entities’ other subsidiaries in addition to those of the borrower such that the financial distress of an affiliate of a borrower might increase the likelihood of a bankruptcy filing by a borrower in any event we cannot assure you that a borrower will not file for bankruptcy protection that creditors of a borrower will not initiate a bankruptcy or similar proceeding against such borrower or that if initiated a bankruptcy case of the borrower could be dismissed   s     for example in the bankruptcy case of in re general growth properties inc notwithstanding that the subsidiaries were special purpose entities with independent directors numerous propertylevel special purpose subsidiaries were filed for bankruptcy protection by their parent entity nonetheless the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york denied various lenders’ motions to dismiss the special purpose entity subsidiaries’ cases as bad faith filings in denying the motions the bankruptcy court stated that the fundamental and bargainedfor creditor protections embedded in the special purpose entity structures at the property level would remain in place during the pendency of the chapter  cases those protections included adequate protection of the lenders’ interest in their collateral and protection against the substantive consolidation of the propertylevel debtors with any other entities the moving lenders had argued that the  propertylevel bankruptcy filings were premature and improperly sought to restructure the debt of solvent entities for the benefit of equity holders however the bankruptcy code does not require that a voluntary debtor be insolvent or unable to pay its debts currently in order to be eligible for relief and generally a bankruptcy petition will not be dismissed for bad faith if the debtor has a legitimate rehabilitation objective accordingly after finding that the relevant debtors were experiencing varying degrees of financial distress due to factors such as crossdefaults a need to refinance in the near term ie within  to  years and other considerations the bankruptcy court noted that it was not required to analyze in isolation each debtor’s basis for filing in the court’s view the critical issue was whether a parent company that had filed its bankruptcy case in good faith could include in the filing subsidiaries that were crucial to the parent’s reorganization   as demonstrated in the in re general growth properties inc bankruptcy case although special purpose entities are designed to mitigate the bankruptcy risk of a borrower special purpose entities can become debtors in bankruptcy under various circumstances unless a mortgage loan had an original principal balance in excess of  million it is unlikely that the originator obtained a nonconsolidation opinion with respect to the related borrower additionally in certain circumstances where the related mortgage loan had an original principal balance in excess of  million no nonconsolidation opinion was obtained with respect to the related borrower at origination see representation number  in annex d and the identified exceptions to that representation in annex d to this free writing prospectus and see “risk factors—the borrower’s form of entity may cause special risks” in the prospectus   in addition certain of the mortgage loans may be secured by a mortgaged property owned by a delaware statutory trust or its signatory trustee if required by local law or by a borrower that has the ability to convert to a delaware statutory trust including two  mortgaged properties identified as “behringer tractor supply portfolio” on annex a to this free writing prospectus securing one  mortgage loan representing approximately  of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cutoff date delaware statutory trusts are restricted in their ability to actively operate a property including with respect to loan workouts leasing and releasing making material improvements and other material actions affecting the related mortgaged property in addition in the case of a mortgaged property that is owned by a delaware statutory trust certain decisions may require the consent of the holders of the beneficial interests in the delaware statutory trust and in such event there is a risk that obtaining such consent will be time consuming and cause delays in the event certain actions need to be taken by or on behalf of the borrower or with respect to the mortgaged property see “description of the mortgage pool” in this free writing prospectus   tenanciesincommon may hinder recovery   three  mortgaged properties identified as “freeway crossing” and

tenantincommon owns an undivided share in the property and if such tenantincommon desires to sell its interest in the property and is unable to find a buyer or otherwise needs to force a partition the tenantincommon has the   s     ability to request that a court order a sale of the property and distribute the proceeds to each tenantincommon proportionally as a result if a tenantincommon borrower or owner exercises its right of partition the related mortgage loan may be subject to prepayment in addition the tenantincommon structure may cause delays in the enforcement of remedies because each time a tenantincommon borrower or owners file for bankruptcy the bankruptcy court stay will be reinstated in each case each related tenantincommon borrower or owner has waived its right to partition reducing the risk of partition however we cannot assure you that if challenged this waiver would be enforceable in addition in some cases the related mortgage loan documents provide for full recourse or personal liability for losses as to the related tenantsincommon and the guarantor or for the occurrence of an event of default under such mortgage loan documents if a tenantincommon files for partition in some cases a related tenantincommon borrower or owner is a special purpose entity in some cases bankruptcy remote reducing the risk of bankruptcy we cannot assure you that a bankruptcy proceeding by a single tenantincommon borrower or owner will not delay enforcement of the related mortgage loan additionally in some cases subject to the terms of the related mortgage loan documents a borrower or a tenantincommon borrower may assign its interests to one or more tenantincommon borrowers such change to or increase in the number of tenantincommon borrowers increases the risks related

partnership and managing member equity interests in a borrower such as specific percentage or control limitations the terms of the mortgage loans generally permit subject to certain limitations the transfer or pledge of limited partnership nonmanaging member or other passive equity interests in a borrower certain of the mortgage loans do not restrict the pledging of ownership interests in the related borrower but do restrict the transfer of ownership interests in the related borrower by imposing a specific percentage or control limitation or requiring the consent of the mortgagee to any

repayment date of the mortgage loan as applicable than would have otherwise been the case had a shorter amortization schedule been used or had the mortgage loan had a shorter interestonly period or not included an interestonly provision at all that higher principal amount outstanding could both i make it more difficult for the related borrower to make the required balloon or anticipated repayment date payment at maturity or on the related anticipated repayment date as applicable and ii lead to increased losses for the trust either during the loan term or at maturity or on the anticipated repayment date if the mortgage loan becomes a defaulted mortgage loan the ability of a borrower to make the required balloon or anticipated repayment date payment at maturity or on the related anticipated repayment date as applicable depends upon its ability either to refinance the related mortgage loan including any related companion loan or to sell the mortgaged property for an amount that is sufficient to repay the mortgage loan including any related companion loan in full with interest a borrower’s ability to achieve either of these goals will be affected by a number of factors including   •the availability of and competition for credit for commercial properties which may fluctuate over time   •prevailing interest rates   •the fair market value of the related mortgaged property   •the borrower’s equity in the related mortgaged property   •the borrower’s financial condition   •the operating history and occupancy level of the mortgaged property   •tax laws and   •prevailing general and regional economic conditions   see “risk factors—borrowers may be unable to make balloon payments” in the accompanying prospectus for additional risk factor considerations   whether or not losses are ultimately sustained any delay in the collection of a balloon payment or an anticipated repayment date payment that would otherwise be distributable on your certificates whether such delay is due to a borrower default or to a modification of the related mortgage loan or otherwise will likely extend the weighted average life of your certificates failure to repay a mortgage loan on any applicable anticipated repayment date is not an event of default   furthermore the recent credit crisis and economic downturn resulted in tightened lending standards and a substantial reduction in capital available to refinance commercial mortgage loans at maturity these factors increased the risk that refinancing may not be available for commercial mortgage loans see “—the volatile economy and credit crisis may increase loan defaults and affect the value and liquidity of your investment” in this free writing prospectus we cannot assure you that each borrower under a balloon loan will have the ability to repay the principal balance of such mortgage loan on the related maturity date or anticipated repayment date as applicable although there may be financial incentives to do so failure to pay a mortgage loan with an anticipated repayment date in full on or before that date will not be an event of default   additionally none of the mortgage loan sellers any party to the pooling and servicing agreement or any other person will be under any obligation to refinance any mortgage loan however in order to maximize recoveries on defaulted mortgage loans the pooling and servicing agreement permits the special servicer to extend the maturity of or otherwise modify mortgage loans other than the nonserviced mortgage loans which will each be serviced pursuant to a separate pooling and servicing agreement in a manner consistent with the servicing standard and subject to sections a through   s     g of the internal revenue code of  as amended any related treasury regulations and any related rulings or announcements promulgated by the irs subject to the limitations described under “servicing of the mortgage loans—modifications waivers and amendments” in this free writing prospectus we cannot assure you however that any such extension or modification will increase the present value of recoveries in a given case   we cannot assure you that each borrower will have the ability to repay the remaining principal balances on the applicable maturity date or anticipated repayment date   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—general” and “—certain terms and conditions of the mortgage loans” in this free writing prospectus for information on the terms of the mortgage loans in the trust   tenant concentration entails risk   a deterioration in the financial condition of a tenant can be particularly significant if a mortgaged property is wholly or significantly owneroccupied or leased to a single tenant or if any tenant makes up a significant portion of the rental income mortgaged properties that are wholly or significantly owneroccupied or that are leased to a single tenant or whose tenants make up a significant portion of the rental income also are more susceptible to interruptions of cash flow if the owneroccupier’s business operations are negatively impacted or that single tenant or those tenants fail to renew their leases this is so because the financial effect of the absence of operating income or rental income may be severe more time may be required to release the space and substantial capital costs may be incurred to make the space appropriate for replacement tenants   with respect to some of the mortgage loans that are secured by mortgaged properties that are leased to a single tenant or a tenant that makes up a significant portion of the rental income leases will expire prior to at or soon after the anticipated repayment dates or maturity dates of the related mortgage loans in addition certain of the mortgage loans may have mortgaged properties for which the leases of significant tenants provide the tenant with the ability to assign its lease or sublease its space in some cases subject to certain conditions set forth in such lease in certain circumstances the tenants andor lease guarantors may be released from further liability under such leases in connection with such assignments andor subleases see “—mortgaged properties leased to borrowers or borrower affiliated entities also have risks” below   the underwriting of the singletenant mortgage loans is based primarily upon the monthly rental payments due from the tenant under the lease of the related mortgaged property where the primary lease term expires before the scheduled maturity date or anticipated repayment date as applicable of the related mortgage loan the mortgage loan sellers considered the incentives for the primary tenant to release the premises and the anticipated rental value of the premises at the end of the primary lease term or took additional reserves or required letters of credit in connection with the lease expiration   we cannot assure you that any material or sole tenant will release the premises or that the premises will be relet to another tenant or that the space will be relet at the same rent per square foot during the term of or at the expiration of the primary lease term or that the related mortgaged property will not suffer adverse economic consequences in this regard additionally the underwriting of certain of these mortgage loans with mortgaged properties leased to single tenants or material tenants may have taken into account the creditworthiness of the tenants under the related leases and consequently may have higher loantovalue ratios and lower debt service coverage ratios than other types of mortgage loans see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgaged property considerations—tenant issues” in this free writing prospectus for additional information on certain mortgage loans included in the trust and “risk factors—tenant concentration entails risk” in the prospectus   certain additional risks relating to tenants   certain of the mortgaged properties may have tenants that sublet a portion or all of their space or may intend to sublet out a portion or all of their space in the future with respect to certain of these   s     spaces that are sublet the rents with respect to the related mortgage loan may have been underwritten at the amount of rent paid by the direct tenant even if the rent being paid by the sublessee is lower see “risk factors—certain additional risks relating to tenants” in the prospectus   certain of the mortgaged properties are andor may be leased in whole or in part by governmentsponsored tenants who have the right to rent reductions or to cancel their leases at any time for lack of appropriations or as a result of a government shutdown or for damage to the leased premises caused by casualty or condemnation in some of these cases the governmentsponsored tenant may have the right to terminate its lease at any time for any reason see annex a to this free writing prospectus for an identification of any governmentsponsored tenant that constitutes one of the five  largest tenants at any mortgaged property in addition see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgaged property considerations—tenant issues” in this free writing prospectus   in addition in certain cases a mortgaged property may be leased in whole or substantial part by the related borrower under the mortgage loan to an affiliate of the borrower in such cases it may be more likely a landlord will waive lease conditions for an affiliated tenant than it would for an unaffiliated tenant or have other nonstandard more tenantfriendly provisions we cannot assure you that any conflicts arising where a borrower is affiliated with a tenant at a mortgaged property would not adversely impact the value of the related mortgage loan in some cases an affiliated lessee may be physically occupying space related to its business in other cases an affiliated lessee may be a tenant under a master lease with the related borrower under which the tenant is obligated to make rent payments but does not occupy any space at the mortgaged property master leases in these circumstances may be used to bring occupancy to a “stabilized” level with the intent of finding additional tenants to occupy some of all of the master leased space but may not provide additional economic support for the mortgage loan we cannot assure you that any space “leased” by a borrower affiliate will eventually be occupied by third party tenants and consequently a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or its affiliates can be particularly significant to the borrower’s ability to perform under the mortgage loan as it can directly interrupt the cash flow from the mortgaged property if the borrower’s or its affiliate’s financial condition worsens these risks may be mitigated when mortgaged properties are leased to unrelated third parties see “—mortgaged properties leased to borrowers or borrower affiliated entities also have risks” below and “description of the mortgage pool—net cash flow and certain underwriting considerations” and “—mortgage pool characteristics—property type concentrations” in this free writing prospectus   in addition certain of the mortgage loans may have tenants who are leasing their spaces on a month to month basis and have the right to terminate their leases on a monthly basis further certain tenants’ leases may permit affected tenants to terminate their leases or reduce their rent if a tenant at an adjacent or nearby property terminates its lease or goes dark   tenant rollover risks the mortgaged properties related to certain mortgage loans have one or more properties with leases to single tenants in which the lease expires prior to at or shortly after the maturity date or anticipated repayment date as applicable of the related mortgage loans in addition the mortgaged properties related to many of the mortgage loans will experience substantial  or more and as much as  of gross leasable area lease rollover prior to the maturity date or anticipated repayment date as applicable of the related mortgage loan and in many cases relatively near or soon after the maturity dates or anticipated repayment dates as applicable of the related mortgage loans see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgaged property considerations—tenant issues—terminations” and “—expirations” in this free writing prospectus for additional information relating to lease terminations and expirations with respect to certain mortgage loans in the trust in addition for tenant rollover information relating to each of the top ten mortgage loans see the related summaries attached as annex a to this free writing prospectus   certain of the mortgaged properties securing other mortgage loans included in the trust are scheduled to have large lease rollovers prior to or shortly after the related maturity date or anticipated repayment date prospective investors are encouraged to review the lease expirations for the top five  tenants at each mortgaged property on annex a to this free writing prospectus where applicable   s     cotenancy in the event certain tenants fail to meet certain sales thresholds or other economic hurdles at the related mortgaged property or certain key tenants or a certain percent of tenants terminate their respective leases or cease operations or vacate their respective premises at the related mortgaged properties certain cotenancy clauses may be triggered with respect to such tenants or other tenants at the related mortgaged property thereby enhancing the impact of the lease expirations or terminations   certain examples of cotenancy provisions and other lease termination rights affecting various mortgaged properties are identified under “description of the mortgage pool—mortgaged property considerations—tenant issues—terminations” “—expirations” and “—additional considerations” in this free writing prospectus and in annex a annex a and in the footnotes to each such annex   occupancy and other leasing considerations with respect to the mortgage loans described above and certain other mortgage loans some of the related mortgage loan documents require tenant improvement and leasing commission or other reserves including trapping excess cash flow after notice of lease termination or failure to notify the lender of a lease term extension or if the tenant vacates its space or files for bankruptcy protection and in some cases the leases contain lessee extension options extending the term of such leases for a specified term however we cannot assure you that any extension options will be exercised or that the amount of any reserves will be adequate to mitigate the lack of rental income associated with these rollovers also certain of the mortgaged properties may be subject to tenant termination or contraction rights prior to the maturity date or anticipated repayment date as applicable of the related mortgage loan see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgaged property considerations—tenant issues—terminations” and “—expirations” in this free writing prospectus and in annex a annex a and in the footnotes to each such annex   in addition certain mortgaged properties may have ongoing negotiations with potential tenants or tenants for which leases or subleases are “out for signature” or for which prospective tenants have signed letters of intent related to certain space at the mortgaged property or that have executed leases but have not yet commenced paying rent or are not in occupancy or may have vacant space that is not leased in addition in certain cases the related lender has reserved funds for rent abatements andor tenant buildouts at the related space unless otherwise specifically indicated the occupancy underwritten net operating income and underwritten net cash flow statistics set forth in this free writing prospectus assume that those tenants are presently occupying the related leased space however we cannot assure you that those tenants that are not currently in occupancy will ultimately occupy their respective spaces or that those tenants that are not currently paying full rent will pay that rent as required under their respective leases for more information regarding tenants that have not executed leases or that may have executed leases but are not yet in occupancy see annex a to this free writing prospectus including the footnotes thereto annex a to this free writing prospectus and “description of the mortgage pool—net cash flow and certain underwriting considerations” in this free writing prospectus in addition investors should note that mortgaged properties with significant vacant space may be more difficult to relet as compared with mortgaged properties that have the benefit of higher occupancy rates   certain anchor or national tenant leases permit such tenants to cease operations or go “dark” any “dark” space may often be recaptured by the related borrower as landlord following a period of vacancy or ceased operations to the extent provided in the respective lease however recapture is not always an available remedy if not otherwise provided in the related lease and such tenant is not otherwise in default nor may a suitable replacement tenant be willing to relet the “dark” space   the leases with respect to certain of the mortgage loans provide that under certain circumstances the related tenant has the right to cease operating at the related mortgaged property provided that it continues to pay rent subject in certain circumstances to certain landlord recapture rights   certain tenants at the mortgaged properties may presently be dark but are continuing to pay current rent see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgaged property considerations—tenant issues—occupancy and tenant concentrations” in this free writing prospectus   s     in addition certain of the tenant leases for the mortgaged properties permit the affected tenants to terminate their leases andor abate rent if all or a portion of the leased property is affected by a casualty or subject to a condemnation proceeding which in some cases is a relatively low percentage see “risk factors—certain additional risks relating to tenants” in the prospectus   for additional descriptions of lease termination rights rights to reduce space for certain tenants and occupancy and leasing issues with respect to the applicable mortgage loans see “—risks of lease early

the related footnotes for additional information on certain occupancy and leasing issues applicable to the top five tenants at the mortgaged properties   options and other purchase rights may affect value or hinder recovery with respect to the mortgaged properties   with respect to certain of the mortgage loans the related borrower has given to one or more tenants or others an option to purchase a right of first refusal andor a right of first offer to purchase all or a portion of the mortgaged property in the event a sale is contemplated and such right may not be subordinate to the related mortgage in addition state statutes may grant a right of first refusal to certain designated parties this may impede the mortgagee’s ability to sell the related mortgaged property at foreclosure and may affect the value andor marketability of the related mortgaged property additionally the exercise of such a purchase option may result in the related mortgage loan being prepaid during a period when voluntary prepayments are otherwise prohibited see “—risks relating to prepayments and repurchases” “description of the mortgage pool—mortgaged property considerations—tenant issues” in this free writing prospectus and “description of top ten mortgage loans and additional mortgage loan information” in annex a to this free writing prospectus   rights of first refusal or rights of first offer may continue to apply after a foreclosure or comparable conversion of the related mortgaged properties and may have a chilling effect on the special servicer’s ability to liquidate the mortgaged property and as a result may materially adversely impact any liquidation proceeds available for distribution to certificateholders additionally the exercise of a purchase option may result in the related mortgage loan being prepaid during a period when voluntary prepayments are otherwise prohibited   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgaged property considerations—tenant issues” in this free writing prospectus for additional information on certain mortgage loans in the trust relating to purchase options rights of first offer and rights of first refusal affecting the related mortgaged properties   risks related to redevelopment and renovation at the mortgaged properties   certain of the mortgaged properties are properties that are currently undergoing or are expected to undergo in the future redevelopment property improvement plans renovations or expansions as described in “description of the mortgage pool—assessments of property value and condition—appraisals” in this free writing prospectus the underwriting of certain of the mortgage loans relied upon certain hypothetical values in the related appraisals related to such redevelopment property improvements renovation or expansion we cannot assure you that any current or planned redevelopment property improvements renovation or expansion will be completed that such redevelopment property improvements renovation or expansion will be completed in the time frame contemplated or that when and if redevelopment renovation or expansion is completed such redevelopment property improvements renovation or expansion will improve the operations at or increase the value of the subject property failure of any of the foregoing to occur could have a material negative impact on the related mortgaged property which could affect the ability of the related borrower to repay the related mortgage loan   s     in the event the related borrower or a tenant if applicable fails to pay the costs of work completed or material delivered in connection with such ongoing redevelopment renovation or expansion the portion of the mortgaged property on which there is ongoing construction or renovation may be subject to mechanic’s or materialmen’s liens that may be senior to the lien securing the related mortgage loan   the existence of construction at a mortgaged property may take rental units or rooms or leasable space “offline” or otherwise make space unavailable for rental impair access or traffic at or near the mortgaged property or in general make that mortgaged property less attractive to tenants or their customers and accordingly in each case could have a negative effect on net operating income   if the special servicer forecloses on behalf of the trust on a mortgaged property that is being redeveloped renovated or expanded pursuant to the remic provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the special servicer will only be permitted to arrange for completion of the redevelopment renovation or expansion if more than  of the costs of construction were incurred at the time the default on the related mortgage loan became imminent as a result the trust fund may not realize as much proceeds upon disposition of a foreclosure property as it would if it were permitted to complete construction   in addition we cannot assure you that any disruption caused by renovations at the mortgaged properties will not have an adverse impact on the revenue from the related mortgaged properties and therefore on the borrower’s ability to repay the related mortgage loan with income from the related mortgaged property see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgaged property considerations—property redevelopment and renovation issues” in this free writing prospectus for additional related information on certain mortgage loans in the trust   mortgaged properties leased to borrowers or borrower affiliated entities also have risks   if a mortgaged property is leased in whole or substantial part to the borrower under the related mortgage loan or to an affiliate of the borrower there may be conflicts of interest   in such cases it may be more likely a landlord will waive lease conditions for an affiliated tenant than it would for an unaffiliated tenant or have other nonstandard more tenantfriendly provisions we cannot assure you that any conflicts arising where a borrower is affiliated with a tenant at a mortgaged property would not adversely impact the value of the related mortgage loan see “—certain additional risks relating to tenants” above and “description of the mortgage pool—net cash flow and certain underwriting considerations” and “—mortgaged property considerations—tenant issues” in this free writing prospectus   see “risk factors—mortgaged properties leased to borrowers or borrower affiliated entities also have risks” in the prospectus   tenant bankruptcy entails risks   any tenant may from time to time experience a downturn in its business which may weaken its financial condition and result in a reduction or failure to make rental payments when due if tenants’ sales were to decline percentage rents may decline and further tenants may be unable to pay their base rent or other occupancy costs if a tenant defaults in its obligations to a property owner that property owner may experience delays in enforcing its rights as lessor and may incur substantial costs and experience significant delays associated with protecting its investment including costs incurred in renovating and reletting the property   section e of the bankruptcy code generally invalidates clauses that terminate contracts automatically upon the filing by one of the parties of a bankruptcy petition or that are conditioned on a party’s solvency but the bankruptcy code allows the debtor to assume or reject or subject to certain conditions assume and assign to a third party any unexpired lease in full which as a practical matter may give the debtor leverage to seek amendments to the lease in order to avoid a rejection if the tenant rejects the lease the landlord’s claim for breach of the lease would absent collateral securing the claim   s     be treated as a general unsecured claim against the tenant the amount of the claim would be limited to the amount owed for unpaid rent under the lease for the periods prior to the bankruptcy petition or earlier repossession or surrender of the lease premises plus the rent under the lease for the greater of one year or  not to exceed three years of the remaining term of such lease and the actual amount of the recovery could be less than the amount of the claim if a tenant assigns or assumes and assigns its lease the tenant must cure all defaults under the lease and provide the landlord with adequate assurance of its future performance under the lease we cannot assure you that tenants of the mortgaged properties will continue making payments under their leases or that tenants will not file for bankruptcy protection in the future or if any tenants so file that they will continue to make rental payments in the future or if any tenants so file that they will continue to make rental payments in a timely manner see “risk factors—tenant bankruptcy entails risks” in the prospectus   under the federal deposit insurance act upon the insolvency of certain banking institutions the federal deposit insurance corporation would be appointed as receiver for such tenant and has the option to disaffirm any lease it determines to be burdensome if disaffirmance will permit the orderly administration of the failed bank in such event where a bank was the lessee damages would be limited to contractual rent accruing before the later of the date i the notice of disaffirmance was mailed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or ii the disaffirmance becomes effective unless the lessor is in breach of the lease upon such a disaffirmance the landlord will also generally have a claim for unpaid rent due as the date of appointment of the receiver subject to all defenses and to the limitation on claims of the failed tenant’s creditors generally to the extent the landlord’s claim for past rent is unsecured such claim may be further limited by the depositor preference provisions of the federal deposit insurance act that could cause the bulk of the failed tenant’s assets to be paid to depositors and the federal deposit insurance corporation as the subrogee of any depositors paid by the federal deposit insurance corporation in its capacity as insurer   mortgage loans are nonrecourse and are not insured or guaranteed   in general the mortgage loans are not insured or guaranteed by any person or entity governmental or otherwise   investors should treat each mortgage loan as a nonrecourse loan if a default occurs recourse generally may be had only against the specific properties and other assets that have been pledged to secure the mortgage loan subject to in some cases certain customary nonrecourse carveouts to the borrower andor one or more principals or affiliates of the borrower even if a mortgage loan is recourse to the borrower or if a nonrecourse carveout to the borrower applies in most cases the borrower’s assets are limited primarily to its interest in the related mortgaged property consequently payment prior to maturity or the anticipated repayment date is dependent primarily on the sufficiency of the net operating income of the mortgaged property even if the mortgage loan provides limited or full recourse to a principal or affiliate of the related borrower we cannot assure you that any recovery from such principal or affiliate will be made or that such principal’s or affiliate’s assets would be sufficient to pay any otherwise recoverable claim in certain cases there may be limits or caps on the borrower’s or guarantor’s liability for the nonrecourse carveouts and in other cases the borrower may be the only obligor responsible for breaches or violations of some or all of the nonrecourse carveout provisions see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgaged property considerations—additional considerations” in this free writing prospectus as well as representation number  in annex d and the identified exceptions to that representation in annex d in this free writing prospectus   payment at maturity or the anticipated repayment date is primarily dependent upon the market value of the mortgaged property in relation to the unpaid balance of the related mortgage loan or the borrower’s ability to sell or refinance the mortgaged property for an amount sufficient to repay the mortgage loan   lack of skillful property management entails risks   the successful operation of a real estate project depends upon the property manager’s performance and viability certain individuals involved in the management or general business development at certain   s     mortgaged properties may engage in unlawful activities or otherwise exhibit poor business judgment that adversely affect operations and ultimately cash flow at such properties we make no representation or warranty as to the skills of any present or future managers see “risk factors—poor property management may adversely affect the performance of the related mortgaged property” in the prospectus   the performance of a mortgage loan and the related mortgaged property depends in part on who controls the borrower and the related mortgaged property   the operation and performance of a mortgage loan will depend in part on the identity of the persons or entities who control the related borrower and the related mortgaged property the performance of such mortgage loan may be adversely affected if control of the related borrower changes which may occur for example by means of transfers of direct or indirect ownership interests in such borrower generally the mortgage loan documents place certain restrictions on the transfer andor pledging of equity interests in the related borrower including specific percentage or control limitations oftentimes however the terms of the mortgage loan documents will permit subject to certain limitations the transfer or pledge of less than a controlling portion of the equity interests in the related borrower or a transfer of the equity interests of the borrower to an affiliate of the borrower and in certain cases the mortgage loans may have existing or permitted future mezzanine indebtedness see also “description of the mortgage pool—certain terms and conditions of the mortgage loans—”dueonsale” and “dueonencumbrance” provisions” and “description of the mortgage pool—additional debt—existing mezzanine debt” in this free writing prospectus   some mortgaged properties may not be readily convertible to alternative uses   some of the mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans included in the trust fund may not be readily convertible or convertible at all to alternative uses if those properties were to become unprofitable for any reason for example mortgaged properties that are part of a condominium regime may not be readily convertible due to use and other restrictive covenants imposed by the condominium declaration and other related documents especially in a situation where such mortgaged property does not represent the entire condominium regime additionally any vacant movie theater space would not easily be converted to other uses due to the unique construction requirements of movie theaters in addition converting bowling alleys self storage space retail banks specialty self storage space manufactured housing community properties hospitals parking garages certain specialized tenant retail office or industrial properties fitness andor entertainment centers or other athletic facilities educational institutions restaurants and kennels to alternate uses generally requires substantial capital expenditures and could result in a significant adverse effect on or interruption of the revenues generated by such mortgaged properties furthermore certain mortgaged properties may be subject to certain use restrictions andor lowincome housing restrictions in order to remain eligible for lowincome housing tax credits or governmental subsidized rental payments that could prevent the conversion of the mortgaged property to alternative uses the liquidation value of any mortgaged property subject to limitations of the kind described above or other limitations on convertibility of use may be substantially less than would be the case if the mortgaged property were readily adaptable to other uses see “—retail properties have special risks” above   zoning or other restrictions including without limitation any designation of a mortgaged property as a landmark or historical site may also prevent alternative uses see “—zoning compliance use restrictions and condemnation may adversely affect property value” below

mortgaged properties consists of the related borrower’s interest in commercial andor residential condominium interests in buildings andor other improvements or in real   s     property that is part of a master development and related interests in the common areas andor the related voting rights in the condominium or owners association   condominium interests in buildings andor other improvements or in real property that is part of a master development may in some cases constitute less than a majority of such voting rights and result in the related borrower not having control of the related condominium or owners association the board of managers or directors of the related condominium or master development generally has discretion to make decisions affecting the condominium or master development and we cannot assure you that the related borrower under a mortgage loan secured by one or more interests in that condominium or by a property that is part of that master development will have any control over decisions made by the related board of managers or directors thus decisions made by that board of managers or directors including regarding assessments to be paid by the unit owners insurance to be maintained on the condominium or master development and many other decisions affecting the maintenance of that condominium or master development may have a significant impact on the related mortgage loans in the trust fund that are secured by mortgaged properties consisting of such condominium interests or that are part of a master development we cannot assure you that the related board of managers or directors will always act in the best interests of the related borrower under the related mortgage loans in addition with respect to such mortgage loans there are certain circumstances when insurance proceeds must be used to repair and restore the related mortgaged property in accordance with the terms of the governing documents for the related condominium or master development the manner in which those proceeds and awards are required to be used under the governing documents may limit the amounts available for restoration of the related mortgaged property and may result in a material adverse effect on the related borrower’s ability to satisfy its obligations under the mortgage loan documents   further due to the nature of condominiums and master developments a default on the part of the borrower with respect to such mortgaged properties will not allow the special servicer the same flexibility in realizing on the collateral as is generally available with respect to commercial properties that are not condominium units or part of a master development the rights of other unit or property owners the documents governing the management of the condominium units or properties that are part of master developments and the state and local laws applicable to condominium units or properties that are part of master developments must be considered in addition in the event of a casualty with respect to a condominium due to the possible existence of multiple loss payees on any insurance policy covering such property there could be a delay in the allocation of related insurance proceeds if any consequently servicing and realizing upon the collateral described above could subject the certificateholders to a greater delay expense and risk than

not guarantees of present or future value one appraiser may reach a different conclusion than the conclusion that would be reached if a different appraiser were appraising that property moreover notwithstanding that all of the mortgage loans were underwritten and originated within approximately the past seven  months and all of the mortgage loans have appraisal dates within approximately eleven  months of the cutoff date the values of the mortgaged properties may have fluctuated significantly since the appraisals were performed moreover appraisals seek to establish the amount a typically motivated buyer would pay a typically motivated seller and in certain cases may have taken into consideration the purchase price paid by the borrower that amount could be significantly higher than the amount obtained from the sale of a mortgaged property under a distress or liquidation sale in addition certain appraisals may be based on extraordinary assumptions including without limitation that certain tenants are inplace and paying rent when such tenants have not yet taken occupancy additionally certain appraisals with respect to mortgage loans secured by multiple mortgaged properties may have been conducted on a portfolio basis rather than on an individual property basis and the sum of the values of the individual properties may be different from and in some cases may be less than the appraised value of the aggregate of such properties on a portfolio basis further with respect to eight  mortgaged properties identified as “hilton suites chicago magnificent mile”

pool—assessments of property value and condition—appraisals” in this free writing prospectus and “risk factors—limitations of appraisals” in the prospectus   different timing of mortgage loan amortization poses certain risks   as principal payments or prepayments are made on a mortgage loan that is part of a pool of mortgage loans the pool will be subject to more concentration risks with respect to the diversity of mortgaged properties types of mortgaged properties and number of borrowers as described in this free writing prospectus classes that have a later sequential designation or a lower payment priority are more likely to be exposed to this concentration risk than are classes with an earlier sequential designation or a higher priority this is so because principal on the offered certificates is generally payable in sequential order and no class entitled to distributions of principal generally receives principal until the certificate balance of the preceding higher priority class or classes entitled to receive principal has been reduced to zero   environmental risks relating to the mortgaged properties   the trust could become liable for a material adverse environmental condition at an underlying mortgaged property any such potential liability could reduce or delay payments on the offered certificates   s     each of the mortgaged properties was either i subject to environmental site assessments prior to the time of origination of the related mortgage loan or in certain limited cases after origination including phase i environmental site assessments or updates of previously performed phase i environmental site assessments or ii subject to a secured creditor environmental insurance policy or other environmental insurance policy in some cases the related environmental site assessment may have recommended no further action where i underground storage tanks had been removed or abandoned in place with no contamination found andor were issued regulatory closure ii former gas stations or dry cleaning facilities or manufacturing activities had resulted in soil andor groundwater contamination that received regulatory closure based on completion of remediation or of a determination of low environmental risk or iii nearby thirdparty contamination sites were not likely to impact the mortgaged properties in other cases phase ii environmental site assessments or equivalent tests also have been performed or recommended in certain cases these assessments revealed conditions that resulted in requirements that the related borrowers establish operations and maintenance plans monitor the mortgaged property or nearby properties abate or remediate the condition andor provide additional security such as letters of credit reserves a secured creditor impaired property policy environmental insurance policy or pollution legal liability environmental impairment policy or environmental indemnification in certain cases recommended phase ii site assessments were not performed and reserves or insurance policies were obtained in lieu of such phase ii site assessments or the related lender otherwise determined not to have the phase ii site assessment performed additionally certain of the mortgaged properties have had recognized environmental conditions for which remediation has previously occurred or ongoing remediation or monitoring is still continuing although assessments were made on the majority of the mortgaged properties and these involved site visits and other types of review we cannot assure you that all environmental conditions and risks were identified   except as described under “description of the mortgage pool—mortgaged property considerations—environmental considerations” in this free writing prospectus none of the environmental site assessments revealed any material adverse environmental condition or circumstance at any mortgaged property except for those   ·that will be remediated or abated in all material respects by the closing date   ·for which an escrow or letter of credit for the remediation was established   ·for which an environmental insurance policy was obtained from a third party insurer   ·for which the consultant recommended an operations and maintenance plan with respect to the applicable mortgaged property or periodic monitoring of nearby properties which recommendations are consistent with industry practice   ·for which the borrower the principal of the borrower or another financially responsible party has provided an indemnity or is required to take or is liable for the failure to take such actions if any with respect to such matters as have been required by the applicable governmental authority or recommended by the environmental site assessments   ·for which such conditions or circumstances were investigated further and the environmental consultant recommended no further action or remediation   ·as to which the borrower or other responsible party obtained a “no further action” letter or other evidence that governmental authorities are not requiring further action or remediation or as to which the borrower or other responsible party will be obtaining such “no further action” or remediation letter and a holdback or other assurance was made to secure the receipt of such letter or   ·that would not require substantial cleanup remedial action or other extraordinary response under environmental laws   s     with respect to such environmental site assessments in certain cases the identified condition was related to the presence of asbestoscontaining materials leadbased paint mold andor radon where these substances were present the environmental consultant generally recommended and the related mortgage loan documents with certain exceptions generally required the establishment of an operation and maintenance plan to address the issue or in some cases involving asbestoscontaining materials leadbased paint and mold a containment abatement or removal program other identified conditions could for example include leaks from storage tanks or hydraulic equipment and onsite spills corrective action as required by the regulatory agencies has been or is currently being undertaken and in some cases the related borrowers have made deposits into environmental reserve accounts however we cannot assure you that any environmental indemnity insurance letter of credit or reserve amounts will be sufficient to remediate the environmental conditions or that all environmental conditions have been identified or that operation and maintenance plans will be put in place andor followed additionally we cannot assure you that actions of tenants at mortgaged properties will not adversely affect the environmental condition of the mortgaged properties   in addition problems associated with mold may pose risks to mortgaged properties and may also be the basis for personal injury claims against a borrower although the mortgaged properties are required to be inspected periodically we cannot assure you that the presence or extent of mold will be accurately identified if left unchecked the growth of mold could result in the interruption of cash flow litigation and remediation expenses any of which could adversely impact collections from a mortgaged property or otherwise adversely affect the ability of the borrower to pay its loan obligations   we cannot assure you that with respect to any mortgaged property that any remediation plan or any projected remedial costs or time is accurate or sufficient to complete the remediation objectives or that no additional contamination requiring environmental investigation or remediation will not be discovered on any mortgaged property likewise all environmental policies naming the lender as named insured cover certain risks or events specifically identified in the policy but the coverage is limited by its terms conditions limitations and exclusions and does not purport to cover all environmental conditions whatsoever affecting the applicable mortgaged property and we cannot assure you that any environmental conditions currently known suspected or unknown and discovered in the future will be covered by the terms of the policy   in general different types of environmental liability insurance policies provide coverage with respect to a mortgage loan for one or more of the following losses subject to the applicable coverage limits and deductibles and further subject to each policy’s conditions and exclusions   ·if during the term of some types of lender environmental policies the borrower defaults under its mortgage loan and adverse environmental conditions exist at levels above legal limits on the related underlying real property the insurer will indemnify the insured for an amount in some cases capped at remediation costs equal to the outstanding principal balance or in some cases a lesser specified amount of the related mortgage loan on the date of the default together with accrued interest from the date of default or in some cases the date that the default is reported to the insurer until the date that the outstanding principal balance is paid or   ·if the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as a result of a claim first made against the insured and reported to the insurer during the term of a policy for bodily injury property damage or cleanup costs resulting from adverse environmental conditions on under or emanating from the underlying real property the insurer will pay the lesser of a specified amount and the amount of that claim or   ·if the insured enforces the related mortgage loan the insurer will thereafter pay the lesser of a specified amount and the amount of the legally required cleanup costs for adverse environmental conditions at levels above legal limits which exist on or under the acquired underlying real property provided that the appropriate party reported those conditions to the applicable government agency in accordance with applicable law   s     environmental liability insurance policies do not cover adverse environmental conditions that the insured first became aware of before the term of the policy unless those conditions were disclosed to the insurer before the policy was issued in some cases policies exclude coverage for known conditions even if disclosed   environmental liability insurance policies may contain additional limitations and exclusions including but not limited to exclusions from coverage for mold or other microbial contamination asbestos and lead based paint coverages that are less than the related loan amount or policy durations which do not extend to or beyond the maturity of the related loan   some borrowers under the mortgage loans may not have satisfied or may not satisfy all postclosing obligations required by the related mortgage loan documents with respect to environmental matters we cannot assure you that recommended operations and maintenance plans have been implemented or will continue to be complied with   in some cases the environmental consultant did not recommend that any action be taken by the related borrower with respect to a potential adverse environmental condition at a mortgaged property because a responsible party other than the related borrower had been identified with respect to that condition we cannot assure you however that such a responsible party will be willing or financially able to remediate the subject condition   in addition certain properties may be undergoing ongoing monitoring in connection with past remediation or contamination   we cannot assure you that the environmental assessments revealed all existing or potential environmental risks or that all adverse environmental conditions have been or will be completely abated or remediated or that any reserves insurance or operations and maintenance plans will be sufficient to remediate the environmental conditions moreover we cannot assure you that   ·future laws ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or   ·the current environmental condition of the mortgaged properties will not be adversely affected by tenants or by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of the mortgaged properties such as underground storage tanks   before the special servicer acquires title to a mortgaged property on behalf of the trust it must obtain an environmental assessment of such mortgaged property or rely on a recent environmental assessment this requirement will decrease the likelihood that the trust will become liable under any environmental law however this requirement may effectively preclude foreclosure until a satisfactory environmental assessment is obtained or until any required remedial action is taken there is accordingly some risk that the mortgaged property will decline in value while this assessment is being obtained or remedial action is being taken moreover we cannot assure you that this requirement will effectively insulate the trust from potential liability under environmental laws any such potential liability could reduce or delay distributions to certificateholders   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgaged property considerations—environmental considerations” in this free writing prospectus for

of earthquake flood and other insurance   although the mortgaged properties are required to be insured against certain risks there is a possibility of casualty loss with respect to the mortgaged properties for which insurance proceeds may not be adequate or which may result from risks not covered by insurance   in addition hazard insurance policies will typically contain coinsurance clauses that in effect require an insured at all times to carry insurance of a specified percentage generally  to  of the full replacement value of the improvements on the related mortgaged property in order to recover the full amount of any partial loss as a result even if insurance coverage is maintained if the insured’s coverage falls below this specified percentage those clauses generally provide that the insurer’s liability in the event of partial loss does not exceed the lesser of  the replacement cost of the improvements less physical depreciation and  that proportion of the loss as the amount of insurance carried bears to the specified percentage of the full replacement cost of those improvements   the mortgage loans do not all require flood insurance on the related mortgaged properties unless they have material improvements that are in a flood zone and flood insurance is available and in certain instances even where the related mortgaged property was in a flood zone and flood insurance was available flood insurance was not required   furthermore with respect to certain mortgage loans the insurable value of the related mortgaged property as of the origination date of the related mortgage loan was lower than the principal balance of the related mortgage loan  in the event of a casualty when a borrower is not required to rebuild or cannot rebuild we cannot assure you that the insurance required with respect to the related mortgaged property will be sufficient to pay the related mortgage loan in full and there is no “gap” insurance required under such mortgage loan to cover any difference in those circumstances a casualty that occurs near the maturity date may result in an extension of the maturity date of the mortgage loan if the master servicer in accordance with the servicing standard determines that such extension was in the best interest of certificateholders   we cannot assure you that the borrowers will in the future be able to comply with requirements to maintain adequate insurance with respect to the mortgaged properties or be able to pay any deductible on a policy and any uninsured loss could have a material adverse impact on the amount available to make payments on the related mortgage loan and consequently the offered certificates as with all real estate if reconstruction for example following fire or other casualty or any major repair or improvement is required to the damaged property changes in laws and governmental regulations may be applicable and may materially affect the cost to or ability of the borrowers to effect such reconstruction major repair or improvement as a result the amount realized with respect to the mortgaged properties and the amount available to make payments on the related mortgage loan and consequently the offered certificates could be reduced in addition we cannot assure you that the amount of insurance required or provided would be sufficient to cover damages caused by any casualty or that such insurance will be available in the future at commercially reasonable rates   in general other than where the mortgage loan documents permit the borrower to rely on a tenant including a ground tenant or other third party such as a condominium association if applicable to obtain the insurance coverage on selfinsurance provided by a tenant or on a tenant’s agreement to rebuild or continue paying rent the master servicer and the special servicer will be required to cause the borrower on each mortgage loan to maintain such insurance coverage in respect of the related mortgaged property as is required under the related mortgage loan documents see “description of the mortgage pool—certain terms and conditions of the mortgage loans—hazard liability and other insurance” in this free writing prospectus in general the standard form of fire and extended coverage policy covers physical damage to or destruction of the improvements of a property by fire lightning   s     explosion smoke windstorm and hail and riot strike and civil commotion subject to the conditions and exclusions specified in each policy windstorm is a common exclusion for properties located in certain locations most policies typically do not cover any physical damage resulting from among other things   ·war   ·revolution   ·terrorism   ·nuclear biological or chemical materials   ·governmental actions   ·floods and other water related causes   ·earth movement including earthquakes landslides and mudflows   ·wet or dry rot   ·vermin and   ·domestic animals   unless the related mortgage loan documents specifically require the borrower to insure against physical damage arising from such causes then the resulting losses may be borne by you as a holder of certificates see “servicing of the mortgage loans—maintenance of insurance” in this free writing prospectus   even if a type of loss is covered by the insurance policies required to be in place at the mortgaged properties the mortgaged properties may suffer losses for which the insurance coverage is inadequate for example   ·in a case where terrorism coverage is included under a policy if the terrorist attack is for example nuclear biological or chemical in nature the policy may include an exclusion that precludes coverage for such terrorist attack   ·in certain cases particularly where land values are high the insurable value at the time of origination of the mortgage loan of the mortgaged property may be significantly lower than the principal balance of the mortgage loan   ·with respect to mortgaged properties located in flood prone areas where flood insurance is required the related mortgaged property may only have federal flood insurance which only covers up to  not private flood insurance and the related mortgaged property may suffer losses that exceed the amounts covered by the federal flood insurance   ·the mortgage loan documents may limit the requirement to obtain related insurance to where the premium amounts are “commercially reasonable” or a similar limitation and   ·if reconstruction or major repairs are required changes in laws may materially affect the borrower’s ability to effect any reconstruction or major repairs andor may materially increase the costs of the reconstruction or repairs and insurance may not cover or sufficiently compensate the insured   see “description of the mortgage pool—certain terms and conditions of the mortgage loans—hazard liability and other insurance” in this free writing prospectus   s     risks associated with blanket insurance policies or selfinsurance   certain of the mortgaged properties are covered by blanket insurance policies which also cover other properties of the related borrower or its affiliates including certain properties in close proximity to the mortgaged properties in the event that such policies are drawn on to cover losses on such other properties the amount of insurance coverage available under such policies would thereby be reduced and could be insufficient to cover insurable risks at the related mortgaged property in addition with respect to some of the mortgaged properties a tenant the related borrower or their respective affiliates are permitted to provide insurance or to selfinsure against risks to the extent that insurance coverage relies on selfinsurance there is risk that the “insurer” will not be willing or have the financial ability to satisfy the claim when a loss occurs additionally the risk of blanket or selfinsurance can be magnified if affiliated borrowers under multiple mortgage loans in the trust are covered under the same blanket policy see representation number  on annex d to this free writing prospectus and the exceptions to that representation on annex d to this free writing prospectus   availability of terrorism insurance   following the september   terrorist attacks in the new york city area and washington dc area many reinsurance companies which assume some of the risk of policies sold by primary insurers eliminated coverage for acts of terrorism from their reinsurance policies without that reinsurance coverage primary insurance companies would have to assume that risk themselves which may cause them to eliminate such coverage in their policies increase the amount of the deductible for acts of terrorism or charge higher premiums for such coverage in order to offset this risk congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of  which established the terrorism insurance program on december   the terrorism insurance program was extended and amended by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of  through december   and was reauthorized and amended on january   until december   under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of    the terrorism insurance program is administered by the secretary of the treasury and provides some financial assistance from the united states government to insurers in the event of another terrorist attack that results in an insurance claim the program applies to united states risks only and to acts that are committed by an individual or individuals as an effort to influence or coerce united states civilians or the united states government to facilitate the availability of coverage for acts of terrorism the terrorism insurance program voids exclusions in property and casualty insurance policies for acts of terrorism however it does not expressly void coverage exclusions in such policies such as those for damage resulting from nuclear biological chemical and radiological attacks see “description of the mortgage pool—certain terms and conditions of the mortgage loans—hazard liability and other insurance” in this free writing prospectus   in addition no compensation is payable under the terrorism insurance program unless the aggregate industry losses relating to such act of terror exceed a specified threshold which is  million in  subject to annual  million increases until the threshold is equal to  million as a result unless the borrowers obtains separate coverage for events that do not meet these thresholds which coverage may not be required by the respective mortgage loan documents and may not otherwise be obtainable such events would not be covered we cannot assure you that the terrorism insurance program will create any long term changes in the availability and cost of insuring terrorism risks in addition we cannot assure you that terrorism insurance or the terrorism insurance program will be available or provide sufficient protection against risks of loss on the mortgaged properties resulting from acts of terrorism   under the terrorism insurance program the federal share of compensation will be equal to  in  subject to annual decreases of  until equal to  of the portion of insured losses that exceeds an applicable insurer deductible required to be paid during each program year which insurer deductible was fixed by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of  at  of an insurer’s direct earned premium for any program year the federal share in the aggregate in any program year   s     may not exceed  billion with the insurers being liable for any amount that exceeds this cap an insurer that paid its deductible is not liable for the payment of any portion of total annual united states wide losses that exceed  billion regardless of the terms of the individual insurance contracts   in addition certain of the mortgage loans contain limitations on the borrower’s obligation to obtain terrorism insurance such as i waiving the requirement that such borrowers are required to maintain terrorism insurance if such insurance is not available at commercially reasonable rates ii waiving the requirement that such borrowers are required to maintain terrorism insurance or limiting the amount of such insurance for mortgaged properties in certain locations or for certain property types iii providing that the related borrowers may not be required to spend in excess of a specified dollar amount or a cap based on a percentage or multiple factor in order to obtain such terrorism insurance or in the event such terrorism insurance is not available from a “qualified carrier” then the borrower may be permitted to obtain such terrorism insurance from the highest rated insurance company providing such terrorism coverage iv permitting certain tenants to insure or to selfinsure as to risks of terrorism at mortgaged properties that may only be occupied or are predominantly occupied by such tenants or v allowing for a deductible which may be substantial in certain instances for such terrorism insurance   see “description of the mortgage pool—certain terms and conditions of the mortgage loans—hazard liability and other insurance” in this free writing prospectus for additional information on certain mortgage loans in the trust see also representation number  in annex d and the identified exceptions to that representation in annex d to this free writing prospectus   we cannot assure you that all of the mortgaged properties will be insured against the risks of terrorism and similar acts as a result of any of the foregoing the amount available to make distributions on your certificates could be reduced   zoning compliance use restrictions and condemnation may adversely affect property value   certain of the mortgaged properties may not comply with current zoning laws including density use parking height and set back requirements due to changes in zoning requirements after such mortgaged properties were constructed from time to time there may be condemnations pending or threatened against one or more of the mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans the proceeds payable in connection with a total condemnation may not be sufficient to satisfy the remaining indebtedness of the related mortgage loan similarly proceeds payable in connection with partial condemnations may not be sufficient to restore the related mortgaged property and as a result any partial condemnation may have a material adverse effect on the continued use of or income generation from the affected mortgaged property therefore we cannot assure you that the occurrence of any condemnation will not have a negative impact upon distributions on your certificates see also representation number  in annex d and the identified exceptions to that representation in annex d to this free writing prospectus   certain of the mortgaged properties have zoning violations based on current law including those related to density use parking height setbacks area ratio or building separation many of these mortgaged properties have been determined to be i legal nonconforming structures which would be required to be rebuilt in accordance with current zoning requirements if there is a casualty greater than a certain threshold percentage of the property or ii legal nonconforming uses which would no longer be permitted if there is a casualty greater than a certain threshold percentage of the property or if there is an abandonment of the legal nonconforming use for a requisite period in some cases the related borrower has obtained law and ordinance insurance to cover additional costs that result from the inability to rebuild the improvements as it existed prior to such casualty however if as a result of the applicable zoning laws the rebuilt improvements are constrained by size or square footage limitations or otherwise are limited in the type of property that may be rebuilt as compared to the original improvements any potential loss in income will generally not be covered by law and ordinance insurance in addition certain of the mortgaged properties are in violation of zoning requirements in connection with the mortgaged properties that are legal nonconforming or have zoning violations see “description of the mortgage pool—assessments of property value and condition—zoning and building code compliance and condemnation” in this free writing prospectus for additional information on certain mortgage loans in the   s     trust and “risk factors—if mortgaged properties are not in compliance with current zoning laws restoration following a casualty loss may be limited” in the prospectus see also representation number  in annex d and the identified exceptions to that representation in annex d to this free writing prospectus   in addition certain of the mortgaged properties may be subject to certain use restrictions andor operational requirements imposed pursuant to development agreements ground leases restrictive covenants environmental deed restrictions reciprocal easement agreements or operating agreements or in the case of those mortgaged properties that are condominiums condominium declarations or other condominium use restrictions or regulations especially in a situation where the mortgaged property does not represent the entire condominium building such use restrictions could include for example limitations on the character of the improvements or the properties limitations affecting noise and parking requirements among other things and limitations on the borrowers’ right to operate certain types of facilities within a prescribed radius these limitations may impose upon the borrower stricter requirements with respect to repairs and alterations including following a casualty loss these limitations could adversely affect the ability of the related borrower to lease the mortgaged property on favorable terms thus adversely affecting the borrower’s ability to fulfill its obligations under the related mortgage loan   additionally certain of these mortgaged properties may have been designated as historic or landmark buildings or may be located in areas designated as historic or landmark such properties may be subject to historic preservation requirements and regulations compliance with these regulations may be costly and may impede the related borrowers’ ability to renovate or remodel the related property historic preservation regulations may also adversely impact the ability of the related borrowers to convert the related property to alternative uses or otherwise develop or alter the property in addition any alteration reconstruction demolition or new construction affecting such property may require prior approval any such approval process even if successful could delay any redevelopment or alteration of a related property the liquidation value of such property to the extent subject to limitations of the kind described above or other limitations on convertibility of use may be substantially less than would be the case if such property was readily adaptable to other uses or redevelopment   increases in real estate taxes due to termination of a pilot program or other tax abatement arrangements may reduce net cash flow and payments to certificateholders   certain of the mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans may have or may in the future have the benefit of reduced real estate taxes under a local government program of payment in lieu of taxes often known as a “pilot” program or other tax abatement or reimbursement arrangements some of these programs or arrangements are scheduled to terminate or have significant tax increases prior to the maturity of the related mortgage loan resulting in higher and in some cases substantially higher real estate tax obligations for the related borrower or a reduction of payments to the related borrower an increase in real estate taxes may affect the ability of the borrower to pay debt service on the related mortgage loan we cannot assure you that any such program will continue for the term of the related mortgage loan or would survive a mortgage loan foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure   litigation or other legal proceedings could adversely affect the mortgage loans   there may be pending or threatened legal proceedings against or other past or present adverse regulatory circumstances experienced by the borrowers their sponsors and managers of the mortgaged properties and their respective affiliates related to the business of or arising out of the ordinary business of the borrowers their sponsors managers and affiliates any such litigation or proceedings could adversely impact the related borrower’s ability to meet its obligations under the related mortgage loan and as a result have a material adverse effect on your certificates   in addition certain of the borrower sponsors property managers affiliates of any of the foregoing andor entities controlled thereby have been a party to bankruptcy proceedings mortgage loan defaults and restructures discounted payoffs foreclosure proceedings or deedinlieu of foreclosure transactions   s     or other material proceedings including criminal proceedings in the past whether or not related to the mortgaged property securing a mortgage loan in this securitization transaction in some cases mortgaged properties securing certain of the mortgage loans previously secured other loans that had been in default restructured or the subject of a discounted payoff foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure   certain of the borrower sponsors may have a history of litigation or other proceedings against their lender in some cases involving various parties to a securitization transaction we cannot assure you that the borrower sponsors that have engaged in litigation or other proceedings in the past will not commence action against the trust in the future upon any attempt by the special servicer to enforce the mortgage loan documents any such actions by the borrower or borrower sponsor may result in significant expense and potential loss to the issuing entity and a shortfall in funds available to make payments on the offered certificates in addition certain principals or borrower sponsors may have in the past been convicted of or pled guilty to a felony   if a borrower or a principal of a borrower or affiliate has been a party to a bankruptcy foreclosure litigation or other proceeding particularly against a lender or has been convicted of a crime in the past we cannot assure you that the borrower or principal will not be more likely than other borrowers or principals to avail itself or cause a borrower to avail itself of its legal rights under the federal bankruptcy code or otherwise in the event of an action or threatened action by the lender or its servicer to enforce the related mortgage loan documents or otherwise conduct its operations in a manner that is in the best interests of the lender andor the mortgaged property we cannot assure you that any such proceedings or actions will not have a material adverse effect upon distributions on your certificates   further borrowers principals of borrowers property managers and affiliates of such parties may in the future be involved in bankruptcy proceedings foreclosure proceedings or other material proceedings including criminal proceedings whether or not related to the mortgage loans we cannot assure you that any such proceedings will not negatively impact a borrower’s or loan sponsor’s ability to meet its obligations under the related mortgage loan and as a result could have a material adverse effect upon your certificates   often it is difficult to confirm the identity of owners of all of the equity in a borrower which means that past issues may not be

also holds an equity interest may be subject to claims of equitable subordination if the lender were deemed to have the ability to control or otherwise exercise influence over the business and affairs of the borrower resulting in economic hardship to other creditors of the borrower this control or influence may constitute   s     grounds for equitable subordination and a court may treat one or more of the loans as if it were unsecured or common equity in the borrower in that case if the borrower were to liquidate the lender which may include unaffiliated assignees in some cases would be entitled to repayment of its loan on a pro rata basis with other unsecured debt or if the effect of subordination was to place the lender at the level of common equity then on an equal basis with other holders

offered certificates the sponsors and their respective affiliates will be compensated in an amount based on among other things the offering price of the offered certificates and the amount of proceeds received from the sale of the offered certificates to investors   furthermore the sponsors and their respective affiliates may benefit from a completed offering of the offered certificates because the

portfolio whole loan were to become specially serviced then after the occurrence and continuance of a control event under such securitization or after the occurrence of a consultation termination event under such securitization no party would be engaged to review the special servicer’s performance under such securitization or to determine if the special servicer is acting in accordance with the servicing standard under such securitization respectively  a conflict of interest affecting the duties of the special servicer of the uhaul portfolio whole loan under the private cmbs securitization could adversely affect the holders of some or all of the classes of the offered certificates   the sponsors the depositor and the trust are subject to bankruptcy or insolvency laws that may affect the trust fund’s ownership of the mortgage loans   in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of a sponsor or the depositor it is possible the trust’s right to payment from or ownership of the mortgage loans could be challenged and if such challenge were successful delays reductions in payments andor losses on the certificates could occur   the transfer of the mortgage loans by the sponsors in connection with this offering is not expected to qualify for the securitization safe harbor adopted by the federal deposit insurance corporation for securitizations sponsored by insured depository institutions  cfr §  however the safe harbor is nonexclusive   in the case of each sponsor an opinion of counsel will be rendered on the closing date based on certain facts and assumptions and subject to certain qualifications to the effect that the transfer of the applicable mortgage loans by such sponsor to the depositor would generally be respected in the event of   s     a bankruptcy or insolvency of such sponsor nevertheless we cannot assure you that the federal deposit insurance corporation a bankruptcy trustee if applicable or another interested party would not attempt to assert that such transfer was not a sale even if a challenge were not successful it is possible that payments on the offered certificates would be delayed while a court resolves the claim   in addition since the trust is a common law trust it may not be eligible for relief under the federal bankruptcy laws unless it can be characterized as a “business trust” for purposes of the federal bankruptcy laws bankruptcy courts look at various considerations in making this determination so it is not possible to predict with any certainty whether or not the trust would be characterized as a “business trust” regardless of whether a bankruptcy court ultimately determines that the trust is a “business trust” it is possible that payments on the offered certificates would be delayed while the court resolved the issue   title ii of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act provides for an orderly liquidation authority under which the federal deposit insurance corporation can be appointed as receiver of certain us nonbank financial companies and their direct or indirect subsidiaries in certain cases if it is determined that their failure would have adverse effects on us financial stability we make no representation as to whether this would or could apply to any of the sponsors in january  the acting general counsel of the federal deposit insurance corporation issued a letter in which he expressed his view that under thenexisting regulations the federal deposit insurance corporation as receiver under the orderly liquidation authority would not in the exercise of its orderly liquidation authority repudiation powers recover as property of a financial company assets transferred by the financial company provided that the transfer satisfies the conditions for the exclusion of assets from the financial company’s estate under the bankruptcy code the letter further noted that while the federal deposit insurance corporation staff may be considering recommending further regulations under orderly liquidation authority the acting general counsel would recommend that such regulations incorporate a  day transition period for any provisions affecting the federal deposit insurance corporation’s statutory power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts if however the federal deposit insurance corporation were to adopt a different approach than that described in the acting general counsel’s letter delays or reductions in payments on the offered certificates would occur   barclays a loan seller is subject to the provisions of the insolvency act  united kingdom act of parliament  ch  the “insolvency act” and the banking act  united kingdom act of parliament  ch  the “banking act” under the terms of the insolvency act certain transactions by an englishregistered company such as barclays may be challenged by an insolvency officer appointed to that company on its insolvency under the banking act the secretary of state prudential regulation authority or bank of england can apply to the court for implementation of an insolvency regime specifically for certain deposittaking institutions one aspect of this regime is that an insolvency officer will conduct the relevant insolvency process in such a manner as to promote protection of retail deposits held by such an institution in combination with the united kingdom financial services compensation scheme further under the banking act the uk treasury the prudential regulation authority andor the bank of england may also in the circumstances set out in the banking act make an order for the transfer of any property assets or liabilities of a uk authorized deposit taker either to a company owned by the bank of england or to any private sector purchaser orders under the banking act may also modify the way in which rights of third parties can be exercised these powers exist within a broader range of powers designed to ensure the stability of the uk banking sector and exercise of such may have an impact on the rights of third parties relative to barclays an opinion of counsel will be rendered on the closing date based on certain facts and assumptions and subject to certain qualifications to the effect that the transfer of barclays’ interest in the mortgage loan by barclays will constitute a true sale of such assets nevertheless we cannot assure you that an interested party would not attempt to assert that such transfer was not a sale nor challenge the transaction under uk insolvency rules nor that the transfer could not be affected by an order under the banking act even if a challenge were not successful or if an order under the banking act itself was successfully challenged resolution of such a matter could cause significant delay which may impact on payments under the certificates   s     if barclays were acting through its new york branch and were to become the subject of an insolvency proceeding under the laws of the united kingdom and a proceeding were initiated under chapter  of the bankruptcy code or the new york superintendent of financial services were to take possession of the new york branch it is possible that the new york superintendent of financial services a creditor or trustee in bankruptcy of barclays may argue that the sale of its interest in the mortgage loan by barclays was a pledge of the receivables rather than a sale the new york superintendent of financial services a creditor a bankruptcy trustee or another interested party could still attempt to assert that the transfer of barclays’ interest in the mortgage loan was not a sale if such party’s challenge is successful payments on the certificates would be reduced or delayed even if the challenge is not successful payments on the certificates could be delayed while a court resolves the claim   risks relating to the exchangeable certificates and class ec certificates   the characteristics of the class ec certificates will reflect in the aggregate the characteristics of the exchangeable certificates that make up the components of such class as a result the class ec certificates will be subject to the same risks as each exchangeable certificate described in this free writing prospectus investors are encouraged to also consider a number of factors that will limit a certificateholder’s ability to exchange and convert exchangeable certificates for class ec certificates and vice versa   ·at the time of a proposed exchange and conversion a certificateholder must own exchangeable certificates in the requisite exchange proportion to make the desired exchange and conversion   ·a certificateholder that does not own each class of the exchangeable certificates in the requisite exchange proportion may be unable to obtain the necessary exchangeable certificates because the holders of the needed certificates may be unwilling or unable to sell them or because the necessary certificates have been placed into other financial structures   ·principal distributions will decrease the amounts available for exchange and conversion over time and once any class of exchangeable certificates has been reduced to zero as a result of such class being paid all interest and principal on such class in full or through the allocation of collateral support deficits conversions will no longer be permissible   ·certificates may only be held in authorized denominations   risks relating to prepayments and repurchases   the yield to maturity on your certificates will depend in significant part upon the rate and timing of principal payments on the mortgage loans for this purpose principal payments include both voluntary prepayments if permitted and involuntary prepayments such as prepayments resulting from casualty or condemnation defaults and liquidations or repurchases upon breaches of representations and warranties or document defects   in addition it is important to note that previously issued commercial mortgagebacked securities including potentially certain commercial mortgagebacked securities sponsored by jpmorgan chase bank national association barclays bank plc starwood mortgage funding ii llc mcfive mile commercial mortgage finance llc redwood commercial mortgage corporation rait funding llc or affiliates of any of those parties have recently experienced greater losses than expected and in certain circumstances significantly greater losses as a result of defaults and liquidations of the mortgage loans that comprise those commercial mortgagebacked securities we cannot assure you that the losses actually incurred with respect to the mortgage loans that back the offered certificates will not similarly exceed any assumed or expected losses see “yield and maturity considerations” in this free writing prospectus   the yield on each of the classes of certificates that have a passthrough rate equal to limited by or based on the weighted average mortgage rate could or in the case of any class of certificates with a   s     passthrough rate equal to or based on the weighted average mortgage rate would be adversely affected if mortgage loans with higher interest rates pay faster than the mortgage loans with lower interest rates the passthrough rates on these classes of certificates may also be adversely affected as a result of a decrease in the weighted average of the net mortgage rates on the mortgage loans even if principal prepayments do not occur see “yield and maturity considerations” in this free writing prospectus   the class xa and class xb certificates will not be entitled to distributions of principal but instead will accrue interest on their respective notional amounts because the notional amount of the class xa certificates is based upon the outstanding aggregate certificate balances of the class a class a class a class a class a class asb and class as certificates determined without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of any class as certificates for class ec certificates and the notional amount of the class xb certificates is based upon the outstanding certificate balance of the class b certificates determined without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of any class b certificates for class ec certificates the yield to maturity on the class xa and class xb certificates will be extremely sensitive to the rate and timing of prepayments of principal liquidations and principal losses on the mortgage loans to the extent allocated to the related classes of certificates in particular the class xa certificates and to a lesser extent the class xb certificates will be sensitive to prepayments on the mortgage loans because the prepayments will have the effect of reducing the notional amount of the class xa certificates first a rapid rate of principal prepayments liquidations andor principal losses on the mortgage loans could result in the failure to recoup the initial investment in the class xa certificates and then the class xb certificates investors in the class xa and class xb certificates should fully consider the associated risks including the risk that an extremely rapid rate of amortization prepayment or other liquidation of the mortgage loans could result in the failure of such investors to recoup fully their initial investments   in addition with respect to the class asb certificates the extent to which the planned balances are achieved and the sensitivity of the class asb certificates to principal prepayments on the mortgage loans will depend in part on the period of time during which the class a class a class a class a and class a certificates remain outstanding as such the class asb certificates will become more sensitive to the rate of prepayments on the mortgage loans than they were when the class a class a class a class a and class a certificates were outstanding   the investment performance of your certificates may vary materially and adversely from your expectations if the actual rate of prepayment on the mortgage loans is higher or lower than you anticipate   any changes in the weighted average lives of your certificates may adversely affect your yield prepayments resulting in a shortening of weighted average lives of your certificates may be made at a time of low interest rates when you may be unable to reinvest the resulting payment of principal on your certificates at a rate comparable to the effective yield anticipated by you in making your investment in the certificates while delays and extensions resulting in a lengthening of those weighted average lives may occur at a time of high interest rates when you may have been able to reinvest principal payments that would otherwise have been received by you at higher rates   in addition the extent to which prepayments on the mortgage loans in the trust fund ultimately affect the average life of the offered certificates will depend on the terms of the offered certificates more particularly   ·a class of offered certificates that entitles the holders of those certificates to a disproportionately larger share of the prepayments on the mortgage loans increases the “call risk” or the likelihood of early retirement of that class if the rate of prepayment is relatively fast and   ·a class of offered certificates that entitles the holders of the offered certificates to a disproportionately smaller share of the prepayments on the mortgage loans increases the likelihood of “extension risk” or an extended average life of that class if the rate of prepayment is relatively slow   see “yield and maturity considerations” in this free writing prospectus   s     although the mortgage loans generally have prepayment protection in the form of lockout periods andor one or more of the following a defeasance b yield maintenance or c prepayment premium provisions we cannot assure you that the related borrowers will refrain from prepaying their related mortgage loans due to the existence of yield maintenance charges or prepayment premiums or that involuntary prepayments will not occur   there are nineteen  mortgage loans identified as “hilton suites chicago magnificent mile” “civic opera building” “first national building” “one shell square” “waterstone apartments” “hilton atlanta perimeter” “brunswick portfolio” “new center one

principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cutoff date that permit prepayment together with the payment of a yield maintenance premium generally following the end of a lockout period of at least twentythree  due dates from and including the first payment date   we are not aware of any relevant publicly available or authoritative statistics with respect to the historical prepayment experiences of commercial mortgage loans however the rate at which voluntary prepayments occur on the mortgage loans will be affected by a variety of factors including   ·the terms of the related mortgage loans   ·the length of any prepayment lockout period   ·the level of prevailing interest rates   ·the availability of mortgage credit   ·any applicable yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums   ·the master servicer’s or special servicer’s ability to enforce those yield maintenance charges or prepayment premiums   ·the failure to meet certain requirements for the release of escrows   ·the occurrence of casualties or natural disasters and   ·economic demographic tax legal or other factors   in addition the rate at which voluntary prepayments occur may also be impacted by the existence of any purchase options related to a mortgaged property the exercise of the purchase option could occur during what would otherwise be a lockoutdefeasance period the resulting prepayment is required to be accompanied by a yield maintenance charge see “yield and maturity considerations” in this free writing prospectus further the rate at which voluntary prepayments occur may also be impacted by the ability of borrowers with respect to certain mortgage loans to affect a paydown of amounts owing under the related mortgage loan documents in connection with a release of a particular related mortgaged property or a portion of the related mortgaged property or by the application of earnout reserves to pay down a mortgage loan as a result of the related borrower’s failure to satisfy the conditions for a release of the reserves in any event during periods in which prepayments on the mortgage loan were otherwise prohibited see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgaged property considerations—tenant issues” and “—certain terms and conditions of the mortgage loans—releases of individual mortgaged properties” in this free writing prospectus for additional information relating to prepayment provisions on certain mortgage loans in the trust   we cannot assure you that the obligation to pay any yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium will be enforceable see “—risks relating to prepayments and repurchases” in this free writing prospectus provisions requiring yield maintenance charges or prepayment premiums may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions and under federal bankruptcy law those provisions also may be   s     interpreted as constituting the collection of interest for usury purposes also we cannot assure you that liquidation proceeds will be sufficient to pay an enforceable yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium generally no yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium will be required for prepayments in connection with a casualty or condemnation in addition certain of the mortgage loans permit the related borrower after a partial casualty or partial condemnation or a change in applicable laws that would allow a lender to accelerate the related mortgage loan pursuant to the related mortgage loan documents to prepay the remaining principal balance of the mortgage loan after application of the related insurance proceeds or condemnation award to pay the principal balance of the mortgage loan which may in certain cases not be accompanied by any prepayment consideration provided that the prepayment of the remaining balance is made within a specified period of time following the date of the application of proceeds or award andor no event of default has occurred and is continuing under the mortgage loan see “risk factors—risks relating to enforceability of yield maintenance charges prepayment premiums or defeasance provisions” in the prospectus   additionally although the collateral substitution provisions related to defeasance do not have the same effect on the certificateholders as prepayment we cannot assure you that a court would not interpret those provisions as requiring a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium in certain jurisdictions those collateral substitution provisions might be deemed unenforceable under applicable law or public policy or usurious   certain shortfalls in interest as a result of involuntary prepayments may reduce the available distribution amount in addition if a mortgage loan seller repurchases any mortgage loan from the trust due to breaches of representations or warranties or document defects the repurchase price paid with respect to such mortgage loan will be passed through to the holders of the offered certificates with the same effect as if the mortgage loan had been prepaid in part or in full and no yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium will be payable mezzanine lenders may have the option to purchase the related mortgage loan after certain defaults and the purchase price may not include any yield maintenance payments or prepayment charges in addition certain of the mortgage loans are secured by mortgaged properties that have franchisors tenants or other parties that have an option to purchase the mortgaged property see “—certain additional risks relating to tenants” above a repurchase or the exercise of such a purchase option may adversely affect the yield to maturity on the offered certificates   certain of the mortgage loans are secured in part by letters of credit andor cash reserves that in each such case                     i   will be released to the related borrower in whole or in part upon satisfaction by that borrower of certain performance related conditions which may include in some cases meeting debt service coverage ratio levels andor satisfying leasing conditions and                    ii   if not so released may at the discretion of the lender prior to loan maturity or earlier loan default or loan acceleration be drawn on andor applied to prepay or defease the related mortgage loan if such performance related conditions are not satisfied within specified time periods   in addition with respect to certain of the mortgage loans if the borrower does not satisfy the performance conditions and does not qualify for the release of the related cash reserve the reserve less in some cases a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium which in some cases may be paid out of the related additional collateral may be applied to reduce the principal balance of the mortgage loan and the remaining unpaid balance of the mortgage loan may be reamortized over the remaining amortization term if such amount is used to prepay or defease the mortgage loan as described in paragraph ii above there is no obligation on the part of the related borrower to replenish such cash reserves   optional early termination of the trust fund may result in an adverse impact on your yield or may result in a loss   the certificates will be subject to optional early termination by means of the purchase of the mortgage loans and any reo properties in the trust fund we cannot assure you that the proceeds from a sale of   s     the mortgage loans andor reo properties will be sufficient to distribute the outstanding certificate balance plus accrued interest and any undistributed shortfalls in interest accrued on the certificates that are subject to the termination accordingly the holders of offered certificates affected by such a termination may suffer an adverse impact on the overall yield on their certificates may experience repayment of their investment at an unpredictable and inopportune time or may even incur a loss on their investment see “description of the certificates—termination retirement of certificates” in this free writing prospectus   the mortgage loan sellers may not be able to make a required repurchase or substitution of a defective mortgage loan   the related mortgage loan seller is the sole warranting party in respect of the mortgage loans sold by it to us however starwood mortgage capital llc redwood trust inc and

in this free writing prospectus   realization on certain mortgage loans may be adversely affected by the rights of the holder of the related mezzanine lender   mezzanine lenders commonly hold a defaulted mortgage loan purchase option pursuant to the related intercreditor agreement which generally permits the mezzanine lender to purchase its related defaulted mortgage loan for a purchase price generally equal to the outstanding principal balance of the related defaulted mortgage loan together with accrued and unpaid interest exclusive of default interest on and unpaid servicing expenses and fees protective advances and interest on advances related to such defaulted mortgage loan however in the event that such party is not obligated to pay some or all of those fees and additional expenses including any liquidation fee payable to the special servicer under the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement then the exercise of such party’s rights under the intercreditor agreement to purchase the related mortgage loan from the trust may result in a loss to the trust in the amount of those fees and additional expenses furthermore a mezzanine lender generally has the right to cure defaults under the related defaulted mortgage loan thereby delaying the mortgagee’s ability to realize on or otherwise take action with respect to such defaulted mortgage loan   limited obligations   the certificates when issued will represent beneficial interests in the trust fund the certificates will not represent an interest in or obligation of the

writing prospectus payments on the offered certificates are expected to be derived from payments made by the borrowers on or in respect of the mortgage loans we cannot assure you that the cash flow from the mortgaged properties and the proceeds of any sale or refinancing of the mortgaged properties will be sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the mortgage loans or to distribute in full the amounts of interest and principal to which the holders of the offered certificates are entitled see “description of the certificates—general” in this free writing prospectus   changes to accounting standards and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse impact on the certificates   none of the issuing entity the depositor the sponsors or the underwriters make any representation or warranty regarding any accounting implications related to the offered certificates the financial accounting standards board has adopted changes to the accounting standards for structured products these changes or any other future changes may impact the accounting for entities such as the trust and could require the trust to be consolidated in an investor’s financial statements each investor in the offered certificates should consult its accounting advisor to determine the impact these accounting changes might have as a result of an investment in the offered certificates   tax consequences related to foreclosure   if the trust were to acquire a mortgaged property subsequent to a default on the related mortgage loan pursuant to a foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure the special servicer would be required to retain an independent contractor to operate and manage such mortgaged property among other things the independent contractor would not be able to perform construction work other than repair maintenance or certain types of tenant buildouts unless such construction was more than  completed when the default on the related mortgage loan became imminent any i net income from such operation and management other than qualifying “rents from real property” ii rental income based on the net profits of a tenant or subtenant or allocable to a service that is noncustomary in the area and for the type of property involved and iii rental income attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property if the rent attributable to that personal property exceeds  of the total rent at the related mortgaged property for the taxable year will subject the related remic to federal and possibly state or local tax on such income at the highest marginal corporate tax rate currently  thereby reducing net proceeds available for distribution to certificateholders no determination has been made whether any portion of the income from the mortgaged property constitutes “rents from real property” the pooling and servicing agreement provides that the special servicer will be permitted to cause the remics to earn “net income from foreclosure property” that is subject to tax if it determines that the net aftertax benefit to certificateholders is greater than another method of operating eg net leasing the mortgaged property see “material federal income tax consequences” in this free writing prospectus in addition if the trust were to acquire any mortgaged property pursuant to a foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure upon acquisition of those mortgaged properties the trust may in certain jurisdictions particularly in new york be required to pay state or local transfer or excise taxes upon liquidation of such properties such state or local taxes may reduce net proceeds available for distribution to the certificateholders   state and local tax considerations   in addition to the federal income tax consequences described under the heading “material federal income tax consequences” in this free writing prospectus potential purchasers should consider the state and local income tax consequences of the acquisition ownership and disposition of the certificates state and local income tax laws may differ substantially from the corresponding federal tax laws and this free writing prospectus does not purport to describe any aspects of the income tax laws of the states or localities in which the mortgaged properties are located or of any other applicable state or locality   s     it is possible that one or more jurisdictions may attempt to tax nonresident holders of certificates solely by reason of the location in that jurisdiction of the depositor the certificate administrator the trustee the related borrower or the mortgaged properties or on some other basis may require nonresident holders of certificates to file returns in such jurisdiction or may attempt to impose penalties for failure to file such returns and it is possible that any such jurisdiction will ultimately succeed in collecting such taxes or penalties from nonresident holders of certificates we cannot assure you that holders of certificates will not be subject to tax in any particular state or local taxing jurisdiction   if any tax or penalty is successfully asserted by any state or local taxing jurisdiction none of the depositor the related borrower the certificate administrator the trustee the master servicer or the special servicer will be obligated to indemnify or otherwise to reimburse the holders of certificates therefor   potential purchasers should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the various state and local tax consequences of an investment in the certificates   ratings of the certificates   the ratings assigned to the offered certificates by moody’s investors service inc fitch ratings inc dbrs inc and kroll bond rating agency inc are based among other things on the economic characteristics of the mortgaged properties and other relevant structural features of the transaction a security rating does not represent any assessment of the yield to maturity that a certificateholder may experience the ratings assigned to the offered certificates reflect only the views of the respective rating agencies as of the date such ratings were issued future events could have an adverse impact on such ratings the ratings may be reviewed revised suspended downgraded qualified or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agency as a result of changes in or unavailability of information the ratings do not consider to what extent the offered certificates will be subject to prepayment or that the outstanding principal amount of any class of the offered certificates will be prepaid   furthermore the amount type and nature of credit support if any provided with respect to the offered certificates are determined on the basis of criteria established by each rating agency these criteria are sometimes based upon analysis of the behavior of mortgage loans in a larger group however we cannot assure you that the historical data supporting that analysis will accurately reflect future experience or that the data derived from a large pool of mortgage loans will accurately predict the delinquency foreclosure or loss experience of the mortgage loans in the trust as evidenced by the significant amount of downgrades qualifications and withdrawals of ratings assigned to previously issued commercial mortgagebacked securities during the recent credit crisis by the hired rating agencies and other nationally recognized statistical rating organizations the assumptions by the rating agencies engaged by the depositor and other nationally recognized statistical rating organizations regarding the performance of the mortgage loans related to such commercial mortgagebacked securities were not in all cases correct   we are not obligated to maintain any particular rating with respect to any class of the offered certificates and the ratings initially assigned to the offered certificates by any or all of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor to rate the offered certificates could change adversely as a result of changes affecting among other things the underlying mortgage loans the mortgaged properties the sponsors the certificate administrator the trustee the senior trust advisor the master servicer or the special servicer or as a result of changes to ratings criteria employed by any or all of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor to rate the offered certificates although these changes would not necessarily be or result from an event of default on any underlying mortgage loan any adverse change to the ratings of the offered certificates would likely have an adverse effect on the market value liquidity andor regulatory characteristics of those certificates changes affecting the mortgaged properties the trustee the certificate administrator the master servicer the special servicer or another person may have an adverse effect on the ratings of the offered certificates and thus on the liquidity market value and regulatory characteristics of the offered certificates although such adverse changes would not necessarily be an event of default under any related mortgage loan see “ratings” in this free writing prospectus   s     further a rating of any class of offered certificates below an investment grade rating by any of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor or another nationally recognized statistical rating organization whether initially or as a result of a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the ability of a benefit plan or other investor to purchase or retain that class see “certain erisa considerations” and “legal investment” in this free writing prospectus   although the depositor will prepay fees for ongoing rating surveillance by certain of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor the depositor has no obligation or ability to ensure that any rating agency performs ratings surveillance in addition a rating agency may cease ratings surveillance if the information furnished to that rating agency is insufficient to allow it to perform surveillance   the depositor has requested a rating on the offered certificates from moody’s investors service inc fitch ratings inc dbrs inc and kroll bond rating agency inc we cannot assure you as to whether such rating agencies will rate each class of offered certificates or if they were to rate only certain class of offered certificates what rating would be assigned to the other classes of offered certificates additionally we cannot assure you as to whether another nationally recognized statistical rating organization will rate any class of the offered certificates or if it were to rate any class of offered certificates what rating would be assigned by it additionally other nationally recognized statistical rating organizations that we have not engaged to rate the offered certificates may nevertheless issue unsolicited credit ratings on one or more classes of the offered certificates and any of moody’s investors service inc fitch ratings inc dbrs inc and kroll bond rating agency inc may issue unsolicited credit ratings on one or more classes of offered certificates that it ultimately did not rate relying on information they receive pursuant to rule g under the securities exchange act of  as amended or otherwise if any such unsolicited ratings are issued we cannot assure you that they will not be different from the ratings assigned by the rating agencies engaged by the depositor the issuance of an unsolicited rating of a class of the offered certificates that is lower than the ratings assigned by the rating agencies engaged by the depositor may adversely impact the liquidity market value and regulatory characteristics of that class as part of the process of obtaining ratings for the offered certificates the depositor had initial discussions with and submitted certain materials to dbrs inc fitch ratings inc kroll bond rating agency inc moody’s investors service inc and morningstar credit ratings llc based on preliminary feedback from those nationally recognized statistical rating organizations at that time the depositor selected four of them to rate the offered certificates although moody’s investors service inc fitch ratings inc dbrs inc and kroll bond rating agency inc may not ultimately issue ratings on all the offered certificates and did not select the other nationally recognized statistical rating organization due in part to their initial subordination levels for the various classes of the offered certificates had the depositor selected the other nationally recognized statistical rating organization to rate the offered certificates we cannot assure you as to the ratings that it would ultimately have assigned to the offered certificates in addition had the depositor engaged each of moody’s investors service inc fitch ratings inc dbrs inc and kroll bond rating agency inc to rate all classes of the offered certificates the ratings of those classes of the offered certificates that were not ultimately rated by one or more of those rating agencies may have been different and potentially lower than the ratings ultimately assigned to the offered certificates in the case of moody’s investors service inc and fitch ratings inc the depositor only requested ratings for certain classes of rated certificates due in part to the final subordination levels provided by moody’s investors service inc or fitch ratings inc as applicable for such classes of certificates if the depositor had selected either moody’s investors service inc or fitch ratings inc to rate those other classes of rated certificates not rated by it its ratings of those other certificates may have been different and potentially lower than those ratings ultimately assigned to those certificates by dbrs inc and kroll bond rating agency inc although unsolicited ratings may be issued by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization a nationally recognized statistical rating organization might be more likely to issue an unsolicited rating if it was not selected after having provided preliminary feedback to the depositor the decision not to engage moody’s investors service inc and fitch ratings inc in the rating of certain classes of offered certificates to be issued in connection with this transaction may negatively impact the liquidity market value and regulatory characteristics of those classes of certificates in addition neither the depositor nor any other person or entity will have any duty to notify you if any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization issues or delivers notice of its intention to issue unsolicited ratings on one or more classes of the offered certificates after the date of   s     this free writing prospectus in no event will rating agency confirmations from any such other nationally recognized statistical rating organization except insofar as the matter involves a mortgage loan with a split loan structure and such other rating organization is hired to rate securities backed by the related companion loan be a condition to any action or the exercise of any right power or privilege by any person or entity under the pooling and servicing agreement   certain actions provided for in the mortgage loan agreements require as a condition to taking such action that a rating agency confirmation be obtained from each of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor in certain circumstances this condition may be deemed to have been met or waived without any such rating agency confirmation being obtained in the event such an action is taken without a rating agency confirmation being obtained we cannot assure you that the applicable rating agency will not downgrade qualify or withdraw its ratings on the certificates as a result of the taking of such action if you invest in the certificates the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement will be binding on you and as a result you should be aware of the procedures relating to no downgrade confirmations described under the definition of “rating agency confirmation” in “servicing of the mortgage loans—rating agency confirmations” in this free writing prospectus   furthermore the united states securities and exchange commission may determine that any or all of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor to rate the offered certificates no longer qualifies as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or is no longer qualified to rate the offered certificates and that determination may have an adverse effect on the liquidity market value and regulatory characteristics of the offered certificates see “ratings” in this free writing prospectus   s     description of the mortgage pool

the casualty or condemnation is sufficiently material andor if the insurance proceeds or condemnation award is not released for restoration some mortgage loans permit the related borrower to prepay the related mortgage loan in full or up to a specified percentage of the allocated loan amount of the affected property to obtain the release thereof   with respect to one  mortgage loan secured by the mortgaged properties identified as “uhaul portfolio” on annex a to this free writing prospectus representing approximately  of the initial pool balance the mortgage loan fully amortizes during the defeasance period and there is no open period   s     includes fiftyeight  mortgaged properties securing one  mortgage loan identified as “brunswick portfolio” on annex a to this free writing

payment of a yield maintenance premium in connection with the termination of the master lease as to any mortgaged property which the tenants under the master lease deem uneconomical or unsuitable for further use in the tenants’ business see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgaged property considerations—purchase options rights of first refusal and rights of first offer” and “—certain terms and conditions of the mortgage loans—releases of individual mortgaged properties” in this free writing prospectus   with respect to certain mortgage loans that permit prepayment subject to yield maintenance the “yield maintenance charge” will generally subject to variations be equal to the greater of i a specified percentage of the amount being prepaid and ii the present value as of the prepayment date of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest including any balloon payment from the prepayment date through the date specified in the related mortgage loan documents which will generally be the maturity date the anticipated repayment date or the first date on which the borrower can prepay without a yield maintenance charge determined by discounting such payments at a discount rate less the amount of principal being prepaid see annex a to this free writing prospectus for the specific prepayment restrictions for each mortgage loan   the term “discount rate” as used in the preceding paragraph will be as set forth in the related loan documents but will generally mean the yield on a us treasury security that has the most closely corresponding maturity date to the maturity date open prepayment date andor anticipated repayment date or the remaining weighted average life of the related mortgage loan plus in certain circumstances an additional specified percentage and converted to a monthly equivalent yield as described in the respective loan documents   with respect to certain other mortgage loans that permit prepayment subject to yield maintenance the “yield maintenance charge” will generally subject to certain variations be an amount in some cases not less than  of the amount prepaid equal to the present value of a series of payments each equal to the interest payment differential and payable on each scheduled due date over the remaining original term of the prepaid yield maintenance mortgage loan and with respect to the principal balance of the note due to be outstanding on such date the stated maturity date the anticipated repayment date or the date preceding the commencement of the open prepayment period as applicable discounted at the reinvestment yield as of the date of prepayment for the number of months remaining from such date of prepayment to each scheduled due date through and including the stated maturity date the anticipated repayment date or the date preceding the commencement of the open prepayment period as applicable   the term “interest payment differential” with respect to any related prepaid yield maintenance mortgage loan will generally equal i the mortgage rate minus the reinvestment yield divided by ii  and multiplied by iii the outstanding principal balance of the prepaid yield maintenance mortgage loan on the date of prepayment if the prepayment date is a scheduled due date after the application of the monthly payment amount due provided that the interest payment differential will never be less than zero   the term “reinvestment yield” means with respect to any related prepaid yield maintenance mortgage loan will generally equal depending on the mortgage loan either a the yield calculated by the related lender by the linear interpolation of the yields “as reported in the federal reserve statistical release hselected interest rates under the heading us government securitiestreasury constant maturities” for the week ending prior to the date of prepayment of us treasury constant maturities with maturity dates one longer or one shorter most nearly approximating the loan maturity date or the anticipated repayment date or the date preceding the commencement of the open prepayment period as applicable and as used in the second preceding paragraph converted to a monthly compounded nominal yield or b the lesser of i the yield on the us obligations with the same maturity date as the stated maturity date the anticipated repayment date or date

two us obligations issues primary issues with maturity dates one prior to and one following that are closest to the stated maturity date the anticipated repayment date or the date preceding the commencement of the open prepayment period   s     as applicable of the prepaid yield maintenance mortgage loan or ii the yield on the us obligations with a term equal to the remaining average life of the prepaid yield maintenance mortgage loan or if no such us obligations are available then the interpolated yield on the two us obligations issues primary issues with terms one prior to and one following that are closest to the remaining average life of the prepaid yield maintenance mortgage loan with each such yield being based on the bid price for such issue as published in the wall street journal on the date that is  days prior to the date of prepayment set forth in the related borrower’s notice of repayment or if such bid price is not published on that date the next preceding date on which such bid price is so published and converted to a monthly compounded nominal yield   the term “us obligations” means in general securities evidencing an obligation to timely pay principal andor interest in a full and timely manner that are  direct obligations of the united states of america for the payment of which its full faith and credit is pledged not subject to prepayment call or early redemption  certain other noncallable “government securities” as defined in treasury regulations section ga as amended or  such other instruments if any as set forth in the related mortgage loan documents   yield maintenance charges and any prepayment premiums are distributable as described in this free writing prospectus under “description of the certificates—allocation of yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums”   the mortgage loans generally permit voluntary prepayment without the payment of a yield maintenance charge or any prepayment premium during an “open period”

anticipated repayment date or unless the sale price or the amount of the refinancing of the related mortgaged property is considerably higher than the current outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan due to an increase in the value of the mortgaged property or otherwise and depending on the interest rate environment at the time of prepayment the yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium may offset entirely or render insignificant any economic benefit to be received by a related borrower upon a refinancing or sale of its mortgaged property the yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium provision of a mortgage loan creates an economic disincentive for the borrower to prepay its mortgage loan voluntarily and accordingly the related borrower may elect not to prepay its mortgage loan however we cannot assure you that the imposition of a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium will provide a sufficient disincentive to prevent a voluntary principal prepayment or sufficient compensation to certificateholders affected by a prepayment to offset the effects of such prepayment on the yield to certificateholders   certain state laws limit the amounts that a lender may collect from a borrower as an additional charge in connection with the prepayment of a mortgage loan certain mortgage loans may require the payment of yield maintenance charges or prepayment premiums in connection with a prepayment of the related mortgage loan as a result of a casualty or condemnation certain other of the mortgage loans do not require the payment of yield maintenance charges or prepayment premiums in connection with a prepayment of the related mortgage loan with insurance and condemnation proceeds as a result of a   s     casualty or condemnation provided that no event of default exists in addition certain of the mortgage loans permit the related borrower after a partial casualty or partial condemnation to prepay the remaining principal balance of the mortgage loan after application of the related insurance and condemnation proceeds to pay the principal balance of the mortgage loan which may in certain cases not be accompanied by any prepayment consideration provided that i the prepayment of the remaining balance is made within a specified period of time following the date of the application of proceeds or award andor ii no event of default exists furthermore the enforceability under the laws of a number of states of provisions providing for payments comparable to yield maintenance charges or prepayment premiums upon an involuntary prepayment is unclear we cannot assure you that at the time a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium is required to be made on a mortgage loan in connection with an involuntary prepayment the obligation to pay the yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium will be enforceable under applicable state law see “certain legal aspects of the mortgage loans” in this free writing prospectus and “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—default interest and limitations on prepayments” in the prospectus   certain of the mortgage loans may provide for a recast of the amortization schedule and an adjustment of the scheduled debt service payments on the related mortgage loan upon application of specified amounts of insurance and condemnation proceeds upon the release of individual properties securing certain mortgage loans or upon application of certain holdbacks if such holdbacks are not used for their specified purpose to pay the related unpaid principal balance such application of a holdback may or may not require a payment of a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium based upon the amount of the principal being paid   ard loans   one  mortgage loan identified as “eastmont town center” on annex a to this free writing prospectus the “ard loan” representing approximately  of the initial pool balance provides that if after a certain date the “anticipated repayment date” the borrower has not prepaid the applicable ard loan in full any principal outstanding on that date will accrue interest at an increased interest rate the “revised rate” rather than the applicable stated mortgage rate the “initial rate” see annex a in this free writing prospectus for the anticipated repayment date and revised rate for the ard loan after the anticipated repayment date the ard loan further requires that all cash flow available from the mortgaged property after payment of the periodic payments required under the terms of the mortgage loan documents and all escrows and property expenses required under the mortgage loan documents be used to accelerate amortization of principal without payment of any yield maintenance premium or prepayment charge on the ard loan while interest at the initial rate continues to accrue and be payable on a current basis on an ard loan after its anticipated repayment date the payment of excess interest to the extent actually collected will be deferred and will be required to be paid with interest to the extent permitted under applicable law and the mortgage loan documents only after the outstanding principal balance of the ard loan has been paid in full at which time the excess interest will be paid to the holders of the class z certificates   additionally an account has been established for the ard loan into which the tenants are required to directly deposit rents or other revenues from the related mortgaged property the foregoing feature is designed to increase the likelihood that the ard loan will be prepaid by the borrower on or about its anticipated repayment date however we cannot assure you that any ard loan will be prepaid on its anticipated repayment date

factors—additional debt or the ability to incur other borrowings entails risk” and “certain legal aspects of the mortgage loans” in this free writing prospectus   hazard liability and other insurance   the mortgage loans generally require that each mortgaged property be insured by a hazard insurance policy in an amount subject to an approved deductible which may be a large amount in the case of certain mortgage loans at least equal to the lesser of a the outstanding principal balance of the related mortgage loan and b  of the replacement cost of the improvements located on the related mortgaged property and if applicable that the related hazard insurance policy contain appropriate endorsements or have been issued in an amount sufficient to avoid the application of coinsurance and not permit reduction in insurance proceeds for depreciation provided that in the case of certain of the mortgage loans the hazard insurance may be in such other amounts as was required by the applicable mortgage loan seller and in some cases may be significantly less than the outstanding principal amount of the mortgage loan moreover with respect to certain of the mortgage loans insured for less than the full principal balance applicable zoning ordinances may prevent restoration of the use or prevent or limit rebuilding of the related mortgaged properties to their current condition under certain circumstances certain mortgage loans permit a borrower to satisfy its insurance coverage requirement by permitting its tenant to selfinsure or permitting its tenant or a condominium association or a hotel franchiser to provide insurance for its premises in some cases even where a tenant selfinsures a lease may be terminated based on a material casualty or condemnation particularly near the end of the lease term in some cases required insurance is provided under a blanket policy that also insures properties that do not secure mortgage loans included in this securitization see “risk factors—risks associated with blanket insurance policies or selfinsurance” in this free writing prospectus   s     in general the standard form of hazard insurance policy covers physical damage to or destruction of the improvements on the mortgaged property by fire lightning explosion smoke windstorm and hail riot or strike and civil commotion subject to the deductibles conditions and exclusions set forth in each policy each mortgage loan generally also requires the related borrower to maintain general liability insurance against claims for personal and bodily injury death or property damage occurring on in or about the related mortgaged property in an amount generally equal to at least  per occurrence although the policies covering the mortgaged properties will be underwritten by different insurers under different state laws in accordance with different applicable state forms and therefore will not contain identical terms and conditions most policies typically do not cover any physical damage resulting from war revolution governmental actions floods and other waterrelated causes earth movement including earthquakes landslides and mudflows wet or dry rot vermin domestic animals and certain other kinds of risks accordingly a mortgaged property may not be insured for losses arising from such causes unless the related mortgage specifically requires or permits the mortgagee to require that coverage each mortgage loan generally further requires the related borrower to maintain business interruption insurance in an amount not less than approximately  of the gross rental income from the related mortgaged property for not less than  months in addition some mortgage loans permit the related borrower to satisfy its obligations to insure the related mortgaged property by relying on a tenant or condominium association to obtain the insurance or permit a tenant to selfinsure see representation numbers  and  on annex d to this free

mortgage loan seller in accordance with its underwriting guidelines for similar properties operating revenues from a mortgaged property “effective gross income” are generally calculated as follows rental revenue is calculated using actual rental rates or in some cases estimates in the appraisal which are usually derived from historical results but which may include anticipated revenues from newly executed contracts in some cases adjusted downward to market rates or upward to account for contractual rent increases that are specified in a tenant’s lease or contract as deemed appropriate by the applicable mortgage loan seller in light of the circumstances with vacancy rates equal to the related mortgaged property’s historical rate the market rate or an assumed vacancy rate or that are effective in a lease renewal option period that a tenant has orally indicated its intent to exercise as deemed appropriate by the applicable mortgage loan seller in light of the circumstances other revenue such as parking fees laundry fees and other income items are included only if supported by a trend andor are likely to be recurring in some cases the related mortgage loan seller included in the operating revenues rents otherwise payable by a tenant in occupancy of its space but for the existence of an initial or periodic “free rent” period reduced rent period or a permitted rent   s     abatement or rents payable by a tenant that is not in occupancy but has executed a lease for which in any of the foregoing cases the related mortgage loan seller may have reserved funds as deemed appropriate by the applicable mortgage loan seller in light of the circumstances operating expenses generally reflect the related mortgaged property’s historical expenses adjusted in some cases to account for inflation significant occupancy increases and a market rate management fee however some operating expenses are based on the budget of the borrower or the appraiser’s estimate   the underwritten noi for each mortgaged property is calculated on the basis of numerous assumptions and subjective judgments which if ultimately proven erroneous could cause the actual operating income for such mortgaged property to differ materially from the underwritten noi set forth in this free writing prospectus some assumptions and subjective judgments are related to future events conditions and circumstances including future expense levels and the releasing of occupied space which will be affected by a variety of complex factors over which none of the trust the depositor the sponsors the mortgage loan sellers the master servicer the special servicer the certificate administrator or the trustee has control in some cases the underwritten noi for any mortgaged property is higher and may be materially higher than the actual annual net operating income for that mortgaged property based on historical operating statements no guaranty can be given with respect to the accuracy of the information provided by any borrowers or the adequacy of the procedures used by a mortgage loan seller in determining the relevant operating information see “risk factors—risks relating to

related mortgaged properties or tenants which in the aggregate constitute a significant portion of the mortgaged property have executed leases but are not currently fully occupying the related space

secured by newly constructed or recently acquired mortgaged properties the uw ncfs used as a basis for calculating uw ncf dscrs are derived principally from rent rolls tenant leases and the borrowers’ appraisers’ projected expense levels in certain cases when the information is available uw ncfs for newly constructed or recently acquired mortgaged properties are based on historical data provided by the borrower the operating statements and rent rolls were not audited and in most cases were not prepared in accordance with   s     generally accepted accounting principles to increase the level of consistency between the operating statements and rent rolls in some instances adjustments were made to such operating statements as regards expenses these adjustments were principally for real estate tax and insurance expenses eg adjusting for the payment of two years of expenses in one year and to eliminate obvious items not related to the operation of the mortgaged property however such adjustments were subjective in nature and may not have been made in a uniform manner   the tables presented in annex a that are entitled “cutoff date ltv ratios” and “maturity date ltv ratios” set forth the range of ltv ratios of the mortgage loans as of the cutoff date and the stated maturity dates or if applicable the anticipated repayment date respectively of the related mortgage loans

condition—appraisals” in this free writing prospectus as determined by an appraisal of the mortgaged property obtained at or about the time of the origination of the related mortgage loan in the event that a mortgage loan is crosscollateralized with other mortgage loans the ltv ratio is the fraction expressed as a percentage the numerator of which is the scheduled principal balance of all the mortgage loans in the crosscollateralized group and the denominator of which is the aggregate of the appraised values of all the mortgaged properties related to the crosscollateralized group the ltv ratio as of the related maturity date or if applicable the anticipated repayment date set forth in annex a was calculated based on the principal balance of the related mortgage loan on the related maturity date or anticipated repayment date as the case may be assuming all principal payments required to be made on or prior to the related maturity date or if applicable the anticipated repayment date in either case not including the balloon payment are made in addition because it is based on the value of a mortgaged property determined as of loan origination the information set forth in this

stanley bank na jpmcb is selling note ab to the depositor for inclusion in the issuing entity   jpmcb’s underwriting guidelines and processes   jpmcb has developed guidelines establishing certain procedures with respect to underwriting the mortgage loans originated or purchased by it all of the mortgage loans sold to the trust by jpmcb were generally underwritten in accordance with the guidelines below in some instances one or more provisions of the guidelines were waived or modified by jpmcb at origination where it was determined not to adversely affect the related mortgage loan originated by it in any material respect the mortgage loans to be included in the trust were originated or acquired by jpmcb generally in accordance with the commercial mortgagebacked securitization program of jpmcb for a description of any material exceptions to the underwriting guidelines in this free writing prospectus see “—exceptions to jpmcb’s disclosed underwriting guidelines” below   notwithstanding the discussion below given the differences between individual commercial mortgaged properties the underwriting and origination procedures and the credit analysis with respect to any particular commercial mortgage loan may significantly differ from one asset to another and will be driven by circumstances particular to that property including among others its type current and alternative uses size location market conditions reserve requirements and additional collateral tenants and leases borrower identity sponsorship performance history andor other factors however except as described in the exceptions to the underwriting guidelines see “—exceptions to jpmcb’s disclosed underwriting guidelines” the underwriting of the jpmcb mortgage loans will conform to the general guidelines described below   property analysis jpmcb performs or causes to be performed a site inspection to evaluate the location and quality of the related mortgaged properties such inspection generally includes an evaluation of functionality design attractiveness visibility and accessibility as well as location to major thoroughfares transportation centers employment sources retail areas and educational or recreational facilities jpmcb assesses the submarket in which the property is located to evaluate competitive or comparable properties as well as market trends in addition jpmcb evaluates the property’s age physical condition operating history lease and tenant mix and management   cash flow analysis jpmcb reviews among other things historical operating statements rent rolls tenant leases andor budgeted income and expense statements provided by the borrower and makes adjustments in order to determine a debt service coverage ratio including taking into account the benefits of any governmental assistance programs see “description of the mortgage pool—additional mortgage loan information” in this free writing prospectus   debt service coverage ratio and loantovalue ratio the underwriting includes a calculation of the debt service coverage ratio and the loantovalue ratio in connection with the origination of each loan   the debt service coverage ratio will generally be calculated based on the ratio of the underwritten net cash flow from the property in question as determined by jpmcb and payments on the loan based on actual principal andor interest due on the loan however underwritten net cash flow is often a highly subjective number based on a variety of assumptions regarding and adjustments to revenues and expenses with respect to the related real property collateral for example when calculating the debt service coverage ratio for a multifamily or commercial mortgage loan annual net cash flow that was calculated based on assumptions regarding projected

the mortgage loans originated by mcfive mile for securitization   notwithstanding the discussion below given the unique nature of commercial or multifamily mortgaged properties the underwriting and origination procedures and the credit analysis with respect to any particular commercial or multifamily mortgage loan may significantly differ from one asset to another and will be driven by circumstances particular to that property including among others the property type current and alternative uses size location market conditions reserve requirements additional collateral tenant quality and lease terms borrower identity sponsorship performance history andor other factors therefore this general description of mcfive mile’s origination procedures and underwriting criteria is not intended as a representation that every commercial mortgage loan originated by it complies entirely with all procedures and criteria set forth below for important information about the circumstances that have affected the underwriting of particular mcfive mile mortgage loans see the “risk factors” section of this free writing prospectus the other subsections of this “transaction parties—the sponsors and mortgage loan sellers” section and “annex d—exceptions to mortgage loan representations and warranties” in this free writing prospectus   if a mortgage loan exhibits any one or more of the following characteristics variances from general underwritingorigination procedures described below may be considered acceptable under the circumstances indicated i low loantovalue ratio ii high debt service coverage ratio iii experienced property sponsorsguarantors with financial wherewithal iv additional springing reserves v cash flow sweeps and vi elements of recourse included in the mortgage loan   loan analysis generally both a credit analysis and a collateral analysis are conducted with respect to each mortgage loan the credit analysis of the borrower generally includes a review of third party credit reports andor judgment lien bankruptcy and pending litigation searches prior experience as an owner and operator of commercial real estate properties and the borrower’s financial capacity the collateral analysis generally includes a review of in each case to the extent available and applicable the historical property operating statements rent rolls and certain significant tenant leases the credit underwriting also generally includes a review of third party appraisals as well as environmental reports engineering assessments and if applicable zoning reports and seismic reports generally a member of the loan underwriting team also conducts or causes a third party to conduct a site inspection to ascertain the overall quality functionality and competitiveness of the property including its neighborhood and market accessibility and visibility and to assess the tenancy of the property unless otherwise specified in this free writing prospectus all financial occupancy and other information contained in this free writing prospectus is based on such information and we cannot assure you that such financial occupancy and other information remains accurate   loan approval all mortgage loans originated by mcfive mile require approval by an investment committee which includes senior executives of five mile capital partners llc and mc asset management holdings llc the committee may approve a mortgage loan as recommended request additional due diligence prior to approval approve it subject to modifications of the loan terms or decline the proposed loan   debt service coverage ratio and loantovalue ratio the underwriting includes a calculation of debt service coverage ratio and loantovalue ratio in connection with the origination of each loan mcfive mile’s underwriting guidelines generally require without regard to any other debt a debt service coverage ratio calculated for this purpose using a year amortization schedule of not less than x or x for multifamily properties and a loantovalue ratio of not more than  mcfive mile may   s     originate a mortgage loan with a debt service coverage ratio below x based on among other things the amortization features of the mortgage loan the type of tenants and leases at the property the taking of additional collateral such as reserves letters of credit andor guarantees mcfive mile’s judgment of improved property andor market performance andor other relevant factors   the debt service coverage ratio will generally be calculated based on the ratio of the underwritten net cash flow from the property in question as determined by mcfive mile and payments on the loan based on actual or in some cases assumed principal andor interest due on the loan however underwritten net cash flow is often a highly subjective number based on a variety of assumptions regarding and adjustments to revenues and expenses with respect to the related real property collateral for example when calculating the debt service coverage ratio for a multifamily or commercial mortgage loan annual net cash flow that was calculated based on assumptions regarding projected future rental income expenses andor occupancy may be utilized we cannot assure you that the foregoing assumptions made with respect to any prospective multifamily or commercial mortgage loan will in fact be consistent with actual property performance as described above for the purpose of determining whether a mortgage loan’s debt service coverage ratio meets mcfive mile’s underwriting criteria the debt service coverage ratio is calculated based on a debt service payment using a year amortization term however if a loan’s debt service coverage ratio is less than x because its debt service payment is calculated on an amortization schedule less than  years but its debt service coverage ratio calculated using a year amortization term is equal to or greater than x that loan meets mcfive mile’s underwriting criteria for debt service coverage ratio the loantovalue ratio in general is the ratio expressed as a percentage of the thenoutstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan divided by the estimated value of the related property based on an appraisal   additional debt certain mortgage loans may have or permit in the future certain additional subordinate debt whether secured or unsecured andor mezzanine it is possible that an affiliate of mcfive mile may be the lender on that additional debt   the debt service coverage ratios described above will be lower based on the inclusion of the payments related to such additional debt and the loantovalue ratios described above will be higher based on the inclusion of the amount of any such additional subordinate debt andor mezzanine debt   mortgage loan terms mcfive mile’s underwriting guidelines generally require that the term of a mortgage loan be not less than five years and not more than ten years   assessments of property condition as part of the underwriting process the property assessments and reports described below will typically be obtained   ·appraisals independent appraisals or an update of an independent appraisal will generally be required in connection with the origination of each mortgage loan each appraisal must meet the requirements of the “uniform standards of professional appraisal practice” as adopted by the appraisal standards board of the appraisal foundation or the guidelines in title xi of the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  the appraisal is based on the current use of the mortgaged property and must include an estimate of the thencurrent market value of the property “asis” in its thencurrent condition although in certain cases mcfive mile may also obtain a value on an “asstabilized” basis reflecting leases that have been executed but tenants have not commenced paying rent or on an “ascompleted” basis reflecting completion of capital improvements that are being undertaken at the mortgaged property in some cases however the value of the subject real property collateral may be established based on a cash flow analysis a recent sales price or another method or benchmark of valuation mcfive mile then determines the loantovalue ratio of the mortgage loan in each case based on the value set forth in the appraisal   ·environmental assessment phase i esa that confirm with american society for testing and materials astm standard e   entitled “standard practices for environmental site assessment phase i environmental site assessment process” are required with respect to the real property collateral for each mortgage loan as may be amended from time to time are performed on all properties however when circumstances warrant an update of a prior environmental   s     assessment a transaction screen or a desktop review may be utilized furthermore an esa conducted at any particular real property collateral will not necessarily cover all potential environmental issues   depending on the findings of the initial environmental assessment additional environmental testing such as a phase ii environmental assessment with respect to the subject real property collateral may be required in cases in which the esa identifies conditions that would require cleanup remedial action or any other response mcfive mile either i determines that another party with sufficient assets is responsible for taking remedial actions directed by an applicable regulatory authority or ii requires the borrower to do one of the following a carry out satisfactory remediation activities or other responses prior to the origination of the mortgage loan b establish an operations and maintenance plan c place sufficient funds in escrow or establish a letter of credit at the time of origination of the mortgage loan to complete such remediation within a specified period of time d obtain an environmental

replacements in cases in which the engineering assessment identifies material repairs or replacements needed immediately mcfive mile generally requires the borrower to carry out such repairs or replacements prior to the origination of the mortgage loan or in many cases requires the borrower to place sufficient funds in escrow at the time of origination of the mortgage loan to complete such

mortgage loans   overview rcmc has conducted a review of the rcmc mortgage loans in connection with the securitization described in this free writing prospectus the review of the rcmc mortgage loans was performed by a team comprised of real estate and securitization professionals who are employees of rcmc or one or more of its affiliates the “rcmc review team” the review procedures described below were employed with respect to the rcmc mortgage loans no sampling procedures were used in the review process   database to prepare for securitization members of the rcmc review team reviewed a database of loanlevel and propertylevel information relating to the rcmc mortgage loans rcmc engaged a third party to assist in the preparation of the database which was compiled from among other sources the related mortgage loan documents appraisal environmental assessment report property condition report zoning reports insurance review summary borrowersupplied information including but not limited to rent rolls leases operating statements and budgets and information collected by the rcmc review team during the underwriting process prior to securitization of the rcmc mortgage loans the rcmc review team may have updated the information in the database with respect to the rcmc mortgage loans based on updates provided by the related servicer relating to loan payment status and escrows updated operating statements rent rolls and leasing activity and information otherwise brought to the attention of the rcmc review team such updates if any were not intended to be and do not serve as a reunderwriting of the rcmc mortgage loans   a data tape the “rcmc data tape” containing detailed information regarding the rcmc mortgage loans was created from the information in the database referred to in the prior paragraph the rcmc data tape was used to provide the numerical information regarding the rcmc mortgage loans in this free writing prospectus   s     data comparison and recalculation rcmc engaged a third party accounting firm to perform certain data comparison and recalculation procedures designed by rcmc and relating to information in this free writing prospectus regarding the rcmc mortgage loans these procedures included   ·comparing the information in the rcmc data tape against various source documents provided by rcmc that are described above under “—database”   ·comparing numerical information regarding the rcmc mortgage loans and the related mortgaged properties disclosed in this free writing prospectus against the rcmc data tape and   ·recalculating certain percentages ratios and other formulae relating to the rcmc mortgage loans disclosed in this free writing prospectus   legal review rcmc engaged legal counsel to conduct certain legal reviews of the rcmc mortgage loans for disclosure in this free writing prospectus in anticipation of the securitization described in this free writing prospectus rcmc’s origination counsel reviewed a form of securitization representations and warranties at origination and if applicable identified exceptions to those representations and warranties rcmc’s origination and underwriting staff also performed a review of the representations and warranties   legal counsel was also engaged in connection with this securitization to assist in the review of the rcmc mortgage loans such assistance included among other things i a review of any of rcmc’s internal credit memoranda for the rcmc mortgage loans ii a review of the representations and warranties and exception reports referred to above relating to the rcmc mortgage loans prepared by origination counsel iii the review of and assistance in the completion by the rcmc review team of a due diligence questionnaire relating to the rcmc mortgage loans and iv the review of certain loan documents with respect to the rcmc mortgage loans   other review procedures the rcmc review team with the assistance of counsel engaged in connection with this securitization also reviewed the rcmc mortgage loans to determine whether it materially deviated from the underwriting guidelines set forth under “—rcmc’s underwriting standards and loan analysis” and “—underwriting exceptions” below   findings and conclusions based on the foregoing review procedures rcmc determined that the disclosure regarding the rcmc mortgage loans in this free writing prospectus is accurate in all material respects rcmc also determined that the rcmc mortgage loans were not originated with any material exceptions from rcmc’s underwriting guidelines and procedures except as described under “—underwriting exceptions” below rcmc attributes to itself all findings and conclusions resulting from the foregoing review procedures   review procedures in the event of a mortgage loan substitution rcmc will perform a review of any mortgage loan that it elects to substitute for a mortgage loan in the pool in connection with a material breach of a representation or warranty or a material document defect rcmc and if appropriate its legal counsel will review the mortgage loan documents and servicing history of the substitute mortgage loan to confirm it meets each of the criteria required under the terms of the related purchase agreement and the pooling and servicing agreement rcmc will engage a third party accounting firm to compare the qualification criteria against the underlying source documentation to verify the accuracy of the review by rcmc and to confirm any numerical andor statistical information to be disclosed in any required filings under the exchange act legal counsel will also be engaged by rcmc to render any tax opinion required in connection with the substitution   rcmc’s underwriting standards and loan analysis   overview rcmc is the originator of six  mortgage loans generally rcmc performed an underwriting analysis with respect to each mortgage loan applicant and the related mortgaged property   set forth below is a discussion of certain current general guidelines of rcmc generally applicable with respect to rcmc’s underwriting analysis of multifamily and commercial real estate properties which   s     serve as the direct or indirect source of repayment for commercial real estate debt originated by rcmc all or a portion of the underwriting guidelines described below may not be applied exactly as described below at the time a particular asset is originated by rcmc notwithstanding the discussion below given the unique nature of incomeproducing real properties the underwriting and origination procedures and analyses with respect to any particular asset may differ significantly from one asset to another and will be driven by circumstances particular to that property including among others its type current use physical quality size environmental condition location market conditions capital reserve requirements and additional collateral tenants and leases borrower identity borrower sponsorship andor performance history and any other factors deemed material or pertinent by rcmc consequently we cannot assure you that the underwriting analysis with respect to any asset will conform to the general guidelines described herein   process and loan analysis the underwriting process for each rcmc investment is performed by a transaction team comprised of real estate professionals that typically includes a loan originator and an underwriter subject to oversight by the members of the management team of rcmc this team conducts a review of the related real property which typically includes an examination of some or all of the following information among other things to the extent applicable and available historical operating statements rent rolls certain tenant leases real estate tax information insurance policies andor schedules and third party reports pertaining to appraisal physical condition and environmental status each applicable report is reviewed for acceptability by rcmc or a thirdparty reviewer the results of these reviews are incorporated into rcmc’s underwriting analysis in some cases certain of these documents may not be required or may not be reviewed due to the nature of the related real property for instance historical operating statements may not be available with respect to real property with limited operating history or that has been recently acquired by its current owner in addition rent rolls would not be examined for certain property types eg hospitality properties and executed tenant leases would not be examined for certain property types eg hospitality selfstorage multifamily and manufactured housing community properties although the forms of leases would typically be reviewed for certain of these property types   rcmc also performs an underwriting analysis with respect to the borrower under each asset it originates the underwriting analysis of the borrower may include a review of thirdparty credit reports and reports resulting from judgment lien or bankruptcy searches borrowers are generally required to be single purpose entities although exceptions may be made from time to time on a casebycase basis and in some cases other structural requirements may be imposed on the borrower which are intended to reduce the likelihood of the borrower becoming involved in a bankruptcy proceeding however we cannot assure you that any of these structural requirements will prevent a particular borrower from becoming involved in a bankruptcy proceeding   after the compilation and review of all applicable documentation and other relevant considerations the transaction team finalizes its detailed underwriting analysis of the real property’s cash flow in a manner generally consistent with rcmc’s underwriting guidelines determinations are also made regarding the implementation of appropriate transaction terms to address certain risks which may result in the recommendation of certain additional structural features a credit committee memorandum is prepared which summarizes the above referenced information and which is circulated to the credit committee for review   credit approval all assets originated by rcmc must be approved by one or more specified internal committees after a review of the credit committee package and a discussion of the asset a committee may approve a transaction as recommended request additional due diligence modify the transaction terms or decline a transaction entirely   debt service coverage ratio the repayment of an asset is typically primarily dependent upon the successful operation of the related underlying real property and the ability of that property to generate income sufficient to make payments as required under the terms of the asset accordingly in connection with the origination of an asset rcmc will analyze whether cash flow expected to be derived from the related real property will be sufficient to make the required payments under that transaction over its expected term taking into account among other things revenues and expenses for and other debt   s     currently secured directly or indirectly by or that in the future may be secured directly or indirectly by the related real property the debt service coverage ratio is an important measure of the likelihood of default on a particular asset in general the debt service coverage ratio at any given time is the ratio of—   ·the amount of income net of expenses derived or expected to be derived from the related real property for a given period to   ·the scheduled payments of principal interest and required reserves during that given period on the subject asset and any other loans that are secured by liens of senior or equal priority on or otherwise have a senior or equal entitlement to be repaid from the income generated by the related real property   however the amount described in the first bullet of the preceding sentence is often a highly subjective number based on a variety of assumptions regarding and adjustments to revenues and expenses with respect to the related real property accordingly based on such subjective assumptions and analysis we cannot assure you that the underwriting analysis of any particular asset will conform to the foregoing in every respect or to any similar analysis which may be performed by other persons or entities for example when calculating the debt service coverage ratio for a particular asset rcmc may utilize net cash flow that was calculated based on assumptions regarding projected rental income expenses andor occupancy including without limitation one or more of the following   ·the assumption that a particular tenant at the related real property that has executed a lease but has not yet taken occupancy andor has not yet commenced paying rent will take occupancy and commence paying rent on a future date   ·the assumption that an unexecuted lease that is currently being negotiated or is out for signature with respect to a particular tenant at the related real property will be executed and in place on a future date   ·the assumption that a portion of currently vacant and unleased space at the related real property will be leased at current market rates and consistent with occupancy rates of comparable properties in the subject market   ·the assumption that certain rental income that is to be payable commencing on a future date under a signed lease but where the subject tenant is in an initial rent abatement or free rent period or has not yet taken occupancy will be paid commencing on such future date   ·assumptions regarding the probability of renewal or extension of particular leases andor the releasing of certain space at the related real property and the anticipated effect on capital and releasing expenditures   ·assumptions regarding the costs and expenses including leasing commissions and tenant improvements associated with leasing vacant space or releasing occupied space at a future date   ·assumptions regarding the disruptions to revenue associated with leasing vacant space or releasing occupied space at a future date   ·assumptions regarding the costs of future capital expenses which may or may not be consistent with historical capital expenses at the related real property   ·assumptions regarding future increases or decreases in expenses or whether certain expenses are capital expenses or should be treated as expenses which are not recurring and   ·various additional leaseup assumptions and other assumptions regarding the payment of rent not currently being paid   s     we cannot assure you that the foregoing assumptions made with respect to any asset or the related real property will in fact be consistent with actual property performance   generally the debt service coverage ratio for assets originated by rcmc calculated as described above will be subject to a minimum standard at origination however exceptions may be made when consideration is given to circumstances particular to the asset the related real property the associated loantovalue ratio as described below reserves or other factors for example rcmc may originate an asset with a debt service coverage ratio below the minimum standard at origination based on among other things the amortization features of the overall debt structure the type of tenants and leases at the related real property the taking of additional collateral such as reserves letters of credit andor guarantees the profile of the borrower and its owners rcmc’s judgment of improved property andor market performance in the future andor other relevant factors   loantovalue ratio rcmc also looks at the loantovalue ratio of a prospective investment related to multifamily or commercial real estate as one of the factors it takes into consideration in evaluating the likelihood of recovery if a property is liquidated following a default in general the loantovalue ratio of an asset related to multifamily or commercial real estate at any given time is the ratio expressed as a percentage of   ·the then outstanding principal balance of the asset and any other loans that are secured directly or indirectly by liens of senior or equal priority on the related real property to   ·the estimated value of the related real property based on an appraisal a cash flow analysis a recent sales price or another method or benchmark of valuation   generally the loantovalue ratio for assets originated by rcmc calculated as described above will be subject to a maximum standard at origination however exceptions may be made when consideration is given to circumstances particular to the asset the related real property debt service coverage reserves or other factors for example rcmc may originate a multifamily or commercial real estate loan with a loantovalue ratio above the maximum standard at origination based on among other things the amortization features of the overall debt structure the type of tenants and leases at the related real property the taking of additional collateral such as reserves letters of credit andor guarantees the profile of the borrower and its owners rcmc’s judgment of improved property andor market performance in the future andor other relevant factors   additional debt when underwriting an asset rcmc will take into account whether the related real property andor direct or indirect interest in a related borrower are encumbered by additional debt and will analyze the likely effect of that additional debt on repayment of the subject asset it is possible that rcmc or an affiliate will be the lender on that additional debt and may either sell such debt to an unaffiliated third party or hold it for investment or future sale   the debt service coverage ratios at origination described above under “—debt service coverage ratio” and the loantovalue ratios at origination described above under “—loantovalue ratio” may be significantly below the minimum standard andor significantly above the maximum standard respectively when calculated taking into account the existence of additional debt secured directly or indirectly by equity interests in the related borrower   assessments of property condition as part of the underwriting process rcmc will analyze the condition of the real property for a prospective asset to aid in that analysis rcmc may subject to certain exceptions inspect or retain a third party to inspect the property and will in most cases obtain the property reports described below   appraisal report rcmc will in most cases require that the real property related to the asset be appraised by a state certified appraiser an appraiser belonging to the appraisal institute a membership association of professional real estate appraisers or an otherwise qualified appraiser who will prepare an appraisal report after completing certain diligence the appraisal report may utilize one or more approaches to value such as i cost approach ii sale comparison approach andor iii income   s     capitalization approach in addition rcmc will generally require that those appraisal reports be conducted in accordance with the uniform standards of professional appraisal practices developed by the appraisal foundation a notforprofit organization established by the appraisal profession furthermore the appraisal report will usually include or be accompanied by a separate letter that includes a statement by the appraiser that the guidelines in title xi of the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  were followed in preparing the appraisal report we cannot assure you that another person would not have arrived at a different valuation even if such person used the same general approach to and the same method of valuing the real property moreover such appraisal reports generally seek to establish the amount a typically motivated buyer would pay a typically motivated seller such amounts could be significantly higher than the amount obtained from the sale of real property particularly under a distress or liquidation sale   environmental report rcmc may require that an environmental consultant prepare a phase i environmental report with respect to the real property related to the asset however when circumstances warrant rcmc may utilize an update of a prior environmental report a transaction screen or a desktop review alternatively rcmc might forego an environmental report in limited circumstances such as when it has obtained the benefits of an environmental insurance policy or an environmental guarantee furthermore an environmental report conducted at any particular real property will not necessarily cover all potential environmental issues for example an analysis for radon andor leadbased paint will usually be conducted only at multifamily rental properties and only when rcmc or the environmental consultant believes that special circumstances warrant such an analysis depending on the findings of the initial environmental report rcmc may sometimes require additional record searches or environmental testing such as a phase ii environmental report with respect to the subject real property in certain cases the phase i or phase ii report with respect to the subject real property disclosed the existence of or potential for adverse environmental conditions including as a result of the activities of identified tenants adjacent property owners or previous owners of the subject real property in certain such cases the related borrowers were required to establish operations and maintenance plans monitor the real property abate or remediate the condition andor provide additional security such as letters of credit reserves or environmental insurance policies   engineering report in connection with the origination process rcmc generally requires that an engineering firm inspect the real property related to the asset to assess and prepare a report regarding the structure exterior walls roofing interior structure mechanical systems andor electrical systems it is important to note that such engineering reports are often based on and limited to information available through visual inspection and that any such inspection will not necessarily reveal all potential issues rcmc will generally consider the engineering report in connection with determining the relevant terms of a transaction intended to address any recommended repairs corrections or replacements and any identified deferred maintenance rcmc also often reviews such engineering reports in connection with making a determination about the necessity for ongoing escrows for the continued maintenance of the real property based on the conclusions of the applicable engineering report   seismic report if the real property related to an asset consists of improvements located in california or in seismic zones  or  rcmc generally requires a seismic report from an engineering firm to establish the probable maximum or bounded loss for the improvements at the property as a result of an earthquake generally if a seismic report concludes that the related real property is estimated to have a probably maximum loss or scenario expected loss in excess of  rcmc may require retrofitting of the improvements or that the borrower obtain earthquake insurance if available at a commercially reasonable price it should be noted however that because the seismic reports may not necessarily have used the same assumptions in assessing probable maximum loss or scenario expected loss it is possible that some of the real properties that were considered unlikely to experience a probable maximum loss or scenario expected loss in excess of  might have been the subject of a higher estimate had different assumptions been used   zoning and building code compliance in connection with the origination of an asset related to multifamily or commercial real estate rcmc will generally consider whether the use and occupancy of the related real property is in material compliance with zoning landuse building rules regulations and orders then applicable to that property evidence of this compliance may be in the form of one or more of   s     the following zoning reports legal opinions surveys recorded documents temporary or permanent certificates of occupancy letters from government officials or agencies title insurance endorsements engineering or consulting reports andor representations by the related borrower in some cases the real property may constitute a legal nonconforming use or structure in such cases rcmc may require an endorsement to the title insurance policy andor the acquisition of law and ordinance insurance with respect to the particular nonconformity unless it determines that i the nonconformity should not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the borrower to rebuild ii the real property if permitted to be repaired or restored in conformity with current law would in rcmc’s judgment constitute adequate security iii any major casualty that would prevent rebuilding has a sufficiently remote likelihood of occurring iv a variance or other similar change in applicable zoning restrictions is potentially available or the applicable governing entity is unlikely to enforce the related limitations v casualty insurance proceeds together with the value of any additional collateral are expected to be available in an amount estimated by rcmc to be sufficient to pay off all relevant indebtedness in full andor vi a cash reserve a letter of credit or an agreement imposing recourse liability from a principal of the borrower is provided to cover losses   escrow requirements based on its analysis of the related real property the borrower and the principals of the borrower rcmc may require a borrower under an asset related to multifamily or commercial real estate to fund various escrows for taxes andor insurance capital expenses replacement reserves retenanting reserves environmental remediation andor other matters rcmc conducts a casebycase analysis to determine the need for a particular escrow or reserve consequently the underlying documents for some assets do not contain provisions requiring the establishment of escrows and reserves or only require the establishment of escrows and reserves in limited amounts andor circumstances furthermore where escrows or reserves are required rcmc may accept an alternative to a cash escrow or reserve from a borrower such as a letter of credit or a guarantee from the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower or periodic evidence that the items for which the escrow or reserve would have been established are being paid or addressed in some cases rcmc may determine that establishing an escrow or reserve is not warranted given the amounts that would be involved and rcmc’s evaluation of the ability of the real property the borrower or a holder of direct or indirect ownership interests in the borrower to bear the subject expense or cost absent creation of an escrow or reserve   notwithstanding the foregoing discussion under “—rcmc’s underwriting standards and loan analysis” section rcmc may originate or acquire and may have originated or acquired real estate related loans and other investments that vary from or do not comply with rcmc’s underwriting guidelines as described herein andor such underwriting guidelines may not have been in place or may have been in place in a modified version at the time rcmc or its affiliates originated or acquired certain assets in addition in some cases rcmc may not have strictly applied these underwriting guidelines as the result of a casebycase permitted exception based upon other compensating factors   repurchase requests   rcmc filed a form absg on february   which form absg is available electronically through the sec’s edgar system rcmc’s central

all principal shortfalls that would otherwise be distributable to such converted exchangeable certificates will be deemed allocable to such class ec certificates without duplication the “class asb planned principal balance” for any distribution date is the balance shown for such distribution date in the table set forth in annex e to this free writing prospectus such balances were calculated using among other things certain weighted average life assumptions see “yield and maturity considerations—weighted average life” in this free writing prospectus based on such assumptions the certificate balance of the class asb certificates on each distribution date would be expected to be reduced to the balance indicated for such distribution date in the table set forth in annex e to this free writing prospectus we cannot assure you however that the mortgage loans will perform in conformity with our assumptions therefore we cannot assure you that the balance of the class asb certificates on any distribution date will be equal to the balance that is specified for such distribution date in the table certain calculations with respect to individual mortgage loans the stated principal balance of each mortgage loan outstanding at any time represents the principal balance of the mortgage loan ultimately due and payable to the certificateholders the “stated principal balance” of each mortgage s     loan will initially equal its cutoff date balance and on each distribution date will be reduced by the amount of principal payments received from the related borrower or advanced for such distribution date and any insurance andor condemnation proceeds received and attributable to principal but increased by any mortgage deferred interest added to the principal balance of any such mortgage loan the stated principal balance of a mortgage loan may also be reduced in connection with any modification of such mortgage loan under the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement or in connection with any forced reduction of its actual unpaid principal balance imposed by a court presiding over a bankruptcy proceeding in which the related borrower is the debtor see “certain legal aspects of the mortgage loans” in this free writing prospectus if any mortgage loan is paid in full or the mortgage loan or any mortgaged property acquired in respect of the mortgage loan is otherwise liquidated then as of the first distribution date that follows the end of the due period in which that payment in full or liquidation occurred and notwithstanding that a loss may have occurred in connection with any liquidation the stated principal balance of the mortgage loan will be zero with respect to any companion loan on any date of determination the stated principal balance will equal the unpaid principal balance of such companion loan as of such date with respect to any whole loan on any date of determination the stated principal balance of such whole loan will be the sum of the stated principal balance of the related mortgage loan and each related companion loan on such date for purposes of calculating distributions on and allocations of

“assumed final distribution date” with respect to any class of certificates is the distribution date on which the aggregate certificate balance or notional amount of that class of certificates would

collection of balloon payments and without regard to delinquencies defaults or liquidations accordingly in the event of defaults on the mortgage loans the actual final distribution date for one or more classes of the offered certificates may be later and could be substantially later than the related assumed final distribution dates   in addition the assumed final distribution dates set forth above were calculated on the basis of a  cpr prepayment rate and the modeling assumptions since the rate of payment including prepayments of the mortgage loans may exceed the scheduled rate of payments and could exceed the scheduled rate by a substantial amount the actual final distribution date for one or more classes of the offered certificates may be earlier and could be substantially earlier than the related assumed final distribution dates the rate of payments including prepayments on the mortgage loans will depend on the characteristics of the mortgage loans as well as on the prevailing level of interest rates and other economic factors and we cannot assure you as to actual payment experience   the “rated final distribution date” for each class of offered certificates will

certificates other than the class as certificates of principal in an amount equal to in each case the entire certificate balance of the class a certificates other than the class as certificates similarly but to decreasing degrees this subordination is also intended to enhance the likelihood of timely receipt by the holders of more senior classes of subordinate certificates including the

has been reduced to zero   allocation to the class a class a class a class a class a and class asb certificates for so long as they are outstanding of the entire principal distribution amount for each distribution date will have the effect of reducing the aggregate certificate balance of the class a class a class a class a class a and class asb certificates at a proportionately faster rate than the rate at which the aggregate stated principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans will decline therefore as principal is distributed to the holders of the class a class a class a class a class a and class asb certificates the percentage interest in the trust evidenced by the class a class a class a class a class a and class asb certificates will be decreased with a corresponding increase in the percentage interest in the trust evidenced by the subordinate certificates thereby increasing relative to their respective certificate balances the subordination afforded to the class a class a class a class a class a and class asb certificates by the subordinate certificates   following retirement of the class a class a class a class a class a and class asb certificates the successive allocation on each distribution date of the remaining principal distribution amount to the class as certificates and with respect to converted portions of the class as certificates passed through to

respect to converted portions of the class c certificates passed through to the class ec certificates the class d certificates the class e certificates the class f certificates the class g certificates and the class nr certificates in that order for so long as they are outstanding will provide a similar but diminishing benefit to those certificates other than to class nr certificates as to the relative amount of subordination afforded by the outstanding classes of certificates with later sequential designations   on each distribution date immediately following the distributions to be made to the certificateholders on that date and the allocation of certificate deferred interest for such date the certificate administrator is required to calculate the amount if any by which i the aggregate stated principal balance for purposes of this calculation only the aggregate stated principal balance will not be reduced by the amount of principal payments received on the mortgage loans that were used to reimburse the master servicer the special servicer or the trustee from general collections of principal on the mortgage loans for workoutdelayed reimbursement amounts to the extent those amounts are not otherwise determined to be nonrecoverable advances of the mortgage loans including any reo loans but in each case excluding any companion loan expected to be outstanding immediately following that distribution date is less than ii the then aggregate certificate balance of the principal balance certificates calculated without regard to any exchange and conversion of the exchangeable certificates for class ec certificates after giving effect to distributions of principal on that distribution date and the allocation of certificate deferred interest any such deficit a “collateral support deficit” the certificate administrator will be required to allocate any collateral support deficit among the respective classes of principal balance certificates in the following order to the class nr certificates class g certificates class f certificates class e certificates class d certificates class c certificates without regard to the exchange and conversion of the exchangeable certificates for class ec certificates class b certificates without regard to the exchange and conversion of the exchangeable certificates for class ec certificates and class as certificates without regard to the exchange and conversion of the exchangeable certificates for class ec certificates and in each case in respect of and until the remaining certificate balance of that class of   s     certificates has been reduced to zero following the reduction of the certificate balances of all classes of subordinate certificates and class ec certificates to zero the certificate administrator will be required to allocate the collateral support deficit among the classes of class a class a class a class a class a and class asb certificates pro rata without regard to the class asb planned principal balance based upon their respective certificate balances until the remaining certificate balances of the class a class a class a class a class a and class asb certificates have been reduced to zero any collateral support deficit allocated to a class of certificates will be allocated among the respective certificates of such class in proportion to the percentage interests evidenced by the respective certificates   mortgage loan losses and collateral support deficits will not be allocated to the class r or class z certificates and will not be directly allocated to the class x certificates however the notional amounts of the classes of class x certificates may be reduced if the related classes of principal balance certificates are reduced by such loan losses or such collateral support deficits   in the event that all or a portion of the exchangeable certificates are converted in an exchange for the class ec certificates such class ec certificates will be entitled to the sum of the principal and interest and other amounts otherwise distributable to the class as class b and class c certificates that are converted in an exchange for such class ec certificates and will similarly be allocated the collateral support deficit and other shortfalls otherwise allocable to the class as class b and class c certificates that are converted in an exchange for such class ec certificates as a result the class ec certificates will have the benefit of the subordination afforded the underlying exchangeable certificates and will be subject to the corresponding risks and limitations that subordination of a related component class of exchangeable certificates entails   in general collateral support deficits with respect to the offered certificates could result from the occurrence of  losses and other shortfalls on or in respect of the mortgage loans including as a result of defaults and delinquencies on the related mortgage loans nonrecoverable advances made in respect of the mortgage loans the payment to the special servicer of any compensation as described in “transaction parties—servicing and other compensation and payment

prospectus and certain federal state and local taxes and certain taxrelated expenses payable out of the trust fund as described under “material federal income tax consequences” in this free writing prospectus and “material federal income tax consequences—federal income tax consequences for remic certificates” in the prospectus accordingly the allocation of collateral support deficit as described above will constitute an allocation of losses and other shortfalls experienced by the trust fund   a class of certificates will be considered outstanding until its certificate balance or notional amount is reduced to zero without regard to the exchange and conversion of the exchangeable certificates for class ec certificates provided that in any event the class z certificates will be considered outstanding so long as holders of such certificates are entitled to receive excess interest however notwithstanding a reduction of its certificate balance to zero reimbursements of any previously allocated collateral support deficits are required thereafter to be made to a class of principal balance certificates in accordance with the payment priorities set forth in “—distributions—priority” above   advances   advances are intended to maintain a regular flow of scheduled interest and principal payments to holders of the class or classes of certificates entitled thereto and are not credit support for the certificates and will not act to guarantee or insure against losses on the mortgage loans or otherwise on the business day immediately preceding each

applicable grace period has expired or if the related periodic payment is received after the determination date but on or prior to the master servicer remittance date to the extent that the master servicer fails to make a pi advance that it is required to make under the pooling and servicing agreement the trustee will be required to make the required pi advance in accordance with the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement   neither the master servicer nor the trustee will be required to make a pi advance for a balloon payment default interest late payment charges yield maintenance charges prepayment premiums or excess interest or with respect to any companion loan   if an appraisal reduction has been made with respect to any mortgage loan or in the case of a nonserviced whole loan an appraisal reduction has been made in accordance with the related nonserviced psa and the master servicer has notice of such appraisal reduction and such mortgage loan experiences subsequent delinquencies then the interest portion of any pi advance in respect of that mortgage loan for the related distribution date will be reduced there will be no reduction in the principal portion if any

of that mortgage loan immediately prior to the related distribution date for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence the periodic payment due on the maturity date for a balloon loan will be the assumed scheduled payment for the related distribution date   in no event will either the master servicer or the trustee be required to make a pi advance with respect to any companion loan   in addition to pi advances the master servicer will also be obligated subject to the limitations described in this free writing prospectus to make advances “servicing advances” and collectively with pi advances “advances” in connection with the servicing and administration of any mortgage loan or any whole loan other than the nonserviced whole loans as applicable in respect of which a default delinquency or other unanticipated event has occurred or is reasonably foreseeable or in connection with the servicing and administration of any mortgaged property or reo property in order to pay

documents or to protect lease manage and maintain the related mortgaged property to the extent that the master servicer fails to make a servicing advance that it is required to make under the pooling and servicing agreement and the trustee has received notice or otherwise has actual knowledge of this failure the trustee will be required to make the required servicing advance in accordance with the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement   s     the special servicer will have no obligation to make any servicing advances provided that in an urgent or emergency situation requiring the making of a servicing advance the special servicer may make such servicing advance and the master servicer will be required to reimburse the special servicer for such advance with interest on that advance within a specified number of days as set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement unless such advance is determined to be nonrecoverable by the master servicer in its reasonable judgment in which

recoverable including interest on the advance out of related proceeds a “nonrecoverable advance”   each of the master servicer the special servicer and the trustee will be entitled to recover any advance by it that it subsequently determines to be a nonrecoverable advance out of general funds relating to the mortgage loans on deposit in the certificate account first from principal collections and then from any other collections the master servicer and trustee will be entitled to rely conclusively on any nonrecoverability determination of the special servicer but such determination will not be binding on the master servicer or the trustee amounts payable in respect of each companion loan pursuant to the related intercreditor agreement will not be available for distributions on the

agreement and related intercreditor agreement for the reimbursement of any servicing advances with respect to the related serviced whole loan if a servicing advance by the master servicer or special servicer or trustee as applicable on a serviced whole loan becomes a nonrecoverable advance and the master servicer the special servicer or the trustee as applicable is unable to recover such amounts from related proceeds or the related companion loan as applicable the master servicer the special servicer or the trustee as applicable will be permitted to recover such nonrecoverable advance including interest thereon out of general funds on deposit in the certificate account   if the funds in the certificate account relating to the mortgage loans allocable to principal on the mortgage loans are insufficient to fully reimburse the party entitled to reimbursement then such party as an accommodation may elect on a monthly basis at its sole option and discretion to defer reimbursement of the portion that exceeds such amount allocable to principal in which case interest will continue to accrue on the unreimbursed portion of the advance for a time as required to reimburse the excess portion from principal for a consecutive period up to  months provided that with respect to any mortgage loan other than an excluded loan any such deferral exceeding  months will require prior to the occurrence and continuance of any control event the consent of the directing certificateholder and any election to so defer will be deemed to be in accordance with the servicing standard provided that no such deferral may occur at any time to the extent that amounts otherwise distributable as principal are available for such reimbursement   s     in connection with a potential election by the master servicer or the trustee to refrain from the reimbursement of all or a portion of a particular nonrecoverable advance during the one month collection period ending on the related determination

before making its determination of whether to refrain from the reimbursement of all or a portion of a particular nonrecoverable advance provided however that if at any time the master servicer or the trustee as applicable elects in its sole discretion not to refrain from obtaining such reimbursement or otherwise determines that the reimbursement of a nonrecoverable advance during a one month collection period will exceed the full amount of the principal portion of general collections deposited in the certificate account for such distribution date then the master servicer or the trustee as applicable will be required to use its reasonable efforts to give the g information provider  days’ notice of such determination for posting on the g information provider’s website unless extraordinary circumstances make such notice impractical and thereafter will be required to deliver copies of such notice to the rating agencies notwithstanding the foregoing failure to give such notice will in no way affect the master servicer’s or the trustee’s election whether to refrain from obtaining such reimbursement   each of the master servicer the special servicer and the trustee will be entitled to recover any advance that is outstanding at the time that a mortgage loan is modified but is not repaid in full by the borrower in connection with such modification but becomes an obligation of the borrower to pay such amounts in the future such advance together with interest on that advance a “workoutdelayed reimbursement amount” out of principal collections on the mortgage loans in the certificate account   any amount that constitutes all or a portion of any workoutdelayed reimbursement amount may in the future be determined to constitute a nonrecoverable advance and thereafter will be recoverable as any other nonrecoverable advance   in addition the special servicer may at its option with respect to any specially serviced mortgage loan in consultation with prior to the occurrence of a consultation termination event the directing certificateholder make a determination in accordance with the servicing standard that any pi advance or servicing advance if made would be a nonrecoverable advance and if it makes such a determination must deliver to the master servicer and with respect to a serviced mortgage loan to any master servicer or special servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement governing any trust into which the related serviced pari passu companion loan is deposited and with respect to any nonserviced mortgage loan the related master

behalf of the trust fund and the holder of any related companion loan if applicable will be required to sell the mortgaged property prior to the close of the third calendar year beginning after the year of acquisition unless  the irs grants or has not denied an extension of time to sell the property or  the trustee the certificate administrator and the master servicer receive an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that the holding of the property by the trust fund longer than the abovereferenced three year period will not result in the imposition of a tax on any trust remic or cause the trust fund or cause any trust remic to fail to qualify as a remic under the code at any time that any certificate is outstanding subject to the foregoing and any other taxrelated limitations pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement the special servicer will generally be required to attempt to sell any mortgaged property so acquired on the same terms and conditions it would if it were the owner the special servicer will also be   s     required to ensure that any mortgaged property acquired by the trust fund is administered so that it constitutes “foreclosure property” within the meaning of section ga of the code at all times and that the sale of the property does not result in the receipt by the trust fund or the holder of any companion loan of any “income from nonpermitted assets” as described in section fab of the code endanger the status of any trust remic or result in the imposition of a tax upon any trust remic or the trust fund including but not limited to the tax on “prohibited transactions” as defined in section fa of the code and the tax on contributions to a remic set forth in section gd of the code but not including the tax on “net income from foreclosure property” as defined in section gc of the code if the trust fund acquires title to any mortgaged property the special servicer on behalf of the trust fund will retain at the expense of the trust fund an independent contractor to manage and operate the property the independent contractor generally will be permitted to perform construction including renovation on a foreclosed property only if the construction was more than  completed before default on the related mortgage loan became imminent the retention of an independent contractor however will not relieve the special servicer of its obligation to manage the mortgaged property as required under the pooling and servicing agreement   generally no trust remic will be taxable on income received with respect to a mortgaged property acquired by the trust fund to the extent that it constitutes “rents from real property” within the meaning of section d of the code and treasury regulations under the code rents from real property include fixed rents and rents based on the receipts or sales of a tenant but do not include the portion of any rental based on the net income or profit of any tenant or subtenant no determination has been made whether rent on any of the mortgaged properties meets this requirement rents from real property include charges for services customarily furnished or rendered in connection with the rental of real property whether or not the charges are separately stated services furnished to the tenants of a particular building will be considered as customary if in the geographic market in which the building is located tenants in buildings that are of similar class are customarily provided with the service no determination has been made whether the services furnished to the tenants of the mortgaged properties are “customary” within the meaning of applicable regulations it is therefore possible that a portion of the rental income with respect to a mortgaged property owned by the trust fund would not constitute rents from real property or that none of such income would qualify if a separate charge is not stated for such noncustomary services or they are not performed by an independent contractor rents from real property also do not include income from the operation of a trade or business on the mortgaged property such as a hotel or rental income attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property if the rent attributable to that personal property exceeds  of the total rent at the related mortgaged property for the taxable year any of the foregoing types of income may instead constitute “net income from foreclosure property” which would be taxable to the lowertier remic at the highest marginal federal corporate rate currently  and may also be subject to state or local taxes the pooling and servicing agreement provides that the special servicer will be permitted to cause a trust remic to earn “net income from foreclosure property” that is subject to tax if it determines that the net aftertax benefit to certificateholders is greater than another method of operating or net leasing the mortgaged property because these sources of income if they exist are already in place with respect to the mortgaged properties it is generally viewed as beneficial to certificateholders to permit the trust fund to continue to earn them if it acquires a mortgaged property even at the cost of this tax these taxes would be chargeable against the related income for purposes of determining the proceeds available for distribution to holders of certificates see “material federal income tax consequences—federal income tax consequences for remic certificates—mark to market regulations—taxes that may be imposed on the remic pool” in the prospectus   to the extent that liquidation proceeds collected with respect to any mortgage loan are less than the sum of  the outstanding principal balance of the

of the related hazard insurance policy are insufficient to restore fully the damaged property the master servicer will not be required to advance the funds to effect the restoration unless  the

each class of offered certificates other than the class ec certificates which do not have a passthrough rate for any distribution date will equal the rate set forth on the cover of this free writing prospectus including additional information indicated by any relevant footnotes see “description of the certificates” in this free writing prospectus   rate and timing of principal payments the yield to holders of offered certificates that are purchased at a discount or premium will be affected by the rate and timing of principal payments on the mortgage loans including principal prepayments on the mortgage loans resulting from both voluntary prepayments by the borrowers and involuntary liquidations as described in this free writing prospectus the principal distribution amount for each distribution date will generally be distributable first in respect of the class asb certificates until their certificate balance is reduced to the class asb planned principal balance for such distribution date second in respect of the class a certificates until their certificate balance is reduced to zero third in respect of the class a certificates until their certificate balance is reduced to zero fourth in respect of the class a certificates until their certificate balance is reduced to zero fifth in respect of the class a certificates until their certificate balance is reduced to zero sixth in respect of the class a certificates until their certificate balance is reduced to zero and seventh in respect of the class asb certificates without regard to the class asb planned principal balance until their certificate balance is reduced to zero after those distributions the remaining principal distribution amount with respect to the pool of mortgage loans will generally be distributable entirely in respect of the class as certificates the class b certificates the class c certificates the class d certificates the class e certificates the class f certificates the class g certificates and the class nr certificates in that order in each case until the certificate balance of such class of certificates is reduced to zero calculated without giving effect to any exchange of the exchangeable certificates for class ec certificates on each distribution date the class ec certificates will receive in the aggregate the sum of the principal distributable to the class as class b and class c certificates that have been exchanged for such class ec certificates consequently the rate and timing of principal payments on the mortgage loans will in turn be affected by their amortization schedules lockout periods defeasance provisions provisions relating to the release andor application of earnout reserves provisions requiring prepayments in connection with the release of real property collateral provisions requiring or permitting prepayments in connection with casualties and condemnations requirements to pay yield maintenance charges andor other prepayment consideration in connection with principal payments the dates on which balloon payments are due incentives for a borrower to repay an ard loan by the related anticipated repayment date property release provisions provisions relating to the application or release of earnout reserves any extensions of maturity dates by the master servicer or the special servicer and the rate and timing of principal prepayments and other unscheduled collections received in respect of the   s     mortgage loans including for this purpose collections made in connection with liquidations of mortgage loans due to defaults casualties or condemnations affecting the mortgaged properties or purchases of mortgage loans out of the trust fund furthermore because the class x certificates are not entitled to distributions of principal the yield on such certificates will be extremely sensitive to prepayments received in respect of the mortgage loans to the extent distributed to reduce the related notional amount of the applicable class of class x certificates in addition although the borrower under an ard loan may have certain incentives to prepay such ard loan on its anticipated repayment date we cannot assure you that the borrower will be able to prepay such ard loan on its related anticipated repayment date the failure of the borrower to prepay an ard loan on its anticipated repayment date will not be an event of default under the terms of such ard loan and pursuant to the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement neither the master servicer nor the special servicer will be permitted to take any enforcement action with respect to the borrower’s failure to pay excess interest other than to make requests for collection until the scheduled maturity of such ard loan provided that the master servicer or the special servicer as the case may be may take action to enforce the trust fund’s right to apply excess cash flow to principal in accordance with the terms of the respective ard loan documents with respect to the class asb certificates the extent to which the planned balances are achieved and the sensitivity of the class asb certificates to principal prepayments on the mortgage loans will depend in part on the period of time during which the class a class a class a class a and class a certificates remain outstanding as such the class asb certificates will become more sensitive to the rate of prepayments on the mortgage loans than they were when the class a class a class a class a and class a certificates were outstanding   prepayments and assuming the respective stated maturity dates or if applicable anticipated repayment dates for the mortgage loans have not occurred liquidations and purchases of the mortgage loans will result in distributions on the offered certificates of amounts that would otherwise be distributed over the remaining terms of the mortgage loans to maturity or if applicable to the related anticipated repayment date defaults on the mortgage loans particularly at or near their stated maturity dates or if applicable anticipated repayment dates may result in significant delays in anticipated payments of principal on the mortgage loans and accordingly on the offered certificates while workouts are negotiated or foreclosures are completed see “servicing of the mortgage loans—modifications waivers and amendments” and “—realization upon defaulted mortgage loans” and “certain legal aspects of the mortgage loans” in this free writing prospectus because the rate of principal payments on the mortgage loans will depend on future events and a variety of factors as described below we cannot assure you as to the rate of principal payments or the rate of principal prepayments in particular we are not aware of any relevant publicly available or authoritative statistics with respect to the historical prepayment experience of a large group of mortgage loans comparable to the mortgage loans   the extent to which the yield to maturity of any class of offered certificates may vary from the anticipated yield will depend upon the degree to which the certificates are purchased at a discount or premium and when and to what degree payments of principal on the mortgage loans are in turn distributed on the certificates or in the case of the class xa or class xb certificates applied to reduce the notional amount of the class xa or class xb certificates as applicable in each case determined without giving effect to any exchange of exchangeable certificates for class ec certificates an investor should consider in the case of any certificate other than the class x certificates purchased at a discount the risk that a slower than anticipated rate of principal payments on the mortgage loans could result in an actual yield to such investor that is lower than the anticipated yield and in the case of any certificate purchased at a premium the risk that a faster than anticipated rate of principal payments could result in an actual yield to such investor that is lower than the anticipated yield in general the earlier a payment of principal on the mortgage loans is distributed or otherwise results in reduction of the principal balance of a certificate purchased at a discount or premium the greater will be the effect on an investor’s yield to maturity as a result the effect on an investor’s yield of principal payments distributed on an investor’s certificates occurring at a rate higher or lower than the rate anticipated by the investor during any particular period would not be fully offset by a subsequent like reduction or increase in the rate of principal payments   s     because the notional amounts of the class xa and class xb certificates are based on the outstanding certificate balances of in the case of the class xa certificates the class a certificates determined without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of any class as certificates for class ec certificates and in the case of the class xb certificates the class b certificates determined without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of any class b certificates for class ec certificates the yield to maturity on the class xa and class xb certificates will be extremely sensitive to the rate and timing of prepayments of principal on the mortgage loans   the yield on each of the classes of certificates that have a passthrough rate equal to limited by or based on the wac rate could or in the case of any class of certificates with a passthrough rate equal to the wac rate would be adversely affected if mortgage loans with higher mortgage rates prepay faster than mortgage loans with lower mortgage rates the passthrough rates on these classes of certificates may be adversely affected by a decrease in the wac rate even if principal prepayments do not occur   losses and shortfalls the yield to holders of the offered certificates will also depend on the extent to which the holders are required to bear the effects of any losses or shortfalls on the mortgage loans losses and other shortfalls on the mortgage loans will generally be borne by the holders of the class nr certificates the class g certificates the class f certificates the class e certificates the class d certificates the class c certificates and any related portion of the class ec certificates class b certificates and any related portion of the class ec certificates and the class as certificates and any related portion of the class ec certificates in that order in each case to the extent of amounts otherwise distributable in respect of the class of subordinate certificates although losses on the class as certificates and any related portion of the class ec certificates will not be allocated to the class xa certificates directly they will reduce the notional amount of the class xa certificates without giving effect to any conversion and exchange of class as certificates for class ec certificates which will reduce the yield on such offered certificates similarly although losses on the class b certificates and any related portion of the class ec certificates will not be allocated to the class xb certificates directly they will reduce the notional amount of the class xb certificates without giving effect to any conversion and exchange of class b certificates for class ec certificates which will reduce the yield on such offered certificates in the event of the reduction of the certificate balances of all those classes of subordinate certificates and the class ec certificates to zero the resulting losses and shortfalls will then be borne pro rata by the class a class a class a class a class a and class asb certificates as is the case with losses on the class as certificates as described above although losses on such class a certificates will not be allocated to the class xa certificates directly they will reduce the notional amount of the class xa certificates without giving effect to any conversion and exchange of class as certificates for class ec certificates which will reduce the yield on such offered certificates if exchangeable certificates are converted in an exchange for class ec certificates all losses and shortfalls that would otherwise be allocable to such converted exchangeable certificates will be borne by such class ec certificates   certain relevant factors the rate and timing of principal payments and defaults and the severity of losses on the mortgage loans may be affected by a number of factors including without limitation prevailing interest rates the terms of the mortgage loans for example dueonsale clauses lockout periods or yield maintenance charges release of property provision and amortization terms that require balloon payments and incentives for a borrower to repay its mortgage loan by an anticipated repayment date the demographics and relative economic vitality of the areas in which the mortgaged properties are located and the general supply and demand for rental properties in those areas the quality of management of the mortgaged properties the servicing of the mortgage loans possible changes in tax laws and other opportunities for investment see “risk factors” and “description of the mortgage pool” and “yield and maturity considerations” in this free writing prospectus   the rate of prepayment on the pool of mortgage loans is likely to be affected by prevailing market interest rates for mortgage loans of a comparable type term and risk level as the mortgage loans when the prevailing market interest rate is below a mortgage coupon a borrower may have an increased incentive to refinance its mortgage loan however under all of the mortgage loans voluntary   s     prepayments are subject to lockout periods andor yield maintenance charges see “description of the mortgage pool—certain terms and conditions of the mortgage loans” in this free writing prospectus in any case we cannot assure you that the related borrowers will refrain from prepaying their mortgage loans due to the existence of yield maintenance charges or prepayment premiums or that involuntary prepayments will not occur see “description of the mortgage pool—certain terms and conditions of the mortgage loans” in this free writing prospectus   with respect to certain mortgage loans the related mortgage loan documents allow for the sale of individual properties and the severance of the related debt and the assumption by the transferee of such portion of the mortgage loan as is allocable to the individual property acquired by that transferee subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions in addition with respect to certain mortgage loans the related mortgage loan documents allow for partial releases of individual mortgaged properties during a lockout period or during such time as a yield maintenance charge would otherwise be payable which could result in a prepayment of a portion of the initial principal balance of the related mortgage loan without payment of a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium additionally in the case of a partial release of an individual mortgaged property the related release amount in many cases is greater than the allocated loan amount for the mortgaged property being released which would result in a greater than proportionate paydown of the mortgage loan for certain mortgage loans a prepayment may occur often without any required yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium in connection with a casualty at or condemnation of the related mortgaged property for more information see “description of the mortgage pool—certain terms and conditions of the mortgage loans—releases of individual mortgaged properties” in this free writing prospectus   depending on prevailing market interest rates the outlook for market interest rates and economic conditions generally some borrowers may sell mortgaged properties in order to realize their equity in the mortgaged property to meet cash flow needs or to make other investments in addition some borrowers may be motivated by federal and state tax laws which are subject to change to sell mortgaged properties prior to the exhaustion of tax depreciation benefits   we make no representation as to the particular factors that will affect the rate and timing of prepayments and defaults on the mortgage loans as to the relative importance of those factors as to the percentage of the principal balance of the mortgage loans that will be prepaid or as to which a default will have occurred as of any date or as to the overall rate of prepayment or default on the mortgage loans or related mortgage loans   delay in payment of distributions because each monthly distribution is made on each distribution date which is at least  days after the end of the related interest accrual period for the certificates the effective yield to the holders of such certificates will be lower than the yield that would otherwise be produced by the applicable passthrough rates and purchase prices assuming the prices did not account for the delay   unpaid distributable certificate interest as described under “description of the certificates—distributions—priority” in this free writing prospectus if the portion of the available distribution amount distributable in respect of interest on any class of certificates on any distribution date is less than the distributable certificate interest then payable for that class of certificates then the shortfall will be distributable to holders of that class of certificates on subsequent distribution dates to the extent of available funds any shortfall will not bear interest however so it will negatively affect the yield to maturity of the related class of certificates for so long as it is outstanding similarly any amounts constituting collateral support deficit that are subsequently reimbursed generally will not bear interest except as provided in this free writing prospectus with respect to accrued interest from recoveries   weighted average life   the weighted average life of a regular certificate and the class ec certificates refers to the average amount of time that will elapse from the date of its issuance until each dollar allocable to principal of the certificate is distributed to the related investor the weighted average life of a regular certificate and the class ec certificates will be influenced by among other things the rate at which principal on the   s     mortgage loans is paid or otherwise received which may be in the form of scheduled amortization voluntary prepayments insurance and condemnation proceeds and liquidation proceeds as described in this free writing prospectus the principal distribution amount for each distribution date will generally be distributable first in respect of the class asb certificates until their certificate balance is reduced to the class asb planned principal balance for such distribution date second in respect of the class a certificates until their certificate balance is reduced to zero third in respect of the class a certificates until their certificate balance is reduced to zero fourth in respect of the class a certificates until their certificate balance is reduced to zero fifth in respect of the class a certificates until their certificate balance is reduced to zero sixth in respect of the class a certificates until their certificate balance is reduced to zero and seventh in respect of the class asb certificates without regard to the class asb planned principal balance until their certificate balance is reduced to zero after those distributions the remaining principal distribution amount with respect to all the mortgage loans will generally be distributable entirely in respect of the class as certificates then the class b certificates then the class c certificates then the class d certificates then the class e certificates then the class f certificates then the class g certificates and then the class nr certificates in that order in each case until the certificate balance of each such class of certificates is reduced to zero calculated without giving effect to any exchange of the exchangeable certificates for class ec certificates on each distribution date the class ec certificates will receive in the aggregate the sum of the principal distribution amount that would otherwise be distributed to the class as class b and class c certificates that have been converted in an exchange for such class ec certificates   prepayments on mortgage loans may be measured by a prepayment standard or model the “constant prepayment rate” or “cpr” model represents an assumed constant annual rate of prepayment each month expressed as a per annum percentage of the thenscheduled principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans the “cpy” model represents an assumed cpr prepayment rate after any applicable lockout period any applicable period in which defeasance is permitted and any applicable yield maintenance period the model used in this free writing prospectus is the cpy model as used in each of the following tables the column headed “ cpy” assumes that none of the mortgage loans is prepaid before its maturity date or anticipated repayment date as the case may be the columns headed “ cpy” “ cpy” “ cpy” and “ cpy” assume that prepayments on the mortgage loans are made at those levels of cpr following the expiration of any applicable lockout period any applicable period in which defeasance is permitted and any applicable yield maintenance period except as described below we cannot assure you however that prepayments of the mortgage loans will conform to any level of cpy and we make no representation that the mortgage loans will prepay at the levels of cpy shown or at any other prepayment rate   the following tables indicate the percentage of the initial certificate balance of each class of the offered certificates that would be outstanding after each of the dates shown at various cpys and the corresponding weighted average life of each class of offered certificates the tables have been prepared on the basis of the following assumptions the “modeling assumptions” among others   a scheduled periodic payments including payments due at maturity of principal andor interest on the mortgage loans will be received on a timely basis and will be distributed on the th day of the related month beginning in november    b the mortgage rate in effect for each mortgage loan as of the cutoff date will remain in effect to the related maturity date or anticipated repayment date as the case may be and will be adjusted as required pursuant to the definition of mortgage rate   c the mortgage loan sellers will not be required to repurchase any mortgage loan and none of the holders of the controlling class or any other certificateholder the special servicer the master servicer or the holders of the class r certificates will exercise its option to purchase all the mortgage loans and thereby cause an early termination of the trust fund and no holder of any mezzanine debt or other indebtedness will exercise its option to purchase the related mortgage loan   d any principal prepayments on the mortgage loans will be received on their respective due dates after the expiration of any applicable lockout period any applicable period in which defeasance   s     is permitted and any applicable yield maintenance period in each case at the respective levels of cpy set forth in the tables without regard to any limitations in such mortgage loans on partial voluntary principal prepayment   e no prepayment interest shortfalls are

the mortgaged property identified as “uhaul portfolio” on annex a to this free writing prospectus representing approximately  of the initial pool balance amortizes based on the assumed principal payment schedule attached to this free writing prospectus as annex f and for purposes of assumed cpr prepayment rates prepayments are determined on the basis of the principal balance of the related mortgage loan only   to the extent that the mortgage loans have characteristics that differ from those assumed in preparing the tables set forth below a class of offered certificates may mature earlier or later than indicated by the tables the tables set forth below are for illustrative purposes only and it is highly unlikely that the mortgage loans will actually prepay at any constant rate until maturity or that all the mortgage loans will prepay at the same rate in addition variations in the actual prepayment experience and the balance of the mortgage loans that prepay may increase or decrease the percentages of initial certificate balances and weighted average lives shown in the following tables these variations may occur even if the average prepayment experience of the mortgage loans were to equal any of the specified cpy percentages investors should not rely on the prepayment assumptions set forth in this free writing prospectus and are urged to conduct their own analyses of the rates at which the mortgage loans may be expected to prepay based on their own assumptions based on the foregoing assumptions the following tables indicate the resulting weighted average lives

holders of the controlling class the special servicer the master servicer or the holders of the class r certificates would result in prepayment in full of the offered certificates and would have an adverse effect on the yield of a class of the class xa and class xb certificates because a termination would have an effect similar to a principal prepayment in full of the mortgage loans and as a

certificates—termination retirement of certificates” in this free writing prospectus   pretax yield to maturity tables   the following tables indicate the approximate pretax yield to maturity on a corporate bond equivalent “cbe” basis on the offered certificates for the specified cpys based on the assumptions set forth under “—weighted average life” above it was further assumed that the purchase price of the offered certificates is as specified in the tables below expressed as a percentage of the initial certificate balance or notional amount as applicable plus accrued interest from october   to the closing date   the yields set forth in the following tables were calculated by determining the monthly discount rates that when applied to the assumed streams of cash flows to be paid on the applicable class of offered certificates would cause the discounted present value of such assumed stream of cash flows to equal the assumed purchase price of such class and by converting such monthly rates to semiannual corporate bond equivalent rates such calculations do not take into account shortfalls in collection of interest due to prepayments or other liquidations of the mortgage loans or the interest rates at which investors may be able to reinvest funds received by them as distributions on the applicable class of certificates and accordingly do not purport to reflect the return on any investment in the applicable class of offered certificates when such reinvestment rates are considered   the characteristics of the mortgage loans may differ from those assumed in preparing the tables below in addition we cannot assure you that the mortgage loans will prepay in accordance with the above assumptions at any of the rates shown in the tables or at any other particular rate that the cash flows on the applicable class of offered certificates will correspond to the cash flows shown in this free writing prospectus or that the aggregate purchase price of such class of offered certificates will be as assumed in addition it is unlikely that the mortgage loans will prepay in accordance with the above assumptions at any of the specified cpys until maturity or that all the mortgage loans will so prepay at the same rate timing of changes in the rate of prepayments may significantly affect the actual yield to maturity to investors even if the average rate of principal prepayments is consistent with the expectations of investors investors must make their own decisions as to the appropriate prepayment assumption to be used in deciding whether to purchase

offered certificates held by a domestic building and loan association will be treated as “loans   secured by an interest in real property which is    residential real property” within the meaning of

certificates—characterization of investments in remic certificates” in the prospectus   taxation of offered certificates   general each class of offered certificates whether held directly or in the form of the class ec certificates generally will be treated as newly originated debt instruments for federal income tax purposes holders of the class ec certificates will treat the related portions of the related exchangeable certificates as separate debt instruments and will report the aggregate of separate amounts computed with respect thereto holders of such classes will be required to include in income all interest on the regular interests represented by their certificates in accordance with the accrual method of accounting regardless of a certificateholder’s usual method of accounting the prepayment assumption that will be used in determining the rate of accrual of oid if any and market discount or whether any such discount is de minimis and that may be used to amortize premium if any for federal income tax purposes will be based on the assumption that subsequent to the date of any determination the mortgage loans will prepay at a rate equal to a cpr of  provided that it is assumed that any ard loan prepays on its related anticipated repayment date the “prepayment assumption” no representation is made that the mortgage loans will prepay at that rate or at any other rate treasury regulations the “oid regulations” governing the computation of oid do not address the manner of accruing oid on securities such as the offered certificates on which principal is required to be prepaid based on prepayments of the underlying assets and which are governed by section a of the code the methodology for accruing oid described in this paragraph and in the prospectus will be used for reporting to investors unless and until   s     more specific regulations are issued for obligations governed by section a of the code see “material federal income tax consequences—federal income tax consequences for remic certificates—taxation of regular certificates—original issue discount” and “—premium” in the prospectus it is anticipated that the class ● certificates will be issued with oid   in addition it is anticipated that the certificate administrator will treat the class xa and class xb certificates as having no qualified stated interest accordingly such classes will be considered to be issued with oid in an amount equal to the excess of all distributions of interest expected to be received thereon over their respective issue prices including interest accrued prior to the closing date any “negative” amounts of oid on the class xa or class xb certificates attributable to rapid prepayments with respect to the mortgage loans will not be deductible currently holders of class xa and class xb certificates may be entitled to a loss which may be a capital loss to the extent it becomes certain that such certificateholders will not recover a portion of their basis in such classes assuming no further prepayments in the alternative it is possible that rules similar to the “noncontingent bond method” of the contingent interest rules of the oid regulations may be promulgated with respect to such classes unless and until required otherwise by applicable authority it is not anticipated that the contingent interest rules will apply   premium a regular certificate purchased upon initial issuance or in the secondary market at a cost as adjusted greater than its remaining stated redemption price at maturity generally is considered to be purchased at a premium see “material federal income tax consequences—federal income tax consequences for remic certificates—taxation of regular certificates—premium” in the prospectus it is anticipated that the class ● certificates will be issued at a premium   yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums actually collected on the mortgage loans will be distributed to the offered certificates as described in “description of the certificates—allocation of yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums” in this free writing prospectus it is not entirely clear under the code when the amount of yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums so allocated should be taxed to the holders of the regular certificates but it is not expected for federal income tax reporting purposes that yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums will be treated as giving rise to any income to the holder of such classes of certificates prior to the certificate administrator’s actual receipt of yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums if any may be treated as paid upon the retirement or partial retirement of the offered certificates the irs may disagree with these positions holders of offered certificates should consult their own tax advisors concerning the treatment of yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums   taxation of the class ec certificates   the arrangement under which exchangeable certificates converted in an exchange for class ec certificates is held will be classified as a grantor trust under subpart e part i of subchapter j of the code and the class ec certificates will evidence beneficial ownership of a portion of the grantor trust the interests in the exchangeable certificates that have been exchanged and converted for an interest in the class ec certificates including any exchanges effective on the closing date will be the assets of that portion of the grantor trust and such class ec certificates will represent beneficial ownership of such exchangeable certificates   the class ec certificates will represent undivided beneficial interests in the exchangeable certificates that have been exchanged for such class ec certificates which will be treated as separate debt instruments for federal income tax purposes the holder of the class ec certificates must account separately for its interest in each such class of exchangeable certificates see “—taxation of offered certificates” above a purchaser must allocate its basis in the class ec certificates among the exchangeable certificates represented by each class of exchangeable certificates in accordance with their relative fair market values as of the time of acquisition similarly on the sale of such class ec certificate the holder must allocate the amount received on the sale among the exchangeable   s     certificates represented by each class of exchangeable certificates in accordance with their relative fair market values as of the time of sale prospective beneficial owners of the class ec certificates should consult their tax advisors as to the appropriate method of accounting for their interest in the class ec certificates   if a beneficial owner exchanges exchangeable certificates for class ec certificates the exchange and conversion will not be taxable likewise if a beneficial owner exchanges and converts class ec certificates for exchangeable certificates the exchange and conversion will not be taxable   taxation of foreign investors   for further information

offered certificates see “material federal income tax consequences—federal income tax consequences for remic certificates—taxation of regular certificates” in the prospectus   due to the complexity of these rules and the current uncertainty as to the manner of their application to the issuing entity and certificateholders it is particularly important that potential investors consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax treatment of their acquisition ownership and disposition of the offered certificates   certain state local and foreign tax considerations   in addition to the federal income tax consequences described in “material federal income tax consequences” above purchasers of offered certificates should consider the state local and foreign income tax consequences of the acquisition ownership and disposition of the offered certificates state local and foreign income tax law may differ substantially from the corresponding federal law and this discussion does not purport to describe any aspect of the income tax laws of any state locality or foreign jurisdiction therefore potential purchasers should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the various state local and foreign tax consequences of investment in the offered certificates   certain erisa considerations   a fiduciary of any retirement plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement including individual retirement accounts and annuities keogh plans and collective investment funds and separate accounts in which those plans annuities accounts or arrangements are invested including insurance company general accounts that is subject to the fiduciary responsibility rules of the employee retirement income security act of  as amended “erisa” or section  of the code an “erisa plan” or which is a governmental plan as defined in section  of erisa a church plan as defined in section  of erisa and for which no election has been made under section d of the code or any other plan subject to any federal state or local law “similar law” which is to a material extent similar to the foregoing provisions of erisa or the code collectively with an erisa plan a “plan” should review with   s     its legal advisors whether the purchase or holding of offered certificates could give rise to a transaction that is prohibited or is not otherwise permitted under erisa the code or similar law or whether there exists any statutory regulatory or administrative exemption applicable thereto moreover each plan fiduciary should determine whether an investment in the offered certificates is appropriate for the plan taking into account the overall investment policy of the plan and the composition of the plan’s investment portfolio   the us department of labor has issued to jp morgan securities llc an individual prohibited transaction exemption pte   fed reg  march   as amended by pte   fed reg  july   the “exemption” the exemption generally exempts from the application of the prohibited transaction provisions of sections  and  of erisa and the excise taxes imposed on prohibited transactions pursuant to sections a and b of the code certain transactions among others relating to the servicing and operation of pools of mortgage loans such as the pool of mortgage loans held by the trust and the purchase sale and holding of mortgage passthrough certificates such as the offered certificates underwritten by jp morgan securities llc provided that certain conditions set forth in the exemption are satisfied the depositor expects that the exemption generally will apply to the offered certificates   the exemption sets forth five general conditions that must be satisfied for a transaction involving the purchase sale and holding of the offered certificates to be eligible for exemptive relief first the acquisition of the offered certificates by an erisa plan must be on terms including the price paid for the offered certificates that are at least as favorable to the erisa plan as they would be in an arm’slength transaction with an unrelated party second the offered certificates at the time of acquisition by the erisa plan must be rated in one of the four highest generic rating categories by at least one nrsro that meets the requirements of the exemption an “exemption rating agency” third the trustee cannot be an affiliate of any other member of the restricted group other than an underwriter the “restricted group” consists of any underwriter the depositor the trustee the master servicer the special servicer any subservicer any entity that provides insurance or other credit support to the trust fund and any borrower with respect to mortgage loans constituting more than  of the aggregate unamortized principal balance of the mortgage loans as of the date of initial issuance of the offered certificates and any affiliate of any of the foregoing entities fourth the sum of all payments made to and retained by the underwriters must represent not more than reasonable compensation for underwriting the offered certificates the sum of all payments made to and retained by the depositor pursuant to the assignment of the mortgage loans to the trust fund must represent not more than the fair market value of the mortgage loans and the sum of all payments made to and retained by the master servicer the special servicer and any subservicer must represent not more than reasonable compensation for that person’s services under the pooling and servicing agreement and reimbursement of the person’s reasonable expenses in connection therewith fifth the investing erisa plan must be an accredited investor as defined in rule a of regulation d under the securities act   it is a condition of the issuance of the offered certificates that they have the ratings described above required by the exemption and the depositor believes that each of the rating agencies qualifies as an exemption rating agency consequently the second general condition set forth above will be satisfied with respect to the offered certificates as of the closing date as of the closing date the third general condition set forth above will be satisfied with respect to the offered certificates in addition the depositor believes that the fourth general condition set forth above will be satisfied with respect to the offered certificates a fiduciary of an erisa plan contemplating purchasing an offered certificate in the secondary market must make its own determination that at the time of purchase the offered certificates continue to satisfy the second general condition set forth above a fiduciary of an erisa plan contemplating purchasing an offered certificate whether in the initial issuance of the offered certificates or in the secondary market must make its own determination that the first and fifth general conditions set forth above will be satisfied with respect to the related offered certificate   the exemption also requires that the trust fund meet the following requirements  the trust fund must consist solely of assets of the type that have been included in other investment pools  certificates in those other investment pools must have been rated in one of the four highest categories by at least one   s     of the exemption rating agencies for at least one year prior to the erisa plan’s acquisition of offered certificates and  certificates in those other investment pools must have been purchased by investors other than erisa plans for at least one year prior to any erisa plan’s acquisition of offered certificates   the depositor believes that the conditions to the applicability of the exemption will generally be met with respect to the offered certificates other than those conditions which are dependent on facts unknown to the depositor or which it cannot control such as those relating to the circumstances of the erisa plan purchaser or the erisa plan fiduciary making the decision to purchase any such offered certificates   if the general conditions of the exemption are satisfied the exemption may provide an exemption from the restrictions imposed by sections a and a of erisa as well as the excise taxes imposed by sections a and b of the code by reason of sections ca through d of the code in connection with  the direct or indirect sale exchange or transfer of offered certificates in the initial issuance of certificates between the depositor or the underwriters and an erisa plan when the depositor any of the underwriters the trustee the master servicer the special servicer a subservicer or a borrower is a party in interest with respect to the investing erisa plan  the direct or indirect acquisition or disposition in the secondary market of the offered certificates by an erisa plan and  the holding of offered certificates by an erisa plan however no exemption is provided from the restrictions of sections ae a and  of erisa for the acquisition or holding of an offered certificate on behalf of an “excluded plan” by any person who has discretionary authority or renders investment advice with respect to the assets of the excluded plan for purposes of this free writing prospectus an “excluded plan” is an erisa plan sponsored by any member of the restricted group   if certain specific conditions of the exemption are also satisfied the exemption may provide an exemption from the restrictions imposed by sections b and b of erisa and the taxes imposed by section ce of the code in connection with  the direct or indirect sale exchange or transfer of offered certificates in the initial issuance of certificates between the depositor or the underwriters and an erisa plan when the person who has discretionary authority or renders investment advice with respect to the investment of plan assets in those certificates is a a borrower with respect to  or less of the fair market value of the mortgage loans or b an affiliate of that person  the direct or indirect acquisition or disposition in the secondary market of offered certificates by an erisa plan and  the holding of offered certificates by an erisa plan   further if certain specific conditions of the exemption are satisfied the exemption may provide an exemption from the restrictions imposed by sections a b and a of erisa and the taxes imposed by sections a and b of the code by reason of section c of the code for transactions in connection with the servicing management and operation of the pool of mortgage loans   a fiduciary of an erisa plan should consult with its counsel with respect to the applicability of the exemption the fiduciary of a plan not subject to erisa or section  of the code such as a governmental plan should determine the need for and availability of exemptive relief under applicable similar law a purchaser of an offered certificate should be aware however that even if the conditions specified in one or more exemptions are satisfied the scope of relief provided by an exemption may not cover all acts which might be construed as prohibited transactions in particular a plan fiduciary should note that one of the mortgaged properties is located in canada plan fiduciaries should consult with their advisors as to whether the plan could continue to own an interest in the offered certificates if the mortgaged property located in canada were acquired by the trust whether by foreclosure or otherwise   the sale of offered certificates to a plan is in no respect a representation by the depositor or any of the underwriters that this investment meets any relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by plans generally or any particular plan or that this investment is appropriate for plans generally or any particular plan   s     certain legal aspects of

  s     other aspects please see the discussion under “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans” in the prospectus regarding other legal aspects of the mortgage loans that you should consider prior to making any investment in the certificates   legal investment   no class of the offered certificates will constitute “mortgage related securities” for purposes of the secondary mortgage market enhancement act of  as amended the appropriate characterization of the certificates under various legal investment restrictions and thus the ability of investors subject to these restrictions to purchase the offered certificates are subject to significant interpretive uncertainties   no representations are made as to the proper characterization of the offered certificates for legal investment financial institution regulatory or other purposes or as to the ability of particular investors to purchase the offered certificates under applicable legal investment restrictions further any ratings downgrade of a class of certificates to less than an “investment grade” rating ie lower than the top four rating categories by a rating agency or another nrsro whether initially or as a result of a ratings downgrade may adversely affect the ability of an investor to purchase or retain or otherwise impact the regulatory characteristics of that class the uncertainties described above and any unfavorable future determinations concerning the legal investment or financial institution regulatory characteristics of the certificates may adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the certificates   accordingly all investors whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations regulatory capital requirements or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal advisors in determining whether and to what extent the offered certificates will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment capital or other regulatory restrictions see “legal investment” in the prospectus   the issuing entity will be relying on an exclusion or exemption from the definition of “investment company” under the investment company act of  as amended the “investment company act” contained in section c of the investment company act or rule a as a basis for not registering under the investment company act although there may be additional exclusions or exemptions available to the issuing entity the issuing entity was structured so as not to constitute a “covered fund” for purposes of the volcker rule under the

about this identifier prospective investors can go to the website of the applicable rating agency the depositor issuing entity and the underwriters have not verified do not adopt and do not accept responsibility for any statements made by the rating agencies on their internet websites credit ratings referenced throughout this material are forwardlooking opinions about credit risk and express a rating agency’s opinion about the ability of and willingness of an issuer of securities to meet its financial obligations in full and on time ratings are not indications of investment merit and are not buy sell or hold recommendations a measure of asset value or an indication of the suitability of an investment   it is a condition to their issuance that the offered certificates receive investment grade credit ratings from each of the four rating agencies   the ratings address the likelihood of the timely receipt of distributions of interest by the certificateholders to which they are entitled and the ultimate distribution of principal by the rated final distribution date the ratings of the offered certificates should be evaluated independently from similar ratings on other types of securities the ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities a measure of asset value or an indication of the suitability of an investment and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by any rating agency in addition these ratings do not address a the likelihood timing or frequency of prepayments both voluntary and involuntary and their impact on interest payments or the degree to which such prepayments might differ from those originally anticipated b the possibility that a certificateholder might suffer a lower than anticipated yield c the likelihood of receipt of yield maintenance charges prepayment charges prepayment premiums prepayment fees or penalties default interest or postanticipated repayment date additional interest d the likelihood of experiencing any prepayment interest shortfalls an assessment of whether or to what extent the interest payable on any class of offered certificates may be reduced in connection with any prepayment interest shortfalls or of receiving compensating interest payments e the tax treatment of the offered certificates or effect of taxes on the payments received f the likelihood or willingness of the parties to the respective documents to meet their contractual obligations or the likelihood or willingness of any party or court to enforce or hold enforceable the documents in whole or in part g an assessment of the yield to maturity that investors may experience h the likelihood timing or receipt of any payments of interest to the holders of the offered certificates resulting from an increase in the interest rate on any underlying mortgage loan in connection with a mortgage loan modification waiver or amendment i excess interest or j other noncredit risks including without limitation market risks or liquidity   the ratings take into consideration the credit quality of the underlying mortgaged properties and the mortgage loans structural and legal aspects associated with the offered certificates and the extent to which the payment stream of the mortgage loans is adequate to make payments required under the offered certificates however as noted above the ratings do not represent an assessment of the   s     likelihood timing or frequency of principal prepayments both voluntary and involuntary by the borrowers or the degree to which such prepayments might differ from those originally anticipated in general the ratings address credit risk and not prepayment risk ratings are forwardlooking opinions about credit risk and express an agency’s opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer of securities to meet its financial obligations in full and on time ratings are not indications of investment merit in addition the ratings do not represent an assessment of the yield to maturity that investors may experience or the possibility that the certificateholders of the class xa and class xb certificates might not fully recover their initial investment in the event of delinquencies or defaults or rapid prepayments on the mortgage loans including both voluntary and involuntary prepayments or the application of any realized losses in the event that holders of such certificates do not fully recover their investment as a result of rapid principal prepayments on the mortgage loans all amounts “due” to such holders will nevertheless have been paid and such result is consistent with the ratings assigned to such certificates   as indicated in this free writing prospectus holders of the class xa and class xb certificates are entitled only to payments of interest on the related mortgage loans if the mortgage loans were to prepay in the initial month with the result that the holders of the class xa and class xb certificates receive only a single month’s interest and therefore suffer a nearly complete loss of their investment all amounts “due” to such holders will nevertheless have been paid and such result is consistent with the rating received on the class xa and class xb certificates the notional amounts of the class xa and class xb certificates on which interest is calculated may be reduced by the allocation of realized losses and prepayments whether voluntary or involuntary the ratings do not address the timing or magnitude of reductions of such notional amount but only the obligation to pay interest timely on the notional amount as so reduced from time to time therefore the ratings of the class xa and class xb certificates should be evaluated independently from similar ratings on other types of securities   although the depositor will prepay fees for ongoing rating surveillance by certain of the rating agencies the depositor has no obligation or ability to ensure that any rating agency performs ratings surveillance in addition a rating agency may cease ratings surveillance if the information furnished to that rating agency is insufficient to allow it to perform surveillance   additionally other nrsros that we have not engaged to rate the offered certificates may nevertheless issue unsolicited credit ratings on one or more classes of certificates relying on information they receive pursuant to rule g under the securities exchange act of  as amended or otherwise if any such unsolicited ratings are issued we cannot assure you that they will not be different from or lower than any ratings assigned to the offered certificates by any other nrsro the issuance of an unsolicited rating of a class of the offered certificates that is lower than the ratings assigned by the rating agencies engaged by the depositor may adversely impact the liquidity market value and regulatory characteristics of that class   as part of the process of obtaining ratings for the offered certificates the depositor had initial discussions with and submitted certain materials to five  nrsros based on preliminary feedback from those nrsros at that time the depositor selected moody’s fitch dbrs and kbra to rate the offered certificates and not the other nrsro due in part to those nrsros’ initial subordination levels for the various classes of certificates had the depositor selected such other nrsro to rate the offered certificates we cannot assure you as to the ratings that such other nrsro would have ultimately assigned to the offered certificates in addition had the depositor engaged the other nrsro to rate the offered certificates the ratings of those classes of the offered certificates that were not ultimately rated by that rating agency may have been different and potentially lower than the ratings ultimately assigned to the offered certificates although unsolicited ratings may be issued by any nrsro relying on information obtained pursuant to rule g or otherwise an nrsro might be more likely to issue an unsolicited rating if it was not selected after having provided preliminary feedback to the depositor in the case of moody’s and fitch the depositor only requested ratings for certain classes of rated certificates due in part to the final subordination levels provided by moody’s or fitch as applicable for such classes of certificates if the depositor had selected either moody’s or fitch to rate those other classes of rated certificates not rated by it its ratings of those other certificates may have been different and potentially lower than those ratings ultimately assigned to those certificates by dbrs and kbra   s     furthermore the sec may determine that any or all of the rating agencies no longer qualifies as an nrsro or is no longer qualified to rate the offered certificates and that determination may have an adverse effect on the liquidity market value and regulatory characteristics of the offered certificates   s     index of defined terms g

and interest or servicing advances made with respect to a particular mortgage loan will be reimbursable from subsequent recoveries from the related mortgage loan and otherwise to the extent described in this prospectus and in the related prospectus supplement  if provided in the prospectus supplement for a series of certificates any entity making these advances may be entitled to receive interest on those advances while they are outstanding payable from amounts in the related trust fund  if a trust fund includes mortgage participations passthrough certificates or other mortgagebacked securities any comparable advancing obligation will be described in the related prospectus supplement  see “description of the certificates—advances in respect of delinquencies” in this prospectus

name of a nominee of the depository trust company  no person acquiring an interest in a class of bookentry certificates will be entitled to receive definitive certificates of that class in fully registered form except under the limited circumstances described in this prospectus  see “risk factors—bookentry system for certain classes may decrease liquidity and delay payment” and “description of the certificates—bookentry registration and definitive certificates” in this prospectus       material federal income tax       consequences   the federal income tax consequences to certificateholders will vary depending on whether one or more elections are made to treat the trust fund or specified portions of the trust fund as one or more “real estate mortgage investment conduits” each a “remic” or grantor trusts under the provisions of the internal revenue code  the prospectus supplement for each series of certificates will specify whether one or more remic elections will be made  see “material federal income tax consequences” in this prospectus       certain erisa considerations   if you are a fiduciary of any retirement plans or certain other employee benefit plans and arrangements including individual retirement accounts annuities keogh plans and collective investment funds and insurance company general and separate accounts in which those plans accounts annuities or arrangements are invested that are subject to erisa or section  of the internal revenue code you should carefully review with your legal advisors whether the purchase or holding of offered certificates could give rise to a transaction that is prohibited or is not otherwise permissible either under erisa or the internal revenue code  see “certain erisa considerations” in this prospectus and in the related prospectus supplement       legal investment   your offered certificates will constitute “mortgage related securities” for purposes of the secondary mortgage market enhancement act of  as amended only if the related prospectus supplement so provides  if your investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations regulatory capital requirements or review by regulatory authorities then you may be subject to restrictions on investment in the offered certificates  you should consult your own legal advisors for assistance in determining the suitability of and consequences to you of the purchase ownership and sale of the offered certificates  see “legal investment” in this prospectus and in the related prospectus supplement              rating   at their respective dates of issuance each class of offered certificates will be rated at least investment grade by one or more nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  see “rating” in this prospectus and “ratings” in the related prospectus supplement        risk factors   you should carefully consider the following risks and the risks described under “risk factors” in the prospectus supplement for the applicable series of certificates before making an investment decision in particular distributions on your certificates will depend on payments received on and other recoveries with respect to the mortgage loans thus you should carefully consider the risk factors relating to the mortgage loans and the mortgaged properties   your ability to resell certificates may be limited because of their characteristics   we cannot assure you that a secondary market for the certificates will develop or if it does develop that it will provide you with liquidity of investment or will continue for the life of your certificates the prospectus supplement for any series of offered certificates may indicate that an underwriter intends to make a secondary market in those offered certificates however no underwriter will be obligated to do so and may discontinue such a secondary market at any time any resulting secondary market may provide you with less liquidity than any comparable market for certificates that evidence interests in singlefamily mortgage loans   the primary source of ongoing information regarding the offered certificates of any series including information regarding the status of the related mortgage assets and any credit support for your certificates will be the periodic reports delivered to you see “description of the certificates—reports to certificateholders” in this prospectus we cannot assure you that any additional ongoing information regarding your certificates will be available through any other source the limited nature of the available information in respect of a series of offered certificates may adversely affect its liquidity even if a secondary market for those certificates does develop   even if a secondary market does develop with respect to any series or class of certificates the market value of those certificates will be affected by several factors including   · the perceived liquidity of the certificates     · the anticipated cash flow of the certificates which may vary widely depending upon the prepayment and default assumptions applied in respect of the underlying mortgage loans and prevailing interest rates     · the price payable at any given time in respect of certain classes of offered certificates may be extremely sensitive to small fluctuations in prevailing interest rates particularly for a class with a relatively long average life a companion class to a controlled amortization class a class of interestonly certificates or principalonly certificates and     · the relative change in price for an offered certificate in response to an upward or downward movement in prevailing interest rates may not equal the relative change in price for that certificate in response to an equal but opposite movement in those rates accordingly the sale of your certificates in any secondary market that may develop may be at a discount from the price you paid   we are not aware of any source through which price information about the offered certificates will be generally available on an ongoing basis   you will generally have no redemption rights and the certificates of each series will be subject to early retirement only under certain specified circumstances described in this prospectus and in the related prospectus supplement see “description of the certificates—termination” in this prospectus        the assets of the trust fund may not be sufficient to pay your certificates   if not described in the related prospectus supplement   · the certificates of any series and the mortgage assets in the related trust fund will not be guaranteed or insured by the depositor or any of its affiliates by any governmental agency or instrumentality or by any other person or entity and     · the certificates of any series will not represent a claim against or security interest in the trust funds for any other series     accordingly if the related trust fund has insufficient assets to make payments on a series of offered certificates no other assets will be available to make those payments additionally certain amounts on deposit from time to time in certain funds or accounts constituting part of a trust fund may be withdrawn under certain conditions as described in the related prospectus supplement for purposes other than the payment of principal of or interest on the related series of certificates if so provided in the prospectus supplement for a series of certificates consisting of one or more classes of subordinate certificates if losses or shortfalls in collections have occurred with respect to any distribution date all or a portion of the amount of these losses or shortfalls will be borne first by one or more classes of the subordinate certificates and thereafter by the remaining classes of certificates in the priority and manner specified in the prospectus supplement   prepayments of the mortgage assets will affect the timing of your cash flow and may affect your yield   as a result of among other things prepayments on the mortgage loans in any trust fund the amount and timing of distributions of principal andor interest on the offered certificates of the related series may be highly unpredictable prepayments on the mortgage loans in any trust fund will result in a faster rate of principal payments on one or more classes of the related series of certificates than if payments on those mortgage loans were made as scheduled thus the prepayment experience on the mortgage loans in a trust fund may affect the average life of one or more classes of offered certificates of the related series   the rate of principal payments on pools of mortgage loans varies among pools and from time to time is influenced by a variety of economic demographic geographic social tax legal and other factors for example if prevailing interest rates fall significantly below the mortgage interest rates of the mortgage loans included in a trust fund then subject to among other things the particular terms of the mortgage loans and the ability of borrowers to get new financing principal prepayments on those mortgage loans are likely to be higher than if prevailing interest rates remain at or above the rates on those mortgage loans conversely if prevailing interest rates rise significantly above the mortgage interest rates of the mortgage loans included in a trust fund then principal prepayments on those mortgage loans are likely to be lower than if prevailing interest rates remain at or below the rates on those mortgage loans we cannot assure you as to the actual rate of prepayment on the mortgage loans in any trust fund or that the rate of prepayment will conform to any model described in this prospectus or in any prospectus supplement as a result depending on the anticipated rate of prepayment for the mortgage loans in any trust fund the retirement of any class of certificates of the related series could occur significantly earlier or later than expected   the extent to which prepayments on the mortgage loans in any trust fund ultimately affect the average life of your certificates will depend on the terms of your certificates   · a class of certificates that entitles the holders of those certificates to a disproportionately large share of the prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund increases the “call risk” or the likelihood of early retirement of that class if the rate of prepayment is relatively fast and     · a class of certificates that entitles the holders of the certificates to a disproportionately small share of the prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund increases the likelihood            of “extension risk” or an extended average life of that class if the rate of prepayment is relatively slow   as described in the related prospectus supplement the respective entitlements of the various classes of certificate of any series to receive payments especially prepayments of principal of the mortgage loans in the related trust fund may vary based on the occurrence of certain events such as the retirement of one or more classes of certificates of that series or subject to certain contingencies such as the rate of prepayments and defaults with respect to those mortgage loans   a series of certificates may include one or more controlled amortization classes which will entitle you to receive principal distributions according to a specified principal payment schedule although prepayment risk cannot be eliminated entirely for any class of certificates a controlled amortization class will generally provide a relatively stable cash flow so long as the actual rate of prepayment on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund remains relatively constant at the rate or within the range of rates of prepayment used to establish the specific principal payment schedule for those certificates prepayment risk with respect to a given pool of mortgage assets does not disappear however and the stability afforded to a controlled amortization class comes at the expense of one or more companion classes of the same series any of which companion classes may also be a class of offered certificates in general and as more specifically described in the related prospectus supplement a companion class may entitle you to a disproportionately large share of prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund when the rate of prepayment is relatively fast or may entitle you to a disproportionately small share of prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund when the rate of prepayment is relatively slow as described in the related prospectus supplement a companion class absorbs some but not all of the “call risk” andor “extension risk” that would otherwise belong to the related controlled amortization class if all payments of principal of the mortgage loans in the related trust fund were allocated on a pro rata basis   a series of certificates may include one or more classes of offered certificates offered at a premium or discount yields on those classes of certificates will be sensitive and in some cases extremely sensitive to prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund where the amount of interest payable with respect to a class is disproportionately large as compared to the amount of principal as with certain classes of interestonly certificates you might fail to recover your original investment under some prepayment scenarios the extent to which the yield to maturity of any class of offered certificates may vary from the anticipated yield will depend upon the degree to which they are purchased at a discount or premium and the amount and timing of distributions on those certificates you should consider in the case of any offered certificate purchased at a discount the risk that a slower than anticipated rate of principal payments on the mortgage loans could result in an actual yield that is lower than the anticipated yield and in the case of any offered certificate purchased at a premium the risk that a faster than anticipated rate of principal payments could result in an actual yield that is lower than the anticipated yield see “yield and maturity considerations” in this prospectus   ratings do not guarantee payment and do not address prepayment risks   any rating assigned to a class of offered certificates by a rating agency will only reflect its assessment of the probability that you will receive payments to which you are entitled this rating will not constitute an assessment of the probability that   · principal prepayments on the related mortgage loans will be made     · the degree to which the rate of prepayments might differ from the rate of prepayments that was originally anticipated or     · the likelihood of early optional termination of the related trust fund   furthermore the rating will not address the possibility that prepayment of the related mortgage loans at a higher or lower rate than you anticipated may cause you to experience a lower than anticipated yield        or that if you purchase a certificate at a significant premium you might fail to recover your initial investment under certain prepayment scenarios   the amount type and nature of credit support if any provided with respect to a series of certificates will be determined on the basis of criteria established by each rating agency rating classes of the certificates of that series these criteria are sometimes based upon analysis of the behavior of mortgage loans in a larger group however we cannot assure you that the historical data supporting that analysis will accurately reflect future experience or that the data derived from a large pool of mortgage loans will accurately predict the delinquency foreclosure or loss experience of any particular pool of mortgage loans in other cases the criteria may be based upon determinations of the values of the mortgaged properties that provide security for the mortgage loans in the related trust fund however we cannot assure you that those values will not decline in the future see “description of credit support” and “rating” in this prospectus   if one or more of the rating agencies downgrade suspend or withdraw a rating of a class of your offered certificates those certificates will decrease in value and the liquidity and regulatory characteristics of such certificates may also be adversely affected because neither we nor the issuing entity the trustee the master servicer the special servicer any originator any seller or any other party to the related pooling and servicing agreement will have any obligation to maintain a rating on a class of offered certificates you will have no recourse if your offered certificates decrease in value by reason of a downgrade suspension or withdrawal of a rating in addition pursuant to rule g under the securities exchange act of  as amended an issuer underwriter or sponsor that retains a rating agency is required to make all information provided to the retained rating agency available to nonretained rating agencies those rating agencies may issue their own ratings of the certificates in reliance on that information or otherwise which ratings may be higher or lower than the ratings issued by the retained rating agencies if a nonretained rating agency issues a rating for a class of offered certificates that is lower than the rating issued by a retained rating agency that may have an adverse effect on the liquidity market value and regulatory characteristics of such class   commercial and multifamily mortgage loans have risks that may affect payments on your certificates   a description of risks associated with investments in mortgage loans is included under “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans” in this prospectus commercial and multifamily lending are generally thought to expose the lender to a greater risk of loss than one to four family residential lending commercial and multifamily lending typically involves larger loans to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers than residential one to four family mortgage loans further the repayment of loans secured by income producing properties is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project see “description of the trust funds—mortgage loans—default and loss considerations with respect to the mortgage loans” in this prospectus if the cash flow from the project is reduced for example if leases are not obtained or renewed or rental hotel room or occupancy rates decline or real estate tax rates or other operating expenses increase the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired commercial and multifamily real estate can be affected significantly by the supply and demand in the market for the type of property securing the loan and therefore may be subject to adverse economic conditions market values may vary as a result of economic events or governmental regulations outside the control of the borrower or lender that impact the cash flow of the property for example some laws such as the americans with disabilities act may require modifications to properties and rent control laws may limit rent collections in the case of multifamily properties a number of the mortgage loans may be secured by liens on owner occupied mortgaged properties or on mortgaged properties leased to a single tenant or a small number of significant tenants accordingly a decline in the financial condition of the borrower or a significant tenant as applicable may have a disproportionately greater effect on the net operating income from those mortgaged properties than would be the case with respect to mortgaged properties with multiple tenants        the net operating incomes and property values of the mortgaged properties may be adversely affected by a large number of factors some of these factors relate to the properties themselves such as   · the age design and construction quality of the properties     · perceptions regarding the safety convenience and attractiveness of the properties     · the characteristics of the neighborhood where the property is located     · the proximity and attractiveness of competing properties     · the adequacy of the property’s management and maintenance     · increases in interest rates real estate taxes and other operating expenses at the mortgaged property and in relation to competing properties     · an increase in the capital expenditures needed to maintain the properties or make improvements     · dependence upon a single tenant or a concentration of tenants in a particular business or industry     · a decline in the financial condition of a major tenant     · an increase in vacancy rates and     · a decline in rental rates as leases are renewed or entered into with new tenants   other factors are more general in nature such as   · national regional or local economic conditions including plant closings military base closings industry slowdowns and unemployment rates     · local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of retail space office space multifamily housing or hotel capacity     · demographic factors     · consumer confidence     · consumer tastes and preferences     · retroactive changes in building codes     · changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments and     · the public perception of safety for customers and clients   the volatility of net operating income will be influenced by many of the foregoing factors as well as by   · the length of tenant leases     · the creditworthiness of tenants     · tenant defaults     · in the case of rental properties the rate at which new rentals occur and        · the property’s “operating leverage” which is generally the percentage of total property expenses in relation to revenue the ratio of fixed operating expenses to those that vary with revenues and the level of capital expenditures required to maintain the property and to retain or replace tenants   a decline in the real estate market or in the financial condition of a major tenant will tend to have a more immediate effect on the net operating income of properties with shortterm revenue sources such as shortterm or month to month leases and may lead to higher rates of delinquency or defaults   furthermore the value of any mortgaged property may be adversely affected by risks generally incident to interests in real property including   · changes in general or local economic conditions andor specific industry segments     · declines in real estate values     · declines in rental or occupancy rates     · increases in interest rates real estate tax rates and other operating expenses     · changes in governmental rules regulations and fiscal policies including environmental legislation     · acts of god and     · other factors beyond the control of a master servicer or special servicer   the type and use of a particular mortgaged property may present additional risk for instance   · mortgaged properties that operate as hospitals and nursing homes may present special risks to lenders due to the significant governmental regulation of the ownership operation maintenance and financing of health care institutions     · hotel and motel properties are often operated pursuant to franchise management or operating agreements that may be terminable by the franchisor or operator moreover the transferability of a hotel’s operating liquor and other licenses upon a transfer of the hotel whether through purchase or foreclosure is subject to local law requirements     · the ability of a borrower to repay a mortgage loan secured by shares allocable to one or more cooperative dwelling units may depend on the ability of the dwelling units to generate sufficient rental income which may be subject to rent control or stabilization laws to cover both debt service on the loan as well as maintenance charges to the cooperative further a mortgage loan secured by cooperative shares is subordinate to the mortgage if any on the cooperative apartment building   the economic performance of mortgage loans that are secured by full service hotels limited service hotels hotels associated with national franchise chains hotels associated with regional franchise chains and hotels that are not affiliated with any franchise chain but may have their own brand identity are affected by various factors including   · adverse economic and social conditions either local regional or national which may limit the amount that can be charged for a room and reduce occupancy levels     · construction of competing hotels or resorts     · continuing expenditures for modernizing refurbishing and maintaining existing facilities prior to the expiration of their anticipated useful lives        · deterioration in the financial strength or managerial capabilities of the owner and operator of a hotel and     · changes in travel patterns caused by changes in access energy prices strikes relocation of highways the construction of additional highways or other factors   additionally the hotel and lodging industry is generally seasonal in nature and this seasonality can be expected to cause periodic fluctuations in room and other revenues occupancy levels room rates and operating expenses the demand for particular accommodations may also be affected by changes in travel patterns caused by changes in energy prices strikes relocation of highways the construction of additional highways and other factors   the viability of any hotel property that is the franchisee of a national or regional chain depends in part on the continued existence and financial strength of the franchisor the public perception of the franchise service mark and the duration of the franchise licensing agreements the transferability of franchise license agreements may be restricted and in the event of a foreclosure on that hotel property the property would not have the right to use the franchise license without the franchisor’s consent conversely a lender may be unable to remove a franchisor that it desires to replace following a foreclosure further in the event of a foreclosure on a hotel property it is unlikely that the trustee or servicer or special servicer or purchaser of that hotel property would be entitled to the rights under any existing liquor license for that hotel property it is more likely that those persons would have to apply for new licenses we cannot assure you that a new license could be obtained or that it could be obtained promptly   other multifamily properties hotels retail properties office buildings mobile home parks and manufactured housing communities nursing homes and selfstorage facilities located in the areas of the mortgaged properties compete with the mortgaged properties to attract residents and customers the leasing of real estate is highly competitive the principal means of competition are price location and the nature and condition of the facility to be leased a borrower under a mortgage loan competes with all lessors and developers of comparable types of real estate in the area in which the mortgaged property is located those lessors or developers could have lower rentals lower operating costs more favorable locations or better facilities while a borrower under a mortgage loan may renovate refurbish or expand the mortgaged property to maintain it and remain competitive that renovation refurbishment or expansion may itself entail significant risk increased competition could adversely affect income from and market value of the mortgaged properties in addition the business conducted at each mortgaged property may face competition from other industries and industry segments   selfstorage properties are considered vulnerable to competition because both acquisition costs and breakeven occupancy are relatively low the conversion of selfstorage facilities to alternative uses would generally require substantial capital expenditures thus if the operation of any of the selfstorage mortgaged properties becomes unprofitable due to decreased demand competition age of improvements or other factors such that the borrower becomes unable to meet its obligations on the related mortgage loan the liquidation value of that selfstorage mortgaged property may be substantially less relative to the amount owing on the mortgage loan than would be the case if the selfstorage mortgaged property were readily adaptable to other uses tenant privacy and lack of efficient access may heighten environmental risks   it is anticipated that some or all of the mortgage loans included in any trust fund will be nonrecourse loans or loans for which recourse may be restricted or unenforceable as to that mortgage loan recourse in the event of borrower default will be limited to the specific real property and other assets if any that were pledged to secure the mortgage loan however even with respect to those mortgage loans that provide for recourse against the borrower and its assets generally we cannot assure you that enforcement of those recourse provisions will be practicable or that the assets of the borrower will be sufficient to permit a recovery in respect of a defaulted mortgage loan in excess of the liquidation value of the related mortgaged property see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—foreclosure” in this prospectus        further the concentration of default foreclosure and loss risks in individual mortgage loans in a particular trust fund will generally be greater than for pools of singlefamily loans because mortgage loans in a trust fund will generally consist of a smaller number of higher balance loans than would a pool of singlefamily loans of comparable aggregate unpaid principal balance   the borrower’s form of entity may cause special risks   most of the borrowers are legal entities rather than individuals mortgage loans made to legal entities may entail risks of loss greater than those of mortgage loans made to individuals for example a legal entity as opposed to an individual may be more inclined to seek legal protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy laws unlike individuals involved in bankruptcies most of the entities generally but not in all cases do not have personal assets and creditworthiness at stake the terms of the mortgage loans generally but not in all cases require that the borrowers covenant to be singlepurpose entities although in many cases the borrowers are not required to observe all covenants and conditions that typically are required in order for them to be viewed under standard rating agency criteria as “special purpose entities” in general but not in all cases borrowers’ organizational documents or the terms of the mortgage loans limit their activities to the ownership of only the related mortgaged property or properties and limit the borrowers’ ability to incur additional indebtedness and create or allow any encumbrance on the mortgaged properties to secure additional indebtedness or obligations of other entities these provisions are designed to mitigate the possibility that the borrowers’ financial condition would be adversely impacted by factors unrelated to the mortgaged property and the mortgage loan in the pool however we cannot assure you that the related borrowers will comply with these requirements also although a borrower may currently be a single purpose entity that borrower may have previously owned property other than the related mortgaged property and may not have observed all covenants that typically are required to consider a borrower a “single purpose entity” the bankruptcy of a borrower or a general partner or managing member of a borrower may impair the ability of the lender to enforce its rights and remedies under the related mortgage borrowers that are not special purpose entities structured to limit the possibility of becoming insolvent or bankrupt may be more likely to become insolvent or the subject of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding because the borrowers may be   · operating entities with a business distinct from the operation of the mortgaged property with the associated liabilities and risks of operating an ongoing business or     · entities or individuals that have liabilities unrelated to the mortgaged property   however any borrower even a special purpose entity structured to be bankruptcyremote as an owner of real estate will be subject to certain potential liabilities and risks we cannot assure you that any borrower will not file for bankruptcy protection or that creditors of a borrower or a corporate or individual general partner or managing member of a borrower will not initiate a bankruptcy or similar proceeding against the borrower or corporate or individual general partner or managing member of the borrower   the organizational documents of a borrower may also contain requirements that there be one or two independent directors managers or trustees depending on the entity form of such borrower whose vote is required before the borrower files a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency petition or otherwise institutes insolvency proceedings generally but not always the independent directors managers or trustees may only be replaced by certain other independent successors although the requirement of having independent directors managers or trustees is designed to mitigate the risk of a voluntary bankruptcy filing by a solvent borrower the independent directors managers or trustees may determine in the exercise of their fiduciary duties to the applicable borrower that a bankruptcy filing is an appropriate course of action to be taken by such borrower such determination might take into account the interests and financial condition of such borrower’s parent entities and such parent entities’ other subsidiaries in addition to those of the borrower such that the financial distress of an affiliate of a borrower might increase the likelihood of a bankruptcy filing by a borrower in any event we cannot assure you that a borrower will not file for bankruptcy protection or that creditors of a borrower will not initiate a bankruptcy or similar proceeding against such borrower        furthermore with respect to any affiliated borrowers creditors of a common parent in bankruptcy may seek to consolidate the assets of those borrowers with those of the parent consolidation of the assets of the borrowers would likely have an adverse effect on the funds available to make distributions on your certificates and may lead to a downgrade withdrawal or qualification of the ratings of your certificates see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—bankruptcy laws” in this prospectus   ability to incur other borrowings entails risk   when a mortgage loan borrower or its constituent members also has one or more other outstanding loans even if they are subordinated or mezzanine loans the trust is subjected to additional risk the borrower may have difficulty servicing and repaying multiple loans the existence of another loan generally also will make it more difficult for the borrower to obtain refinancing of its mortgage loan and may thereby jeopardize repayment of the mortgage loan moreover the need to service additional debt may reduce the cash flow available to the borrower to operate and maintain the mortgaged property   additionally if a borrower or its constituent members defaults on its mortgage loan andor any other loan actions taken by other lenders such as a foreclosure or an involuntary petition for bankruptcy against the borrower could impair the security available to the trust including the mortgaged property or stay the trust’s ability to foreclose during the course of the bankruptcy case the bankruptcy of another lender also may operate to stay foreclosure by the trust the trust may also be subject to the costs and administrative burdens of involvement in foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings or related litigation   in this regard the mortgage loans generally prohibit borrowers from incurring any additional debt secured by their mortgaged property without the consent of the lender however no investigations searches or inquiries to determine the existence or status of any subordinate secured financing with respect to any of the mortgaged properties have been made at any time since origination of the related mortgage loan we cannot assure you that any of the borrowers have complied with the restrictions on indebtedness in the related mortgage loan documents   the mortgage loans will generally permit the related borrower to incur limited indebtedness in the ordinary course of business that is not secured by the related mortgaged property in addition the borrowers under certain of the mortgage loans have incurred andor may incur in the future unsecured debt other than in the ordinary course of business   additionally the terms of certain mortgage loans may permit or require the borrowers to post letters of credit andor surety bonds for the benefit of the related mortgage loan which may constitute a contingent reimbursement obligation of the related borrower or an affiliate the issuing bank or surety will not typically agree to subordination and standstill protection benefiting the mortgagee   the mortgage loan documents generally place certain restrictions on the transfer andor pledging of general partnership and managing member equity interests in a borrower such as specific percentage or control limitations the terms of the mortgage loans generally permit subject to certain limitations the transfer or pledge of less than a controlling portion of the limited partnership or nonmanaging member equity or other interests in a borrower certain of the mortgage loans do not restrict the pledging of ownership interests in the related borrower but do restrict the transfer of ownership interests in the related borrower by imposing a specific percentage or control limitation or requiring the consent of the mortgagee to any such transfer which consent in certain instances would consist of the mortgagee ascertaining that certain specific transfer conditions have been satisfied moreover in general mortgage loans with borrowers that do not meet single purpose entity criteria may not restrict in any way the incurrence by the relevant borrower of mezzanine debt see “—the borrower’s form of entity may cause special risks” above and “risk factors—the borrower’s form of entity may cause special risks” in the prospectus supplement certain of the mortgage loans permit mezzanine debt secured by pledges of ownership interests in the borrower to be incurred in the future subject to criteria set forth in the mortgage loan documents   mezzanine debt is debt that is incurred by the owner of equity in one or more borrowers and is secured by a pledge of the equity ownership interests in such borrowers because mezzanine debt is        secured by the obligor’s equity interest in the related borrowers such financing effectively reduces the obligor’s economic stake in the related mortgaged property the existence of mezzanine debt may reduce cash flow on the borrower’s mortgaged property after the payment of debt service or result in liquidity pressures if the mezzanine debt matures or becomes payable prior to the maturity of the mortgage loan and may thus increase the likelihood that the owner of a borrower will permit the value or income producing potential of a mortgaged property to fall and may create a greater risk that a borrower will default on the mortgage loan secured by a mortgaged property whose value or income is relatively weak in addition the current and any future mezzanine lender may have cure rights with respect to the related mortgage loan andor an option to purchase the mortgage loan after a default pursuant to an intercreditor agreement   generally upon a default under mezzanine debt the holder of such mezzanine debt would be entitled to foreclose upon the equity in the related borrower which has been pledged to secure payment of such mezzanine debt if permitted pursuant to the terms of the related intercreditor agreement and provided that foreclosure is not stayed by the commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding involving the mezzanine borrowers see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—bankruptcy laws” in this prospectus although such transfer of equity may not trigger the due on sale clause under the related mortgage loan it could cause a change of control in the borrower andor cause the obligor under such mezzanine debt to file for bankruptcy which could negatively affect the operation of the related mortgaged property and such borrower’s ability to make payments on the related mortgage loan in a timely manner   in addition borrowers under certain of the mortgage loans have issued or are permitted to issue preferred equity in such borrowers preferred equity in a borrower will generally require such borrower to make certain specified dividend payments to the preferred equity holder on a preferred basis since a borrower’s assets are generally limited to its mortgaged property any preferred equity in the borrower effectively reduces the borrower’s economic stake in the related mortgaged property the existence of preferred equity may reduce cash flow on the borrower’s mortgaged property after payment of debt service on the mortgage loans and any mezzanine loans and may thus increase the likelihood that a borrower will permit the value or income producing potential of a mortgaged property to fall and may create a greater risk that a borrower will default on a mortgage loan secured by a mortgaged property whose value or income is relatively weak   see “description of the mortgage pool—general” in the prospectus supplement and “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—subordinate financing” in this prospectus   borrowers may be unable to make balloon payments   certain of the mortgage loans included in a trust fund may be nonamortizing or only partially amortizing over their terms to maturity and thus will require substantial principal payments that is balloon payments at their stated maturity in addition fully amortizing mortgage loans which may pay interest on an “actual” basis but have fixed monthly payments may in effect have a small balloon payment due at maturity   mortgage loans of this type involve a greater degree of risk than selfamortizing mortgage loans because the ability of a borrower to make a balloon payment typically will depend upon its ability either to refinance the mortgage loan or to sell the related mortgaged property a borrower’s ability to repay a mortgage loan on its stated maturity date or anticipated repayment date typically will depend upon its ability either to refinance the mortgage loan or to sell the mortgaged property at a price sufficient to permit repayment a borrower’s ability to achieve either of these goals will be affected by a number of factors including   · the fair market value of the related mortgaged property     · the level of available mortgage interest rates at the time of sale or refinancing     · the borrower’s equity in the related mortgaged property        · the borrower’s financial condition     · the operating history and occupancy level of the related mortgaged property     · tax laws     · reductions in government assistancerent subsidy programs     · medicaid and medicare reimbursement rates with respect to hospitals and nursing homes     · prevailing general and regional economic conditions and     · the availability of and competition for credit for loans secured by multifamily or commercial real properties generally   we cannot assure you that each borrower will have the ability to repay the remaining principal balances on the related maturity date   neither the depositor nor any of its affiliates will be required to refinance any mortgage loan   if described in this prospectus and in the related prospectus supplement to maximize recoveries on defaulted mortgage loans the master servicer or a special servicer may within prescribed limits extend and modify mortgage loans that are in default or as to which a payment default is reasonably foreseeable while a master servicer or a special servicer generally will be required to determine that any extension or modification is reasonably likely to produce a greater recovery taking into account the time value of money than liquidation we cannot assure you that any extension or modification will in fact increase the present value of receipts from or proceeds of the affected mortgage loans   credit support may not cover losses   the prospectus supplement for a series of certificates will describe any credit support provided for those certificates any use of credit support will be subject to the conditions and limitations described in this prospectus and in the related prospectus supplement and may not cover all potential losses or risks for example it may or may not cover fraud or negligence by a mortgage loan originator or other parties   a series of certificates may include one or more classes of subordinate certificates if so provided in the related prospectus supplement although subordination is intended to reduce the risk to holders of senior certificates of delinquent distributions or ultimate losses the amount of subordination will be limited and may decline under certain circumstances described in the related prospectus supplement in addition if principal payments on one or more classes of certificates of a series are made in a specified order of priority any limits with respect to the aggregate amount of claims under any related credit support may be exhausted before the principal of the later paid classes of certificates of that series has been repaid in full as a result the impact of losses and shortfalls experienced with respect to the mortgage assets may fall primarily upon those subordinate classes of certificates moreover if a form of credit support covers more than one series of certificates holders of certificates of one series will be subject to the risk that the credit support will be exhausted by the claims of the holders of certificates of one or more other series   the amount of any applicable credit support supporting one or more classes of offered certificates including the subordination of one or more classes of certificates will be determined on the basis of criteria established by each rating agency rating those classes of certificates such criteria will be based on an assumed level of defaults delinquencies and losses on the underlying mortgage assets and certain other factors however we cannot assure you that the default delinquency or loss experience on the related mortgage assets will not exceed the assumed levels see “—ratings do not guarantee payment and do not address prepayment risks” “description of the certificates” and “description of credit support” in this prospectus        tenant concentration entails risk   a deterioration in the financial condition of a tenant can be particularly significant if a mortgaged property is wholly or significantly owner–occupied or leased to a single tenant or if any tenant makes up a significant portion of the rental income mortgaged properties that are wholly or significantly owner occupied or leased to a single tenant or tenants that make up a significant portion of the rental income also are more susceptible to interruptions of cash flow if the owner occupier’s business operations are negatively impacted or if such a tenant fails to renew its lease this is so because the financial effect of the absence of operating income or rental income may be severe more time may be required to release the space and substantial capital costs may be incurred to make the space appropriate for replacement tenants   retail and office properties also may be adversely affected if there is a concentration of particular tenants among the mortgaged properties or of tenants in a particular business or industry   certain additional risks relating to tenants   the income from and market value of the mortgaged properties leased to various tenants would be adversely affected if   ·     space in the mortgaged properties could not be leased or released   ·     leasing or releasing is restricted by exclusive rights of tenants to lease the mortgaged properties or other covenants not to lease space for certain uses or activities or covenants limiting the types of tenants to which space may be leased   ·     substantial releasing costs were required andor the cost of performing landlord obligations under existing leases materially increased   ·     tenants were unwilling or unable to meet their lease obligations   ·     a significant tenant were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case   ·     a borrower fails to perform its obligations under a lease resulting in the related tenant having a right to terminate such lease or   ·     rental payments could not be collected for any other reason   repayment of the mortgage loans secured by retail office and industrial properties will be affected by the expiration of leases and the ability of the respective borrowers to renew the leases or relet the space on comparable terms and on a timely basis certain of the mortgaged properties may be leased in whole or in part by government sponsored tenants who have the right to rent reductions or to cancel their leases at any time or for lack of appropriations additionally mortgaged properties may have concentrations of leases expiring at varying rates in varying percentages   in addition certain properties may have tenants that are paying rent but are not in occupancy or may have vacant space that is not leased and in certain cases the occupancy percentage could be less than  any such “dark” space may cause the property to be less desirable to other potential tenants and the related tenant may be more likely to default in its obligations under the lease we cannot assure you that those tenants will continue to fulfill their lease obligations or that the space will be relet additionally certain tenants may have a right to a rent abatement or the right to cancel their lease if certain major tenants at the mortgaged property vacate or go dark   even if vacated space is successfully relet the costs associated with reletting including tenant improvements and leasing commissions could be substantial and could reduce cash flow from the mortgaged properties moreover if a tenant defaults in its obligations to a borrower the borrower may incur substantial costs and experience significant delays associated with enforcing its rights and        protecting its investment including costs incurred in renovating and reletting the related mortgaged property   additionally in certain jurisdictions if tenant leases are subordinated to the liens created by the mortgage but do not contain attornment provisions provisions requiring the tenant to recognize as landlord under the lease a successor owner following foreclosure the leases may terminate upon the transfer of the property to a foreclosing lender or purchaser at foreclosure accordingly if a mortgaged property is located in such a jurisdiction and is leased to one or more desirable tenants under leases that are subordinate to the mortgage and do not contain attornment provisions such mortgaged property could experience a further decline in value if such tenants’ leases were terminated   mortgaged properties leased to multiple tenants also have risks   if a mortgaged property has multiple tenants releasing expenditures may be more frequent than in the case of mortgaged properties with fewer tenants thereby reducing the cash flow available for debt service payments multitenant mortgaged properties also may experience higher continuing vacancy rates and greater volatility in rental income and expenses   mortgaged properties leased to borrowers or borrower affiliated entities also have risks   if a mortgaged property is leased in whole or substantial part to the borrower under the mortgage loan or to an affiliate of the borrower there may be conflicts for instance it is more likely a landlord will waive lease conditions for an affiliated tenant than it would for an unaffiliated tenant we cannot assure you that the conflicts arising where a borrower is affiliated with a tenant at a mortgaged property will not adversely impact the value of the related mortgage loan in some cases this affiliated lessee is physically occupying space related to its business in other cases the affiliated lessee is a tenant under a master lease with the borrower under which the tenant is obligated to make rent payments but does not occupy any space at the mortgaged property these master leases are typically used to bring occupancy to a “stabilized” level but may not provide additional economic support for the mortgage loan we cannot assure you that the space “leased” by a borrower affiliate will eventually be occupied by third party tenants and consequently a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or its affiliates can be particularly significant to the borrower’s ability to perform under the mortgage loan as it can directly interrupt the cash flow from the mortgaged property if the borrower’s or its affiliate’s financial condition worsens these risks may be mitigated when mortgaged properties are leased to unrelated third parties   tenant bankruptcy entails risks   the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant or a number of smaller tenants in retail office and industrial properties may adversely affect the income produced by a mortgaged property under the federal bankruptcy code a tenant has the option of assuming or rejecting or subject to certain conditions assuming and assigning to a third party any unexpired lease if the tenant assumes its lease the tenant must cure all defaults under the lease and provide the landlord with adequate assurance of its future performance under the lease if the tenant rejects the lease the landlord’s claim for breach of the lease would be treated as a general unsecured claim against the tenant absent collateral securing the claim in addition a lessor’s damages for lease rejection are limited to the amount owed for the unpaid rent reserved under the lease for the periods prior to the bankruptcy petition or earlier surrender of the leased premises which are unrelated to the rejection plus the greater of one year’s rent or  of the remaining rent reserved under the lease but not to exceed three years’ rent if the tenant assigns its lease the tenant must cure all defaults under the lease and the proposed assignee must demonstrate adequate assurance of future performance under the lease certain of the tenants may be and may at any time during the term of the related mortgage loan become a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding   we cannot assure you that tenants of mortgaged properties will continue making payments under their leases or that tenants will not file for bankruptcy protection in the future or if any tenants so file that they will continue to make rental payments in a timely manner        if the leased premises are located in a “shopping center” as such term has been interpreted under section  of the federal bankruptcy code the assignee may be required to agree to certain conditions that are protective of the property owner such as compliance with specific lease terms relating to among other things exclusivity and the terms of reciprocal easement agreements however we cannot assure you that any mortgaged property would be considered a shopping center by a court considering the question   assignment of leases and rents may be limited by state law   each mortgage loan included in any trust fund secured by mortgaged property that is subject to leases typically will be secured by an assignment of leases and rents pursuant to which the borrower or with respect to any indemnity deed of trust structure the related property owner assigns to the lender its right title and interest as landlord under the leases of the related mortgaged property and the income derived from those leases as further security for the related mortgage loan while retaining a license to collect rents for so long as there is no default if the borrower defaults the license terminates and the lender is entitled to collect rents some state laws may require that the lender take possession of the mortgaged property and obtain a judicial appointment of a receiver before becoming entitled to collect the rents in addition if bankruptcy or similar proceedings are commenced by or in respect of the borrower the lender’s ability to collect the rents may be adversely affected see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—leases and rents” in this prospectus   failure to comply with environmental law may result in additional losses   under federal law and the laws of certain states contamination of real property may give rise to a lien on the property to assure or reimburse the costs of cleanup in several states that lien has priority over an existing mortgage lien on that property in addition under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances or toxic substances on in or beneath the property this liability may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of those hazardous or toxic substances the costs of any required remediation and the owner’s or operator’s liability for them as to any property are generally not limited under these laws ordinances and regulations and could exceed the value of the mortgaged property and the aggregate assets of the owner or operator in addition as to the owners or operators of mortgaged properties that generate hazardous substances that are disposed of at “offsite” locations the owners or operators may be held strictly jointly and severally liable if there are releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at the offsite locations where that person’s hazardous substances were disposed   under some environmental laws such as the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended as well as some state laws a secured lender such as the trust may be liable as an “owner” or “operator” for the costs of dealing with hazardous substances affecting a borrower’s or neighboring property if agents or employees of the lender have participated in the management of the borrower’s property this liability could exist even if a previous owner caused the environmental damage the trust’s potential exposure to liability for cleanup costs may increase if the trust actually takes possession of a borrower’s property or control of its daytoday operations as for example through the appointment of a receiver see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—environmental risks” in this prospectus   hazard insurance may be insufficient to cover all losses on mortgaged properties   the master servicer for the related trust fund will generally be required to cause the borrower on each mortgage loan in that trust fund to maintain the insurance coverage in respect of the related mortgaged property required under the related mortgage including hazard insurance the master servicer may satisfy its obligation to cause hazard insurance to be maintained with respect to any mortgaged property through acquisition of a blanket policy however we cannot assure you that the amount of insurance maintained will be sufficient to insure against all losses on the mortgaged properties        in general the standard form of fire and extended coverage policy covers physical damage to or destruction of the improvements of the mortgaged property by   · fire     · lightning     · explosion     · smoke     · windstorm and hail and     · riot strike and civil commotion   each subject to the conditions and exclusions specified in each policy   the policies covering the mortgaged properties will be underwritten by different insurers under different state laws and therefore will not contain identical terms and conditions however most policies do not typically cover any physical damage resulting from war revolution governmental actions floods and other waterrelated causes earth movement including earthquakes landslides and mudflows wet or dry rot vermin domestic animals and certain other kinds of risks unless the related mortgage specifically requires the mortgagor to insure against physical damage arising from those causes those losses may be borne at least in part by the holders of one or more classes of offered certificates of the related series to the extent they are not covered by any available credit support see “description of the pooling agreements—hazard insurance policies” in this prospectus   poor property management may adversely affect the performance of the related mortgaged property   the successful operation of a real estate project also depends upon the performance and viability of the property manager properties deriving revenues primarily from shortterm sources generally are more management intensive than properties leased to creditworthy tenants under longterm leases the property manager is generally responsible for   · operating the properties     · providing building services     · establishing and implementing the rental structure     · managing operating expenses     · responding to changes in the local market and     · assuring that maintenance and capital improvements are carried out in a timely fashion   property managers may not be in a financial condition to fulfill their management responsibilities   certain of the mortgaged properties are managed by affiliates of the applicable mortgagor if a mortgage loan is in default or undergoing special servicing such relationship could disrupt the management of the underlying property this may adversely affect cash flow however the mortgage loans may permit the lender to remove the property manager upon the occurrence of an event of default a decline in cash flow below a specified level or the failure to satisfy some other specified performance trigger        we make no representation or warranty as to the skills of any present or future managers in many cases the property manager is an affiliate of the borrower and may not manage properties for nonaffiliates additionally we cannot assure you that the property managers will be in a financial condition to fulfill their management responsibilities throughout the terms of their respective management agreements   property value may be adversely affected even when current operating income is not   various factors may adversely affect the value of a mortgaged property without affecting the property’s current net operating income these factors include among others   · the existence of or changes in governmental regulations fiscal policy zoning or tax laws     · potential environmental legislation or liabilities or other legal liabilities     · the availability of refinancing and     · changes in interest rate levels   mortgage loans secured by leasehold interests may expose investors to greater risks of default and loss   leasehold mortgage loans are subject to certain risks not associated with mortgage loans secured by a lien on the fee estate of the borrower the most significant of these risks is that if the related borrower’s leasehold were to be terminated upon a lease default the lender would lose its security in the leasehold interest generally each related ground lease requires the lessor to give the lender notice of the borrower’s defaults under the ground lease and an opportunity to cure them permits the leasehold interest to be assigned to the lender or the purchaser at a foreclosure sale in some cases only upon the consent of the lessor and contains certain other protective provisions typically included in a “mortgageable” ground lease   upon the bankruptcy of a lessor or a lessee under a ground lease the debtor has the right to assume or reject the lease if a debtor lessor rejects the lease the lessee has the right pursuant to section h of the federal bankruptcy code to remain in possession of its leased premises for the rent otherwise payable under the lease for the term of the ground lease including renewals and to offset against such rent any damages incurred due to the landlord’s failure to perform its obligations under the lease if a debtor lesseeborrower rejects the lease the leasehold lender could succeed to the lesseeborrower’s position under the lease only if the lease specifically grants the lender such right if both the lessor and the lesseeborrower are involved in bankruptcy proceedings the trustee may be unable to enforce the bankrupt lesseeborrower’s right to refuse to treat a ground lease rejected by a bankrupt lessor as terminated in such circumstances a ground lease could be terminated notwithstanding lender protection provisions contained in the ground lease or in the mortgage   some of the ground leases securing the mortgaged properties may provide that the ground rent payable under the related ground lease increases during the term of the mortgage loan these increases may adversely affect the cash flow and net income of the related borrower   a leasehold lender could lose its security unless the leasehold lender holds a fee mortgage the ground lease requires the lessor to enter into a new lease with the leasehold lender upon termination or rejection of the ground lease or the bankruptcy court as a court of equity allows the leasehold lender to assume the ground lessee’s obligations under the ground lease and succeed to the ground lessee’s position although not directly covered by the  amendments to the federal bankruptcy code such a result would be consistent with the purpose of the  amendments to the federal bankruptcy code granting the holders of leasehold mortgages permitted under the terms of the lease the right to succeed to the position of a leasehold mortgagor although consistent with the federal bankruptcy code such position may not be adopted by the applicable bankruptcy court        further in a decision by the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit precision indus v qualitech steel sbq llc  fd  th cir  the court ruled with respect to an unrecorded lease of real property that where a statutory sale of the fee interest in leased property occurs under section f of the federal bankruptcy code  usc section f upon the bankruptcy of a landlord such sale terminates a lessee’s possessory interest in the property and the purchaser assumes title free and clear of any interest including any leasehold estates pursuant to section e of the federal bankruptcy code  usc section e a lessee may request the bankruptcy court to prohibit or condition the statutory sale of the property so as to provide adequate protection of the leasehold interest however the court ruled that this provision does not ensure continued possession of the property but rather entitles the lessee to compensation for the value of its leasehold interest typically from the sale proceeds while there are certain circumstances under which a “free and clear” sale under section f of the federal bankruptcy code would not be authorized including that the lessee could not be compelled in a legal or equitable proceeding to accept a monetary satisfaction of his possessory interest and that none of the other conditions of section f– of the federal bankruptcy code otherwise permits the sale we cannot provide assurances that those circumstances would be present in any proposed sale of a leased premises as a result we cannot provide assurances that in the event of a statutory sale of leased property pursuant to section f of the federal bankruptcy code the lessee may be able to maintain possession of the property under the ground lease in addition we cannot assure you that the lessee andor the lender to the extent it can obtain standing to intervene will be able to recoup the full value of the leasehold interest in bankruptcy court   limitations of appraisals   appraisals will be obtained with respect to each of the mortgaged properties servicing mortgage loans of a series at or about the time of the origination of the applicable mortgage loan in general appraisals represent the analysis and opinion of qualified appraisers and are not guarantees of present or future value one appraiser may reach a different conclusion than the conclusion that would be reached if a different appraiser were appraising that property the values of the mortgaged properties may have fluctuated significantly since the appraisals were performed moreover appraisals seek to establish the amount a typically motivated buyer would pay a typically motivated seller and in certain cases may have taken into consideration the purchase price paid by the borrower that amount could be significantly higher than the amount obtained from the sale of a mortgaged property under a distress or liquidation sale we cannot assure you that the information set forth in the prospectus supplement regarding appraised values or loan to value ratios accurately reflects past present or future market values of the mortgaged properties any engineering report site inspection or appraisal represents only the analysis of the individual consultant engineer or inspector preparing such report at the time of such report and may not reveal all necessary or desirable repairs maintenance and capital improvement items   your lack of control over trust fund can create risks   you and other certificateholders generally do not have a right to vote and do not have the right to make decisions with respect to the administration of the trust see “servicing of the mortgage loans—general” in the prospectus supplement those decisions are generally made subject to the express terms of the pooling and servicing agreement by the master servicer the trustee or the special servicer as applicable any decision made by one of those parties in respect of the trust even if that decision is determined to be in your best interests by that party may be contrary to the decision that you or other certificateholders would have made and may negatively affect your interests   one action jurisdiction may limit the ability of the servicer to foreclose on a mortgaged property   the ability to realize upon the mortgage loans may be limited by the application of state and federal laws several states including california have laws that prohibit more than one “judicial action” to enforce a mortgage obligation and some courts have construed the term “judicial action” broadly accordingly the special servicer may need to obtain advice of counsel prior to enforcing any of the trust        fund’s rights under any of the mortgage loans that include mortgaged properties where a “one action” rule could be applicable   in the case of a multiproperty mortgage loan secured by mortgaged properties located in multiple states the special servicer may be required to foreclose first on properties located in states where such “one action” rules apply and where nonjudicial foreclosure is permitted before foreclosing on properties located in states where judicial foreclosure is the only permitted method of foreclosure the application of other state and federal laws may delay or otherwise limit the ability to realize on defaulted mortgage loans see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—foreclosure” in this prospectus   rights against tenants may be limited if leases are not subordinate to mortgage or do not contain attornment provisions   some of the tenant leases contain provisions that require the tenant to attorn to that is recognize as landlord under the lease a successor owner of the property following foreclosure some of the leases may be either subordinate to the liens created by the mortgage loans or else contain a provision that requires the tenant to subordinate the lease if the mortgagee agrees to enter into a nondisturbance agreement in some states if tenant leases are subordinate to the liens created by the mortgage loans and such leases do not contain attornment provisions such leases may terminate upon the transfer of the property to a foreclosing lender or purchaser at foreclosure accordingly in the case of the foreclosure of a mortgaged property located in such a state and leased to one or more desirable tenants under leases that are subordinate to the mortgage and do not contain attornment provisions such mortgaged property could experience a further decline in value if such tenants’ leases were terminated this is particularly likely if such tenants were paying abovemarket rents or could not be replaced   if a mortgage is subordinate to a lease the trust will not unless it has otherwise agreed with the tenant possess the right to dispossess the tenant upon foreclosure of the mortgaged property and if the lease contains provisions inconsistent with the mortgage eg provisions relating to application of insurance proceeds or condemnation awards or that could affect the enforcement of the lender’s rights eg a right of first refusal to purchase the property the provisions of the lease will take precedence over the provisions of the mortgage   if mortgaged properties are not in compliance with current zoning laws restoration following a casualty loss may be limited   certain of the mortgaged properties may not comply with current zoning laws including density use parking height and set back requirements due to changes in zoning requirements after such mortgaged properties were constructed these properties as well as those for which variances or special permits were issued or for which nonconformity with current zoning laws are otherwise permitted are considered to be a “legal nonconforming use” andor the improvements are considered to be “legal nonconforming structures” this means that the borrower is not required to alter its use or structure to comply with the existing or new law however the borrower may not be able to continue the nonconforming use or rebuild the nonconforming premises “as is” in the event of a substantial casualty loss such limitations may adversely affect the ability of the mortgagor to meet its mortgage loan obligations from cash flow of the property following the loss if a substantial casualty were to occur we cannot assure you that insurance proceeds would be available to pay the mortgage loan in full in addition if a nonconforming use were to be discontinued andor the mortgaged property were repaired or restored in conformity with the current law the value of the property or the revenue producing potential of the property may not be equal to that before the casualty   in addition certain of the mortgaged properties that do not conform to current zoning laws may not be “legal nonconforming uses” or “legal nonconforming structures” the failure of a mortgaged property to comply with zoning laws or to be a “legal nonconforming use” or “legal nonconforming structure” may adversely affect market value of the mortgaged property or the borrower’s ability to continue to use it in the manner it is currently being used or may necessitate material additional expenditures to remedy non conformities        in addition certain of the mortgaged properties may be subject to certain restrictions imposed pursuant to restrictive covenants reciprocal easement agreements or operating agreements or historical landmark designations such use restrictions could include for example limitations on the character of the improvements or the properties limitations affecting noise and parking requirements among other things and limitations on the borrowers’ right to operate certain types of facilities within a prescribed radius these limitations could adversely affect the ability of the related borrower to lease the mortgaged property on favorable terms thus adversely affecting the borrower’s ability to fulfill its obligations under the related mortgage loan   inspections of the mortgaged properties will be limited   the mortgaged properties will generally be inspected by licensed engineers at the time the mortgage loans will be originated to assess the structure exterior walls roofing interior construction mechanical and electrical systems and general condition of the site buildings and other improvements located on the mortgaged properties there can be no assurance that all conditions requiring repair or replacement will be identified in such inspections   compliance with americans with disabilities act may result in additional losses   a borrower may be required to incur costs to comply with various existing and future federal state or local laws and regulations applicable to the related mortgaged property for example under the americans with disabilities act of  all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—americans with disabilities act” in this prospectus to the extent the mortgaged properties do not comply with the act the borrowers may be required to incur costs to comply with the act in addition noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or an award of damages to private litigants the expenditure of these costs or the imposition of injunctive relief penalties or fines in connection with the borrower’s noncompliance could negatively impact the borrower’s cash flow and consequently its ability to pay its mortgage loan   litigation concerns   there may be legal proceedings pending and from time to time threatened against or other past or present adverse regulatory circumstances experienced by the borrowers their sponsors and managers of the mortgaged properties or their respective affiliates relating to the business of or arising out of the ordinary course of business of the borrowers their sponsors managers and affiliates there can be no assurance that such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the distributions to certificateholders in certain cases principals andor affiliates of the borrowers are involved or may have been involved in prior litigation or property foreclosures or deed in lieu of foreclosures we cannot assure you that any litigation other legal proceedings or other adverse situations will not have a material adverse effect on your investment   risks to the financial markets relating to terrorist attacks   on september   the united states was subjected to multiple terrorist attacks resulting in the loss of many lives and massive property damage and destruction in new york city the washington dc area and pennsylvania it is impossible to predict whether or the extent to which future terrorist activities may occur in the united states   it is uncertain what effects any future terrorist activities in the united states or abroad andor any consequent actions on the part of the united states government and others including military action could have on general economic conditions real estate markets particular business segments including those that are important to the performance of commercial mortgage loans andor insurance costs and the availability of insurance coverage for terrorist acts among other things reduced investor confidence could result in substantial volatility in securities markets and a decline in real estaterelated investments        in addition reduced consumer confidence as well as a heightened concern for personal safety could result in a material decline in personal spending and travel   risks to the mortgaged properties relating to terrorist attacks and foreign conflicts   the terrorist attacks in  on the world trade center and the pentagon as well as a number of reported thwarted planned attacks suggest the possibility that large public areas such as shopping centers or large office buildings could become the target of terrorist attacks in the future the occurrence or the possibility of such attacks could i lead to damage to one or more of the mortgaged properties if any such attacks occur ii result in higher costs for insurance premiums particularly for large properties which could adversely affect the cash flow at such mortgaged properties or iii impact leasing patterns or shopping patterns which could adversely impact leasing revenue retail property traffic and percentage rent as a result the ability of the mortgaged properties to generate cash flow may be adversely affected   with respect to shopping patterns attacks in the united states incidents of terrorism occurring outside the united states and the military conflicts in iraq and afghanistan may continue to significantly reduce air travel throughout the united states and therefore continue to have a negative effect on revenues in areas heavily dependent on tourism the decrease in air travel may have a negative effect on certain of the mortgaged properties located in areas heavily dependent on tourism which could reduce the ability of the affected mortgaged properties to generate cash flow   the united states continues to maintain a military presence in iraq and afghanistan it is uncertain what effect the activities of the united states in iraq afghanistan or any future conflict with any other country or group will have on domestic and world financial markets economies real estate markets insurance costs or business segments foreign or domestic conflict of any kind could have an adverse effect on the performance of the mortgaged properties   some certificates may not be appropriate for benefit plans   generally erisa applies to investments made by employee benefit plans and transactions involving the assets of those plans even if erisa does not apply similar prohibited transaction rules may apply under section  of the internal revenue code or materially similar federal state or local laws due to the complexity of regulations that govern those plans if you are subject to erisa or section  of the internal revenue code or to any materially similar federal state or local law you are urged to consult your own counsel regarding consequences under erisa the internal revenue code or such other similar law of acquisition ownership and disposition of the offered certificates of any series see “certain erisa considerations” in this prospectus   material federal tax considerations regarding residual certificates   if you hold certain classes of certificates that constitute a residual interest in a “real estate mortgage investment conduit” for federal income tax purposes you will be required to report on your federal income tax returns as ordinary income your pro rata share of the taxable income of the remic regardless of the amount or timing of your receipt of cash payments as described in “material federal income tax consequences—federal income tax consequences for remic certificates” in this prospectus accordingly under certain circumstances if you hold residual certificates you may have taxable income and tax liabilities arising from your investment during a taxable year in excess of the cash received during that period the requirement to report your pro rata share of the taxable income and net loss of the remic will continue until the principal balances of all classes of certificates of the related series have been reduced to zero even though you as a holder of residual certificates have received full payment of your stated interest and principal a portion or in certain circumstances all of your share of the remic taxable income may be treated as “excess inclusion” income to you which   · generally will not be subject to offset by losses from other activities     · if you are a taxexempt holder will be treated as unrelated business taxable income and        · if you are a foreign holder will not qualify for exemption from withholding tax   if you are an individual and you hold a class of residual certificates you may be limited in your ability to deduct servicing fees and other expenses of the remic in addition classes of residual certificates are subject to certain restrictions on transfer because of the special tax treatment of classes of residual certificates the taxable income arising in a given year on a class of residual certificates may substantially exceed the taxable income associated with investment in a corporate bond or stripped instrument having similar cash flow characteristics and pretax yield as a result the aftertax yield on the classes of residual certificates may be significantly less than that of a corporate bond or stripped instrument having similar cash flow characteristics   material federal tax considerations regarding original issue discount   certain classes of certificates of a series may be issued with “original issue discount” for federal income tax purposes which generally will result in recognition of some taxable income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to that income accordingly investors must have sufficient sources of cash to pay any federal state or local income taxes with respect to the original issue discount see “material federal income tax consequences—federal income tax consequences for remic certificates—taxation of regular certificates” in this prospectus   bankruptcy proceedings could adversely affect payments on your certificates   under the federal bankruptcy code the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or against a borrower will stay the pending sale of the mortgaged property owned by that borrower as well as the commencement or continuation of a foreclosure action and deficiency judgment proceedings in addition even if a court determines that the value of the mortgaged property is less than the principal balance of the mortgage loan it secures the court may prevent a lender from foreclosing on the mortgaged property subject to certain protections available to the lender as part of a restructuring plan a court also may reduce the amount of secured indebtedness to the thencurrent value of the mortgaged property this action would make the lender a general unsecured creditor for the difference between the thencurrent value and the amount of its outstanding mortgage indebtedness   a bankruptcy court also may   · grant a debtor a reasonable time to cure a payment default on a mortgage loan     · reduce periodic payments due under a mortgage loan     · change the rate of interest due on a mortgage loan or     · otherwise alter the mortgage loan’s repayment schedule   moreover the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or on behalf of a junior lienholder may stay the senior lienholder from taking action to foreclose on the junior lien additionally the borrower’s trustee or the borrower as debtorinpossession has certain special powers to avoid subordinate or disallow debts in certain circumstances the claims of the trustee may be subordinated to financing obtained by a debtorinpossession subsequent to its bankruptcy   under the federal bankruptcy code the lender will be stayed from enforcing a borrower’s or with respect to any indemnity deed of trust structure the related property owner’s assignment of rents and leases the federal bankruptcy code also may interfere with the master servicer’s or special servicer’s ability to enforce lockbox requirements the legal proceedings necessary to resolve these issues can be time consuming and costly and may significantly delay or diminish the receipt of rents rents also may escape an assignment to the extent they are used by the borrower to maintain the mortgaged property or for other court authorized expenses        additionally pursuant to subordination agreements for certain of the mortgage loans the subordinate lenders may have agreed that they will not take any direct actions with respect to the related subordinated debt including any actions relating to the bankruptcy of the borrower and that the holder of the mortgage loan will have all rights to direct all such actions there can be no assurance that in the event of the borrower’s bankruptcy a court will enforce such restrictions against a subordinated lender   in its decision in in re  north lasalle street partnership  br  bankr nd ill march   the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois refused to enforce a provision of a subordination agreement that allowed a first mortgagee to vote a second mortgagee’s claim with respect to a chapter  reorganization plan on the grounds that prebankruptcy contracts cannot override rights expressly provided by the federal bankruptcy code this holding which at least one court has already followed potentially limits the ability of a senior lender to accept or reject a reorganization plan or to control the enforcement of remedies against a common borrower over a subordinated lender’s objections   as a result of the foregoing the trust’s recovery with respect to borrowers in bankruptcy proceedings may be significantly delayed and the aggregate amount ultimately collected may be substantially less than the amount owed see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—foreclosure” in this prospectus   risks relating to enforceability of yield maintenance charges prepayment premiums or defeasance provisions   provisions requiring yield maintenance charges or prepayment premiums may not be enforceable in some states and under federal bankruptcy law those provisions also may be interpreted as constituting the collection of interest for usury purposes accordingly we cannot assure you that the obligation to pay a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium will be enforceable also we cannot assure you that foreclosure proceeds will be sufficient to pay an enforceable yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium   additionally although the collateral substitution provisions related to defeasance do not have the same effect on the certificateholders as prepayment we cannot assure you that a court would not interpret those provisions as requiring a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium in certain jurisdictions those collateral substitution provisions might be deemed unenforceable under applicable law or public policy or usurious   risks relating to borrower default   the rate and timing of delinquencies or defaults on the mortgage loans will affect   · the aggregate amount of distributions on the offered certificates     · their yield to maturity     · the rate of principal payments and     · their weighted average life   if losses on the mortgage loans exceed the aggregate principal amount of the classes of certificates subordinated to a particular class that class will suffer a loss equal to the full amount of the excess up to the outstanding principal amount of that class   if you calculate your anticipated yield based on assumed rates of defaults and losses that are lower than the default rate and losses actually experienced and those losses are allocated to your certificates your actual yield to maturity will be lower than the assumed yield under certain extreme scenarios that yield could be negative in general the earlier a loss borne by you on your certificates occurs the greater the effect on your yield to maturity        even if losses on the mortgage loans are not borne by your certificates those losses may affect the weighted average life and yield to maturity of your certificates this may be so because those losses lead to your certificates having a higher percentage ownership interest in the trust and related distributions of principal payments on the mortgage loans than would otherwise have been the case and the related prepayment may affect the passthrough rate on your certificates the effect on the weighted average life and yield to maturity of your certificates will depend upon the characteristics of the remaining mortgage loans   delinquencies and defaults on the mortgage loans may significantly delay the receipt of distributions by you on your certificates unless advances are made to cover delinquent payments or the subordination of another class of certificates fully offsets the effects of any delinquency or default   additionally the courts of any state may refuse the foreclosure of a mortgage or deed of trust when an acceleration of the indebtedness would be inequitable or unjust or the circumstances would render the action unconscionable see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—foreclosure” in this prospectus   risks relating to certain payments   to the extent described in the related prospectus supplement the master servicer the special servicer or the trustee as applicable will be entitled to receive interest on unreimbursed pi advances this interest will generally accrue from the date on which the related advance is made or the related expense is incurred through the date of reimbursement in addition under certain circumstances including delinquencies in the payment of principal andor interest a mortgage loan will be specially serviced and the special servicer is entitled to compensation for special servicing activities the right to receive interest on advances or special servicing compensation is generally senior to the rights of certificateholders to receive distributions on the offered certificates the payment of interest on advances and the payment of compensation to the special servicer may lead to shortfalls in amounts otherwise distributable on the offered certificates   risks relating to enforceability   the mortgages will generally permit the lender to accelerate the debt upon default by the borrower the courts of all states will enforce acceleration clauses in the event of a material payment default courts however may refuse to permit foreclosure or acceleration if a default is deemed immaterial or the exercise of those remedies would be unjust or unconscionable   if a mortgaged property has tenants the borrower typically assigns its income as landlord to the lender as further security while retaining a license to collect rents as long as there is no default if the borrower defaults the license terminates and the lender is entitled to collect rents in certain jurisdictions such assignments may not be perfected as security interests until the lender takes actual possession of the property’s cash flow in some jurisdictions the lender may not be entitled to collect rents until the lender takes possession of the property and secures the appointment of a receiver in addition as previously discussed if bankruptcy or similar proceedings are commenced by or for the borrower the lender’s ability to collect the rents may be adversely affected   bookentry system for certain classes may decrease liquidity and delay payment   if so provided in the related prospectus supplement one or more classes of the offered certificates of any series will be issued as bookentry certificates each class of bookentry certificates will be initially represented by one or more certificates registered in the name of a nominee for the depository trust company or dtc since transactions in the classes of bookentry certificates of any series generally can be effected only through the depository trust company and its participating organizations   · the liquidity of bookentry certificates in secondary trading market that may develop may be limited because investors may be unwilling to purchase certificates for which they cannot obtain physical certificates        · your ability to pledge certificates to persons or entities that do not participate in the dtc system or otherwise to take action in respect of the certificates may be limited due to lack of a physical security representing the certificates     · your access to information regarding the certificates may be limited since conveyance of notices and other communications by the depository trust company to its participating organizations and directly and indirectly through those participating organizations to you will be governed by arrangements among them subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect at that time and     · you may experience some delay in receiving distributions of interest and principal on your certificates because distributions will be made by the trustee to dtc and dtc will then be required to credit those distributions to the accounts of its participating organizations and only then will they be credited to your account either directly or indirectly through dtc’s participating organizations   see “description of the certificates—bookentry registration and definitive certificates” in this prospectus   delinquent and nonperforming mortgage loans could adversely affect payments on your certificates   if so provided in the related prospectus supplement the trust fund for a particular series of certificates may include mortgage loans that are past due in no event will the mortgage loans that are past due comprise  percent or more of the trust fund at the time the mortgage loans are transferred to the trust fund none of the mortgage loans will be nonperforming ie more than  days delinquent or in foreclosure at the time the mortgage loans are transferred by the depositor to a trust fund for a series if so specified in the related prospectus supplement a special servicer may perform the servicing of delinquent mortgage loans or mortgage loans that become nonperforming after the time they are transferred to a trust fund credit support provided with respect to a particular series of certificates may not cover all losses related to those delinquent or nonperforming mortgage loans you should consider the risk that the inclusion of those mortgage loans in the trust fund may adversely affect the rate of defaults and prepayments on the mortgage assets in the trust fund and the yield on your certificates of that series see “description of the trust funds—mortgage loans—general” in this prospectus   changes to remic restrictions on loan modifications may impact an investment in the certificates   the irs issued revenue procedure  easing the tax requirements for a servicer to modify a commercial or multifamily mortgage loan held in a remic or grantor trust by interpreting the circumstances when default is “reasonably foreseeable” to include those where the servicer reasonably believes that there is a “significant risk of default” with respect to the mortgage loan upon maturity of the loan or at an earlier date and that by making such modification the risk of default is substantially reduced accordingly if the servicer or the special servicer determined that the mortgage loan was at significant risk of default and permitted one or more modifications otherwise consistent with the terms of the related pooling and servicing agreement any such modification may impact the timing of payments and ultimate recovery on the mortgage loan and likewise on one or more classes of certificates in the related series and the tax status of the remic   in addition final regulations were issued under the remic provisions of the code that modify the tax restrictions imposed on a servicer’s ability to modify the terms of mortgage loans held by a remic relating to changes in the collateral credit enhancement and recourse features to permit those modifications so long as the mortgage loan remains “principally secured” by real property within the meaning of the final regulations the irs has also issued revenue procedure  describing circumstances in which it will not challenge the treatment of mortgage loans as “qualified mortgages” on the grounds that the mortgage loan is not “principally secured by real property” that is has a real        property loantovalue ratio greater than  following a release of liens on some or all of the real property securing such mortgage loan the general rule is that a mortgage loan must continue to be “principally secured by real property” following any such lien release unless the lien release is pursuant to a defeasance permitted under the original loan documents and occurs more than two years after the startup day of the remic all in accordance with the remic provisions revenue procedure  also allows lien releases in certain “grandfathered transactions” and transactions in which the release is part of a “qualified paydown transaction” even if the mortgage loan after the transaction might not otherwise be treated as principally secured by a lien on real property if the value of the real property securing a mortgage loan were to decline the need to comply with the rules of revenue procedure  could restrict the servicers’ actions in negotiating the terms of a workout or in allowing minor lien releases in circumstances in which after giving effect to the release the mortgage loan would not have a real property loantovalue ratio of  or less this could impact the timing and ultimate recovery on a mortgage loan and likewise on one or more classes of certificates   in the event of an early termination of a swap agreement due to certain swap termination events a trust may be required to make a large termination payment to any related swap counterparty   to the extent described in the related prospectus supplement a trust may enter into one or more interest rate swap agreements a swap agreement generally may not be terminated except upon the occurrence of enumerated termination events set forth in the applicable swap agreement which will be described in the related prospectus supplement depending on the reason for the termination however a swap termination payment may be due from either the trust or the related swap counterparty   if a termination event under any of these swap agreements occurs and the trust owes the related swap counterparty a large termination payment that is required to be paid pro rata with interest due to the related securities the trust may not have sufficient available funds on that or future distribution dates to make required payments of interest or principal and the holders of all classes of securities may suffer a loss   your securities will have greater risk if an interest rate swap agreement terminates   if on any distribution date a payment is due to the trust under an interest rate swap agreement but the related swap counterparty defaults and the trust is unable to arrange for a replacement swap agreement holders of such securities will remain entitled to the established rate of interest and principal even though the related swap agreement has terminated if this occurs amounts available to make payments on the related securities will be reduced to the extent the interest rates on those securities exceed the rates which the trust would have been required to pay to the swap counterparty under the terminated interest rate swap agreement in this event the trust may not have sufficient available funds on that or future distribution dates to make required payments of interest or principal to all classes of securities and you may suffer a loss   description of the trust funds   general   the primary assets of each trust fund will consist of          one or more types of multifamily or commercial mortgage loans          mortgage participations passthrough certificates or other mortgagebacked securities “mbs” that evidence interests in or that are secured by pledges of one or more of various types of multifamily or commercial mortgage loans or          a combination of mortgage loans and mbs        jp morgan chase commercial mortgage securities corp the

holder of the mortgage asset a “mortgage asset seller” which prior holder may or may not be the originator of that mortgage loan or the issuer of that mbs and may be our affiliate the mortgage assets will not be guaranteed or insured by the depositor or any of its affiliates and will be guaranteed or insured by a governmental agency or instrumentality or by any other person only to the extent described in the related prospectus supplement the discussion under the heading “—mortgage loans” below unless otherwise noted applies equally to mortgage loans underlying any mbs included in a particular trust fund   mortgage loans   general the mortgage loans will be evidenced by promissory notes the “mortgage notes” secured by mortgages deeds of trust or similar security instruments the “mortgages” that create liens on fee or leasehold estates in properties the “mortgaged properties” consisting of   · residential properties consisting of five or more rental or cooperativelyowned dwelling units in highrise midrise or garden apartment buildings or other residential structures or     · office buildings retail stores and establishments hotels or motels nursing homes assisted

cooperative housing corporations “cooperatives” and shares of the cooperative allocable to one or more dwelling units occupied by nonowner tenants or to vacant units each mortgage will create a first priority or junior priority mortgage lien on a borrower’s fee estate in a mortgaged property if a mortgage creates a lien on a borrower’s leasehold estate in a property then the term of that leasehold will generally exceed the term of the mortgage note by at least two years generally a person other than the depositor will have originated each mortgage loan and the originator may be or may have been an affiliate of the depositor each such unaffiliated originator that originated  or more of the mortgage loans of any series will be identified in the related prospectus supplement   if so specified in the related prospectus supplement mortgage assets for a series of certificates may include mortgage loans made on the security of real estate projects under construction in that case the related prospectus supplement will describe the procedures and timing for making disbursements from construction reserve funds as portions of the related real estate project are completed in addition the mortgage assets for a particular series of certificates may include mortgage loans that are delinquent or nonperforming as of the date those certificates are issued in that case the related prospectus supplement will set forth as to those mortgage loans available information as to the period of the delinquency or nonperformance of those loans any forbearance arrangement then in effect the condition of the related mortgaged property and the ability of the mortgaged property to generate income to service the mortgage debt   default and loss considerations with respect to the mortgage loans mortgage loans secured by liens on incomeproducing properties are substantially different from loans made on the security of owneroccupied singlefamily homes the repayment of a loan secured by a lien on an incomeproducing property is typically dependent upon the successful operation of that property that is its ability to generate income moreover some or all of the mortgage loans included in a particular trust fund may be nonrecourse loans which means that absent special facts recourse in the case of default will be limited to the mortgaged property and those other assets if any that were pledged to secure repayment of the mortgage loan        lenders typically look to the debt service coverage ratio and the debt yield of a loan secured by incomeproducing property as important factors in evaluating the risk of default on and  or losses related to that loan the “debt service coverage ratio” or “dscr” of a mortgage loan at any given time is generally the ratio of  the net operating income derived from the related mortgaged property for a twelvemonth period to  the annualized scheduled payments on the mortgage loan and any other loans senior thereto that are secured by the related mortgaged property the “debt yield” of a mortgage loan at any given time is generally the ratio of  the net operating income derived from the related mortgaged property for a twelvemonth period divided by  the outstanding principal amount of the mortgage loan secured by the related mortgaged property expressed in percentage terms the prospectus supplement may describe certain variations in the calculation of debt service coverage ratio and  or debt yield that are applicable to a specific series “net operating income” generally means for any given period the total operating revenues derived from a mortgaged property during that period minus the total operating expenses incurred in respect of that mortgaged property during that period other than   · noncash items such as depreciation and amortization     · capital expenditures and     · debt service on the related mortgage loan or on any other loans that are secured by that mortgaged property   the net operating income of a mortgaged property will fluctuate over time and may or may not be sufficient to cover debt service on the related mortgage loan at any given time the prospectus supplement may describe certain variations in the calculation of net operating income that are applicable to a specific series as the primary source of the operating revenues of a nonowner occupied incomeproducing property rental income and with respect to a mortgage loan secured by a cooperative apartment building maintenance payments from tenantstockholders of a cooperative may be affected by the condition of the applicable real estate market andor area economy in addition properties typically leased occupied or used on a shortterm basis such as certain healthcarerelated facilities hotels and motels and miniwarehouse and selfstorage facilities tend to be affected more rapidly by changes in market or business conditions than do properties typically leased for longer periods such as warehouses retail stores office buildings and industrial plants commercial properties may be owneroccupied or leased to a small number of tenants thus the net operating income of a commercial property may depend substantially on the financial condition of the borrower or a tenant and mortgage loans secured by liens on those properties may pose greater risks than loans secured by liens on multifamily properties or on multitenant commercial properties   increases in operating expenses due to the general economic climate or economic conditions in a locality or industry segment such as increases in interest rates real estate tax rates energy costs labor costs and other operating expenses andor to changes in governmental rules regulations and fiscal policies may also affect the risk of default on a mortgage loan as may be further described in the related prospectus supplement in some cases leases of mortgaged properties may provide that the lessee rather than the borrowerlandlord is responsible for payment of operating expenses “net leases” however the existence of these “net of expense” provisions will result in stable net operating income to the borrowerlandlord only to the extent that the lessee is able to absorb operating expense increases while continuing to make rent payments   lenders also look to the loantovalue ratio of a mortgage loan as a factor in evaluating risk of loss if a property must be liquidated following a default the “loantovalue ratio” or “ltv” of a mortgage loan at any given time is generally the ratio expressed as a percentage of   · the then outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan and any other loans senior thereto that are secured by the related mortgaged property to     · the value of the related mortgaged property        the prospectus supplement may describe certain variations in the calculation of loantovalue ratio that are applicable to a specific series   the “value” of a mortgaged property is generally its fair market value determined in an appraisal obtained by the originator at the origination of that loan the lower the loantovalue ratio the greater the percentage of the borrower’s equity in a mortgaged property and thus   a     the greater the incentive of the borrower to perform under the terms of the related mortgage loan in order to protect its equity and   b     the greater the cushion provided to the lender against loss on liquidation following a default   loantovalue ratios will not necessarily constitute an accurate measure of the risk of liquidation loss in a pool of mortgage loans for example the value of a mortgaged property as of the date of initial issuance of the related series of certificates may be less than the value determined at loan origination and will likely continue to fluctuate from time to time based upon changes in economic conditions the real estate market and other factors described in this prospectus moreover even when current an appraisal is not necessarily a reliable estimate of value appraised values of incomeproducing properties are generally based on   · the market comparison method which compares recent resale value of comparable properties at the date of the appraisal     · the cost replacement method which calculates the cost of replacing the property at that date     · the income capitalization method which projects value based upon the property’s projected net cash flow or     · upon a selection from or interpolation of the values derived from those methods   each of these appraisal methods can present analytical difficulties it is often difficult to find truly comparable properties that have recently been sold the replacement cost of a property may have little to do with its current market value and income capitalization is inherently based on inexact projections of income and expense and the selection of an appropriate capitalization rate and discount rate where more than one of these appraisal methods are used and provide significantly different results an accurate determination of value and correspondingly a reliable analysis of default and loss risks is even more difficult   while we believe that the foregoing considerations are important factors that generally distinguish loans secured by liens on incomeproducing real estate from singlefamily mortgage loans we cannot assure you that all of these factors will in fact have been prudently considered by the originators of the mortgage loans or that for a particular mortgage loan they are complete or relevant see “risk factors—commercial and multifamily mortgage loans have risks that may affect payments on your certificates” and “—borrowers may be unable to make balloon payments” in this prospectus   payment provisions of the mortgage loans in general each mortgage loan   · will provide for scheduled payments of principal interest or both to be made on specified dates “due dates” that occur monthly quarterly semiannually or

mbs issuer generally will be limited to certain representations and warranties with respect to the assets it conveyed to the related trust or its assignment of the representations and warranties of another entity from which it acquired the assets the mbs issuer will not generally have guaranteed any of the assets conveyed to the related trust or any of the private mortgage backed securities issued under the mbs pooling and servicing agreement additionally although the mortgage loans underlying the mbs may be guaranteed by an agency or instrumentality of the united states the mbs themselves will not be so guaranteed   certificate accounts   each trust fund will include one or more certificate accounts established and maintained on behalf of the certificateholders into which the person or persons designated in the related prospectus supplement will to the extent described in this prospectus and in that prospectus supplement deposit all payments and collections received or advanced with respect to the mortgage assets and any interest rate or currency swap or interest rate cap floor or collar contracts in the trust fund a certificate account may be maintained as an interest bearing or a noninterest bearing account and funds held in a certificate account may be held as cash or invested in certain obligations acceptable to each rating agency rating one or more classes of the related series of offered certificates   other accounts   the prospectus supplement for each trust will also describe any other accounts established for such series        credit support   if so provided in the prospectus supplement for a series of certificates partial or full protection against certain defaults and losses on the mortgage assets in the related trust fund may

certificates the related trust fund may include guaranteed investment contracts pursuant to which moneys held in the funds and accounts established for those series will be invested at a specified rate the trust fund may also include interest rate exchange agreements interest rate cap or floor agreements or currency exchange agreements which agreements are designed to reduce the effects of interest rate or currency exchange rate fluctuations on the mortgage assets on one or more classes of certificates the principal terms of a guaranteed investment contract or other agreement any of these agreements a “cash flow agreement” and the identity of the cash flow agreement obligor will be described in the prospectus supplement for a series of certificates   yield and maturity considerations   general   the yield on any offered certificate will depend on the price you paid the fixed variable rate or adjustable passthrough interest rate of the certificate and the amount and timing of distributions on the certificate see “risk factors—prepayments of the mortgage assets will affect the timing of your cash flow and may affect your yield” in this prospectus the following discussion contemplates a trust fund that consists solely of mortgage loans while the characteristics and behavior of mortgage loans underlying an mbs can generally be expected to have the same effect on the yield to maturity andor weighted average life of a class of certificates as will the characteristics and behavior of comparable mortgage loans the effect may differ due to the payment characteristics of the mbs if a trust fund includes mbs the related prospectus supplement will discuss the effect that the mbs payment characteristics may have on the yield to maturity and weighted average lives of the offered certificates of the related series   passthrough rate   the certificates of any class within a series may have a fixed variable or adjustable passthrough interest rate which may or may not be based upon the interest rates borne by the mortgage loans in the related trust fund the prospectus supplement with respect to any series of certificates will specify the passthrough interest rate for each class of offered certificates of that series or in the case of a class of offered certificates with a variable or adjustable passthrough interest rate the method of determining the passthrough interest rate the effect if any of the prepayment of any mortgage loan on the passthrough interest rate of one or more classes of offered certificates and whether the distributions of interest on the offered certificates of any class will be dependent in whole or in part on the performance of any obligor under a cash flow agreement   payment delays   with respect to any series of certificates a period of time will elapse between the date upon which payments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund are due and the distribution date on which those        payments are passed through to certificateholders that delay will effectively reduce the yield that would otherwise be produced if payments on those mortgage loans were distributed to certificateholders on or near the date they were due   certain shortfalls in collections of interest   when a principal prepayment in full or in part is made on a mortgage loan the borrower is generally charged interest on the amount of that prepayment only through the date of prepayment instead of through the due date for the next succeeding scheduled payment however interest accrued on any series of certificates and distributable on them on any distribution date will generally correspond to interest accrued on the mortgage loans to their respective due dates during the related due period “due period” is a specified time period generally corresponding in length to the time period between distribution dates and all scheduled payments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund that are due during a given due period will to the extent received by a specified date the “determination date” or otherwise advanced by the related master servicer or other specified person be distributed to the holders of the certificates of that series on the next succeeding distribution date consequently if a prepayment on any mortgage loan is distributable to certificateholders on a particular distribution date but that prepayment is not accompanied by interest on it to the due date for that mortgage loan in the related due period then the interest charged to the borrower net of servicing and administrative fees may be less that shortfall a “prepayment interest shortfall” than the corresponding amount of interest accrued and otherwise payable on the certificates of the related series if that shortfall is allocated to a class of offered certificates their yield will be adversely affected the prospectus supplement for each series of certificates will describe the manner in which those shortfalls will be allocated among the classes of those certificates if so specified in the prospectus supplement for a series of certificates the master servicer for that series will be required to apply some or all of its servicing compensation for the corresponding period to offset the amount of those shortfalls the related prospectus supplement will also describe any other amounts available to offset those shortfalls see “description of the pooling agreements—servicing compensation and payment of expenses” in this prospectus   yield and prepayment considerations   a certificate’s yield to maturity will be affected by the rate of principal payments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund and the allocation of principal to reduce the principal balance or notional amount if applicable of that certificate the rate of principal payments on the mortgage loans in any trust fund will in turn be affected by the amortization schedules of the mortgage loans which in the case of arm loans may change periodically to accommodate adjustments to their mortgage interest rates the dates on which any balloon payments are due and the rate of principal prepayments on them including for this purpose prepayments resulting from liquidations of mortgage loans due to defaults casualties or condemnations affecting the mortgaged properties or purchases of mortgage loans out of the related trust fund because the rate of principal prepayments on the mortgage loans in any trust fund will depend on future events and a variety of factors as described more fully below we cannot assure you as to that rate   the extent to which the yield to maturity of a class of offered certificates of any series may vary from the anticipated yield will depend upon the degree to which they are purchased at a discount or premium and when and to what degree payments of principal on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund are in turn distributed on those certificates or in the case of a class of interestonly certificates result in the reduction of its notional amount an investor should consider in the case of any offered certificate purchased at a discount the risk that a slower than anticipated rate of principal payments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund could result in an actual yield to that investor that is lower than the anticipated yield and in the case of any offered certificate purchased at a premium the risk that a faster than anticipated rate of principal payments on those mortgage loans could result in an actual yield to that investor that is lower than the anticipated yield in addition if an investor purchases an offered certificate at a discount or premium and principal payments are made in reduction of the principal balance or notional amount of that investor’s offered certificates at a rate slower or faster than the rate anticipated by the investor during any particular period the consequent adverse effects on that investor’s        yield would not be fully offset by a subsequent like increase or decrease in the rate of principal payments   a class of certificates including a class of offered certificates may provide that on any distribution date the holders of those certificates are entitled to a pro rata share of the prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund that are distributable on that date to a disproportionately large share which in some cases may be all of those prepayments or to a disproportionately small share which in some cases may be none of those prepayments as described in the related prospectus supplement the respective entitlements of the various classes of certificates of any series to receive distributions in respect of payments and in particular prepayments of principal of the mortgage loans in the related trust fund may vary based on the occurrence of certain events such as the retirement of one or more classes of certificates of that series or subject to certain contingencies such as prepayment and default rates with respect to those mortgage loans   in general the notional amount of a class of interestonly certificates will either  be based on the principal balances of some or all of the mortgage assets in the related trust fund or  equal the principal balances of one or more of the other classes of certificates of the same series accordingly the yield on those interestonly certificates will be inversely related to the rate at which payments and other collections of principal are received on those mortgage assets or distributions are made in reduction of the principal balances of those classes of certificates as the case may be   consistent with the foregoing if a class of certificates of any series consists of interestonly certificates or principalonly certificates a lower than anticipated rate of principal prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund will negatively affect the yield to investors in principalonly certificates and a higher than anticipated rate of principal prepayments on those mortgage loans will negatively affect the yield to investors in interestonly certificates if the offered certificates of a series include those certificates the related prospectus supplement will include a table showing the effect of various assumed levels of prepayment on yields on those certificates those tables will be intended to illustrate the sensitivity of yields to various assumed prepayment rates and will not be intended to predict or to provide information that will enable investors to predict yields or prepayment rates   we are not aware of any relevant publicly available or authoritative statistics with respect to the historical prepayment experience of a group of multifamily or commercial mortgage loans however the extent of prepayments of principal of the mortgage loans in any trust fund may be affected by factors such as   · the availability of mortgage credit     · the relative economic vitality of the area in which the mortgaged properties are located     · the quality of management of the mortgaged properties     · the servicing of the mortgage loans     · possible changes in tax laws and other opportunities for investment     · the existence of lockout periods     · requirements that principal prepayments be accompanied by prepayment premiums and     · by the extent to which these provisions may be practicably enforced   the rate of prepayment on a pool of mortgage loans is also affected by prevailing market interest rates for mortgage loans of a comparable type term and risk level when the prevailing market interest rate is below a mortgage loan’s interest rate a borrower may have an increased incentive to refinance its mortgage loan even in the case of arm loans as prevailing market interest rates decline and without regard to whether the mortgage interest rates on the arm loans decline in a manner consistent        therewith the related borrowers may have an increased incentive to refinance for purposes of either  converting to a fixed rate loan and thereby “locking in” that rate or  taking advantage of a different index margin or rate cap or floor on another adjustable rate mortgage loan   depending on prevailing market interest rates the outlook for market interest rates and economic conditions generally some borrowers may sell mortgaged properties in order to realize their equity in the mortgaged properties to meet cash flow needs or to make other investments in addition some borrowers may be motivated by federal and state tax laws which are subject to change to sell mortgaged properties prior to the exhaustion of tax depreciation benefits we will make no representation as to the particular factors that will affect the prepayment of the mortgage loans in any trust fund as to the relative importance of those factors as to the percentage of the principal balance of the mortgage loans that will be paid as of any date or as to the overall rate of prepayment on the mortgage loans   weighted average life and maturity   the rate at which principal payments are received on the mortgage loans in any trust fund will affect the ultimate maturity and the weighted average life of one or more classes of the certificates of that series weighted average life refers to the average amount of time that will elapse from the date of issuance of an instrument until each dollar allocable as principal of that instrument is repaid to the investor   the weighted average life and maturity of a class of certificates of any series will be influenced by the rate at which principal on the related mortgage loans whether in the form of scheduled amortization or prepayments for this purpose the term “prepayment” includes voluntary prepayments liquidations due to default and purchases of mortgage loans out of the related trust fund is paid to that class prepayment rates on loans are commonly measured relative to a prepayment standard or model such as the constant prepayment rate “cpr” prepayment model or the standard prepayment assumption “spa” prepayment model cpr represents an assumed constant rate of prepayment each month expressed as an annual percentage relative to the then outstanding principal balance of a pool of loans for the life of those loans spa represents an assumed variable rate of prepayment each month expressed as an annual percentage relative to the then outstanding principal balance of a pool of loans with different prepayment assumptions often expressed as percentages of spa for example a prepayment assumption of  of spa assumes prepayment rates of  per annum of the then outstanding principal balance of the loans in the first month of the life of the loans and an additional  per annum in each month thereafter until the thirtieth month beginning in the thirtieth month and in each month thereafter during the life of the loans  of spa assumes a constant prepayment rate of  per annum each month   neither cpr nor spa nor any other prepayment model or assumption purports to be a historical description of prepayment experience or a prediction of the anticipated rate of prepayment of any particular pool of loans moreover the cpr and spa models were developed based upon historical prepayment experience for singlefamily loans thus it is unlikely that the prepayment experience of the mortgage loans included in any trust fund will conform to any particular level of cpr or spa   the prospectus supplement with respect to each series of certificates will contain tables if applicable setting forth the projected weighted average life of each class of offered certificates of those series and the percentage of the initial principal balance of each class that would be outstanding on specified distribution dates based on the assumptions stated in that prospectus supplement including assumptions that prepayments on the related mortgage loans are made at rates corresponding to various percentages of cpr or spa or at other rates specified in that prospectus supplement those tables and assumptions will illustrate the sensitivity of the weighted average lives of the certificates to various assumed prepayment rates and will not be intended to predict or to provide information that will enable investors to predict the actual weighted average lives of the certificates        controlled amortization classes and companion classes   a series of certificates may include one or more controlled amortization classes which will entitle the holders of those certificates to receive principal distributions according to a specified principal payment schedule which schedule is supported by creating priorities as described in the related prospectus supplement to receive principal payments from the mortgage loans in the related trust fund if so specified in the related prospectus supplement each controlled amortization class will either be a planned amortization class or a targeted amortization class in general a planned amortization class has a “prepayment collar” that is a range of prepayment rates that can be sustained without disruption that determines the principal cash flow of those certificates that prepayment collar is not static and may expand or contract after the issuance of the planned amortization class depending on the actual prepayment experience for the underlying mortgage loans distributions of principal on a planned amortization class would be made in accordance with the specified schedule so long as prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans remain at a relatively constant rate within the prepayment collar and as described below companion classes exist to absorb “excesses” or “shortfalls” in principal payments on the underlying mortgage loans if the rate of prepayment on the underlying mortgage loans from time to time falls outside the prepayment collar or fluctuates significantly within the prepayment collar especially for any extended period of time that event may have material consequences in respect of the anticipated weighted average life and maturity for a planned amortization class a targeted amortization class is structured so that principal distributions generally will be payable on it in accordance with its specified principal payments schedule so long as the rate of prepayments on the related mortgage assets remains relatively constant at the particular rate used in establishing that schedule a targeted amortization class will generally afford the holders of those certificates some protection against early retirement or some protection against an extended average life but not both   although prepayment risk cannot be eliminated entirely for any class of certificates a controlled amortization class will generally provide a relatively stable cash flow so long as the actual rate of prepayment on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund remains relatively constant at the rate or within the range of rates of prepayment used to establish the specific principal payment schedule for those certificates prepayment risk with respect to a given pool of mortgage assets does not disappear however and the stability afforded to a controlled amortization class comes at the expense of one or more companion classes of the same series any of which companion classes may also be a class of offered certificates in general and as more particularly described in the related prospectus supplement a companion class will entitle the holders of those certificates to a disproportionately large share of prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund when the rate of prepayment is relatively fast and will entitle the holders of those certificates to a disproportionately small share of prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund when the rate of prepayment is relatively slow a class of certificates that entitles the holders of those certificates to a disproportionately large share of the prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund enhances the risk of early retirement of that class or call risk if the rate of prepayment is relatively fast while a class of certificates that entitles the holders of those certificates to a disproportionately small share of the prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund enhances the risk of an extended average life of that class or extension risk if the rate of prepayment is relatively slow thus as described in the related prospectus supplement a companion class absorbs some but not all of the “call risk” andor “extension risk” that would otherwise belong to the related controlled amortization class if all payments of principal of the mortgage loans in the related trust fund were allocated on a pro rata basis   other factors affecting yield weighted average life and maturity   balloon payments extensions of maturity some or all of the mortgage loans included in a particular trust fund may require that balloon payments be made at maturity because the ability of a borrower to make a balloon payment typically will depend upon its ability either to refinance the loan or to sell the related mortgaged property there is a risk that mortgage loans that require balloon payments may default at maturity or that the maturity of that mortgage loan may be extended in connection with a workout in the case of defaults recovery of proceeds may be delayed by among other things bankruptcy of the borrower or adverse conditions in the market where the property is located in order to minimize losses        on defaulted mortgage loans the master servicer or a special servicer to the extent and under the circumstances set forth in this prospectus and in the related prospectus supplement may be authorized to modify mortgage loans that are in default or as to which a payment default is imminent any defaulted balloon payment or modification that extends the maturity of a mortgage loan may delay distributions of principal on a class of offered certificates and thereby extend the weighted average life of your certificates and if those certificates were purchased at a discount reduce your yield   negative amortization the weighted average life of a class of certificates can be affected by mortgage loans that permit negative amortization to occur a mortgage loan that provides for the payment of interest calculated at a rate lower than the rate at which interest accrues on it would be expected during a period of increasing interest rates to amortize at a slower rate and perhaps not at all than if interest rates were declining or were remaining constant this slower rate of mortgage loan amortization would correspondingly be reflected in a slower rate of amortization for one or more classes of certificates of the related series in addition negative amortization on one or more mortgage loans in any trust fund may result in negative amortization on the certificates of the related series the related prospectus supplement will describe if applicable the manner in which negative amortization in respect of the mortgage loans in any trust fund is allocated among the respective classes of certificates of the related series the portion of any mortgage loan negative amortization allocated to a class of certificates may result in a deferral of some or all of the interest payable on them which deferred interest may be added to the principal balance of the certificates accordingly the weighted average lives of mortgage loans that permit negative amortization and that of the classes of certificates to which the negative amortization would be allocated or that would bear the effects of a slower rate of amortization on those mortgage loans may increase as a result of that feature   negative amortization also may occur in respect of an arm loan that limits the amount by which its scheduled payment may adjust in response to a change in its mortgage interest rate provides that its scheduled payment will adjust less frequently than its mortgage interest rate or provides for constant scheduled payments notwithstanding adjustments to its mortgage interest rate accordingly during a period of declining interest rates the scheduled payment on that mortgage loan may exceed the amount necessary to amortize the loan fully over its remaining amortization schedule and pay interest at the then applicable mortgage interest rate thereby resulting in the accelerated amortization of that mortgage loan this acceleration in amortization of its principal balance will shorten the weighted average life of that mortgage loan and correspondingly the weighted average lives of those classes of certificates entitled to a portion of the principal payments on that mortgage loan   the extent to which the yield on any offered certificate will be affected by the inclusion in the related trust fund of mortgage loans that permit negative amortization will depend upon  whether that offered certificate was purchased at a premium or a discount and  the extent to which the payment characteristics of those mortgage loans delay or accelerate the distributions of principal on that certificate or in the case of an interestonly certificate delay or accelerate the amortization of the notional amount of that certificate see “—yield and prepayment considerations” above   foreclosures and payment plans the number of foreclosures and the principal amount of the mortgage loans that are foreclosed in relation to the number and principal amount of mortgage loans that are repaid in accordance with their terms will affect the weighted average lives of those mortgage loans and accordingly the weighted average lives of and yields on the certificates of the related series servicing decisions made with respect to the mortgage loans including the use of payment plans prior to a demand for acceleration and the restructuring of mortgage loans in bankruptcy proceedings may also have an effect upon the payment patterns of particular mortgage loans and thus the weighted average lives of and yields on the certificates of the related series   losses and shortfalls on the mortgage assets the yield on your certificates will directly depend on the extent to which you are required to bear the effects of any losses or shortfalls in collections arising out of defaults on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund and the timing of those losses and shortfalls in general the earlier that any loss or shortfall occurs the greater will be the negative effect on yield for any class of certificates that is required to bear the effects of the shortfall        the amount of any losses or shortfalls in collections on the mortgage assets in any trust fund to the extent not covered or offset by draws on any reserve fund or under any instrument of credit support will be allocated among the respective classes of certificates of the related series in the priority and manner and subject to the limitations if so specified in the related prospectus supplement as described in the related prospectus supplement those allocations may be effected by a reduction in the entitlements to interest andor principal balances of one or more classes of certificates or by establishing a priority of payments among those classes of certificates   the yield to maturity on a class of subordinate certificates may be extremely sensitive to losses and shortfalls in collections on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund   additional certificate amortization in addition to entitling the holders of one or more classes of a series of certificates to a specified portion which may during specified periods range from none to all of the principal payments received on the mortgage assets in the related trust fund one or more classes of certificates of any series including one or more classes of offered certificates of those series may provide for distributions of principal of those certificates from          amounts attributable to interest accrued but not currently distributable on one or more classes of accrual certificates          excess funds or          any other amounts described in the related prospectus supplement   “excess funds” will in general represent that portion of the amounts distributable in respect of the certificates of any series on any distribution date that represent  interest received or advanced on the mortgage assets in the related trust fund that is in excess of the interest currently accrued on the certificates of that series or  prepayment premiums or any other amounts received on the mortgage assets in the related trust fund that do not constitute interest on or principal of those certificates the prospectus supplement may describe certain variations in the calculation of excess funds that are applicable to a specific series   the amortization of any class of certificates out of the sources described in the preceding paragraph would shorten the weighted average life of those certificates and if those certificates were purchased at a premium reduce the yield on those certificates the related prospectus supplement will discuss the relevant factors to be considered in determining whether distributions of principal of any class of certificates out of those sources would have any material effect on the rate at which those certificates are amortized   optional early termination if so specified in the related prospectus supplement a series of certificates may be subject to optional early termination through the repurchase of the mortgage assets in the related trust fund by the party or parties specified in the related prospectus supplement under the circumstances and in the manner set forth in the prospectus supplement if so provided in the related prospectus supplement upon the reduction of the principal balance of a specified class or classes of certificates by a specified percentage or amount the specified party may be authorized or required to solicit bids for the purchase of all of the mortgage assets of the related trust fund or of a sufficient portion of those mortgage assets to retire that class or classes as set forth in the related prospectus supplement in the absence of other factors any early retirement of a class of offered certificates would shorten the weighted average life of those certificates and if those certificates were purchased at premium reduce the yield on those certificates   the sponsor   the related prospectus supplement will identify the sponsor or sponsors of the applicable series jpmorgan chase bank

the available distribution amount for that series and that distribution date the “available distribution amount” for any distribution date will generally refer to the total of all payments or other collections on or in respect of the mortgage assets and any interest rate or currency swap or interest rate cap floor or collar contracts included in the related trust fund that are available for distribution to the holders of certificates of that series on that date the particular components of the available distribution amount for any series on each distribution date will be more specifically described in the related prospectus supplement   distributions on the certificates other than the final distribution in retirement of that certificate will generally be made to the persons in whose names those certificates are registered at the close of business on the last business day of the month preceding the month in which the applicable distribution date occurs the “record

method for determining the passthrough interest rate for each class if so specified in the related prospectus supplement interest on the certificates of each series will be calculated on the basis of a day year consisting of twelve day months   distributions of interest in respect of any class of certificates other than certain classes of certificates that will be entitled to distributions of accrued interest commencing only on the distribution date or under the circumstances specified in the related prospectus supplement “accrual certificates” and other than any class of principalonly certificates or residual certificates which are not entitled to distributions of interest will be made on each distribution date based on the accrued certificate interest for that class and that distribution date subject to the sufficiency of the portion of the available distribution amount allocable to that class on that distribution date prior to the time interest is distributable on any class of accrual certificates the amount of accrued certificate interest otherwise distributable on that class will be added to the principal balance of those certificates on each distribution date with respect to each class of certificates other than certain classes of interestonly certificates and certain classes of residual certificates the “accrued certificate interest” for each distribution date will be equal to interest at the applicable passthrough interest rate accrued for a specified period of time or accrual period generally corresponding in length to the time period between distribution dates on the outstanding principal balance of that class of certificates immediately prior to that distribution date        the accrued certificate interest for each distribution date on a class of interestonly certificates will be similarly calculated except that it will accrue on a notional amount that is either          based on the principal balances of some or all of the mortgage assets in the related trust fund          equal to the principal balances of one or more other classes of certificates of the same series or          an amount or amounts specified in the applicable prospectus supplement   reference to a notional amount with respect to a class of interestonly certificates is solely for convenience in making certain calculations and does not represent the right to receive any distributions of principal if so specified in the related prospectus supplement the amount of accrued certificate interest that is otherwise distributable on or in the case of accrual certificates that may otherwise be added to the principal balance of one or more classes of the certificates of a series will be reduced to the extent that any prepayment interest shortfalls as described under “yield and maturity considerations—certain shortfalls in collections of interest” in this prospectus exceed the amount of any sums that are applied to offset the amount of those shortfalls the particular manner in which those shortfalls will be allocated among some or all of the classes of certificates of that series will be specified in the related prospectus supplement the related prospectus supplement will also describe the extent to which the amount of accrued certificate interest that is otherwise distributable on or in the case of accrual certificates that may otherwise be added to the principal balance of a class of offered certificates may be reduced as a result of any other contingencies including delinquencies losses and deferred interest on or in respect of the mortgage assets in the related trust fund any reduction in the amount of accrued certificate interest otherwise distributable on a class of certificates by reason of the allocation to that class of a portion of any deferred interest on or in respect of the mortgage assets in the related trust fund may result in a corresponding increase in the principal balance of that class if so specified in the related prospectus supplement see “risk factors—prepayments of the mortgage assets will affect the timing of your cash flow and may affect your yield” and “yield and maturity considerations” in this prospectus   determination of interest rates   day count basis interest rate change dates interest rate determination dates the prospectus supplement for each series of certificates will specify the applicable interest rates or the methods by which interest will be determined and day count conventions for each class of certificates for any class of certificates that bears interest at i a liborbased rate interest due for any accrual period generally will be determined on the basis of an actual day year and ii a fixed rate interest due for any accrual period will be determined on the basis of a  day year the applicable day count convention will be determined in accordance with prevailing market conventions and existing market conditions but generally will be limited to the following accrual methods   · “” which means that interest is calculated on the basis of a day year consisting of twelve day months     · “actual” which means that interest or any other relevant factor is calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of  days     · “actual fixed” which means that interest is calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of  days regardless of whether accrual or payment occurs in a leap year     · “actualactual accrual basis” which means that interest is calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of  days or  days for every day in a leap year        · “actualactual payment basis” which means that interest is calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of  days if the interest period ends in a nonleap year or  days if the interest period ends in a leap year as the case may be and     · “actualactual isma” is a calculation in accordance with the definition of “actualactual” adopted by the international securities market association “isma” which means that interest is calculated on the following basis   · where the number of days in the relevant accrual period is equal to or shorter than the determination period during which such accrual period ends the number of days in such accrual period divided by the product of a the number of days in such determination period and b the number of distribution dates that would occur in one calendar year or     · where the accrual period is longer than the determination period during which the accrual period ends the sum of    the number of days in such accrual period falling in the determination period in which the accrual period begins divided by the product of x the number of days in such determination period and y the number of distribution dates that would occur in one calendar year and      the number of days in such accrual period falling in the next determination period divided by the product of x the number of days in such determination period and y the number of distribution dates that would occur in one calendar year   where “determination period” means the period from and including one calculation date to but excluding the next calculation date and “calculation date” means in each year each of those days in the calendar year that are

exchangeable certificates so exchanged and     · the class or classes of exchangeable certificates will be exchanged in the applicable proportions if any described in the related prospectus supplement   different types of combinations may exist any individual series of certificates may have multiple types of combinations some examples of combinations of exchangeable certificates that differ in their interest characteristics include   · a class of exchangeable certificates with an interest rate that varies directly with changes in an index and a class of exchangeable certificates with an interest rate that varies indirectly with changes in the index may be exchangeable together for a related class of exchangeable certificates with a fixed interest rate in such a combination the classes of exchangeable certificates with interest rates that vary with an index would produce in the aggregate an annual interest amount equal to that generated by the related class of exchangeable certificates with a fixed interest rate in addition the aggregate principal balance of the two classes of exchangeable certificates with interest rates that vary with an index would equal the aggregate principal balance of the related class of exchangeable certificates with the fixed interest rate     · an interestonly class and a principalonly class of exchangeable certificates may be exchangeable together for a related class of exchangeable certificates that is entitled to both principal and interest distributions in such a combination the aggregate principal balance of the related class would be equal to the aggregate principal balance of the principalonly class of exchangeable certificates and the interest rate on the related class when applied to the aggregate principal balance of this related class would generate interest equal to the annual interest amount of the interestonly class of exchangeable certificates     · two or more classes of principal and interest classes of exchangeable certificates with different fixed interest rates may be exchangeable together for a single class of related exchangeable certificates that is entitled to both principal and interest distributions in such a combination the aggregate principal balance of the single class of related exchangeable certificates would be equal to the aggregate principal balance of the two or more classes of exchangeable certificates and the single class of related exchangeable certificates would have a fixed interest rate that when applied to the principal balance of the single class of exchangeable certificates would generate interest equal to the aggregate annual interest amount of the two or more classes of exchangeable certificates   in some series a certificateholder may be able to exchange its exchangeable certificates for other related exchangeable certificates that have different principal distribution characteristics some examples of combinations of exchangeable certificates that differ in the principal distribution characteristics include   · a class of exchangeable certificates that accretes all of its interest for a specified period with the accreted amount added to the aggregate principal balance of the class of exchangeable certificates and a second class of exchangeable certificates that receives principal distributions from these accretions may be exchangeable together for a single class of related exchangeable certificates that receives distributions of interest continuously from the first distribution date on which it receives interest until it is retired     · a class of exchangeable certificates that is a planned amortization class and a class of exchangeable certificates that only receives principal distributions on a distribution date if            scheduled payments have been made on the planned amortization class may be exchangeable together for a class of related exchangeable certificates that receives principal distributions without regard to the planned amortization schedule for the planned amortization class from the first distribution date on which it receives principal until it is retired   a number of factors may limit the ability of a holder of exchangeable certificates to effect an exchange for example the certificateholder must own at the time of the proposed exchange the class or classes of exchangeable certificates necessary to make the exchange in the necessary proportions if a certificateholder does not own the necessary classes of exchangeable certificates or does not own the necessary classes of exchangeable certificates in the proper proportions the certificateholder may not be able to obtain the desired classes of exchangeable certificates the certificateholder desiring to make the exchange may not be able to purchase the necessary class of exchangeable certificates from the then current owner at a reasonable price or the necessary proportion of the needed class of exchangeable certificates may no longer be available due to principal payments or prepayments that have been applied to that class of exchangeable certificates   procedures the related prospectus supplement will describe the procedures that must be followed to make an exchange of exchangeable certificates a certificateholder will be required to provide notice to the trustee prior to the proposed exchange date within the time period specified in the related prospectus supplement the notice must include the outstanding principal or notional amount of the exchangeable certificates to be exchanged and the related securities to be received and the proposed exchange date when the trustee receives this notice it will provide instructions to the certificateholder regarding delivery of the exchangeable certificates and to the extent set forth in the related prospectus supplement payment of the exchange fee a certificateholder’s notice to the trustee will become irrevocable on the second business day prior to the proposed exchange date specified in the related prospectus supplement any exchangeable certificates in bookentry form will be subject to the rules regulations and procedures applicable to dtc’s book entry securities   if the related prospectus supplement describes exchange proportions for a combination of classes of exchangeable certificates these proportions will be based on the original rather than the outstanding principal or notional amounts of these classes   distributions on an exchangeable certificate received in an exchange will be made as described in the related prospectus supplement distributions will be made to the certificateholder of record as of the applicable record date   reports to certificateholders   on each distribution date together with the distribution to the holders of each class of the offered certificates of a series a master servicer or trustee as provided in the related prospectus supplement will forward to each holder a statement a “distribution date statement” that will set forth among other things in each case to the extent applicable   · the amount of that distribution to holders of that class of offered certificates that was applied to reduce the principal balance of those certificates expressed as a dollar amount per minimum denomination of the relevant class of offered certificates or per a specified portion of that minimum denomination     · the amount of that distribution to holders of that class of offered certificates that is allocable to accrued certificate interest expressed as a dollar amount per minimum denomination of the relevant class of offered certificates or per a specified portion of that minimum denomination     · the

the aggregate principal balance of the related mortgage assets on or about that distribution date     · if the related trust fund includes mortgage loans information regarding the number and aggregate principal balance of those mortgage loans that are delinquent in varying degrees     · if the related trust fund includes mortgage loans information regarding the aggregate amount of losses incurred and principal prepayments made with respect to those mortgage loans during the specified period generally equal in length to the time period between distribution dates during which prepayments and other unscheduled collections on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund must be received in order to be distributed on a particular distribution date     · the principal balance or notional amount as the case may be of each class of certificates including any class of certificates not offered hereby at the close of business on that distribution date separately identifying any reduction in that principal balance or notional amount due to the allocation of any losses in respect of the related mortgage assets any increase in that principal balance or notional amount due to the allocation of any negative amortization in respect of the related mortgage assets and any increase in the principal balance of a class of accrual certificates if any in the event that accrued certificate interest has been added to that balance     · if the class of offered certificates has a variable passthrough interest rate or an adjustable passthrough interest rate the passthrough interest rate applicable to that class for that distribution date and if determinable for the next succeeding distribution date     · the amount deposited in or withdrawn from any reserve fund on that distribution date and the amount remaining on deposit in that reserve fund as of the close of business on that distribution date     · if the related trust fund includes one or more instruments of

extent not otherwise reflected through the information furnished as described above the amount of credit support being afforded by any classes of subordinate certificates   the prospectus supplement for each series of certificates may describe variations or additions to the type of information to be included in reports to the holders of the offered certificates of that series   within a reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year the master servicer or trustee for a series of certificates as the case may be will be required to furnish to each person who at any time during the calendar year was a holder of an offered certificate of that series a statement containing the information set forth in the first three categories described above aggregated for that calendar year or the applicable portion of that year during which that person was a certificateholder this obligation will be deemed to have been satisfied to the extent that substantially comparable information is provided pursuant to any requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” as are        from time to time in force see however “description of the certificates—bookentry registration and definitive certificates” in this prospectus   if the trust fund for a series of certificates includes mbs the ability of the related master servicer or trustee as the case may be to include in any distribution date statement information regarding the mortgage loans underlying that mbs will depend on the reports received with respect to that mbs in those cases the related prospectus supplement will describe the loanspecific information to be included in the distribution date statements that will be forwarded to the holders of the offered certificates of that series in connection with distributions made to them   voting rights   the voting rights evidenced by each series of certificates will be allocated among the respective classes of that series in the manner described in the related prospectus supplement   certificateholders will generally not have a right to vote except with respect to required consents to certain amendments to the agreement pursuant to which the certificates are issued and as specified in the related prospectus supplement see “description of the pooling agreements—amendment” in this prospectus the holders of specified amounts of certificates of a particular series will have the right to act as a group to remove the related trustee and also upon the occurrence of certain events which if continuing would constitute a termination event with respect to the related master servicer see “description of the pooling agreements—servicer termination events” and “—resignation and removal of the trustee” in this prospectus   termination   the obligations created by the pooling and servicing or other agreement creating a series of certificates will terminate following   · the final payment or other liquidation of the last mortgage asset underlying the series or the disposition of all property acquired upon foreclosure of any mortgage loan underlying the series and     · the payment to the certificateholders of the series of all amounts required to be paid to them   written notice of termination will be given to each certificateholder of the related series and the final distribution will be made only upon presentation and surrender of the certificates of that series at the location to be specified in the notice of termination   if so specified in the related prospectus supplement a series of certificates may be subject to optional early termination through the repurchase of the mortgage assets in the related trust fund by the party or parties specified in the prospectus supplement in the manner set forth in the prospectus supplement if so provided in the related prospectus supplement upon the reduction of the principal balance of a specified class or classes of certificates by a specified percentage or amount a party designated in the prospectus supplement may be authorized or required to bid for or solicit bids for the purchase of all the mortgage assets of the related trust fund or of a sufficient portion of those mortgage assets to retire those class or classes in the manner set forth in the prospectus supplement   bookentry registration and definitive certificates   if so provided in the prospectus supplement for a series of certificates one or more classes of the offered certificates of that series will be offered in bookentry format through the facilities of the depository trust company and that class will be represented by one or more global certificates registered in the name of dtc or its nominee   dtc is a limitedpurpose trust company organized under the new york banking law a “banking corporation” within the meaning of the new york banking law a member of the federal reserve system        a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the new york uniform commercial code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of section a of the exchange act dtc was created to hold securities for its participating organizations “participants” and facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between participants through electronic computerized bookentry changes in their accounts thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates “direct participants” which maintain accounts with dtc include securities brokers and dealers banks trust companies and clearing corporations and may include certain other organizations dtc is owned by a number of its direct participants and by the new york stock exchange inc the american stock exchange inc and the national association of securities dealers inc access to the dtc system also is available to others like banks brokers dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant either directly or indirectly “indirect participants”   purchases of bookentry certificates under the dtc system must be made by or through direct participants which will receive a credit for the bookentry certificates on dtc’s records   the ownership interest of each actual purchaser of a bookentry certificate a “certificate owner” is in turn to be recorded on the direct and indirect participants’ records certificate owners will not receive written confirmation from dtc of their purchases but certificate owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of those transactions as well as periodic statements of their holdings from the direct or indirect participant through which each certificate owner entered into the transaction transfers of ownership interest in the bookentry certificates are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of participants acting on behalf of certificate owners certificate owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the bookentry certificates except in the event that use of the bookentry system for the bookentry certificates of any series is discontinued as described below   dtc has no knowledge of the actual certificate owners of the bookentry certificates dtc’s records reflect only the identity of the direct participants to whose accounts those certificates are credited which may or may not be the certificate owners the participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers   conveyance of notices and other communications by dtc to direct participants by direct participants to indirect participants and by direct participants and indirect participants to certificate owners will be governed by arrangements among them subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time   distributions on the bookentry certificates will be made to dtc dtc’s practice is to credit direct participants’ accounts on the related distribution date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on dtc’s records unless dtc has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on that date disbursement of those distributions by participants to certificate owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name” and will be the responsibility of that participant and not of dtc the depositor or any trustee or master servicer subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time under a bookentry system certificate owners may receive payments after the related distribution date   generally with respect to bookentry certificates the only certificateholder of record will be the nominee of dtc and the certificate owners will not be recognized as certificateholders under the agreement pursuant to which the certificates are issued certificate owners will be permitted to exercise the rights of certificateholders under that agreement only indirectly through the participants who in turn will exercise their rights through dtc the depositor is informed that dtc will take action permitted to be taken by a certificateholder under that agreement only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account with dtc interests in the bookentry certificates are credited   because dtc can act only on behalf of participants who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain certificate owners the ability of a certificate owner to pledge its interest in bookentry certificates to persons or entities that do not participate in the dtc system or otherwise take actions in        respect of its interest in bookentry certificates may be limited due to the lack of a physical certificate evidencing that interest   if so specified in the related prospectus supplement certificates initially issued in bookentry form will be issued as definitive certificates to certificate owners or their nominees rather than to dtc or its nominee only if   · the depositor advises the trustee in writing that dtc is no longer willing or able to discharge properly its responsibilities as depository with respect to those certificates and the depositor is unable to locate a qualified successor or     · the depositor notifies dtc of its intent to terminate the bookentry system through dtc and upon receipt of notice of such intent from dtc the participants holding beneficial interests in the bookentry certificates agree to initiate such termination     upon the occurrence of either of the events described above dtc will be required to notify all participants of the availability through dtc of definitive certificates upon surrender by dtc of the certificate or certificates representing a class of bookentry certificates together with instructions for registration the trustee for the related series or other designated party will be required to issue to the certificate owners identified in those instructions the definitive certificates to which they are entitled and thereafter the holders of those definitive certificates will be recognized as certificateholders of record under the related agreement pursuant to which the certificates are issued   transfers between participants of euroclear bank as operator of the euroclear system in europe “euroclear” and clearstream banking société anonyme “clearstream” will occur in accordance with their applicable rules and operating procedures   crossmarket transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly through dtc on the one hand and directly through clearstream participants or euroclear participants on the other will be effected in dtc in accordance with dtc rules on behalf of the relevant european international clearing system by its depository however these crossmarket transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant european international clearing system by the counterparty in that system in accordance with its rules and procedures if the transaction complies with all relevant requirements euroclear or clearstream as the case may be will then deliver instructions to the depository to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf   because of timezone differences it is possible that credits of securities in clearstream or euroclear as a result of a transaction with a dtc participant will be made during the subsequent securities settlement processing dated the business day following the dtc settlement date and those credits or any transactions in those securities settled during this processing will be reported to the relevant clearstream participant or euroclear participant on that business day cash received in clearstream or euroclear as a result of sales of securities by or through a clearstream participant or a euroclear participant to a dtc participant will be received with value on the dtc settlement date but due to timezone differences may be available in the relevant clearstream or euroclear cash account only as of the business day following settlement in dtc   certificate owners that are not direct or indirect participants but desire to purchase sell or otherwise transfer ownership of or other interests in the offered certificates may do so only through direct and indirect participants in addition certificate owners will receive all distributions of principal of and interest on the offered certificates from the trustee through dtc and its direct and indirect participants accordingly certificate owners may experience delays in their receipt of payments since those payments will be forwarded by the trustee to cede  co as nominee of dtc dtc will forward those payments to its participants which thereafter will forward them to indirect participants or beneficial owners of offered certificates except as otherwise provided under “description of the certificates—reports to certificateholders certain available information” in the related prospectus supplement certificate owners will not be recognized by the trustee the special servicer or the master servicer as holders of record of certificates and certificate owners will be permitted to receive information furnished        to certificateholders and to exercise the rights of certificateholders only indirectly through dtc and its direct and indirect participants   under the rules regulations and procedures creating and affecting dtc and its operations the “rules” dtc is required to make book entry transfers of the offered certificates among participants and to receive and transmit distributions of principal of and interest on the offered certificates direct and indirect participants with which certificate owners have accounts with respect to the offered certificates similarly are required to make book entry transfers and receive and transmit the distributions on behalf of their respective certificate owners accordingly although certificate owners will not possess physical certificates evidencing their interests in the offered certificates the rules provide a mechanism by which certificate owners through their direct and indirect participants will receive distributions and will be able to transfer their interests in the offered certificates   because dtc can only act on behalf of participants who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks the ability of certificateholders to pledge the certificates to persons or entities that do not participate in the dtc system or to otherwise act with respect to the certificates may be limited due to the lack of a physical certificate for the certificates   dtc has advised the depositor that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of an offered certificate under the pooling agreement only at the direction of one or more participants to whose accounts with dtc the offered certificates are credited dtc may take conflicting actions with respect to other undivided interests to the extent that those actions are taken on behalf of participants whose holdings include the undivided interests   securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the euroclear operator are governed by the terms and conditions governing use of euroclear and the related operating procedures of euroclear and applicable belgian law collectively the “terms and conditions” the terms and conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within euroclear withdrawal of securities and cash from euroclear and receipts of payments with respect to securities in euroclear   although dtc euroclear and clearstream have implemented the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in global certificates among participants of dtc euroclear and clearstream they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to comply with the foregoing procedures and the foregoing procedures may be discontinued at any time   description of the pooling agreements   general   the certificates of each series will be issued pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement or other agreement specified in the related prospectus supplement in either case a “pooling agreement” in general the parties to a pooling agreement will include the depositor a trustee a master servicer and in some cases a special servicer appointed as of the date of the pooling agreement however a pooling agreement may include a mortgage asset seller as a party and a pooling agreement that relates to a trust fund that consists solely of mbs may not include a master servicer or other servicer as a party all parties to each pooling agreement under which certificates of a series are issued will be identified in the related prospectus supplement if so specified in the related prospectus supplement an affiliate of the depositor or the mortgage asset seller or an affiliate of the mortgage asset seller may perform the functions of master servicer or special servicer any party to a pooling agreement may own certificates   a form of a pooling agreement has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part however the provisions of each pooling agreement will vary depending upon the nature of the certificates to be issued and the nature of the related trust fund the following summaries describe certain provisions that may appear in a pooling agreement under which certificates that evidence interests in mortgage loans will be issued the prospectus supplement for a series of certificates will describe any provision of the related pooling agreement that materially differs from the        description contained in this prospectus and if the related trust fund includes mbs will summarize all of the material provisions of the related pooling agreement the summaries in this prospectus do not purport to be complete and are subject to and are qualified in their entirety by reference to all of the provisions of the pooling agreement for each series of certificates and the description of those provisions in the related prospectus supplement we will provide a copy of the pooling agreement that relates to any series of certificates without charge upon written request of a holder of a certificate of that series addressed to jp morgan chase commercial mortgage securities corp  madison avenue st floor new york new york  attention president   assignment of mortgage loans repurchases   at the time of issuance of any series of certificates we will assign or cause to be assigned to the designated trustee the mortgage loans to be included in the related trust fund the trustee will concurrently with the assignment deliver the certificates to or at the direction of the depositor in exchange for the mortgage loans and any interest rate or currency swap or interest rate cap floor or collar contracts to be included in the trust fund for that series each mortgage loan will be identified in a schedule that schedule generally will include detailed information that pertains to each mortgage loan included in the related trust fund which information will typically include the address of the related mortgaged property and type of that property the mortgage interest rate and if applicable the applicable index gross margin adjustment date and any rate cap information the original and remaining term to maturity the original amortization term and the original and outstanding principal balance   with respect to each mortgage loan to be included in a trust fund we will deliver or cause to be delivered to the related trustee or to a custodian appointed by the trustee certain loan documents which will generally include the original mortgage note endorsed without recourse to the order of the trustee the original mortgage or a certified copy in each case with evidence of recording indicated on it and an assignment of the mortgage to the trustee in recordable form the related pooling agreement will generally require us or another party to the agreement to promptly cause each assignment of mortgage to be recorded in the appropriate public office for real property records in the event a particular pooling agreement differs with respect to the mortgage file delivery requirements for a particular series the terms will be described in the related prospectus supplement   the trustee or a custodian appointed by the trustee for a series of certificates will be required to review the mortgage loan documents delivered to it within a specified period of days after receipt of the mortgage loan documents and the trustee or that custodian will hold those documents in trust for the benefit of the certificateholders of that series generally if that document is found to be missing or defective and that omission or defect as the case may be materially and adversely affects the interests of the certificateholders of the related series or the value of the mortgage loan affected by such document defect the trustee or that custodian will be required to notify the master servicer and the depositor and one of those persons will be required to notify the relevant mortgage asset seller in that case and if the mortgage asset seller cannot deliver the document or cure the defect within a specified number of days after receipt of that notice then the mortgage asset seller will generally be obligated to repurchase the related mortgage loan from the trustee at a price that will be specified in the related prospectus supplement a mortgage asset seller in lieu of repurchasing a mortgage loan as to which there is missing or defective loan documentation will generally have the option exercisable upon certain conditions andor within a specified period after initial issuance of that series of certificates to replace those mortgage loans with one or more other mortgage loans in accordance with standards that will be described in the prospectus supplement this repurchase or substitution obligation will generally constitute the sole remedy to holders of the certificates of any series or to the related trustee on their behalf for missing or defective loan documentation and neither the depositor nor unless it is the mortgage asset seller the master servicer will be obligated to purchase or replace a mortgage loan if a mortgage asset seller defaults on its obligation to do so notwithstanding the foregoing if a document has not been delivered to the related trustee or to a custodian appointed by the trustee because that document has been submitted for recording and neither that document nor a certified copy in either case with evidence of recording on it can be obtained because of delays on the part of the applicable recording office then the mortgage asset seller will generally not be required to repurchase or replace        the affected mortgage loan on the basis of that missing document so long as it continues in good faith to attempt to obtain that document or that certified copy in the event a particular pooling agreement differs with respect to the above requirements for a particular series the terms will be described in the related prospectus supplement   representations and warranties repurchases   the depositor will with respect to each mortgage loan in the related trust fund make or assign or cause to be made or assigned certain representations and warranties the person making those representations and warranties the “warranting party” covering by way of example   · the accuracy of the information set forth for that mortgage loan on the schedule of mortgage loans delivered upon initial issuance of the certificates     · the enforceability of the related mortgage note and mortgage and the existence of title insurance insuring the lien priority of the related mortgage     · the warranting party’s title to the mortgage loan and the authority of the warranting party to sell the mortgage loan and     · the payment status of the mortgage loan   a brief summary of additional representations and warranties that are applicable to a particular series will be described in the prospectus supplement it is expected that in most cases the warranting party will be the mortgage asset seller however the warranting party may also be an affiliate of the mortgage asset seller the depositor or an affiliate of the depositor the master servicer a special servicer or another person acceptable to the depositor the warranting party if other than the mortgage asset seller will be identified in the related prospectus supplement   each pooling agreement will generally provide that the master servicer andor trustee will be required to notify promptly any warranting party of any breach of any representation or warranty made by it in respect of a mortgage loan that materially and adversely affects the interests of the certificateholders of the related series or the value of the related mortgage loan if that warranting party cannot cure that breach within a specified period following the date on which it was notified of the breach then it will be obligated to repurchase that mortgage loan from the trustee at a price that will be specified in the related prospectus supplement if so provided in the prospectus supplement for a series of certificates a warranting party in lieu of repurchasing a mortgage loan as to which a breach has occurred will have the option exercisable upon certain conditions andor within a specified period after initial issuance of that series of certificates to replace that mortgage loan with one or more other mortgage loans in accordance with standards that will be described in the prospectus supplement this repurchase or substitution obligation will constitute the sole remedy available to holders of the certificates of any series or to the related trustee on their behalf for a breach of representation and warranty by a warranting party and neither the depositor nor the master servicer in either case unless it is the warranting party will be obligated to purchase or replace a mortgage loan if a warranting party defaults on its obligation to do so   in some cases representations and warranties will have been made in respect of a mortgage loan as of a date prior to the date upon which the related series of certificates is issued and thus may not address events that may occur following the date as of which they were made however we will not include any mortgage loan in the trust fund for any series of certificates if anything has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that the representations and warranties made in respect of that mortgage loan will not be accurate in all material respects as of the date of issuance the date as of which the representations and warranties regarding the mortgage loans in any trust fund were made will be specified in the related prospectus supplement        collection and other servicing procedures   the master servicer for any trust fund directly or through subservicers will be required to make reasonable efforts to collect all scheduled payments under the mortgage loans in that trust fund and will be required to follow the same collection procedures as it would follow with respect to mortgage loans that are comparable to the mortgage loans in that trust fund and held for its own account provided those procedures are consistent with          the terms of the related pooling agreement and any related instrument of credit support included in that trust fund          applicable law and          the servicing standard specified in the related pooling agreement and prospectus supplement the “servicing standard”   the master servicer for any trust fund directly or through subservicers

servicer will generally remain obligated under the related pooling agreement a subservicer for any series of certificates may be an affiliate of the depositor or master servicer each subservicing agreement between a master servicer and a subservicer a “subservicing agreement” will generally provide that if for any reason the master servicer is no longer acting in that capacity the trustee or any successor master servicer may assume the master servicer’s rights and obligations under that subservicing agreement a master servicer will be required to monitor the performance of subservicers retained by it and will have the right to remove a subservicer retained by it at any time it considers removal to be in the best interests of certificateholders   generally a master servicer will be solely liable for all fees owed by it to any subservicer irrespective of whether the master servicer’s compensation pursuant to the related pooling agreement is sufficient to pay those fees each subservicer will be reimbursed by the master servicer that retained it for certain expenditures which it makes generally to the same extent the master servicer would be reimbursed under a pooling agreement see “—certificate account” and “—servicing compensation and payment of expenses” in this prospectus   special servicers   to the extent so specified in the related prospectus supplement one

loans   a master servicer or special servicer may agree to modify waive or amend any term of any mortgage loan serviced by it in a manner consistent with the applicable servicing standard and the remic provisions or grantor trust provisions as applicable for example the related prospectus supplement may provide that a mortgage loan may be amended to extend the maturity date or change the interest rate   realization upon defaulted mortgage loans   a borrower’s failure to make required mortgage loan payments may mean that operating income is insufficient to service the mortgage debt or may reflect the diversion of that income from the servicing of the mortgage debt in addition a borrower that is unable to make mortgage loan payments may also be unable to make timely payment of taxes and insurance premiums and to otherwise maintain the related mortgaged property in general the master servicer or the special servicer if any for a series of certificates will be required to monitor any mortgage loan in the related trust fund that is in default evaluate whether the causes of the default can be corrected over a reasonable period without significant impairment of the value of the related mortgaged property initiate corrective action in cooperation with the borrower if cure is likely inspect the related mortgaged property and take any other actions as are consistent with the servicing standard a significant period of time may elapse before the servicer is able to assess the success of the corrective action or the need for additional initiatives   the time within which the servicer can make the initial determination of appropriate action evaluate the success of corrective action develop additional initiatives institute foreclosure proceedings and actually foreclose or accept a deed to a mortgaged property in lieu of foreclosure on behalf of the certificateholders may vary considerably depending on the particular mortgage loan the mortgaged property the borrower the presence of an acceptable party to assume the mortgage loan and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the mortgaged property is located if a borrower files a bankruptcy petition the master servicer may not be permitted to accelerate the maturity of the related mortgage loan or to foreclose on the related mortgaged property for a considerable period of time and that mortgage loan may be restructured in the resulting bankruptcy proceedings see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans” in this prospectus   the related prospectus supplement will describe the remedies available to a servicer in connection with a default on a mortgage loan such remedies include instituting foreclosure proceedings exercising any power of sale contained in mortgage obtaining a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise acquire title to the related mortgaged property by operation of law or otherwise   hazard insurance policies   each pooling agreement will generally require the master servicer to cause each mortgage loan borrower to maintain a hazard insurance policy that provides for the coverage required under the related mortgage or if the mortgage permits the mortgagee to dictate to the borrower the insurance coverage to be maintained on the related mortgaged property the coverage consistent with the requirements of the servicing standard the coverage generally will be in an amount equal to the lesser of the principal balance owing on that mortgage loan and the replacement cost of the related mortgaged property the ability of a master servicer to assure that hazard insurance proceeds are appropriately applied may be dependent upon its being named as an additional insured under any hazard insurance policy and under any other insurance policy referred to below or upon the extent to which information concerning covered losses is furnished by borrowers all amounts collected by a master servicer under that policy except for amounts to be applied to the restoration or repair of the mortgaged property or released to the borrower in accordance with the master servicer’s normal servicing procedures andor to the terms and conditions of the related mortgage and mortgage note will be deposited in the related certificate account the pooling agreement may provide that the master servicer may satisfy its obligation to cause each borrower to maintain a hazard insurance policy by maintaining a blanket policy insuring against hazard losses on all of the mortgage loans in a trust fund if the blanket policy contains a deductible clause the master        servicer will be required in the event of a casualty covered by the blanket policy to deposit in the related certificate account all sums that would have been deposited in that certificate account but for that deductible clause   in general the standard form of fire and extended coverage policy covers physical damage to or destruction of the improvements of the property by fire lightning explosion smoke windstorm and hail and riot strike and civil commotion subject to the conditions and exclusions specified in each policy although the policies covering the mortgaged properties will be underwritten by different insurers under different state laws in accordance with different applicable state forms and therefore will not contain identical terms and conditions most policies typically do not cover any physical damage resulting from war revolution governmental actions floods and other waterrelated causes earth movement including earthquakes landslides and mudflows wet or dry rot vermin domestic animals and certain other kinds of risks accordingly a mortgaged property may not be insured for losses arising from that cause unless the related mortgage specifically requires or permits the mortgagee to require that coverage   the hazard insurance policies covering the mortgaged properties will typically contain coinsurance clauses that in effect require an insured at all times to carry insurance of a specified percentage generally  to  of the full replacement value of the improvements on the property in order to recover the full amount of any partial loss if the insured’s coverage falls below this specified percentage those clauses generally provide that the insurer’s liability in the event of partial loss does not exceed the lesser of  the replacement cost of the improvements less physical depreciation and  that proportion of the loss as the amount of insurance carried bears to the specified percentage of the full replacement cost of those improvements   dueonsale and dueonencumbrance provisions   certain of the mortgage loans may contain a dueonsale clause that entitles the lender to accelerate payment of the mortgage loan upon any sale or other transfer of the related mortgaged property made without the lender’s consent certain of the mortgage loans may also contain a dueonencumbrance clause that entitles the lender to accelerate the maturity of the mortgage loan upon the creation of any other lien or encumbrance upon the mortgaged property the master servicer will determine whether to exercise any right the trustee may have under that provision in a manner consistent with the servicing standard the master servicer will generally be entitled to retain as additional servicing compensation any fee collected in connection with the permitted transfer of a mortgaged property see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—dueonsale and dueonencumbrance” in this prospectus   servicing compensation and payment of expenses   a master servicer’s primary servicing compensation with respect to a series of certificates generally will come from the periodic payment to it of a specified portion of the interest payments on each mortgage loan in the related trust fund because that compensation is generally based on a percentage of the principal balance of each mortgage loan outstanding from time to time it will decrease in accordance with the amortization of the mortgage loans as additional compensation the master servicer may retain all or a portion of late payment charges prepayment premiums modification fees and other fees collected from borrowers and any interest or other income that may be earned on funds held in the certificate account any subservicer will receive a portion of the master servicer’s compensation as its subservicing compensation   in addition to amounts payable to any subservicer a master servicer may be required to the extent provided in the related prospectus supplement to pay from amounts that represent its servicing compensation certain expenses incurred in connection with the administration of the related trust fund including without limitation payment of the fees and disbursements of independent accountants and payment of expenses incurred in connection with distributions and reports to certificateholders certain other expenses including certain expenses related to mortgage loan defaults and liquidations and to the extent so provided in the related prospectus supplement interest on those expenses at the rate specified        in the prospectus supplement and the fees of any special servicer may be required to be borne by the trust fund   if provided in the related prospectus supplement a master servicer may be required to apply a portion of the servicing compensation otherwise payable to it in respect of any period to prepayment interest shortfalls see “yield and maturity considerations—certain shortfalls in collections of interest” in this prospectus   evidence as to compliance   the related prospectus supplement will identify each party that will be required to deliver annually to the trustee master servicer or us as applicable on or before the date

registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the party’s assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria during and as of the end of the prior calendar month   each party that is required to deliver an assessment of compliance will also be required to simultaneously deliver a report an “attestation report” of a registered public accounting firm prepared in accordance with the standards for attestation engagements issued or adopted by the public company accounting oversight board that expresses an opinion or states that an opinion cannot be expressed concerning the party’s assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria   each pooling agreement will also require on or before a specified date in each year the master servicer to furnish to the trustee a statement signed by one or more officers of the master servicer to the effect that the master servicer has fulfilled its material obligations under that pooling agreement

mortgage loans   the following discussion contains general summaries of certain legal aspects of loans secured by commercial and multifamily residential properties because those legal aspects are governed by applicable state law which laws may differ substantially the summaries do not purport to be complete to reflect the laws of any particular state or to encompass the laws of all states in which the security for the mortgage loans or mortgage loans underlying any mbs is situated accordingly the summaries are        qualified in their entirety by reference to the applicable laws of those states see “description of the trust funds—mortgage loans” in this prospectus   general   each mortgage loan will be evidenced by a promissory note or bond and secured by an instrument granting a security interest in real property which may be a mortgage deed of trust or a deed to secure debt depending upon the prevailing practice and law in the state in which the related mortgaged property is located mortgages deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt are in this prospectus collectively referred to as “mortgages” a mortgage creates a lien upon or grants a title interest in the real property covered thereby and represents the security for the repayment of the indebtedness customarily evidenced by a promissory note the priority of the lien created or interest granted will depend on the terms of the mortgage and in some cases on the terms of separate subordination agreements or intercreditor agreements with others that hold interests in the real property the knowledge of the parties to the mortgage and generally the order of recordation of the mortgage in the appropriate public recording office however the lien of a recorded mortgage will generally be subordinate to laterarising liens for real estate taxes and assessments and other charges imposed under governmental police powers   types of mortgage instruments   there are two parties to a mortgage a mortgagor who is the borrower and usually the owner of the subject property and a mortgagee who is the lender in contrast a deed of trust is a threeparty instrument among a trustor who is the equivalent of a borrower a trustee to whom the real property is conveyed and a beneficiary who is the lender for whose benefit the conveyance is made under a deed of trust the trustor grants the property irrevocably until the debt is paid in trust and generally with a power of sale to the trustee to secure repayment of the indebtedness evidenced by the related mortgage note a deed to secure debt typically has two parties the grantor the borrower conveys title to the real property to the grantee the lender generally with a power of sale until the time the debt is repaid in a case where the borrower is a land trust there would be an additional party because a land trustee holds legal title to the property under a land trust agreement for the benefit of the borrower at origination of a mortgage loan involving a land trust the borrower executes a separate undertaking to make payments on the mortgage note the mortgagee’s authority under a mortgage the trustee’s authority under a deed of trust and the grantee’s authority under a deed to secure debt are governed by the express provisions of the related instrument the law of the state in which the real property is located certain federal laws including without limitation the servicemembers civil relief act and in some deed of trust transactions the directions of the beneficiary   leases and rents   mortgages that encumber incomeproducing property often contain an assignment of rents and leases pursuant to which the borrower or with respect to any indemnity deed of trust structure the related property owner assigns to the lender the its right title and interest as landlord under each lease and the income derived therefrom while unless rents are to be paid directly to the lender retaining a revocable license to collect the rents for so long as there is no default if the borrower defaults the license terminates and the lender is entitled to collect the rents local law may require that the lender take possession of the property andor obtain a courtappointed receiver before becoming entitled to collect the rents   in most states hotel and motel room revenue are considered accounts receivable under the uniform commercial code also known as the ucc in cases where hotels or motels constitute loan security the borrower as additional security for the loan generally pledges the revenue in general the lender must file financing statements in order to perfect its security interest in the revenue and must file continuation statements generally every five years to maintain perfection of that security interest even if the lender’s security interest in room revenue is perfected under the ucc it may be required to commence a foreclosure action or otherwise take possession of the property in order to collect the room revenue following a default see “—bankruptcy laws” below        personalty   in the case of certain types of mortgaged properties for instance hotels motels and nursing homes personal property to the extent owned by the borrower and not previously pledged may constitute a significant portion of the property’s value as security the creation and enforcement of liens on personal property are governed by the ucc accordingly if a borrower pledges personal property as security for a mortgage loan the lender generally must file ucc financing statements in order to perfect its security interest in that personal property and must file continuation statements generally every five years to maintain that perfection   foreclosure   general foreclosure is a legal procedure that allows the lender to recover its mortgage debt by enforcing its rights and available legal remedies under the mortgage if the borrower defaults in payment or performance of its obligations under the mortgage note or mortgage the lender has the right to institute foreclosure proceedings to sell the real property at public auction to satisfy the indebtedness   foreclosure procedures vary from state to state two primary methods of foreclosing a mortgage are judicial foreclosure involving court proceedings and nonjudicial foreclosure pursuant to a power of sale granted in the mortgage instrument other foreclosure procedures are available in some states but they are either infrequently used or available only in limited circumstances   a foreclosure action is subject to most of the delays and expenses of other lawsuits if defenses are raised or counterclaims are interposed and sometimes requires several years to complete moreover as discussed below even a noncollusive regularly conducted foreclosure sale may be challenged as a fraudulent conveyance regardless of the parties’ intent if a court determines that the sale was for less than fair consideration and that the sale occurred while the borrower was insolvent and within a specified period prior to the borrower’s filing for bankruptcy protection   judicial foreclosure a judicial foreclosure proceeding is conducted in a court having jurisdiction over the mortgaged property generally the action is initiated by the service of legal pleadings upon all parties having a subordinate interest of record in the real property and all parties in possession of the property under leases or otherwise whose interests are subordinate to the mortgage delays in completion of the foreclosure may occasionally result from difficulties in locating defendants when the lender’s right to foreclose is contested the legal proceedings can be timeconsuming upon successful completion of a judicial foreclosure proceeding the court generally issues a judgment of foreclosure and appoints a referee or other officer to conduct a public sale of the mortgaged property the proceeds of which are used to satisfy the judgment those sales are made in accordance with procedures that vary from state to state   equitable limitations on enforceability of certain provisions united states courts have traditionally imposed general equitable principles to limit the remedies available to lenders in foreclosure actions these principles are generally designed to relieve borrowers from the effects of mortgage defaults perceived as harsh or unfair relying on those principles a court may alter the specific terms of a loan to the extent it considers necessary to prevent or remedy an injustice undue oppression or overreaching or may require the lender to undertake affirmative actions to determine the cause of the borrower’s default and the likelihood that the borrower will be able to reinstate the loan in some cases courts have substituted their judgment for the lenders and have required that lenders reinstate loans or recast payment schedules in order to accommodate borrowers who are suffering from a temporary financial disability in other cases courts have limited the right of the lender to foreclose in the case of a nonmonetary default such as a failure to adequately maintain the mortgaged property or an impermissible further encumbrance of the mortgaged property finally some courts have addressed the issue of whether federal or state constitutional provisions reflecting due process concerns for adequate notice require that a borrower receive notice in addition to statutorilyprescribed minimum notice for the most part these cases have upheld the reasonableness of the notice provisions or have found that a public sale under a mortgage providing for a power of sale does not involve sufficient state action to trigger constitutional protections        nonjudicial foreclosurepower of sale foreclosure of a deed of trust is generally accomplished by a nonjudicial trustee’s sale pursuant to a power of sale typically granted in the deed of trust a power of sale may also be contained in any other type of mortgage instrument if applicable law so permits a power of sale under a deed of trust allows a nonjudicial public sale to be conducted generally following a request from the beneficiarylender to the trustee to sell the property upon default by the borrower and after notice of sale is given in accordance with the terms of the mortgage and applicable state law in some states prior to that sale the trustee under the deed of trust must record a notice of default and notice of sale and send a copy to the borrower and to any other party who has recorded a request for a copy of a notice of default and notice of sale in addition in some states the trustee must provide notice to any other party having an interest of record in the real property including junior lienholders a notice of sale must be posted in a public place and in most states published for a specified period of time in one or more newspapers the borrower or junior lienholder may then have the right during a reinstatement period required in some states to cure the default by paying the entire actual amount in arrears without regard to the acceleration of the indebtedness plus the lender’s expenses incurred in enforcing the obligation in other states the borrower or the junior lienholder is not provided a period to reinstate the loan but has only the right to pay off the entire debt to prevent the foreclosure sale generally state law governs the procedure for public sale the parties entitled to notice the method of giving notice and the applicable time periods   public sale a third party may be unwilling to purchase a mortgaged property at a public sale because of the difficulty in determining the value of that property at the time of sale due to among other things redemption rights which may exist and the possibility of physical deterioration of the property during the foreclosure proceedings potential buyers may be reluctant to purchase property at a foreclosure sale as a result of the  decision of the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit in durrett v washington national insurance company and other decisions that have followed its reasoning the court in durrett held that even a noncollusive regularly conducted foreclosure sale was a fraudulent transfer under the federal bankruptcy code as amended from time to time  usc §§  the “bankruptcy code” and thus could be rescinded in favor of the bankrupt’s estate if  the foreclosure sale was held while the debtor was insolvent and not more than one year prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition and  the price paid for the foreclosed property did not represent “fair consideration” which is “reasonably equivalent value” under the bankruptcy code although the reasoning and result of durrett in respect of the bankruptcy code was rejected by the united states supreme court in bfp v resolution trust corp  us   the case could nonetheless be persuasive to a court applying a state fraudulent conveyance law which has provisions similar to those construed in durrett for these reasons it is common for the lender to purchase the mortgaged property for an amount equal to the lesser of fair market value and the underlying debt and accrued and unpaid interest plus the expenses of foreclosure generally state law controls the amount of foreclosure costs and expenses which may be recovered by a lender thereafter subject to the mortgagor’s right in some states to remain in possession during a redemption period if applicable the lender will become the owner of the property and have both the benefits and burdens of ownership of the mortgaged property for example the lender will have the obligation to pay debt service on any senior mortgages to pay taxes obtain casualty insurance and to make those repairs at its own expense as are necessary to render the property suitable for sale frequently the lender employs a third party management company to manage and operate the property the costs of operating and maintaining a commercial or multifamily residential property may be significant and may be greater than the income derived from that property the costs of management and operation of those mortgaged properties which are hotels motels or restaurants nursing or convalescent homes hospitals or casinos may be particularly significant because of the expertise knowledge and with respect to nursing or convalescent homes hospitals or casinos regulatory compliance required to run those operations and the effect which foreclosure and a change in ownership may have on the public’s and the industry’s including franchisors’ perception of the quality of those operations the lender will commonly obtain the services of a real estate broker and pay the broker’s commission in connection with the sale of the property depending upon market conditions the ultimate proceeds of the sale of the property may not equal the amount of the mortgage against the property moreover a lender commonly incurs substantial legal fees and court costs in acquiring a mortgaged property through contested foreclosure andor bankruptcy proceedings furthermore an increasing number of states require that any environmental contamination at certain types of properties        be cleaned up before a property may be resold in addition a lender may be responsible under federal or state law for the cost of cleaning up a mortgaged property that is environmentally contaminated see “—environmental risks” below   the holder of a junior mortgage that forecloses on a mortgaged property does so subject to senior mortgages and any other prior liens and may be obliged to keep senior mortgage loans current in order to avoid foreclosure of its interest in the property in addition if the foreclosure of a junior mortgage triggers the enforcement of a “dueonsale” clause contained in a senior mortgage the junior mortgagee could be required to pay the full amount of the senior mortgage indebtedness or face foreclosure   rights of redemption the purposes of a foreclosure action are to enable the lender to realize upon its security and to bar the borrower and all persons who have interests in the property that are subordinate to that of the foreclosing lender from exercise of their “equity of redemption” the doctrine of equity of redemption provides that until the property encumbered by a mortgage has been sold in accordance with a properly conducted foreclosure and foreclosure sale those having interests that are subordinate to that of the foreclosing lender have an equity of redemption and may redeem the property by paying the entire debt with interest those having an equity of redemption must generally be made parties and joined in the foreclosure proceeding in order for their equity of redemption to be terminated   the equity of redemption is a commonlaw nonstatutory right which should be distinguished from postsale statutory rights of redemption in some states after sale pursuant to a deed of trust or foreclosure of a mortgage the borrower and foreclosed junior lienors are given a statutory period in which to redeem the property in some states statutory redemption may occur only upon payment of the foreclosure sale price in other states redemption may be permitted if the former borrower pays only a portion of the sums due the effect of a statutory right of redemption is to diminish the ability of the lender to sell the foreclosed property because the exercise of a right of redemption would defeat the title of any purchaser through a foreclosure consequently the practical effect of the redemption right is to force the lender to maintain the property and pay the expenses of ownership until the redemption period has expired in some states a postsale statutory right of redemption may exist following a judicial foreclosure   antideficiency legislation some or all of the mortgage loans may be nonrecourse loans as to which recourse in the case of default will be limited to the mortgaged property and those other assets if any that were pledged to secure the mortgage loan however even if a mortgage loan by its terms provides for recourse to the borrower’s other assets a lender’s ability to realize upon those assets may be limited by state law for example in some states a lender cannot obtain a deficiency judgment against the borrower following foreclosure or sale under a deed of trust a deficiency judgment is a personal judgment against the former borrower equal to the difference between the net amount realized upon the public sale of the real property and the amount due to the lender other statutes may require the lender to exhaust the security afforded under a mortgage before bringing a personal action against the borrower in certain other states the lender has the option of bringing a personal action against the borrower on the debt without first exhausting that security however in some of those states the lender following judgment on that personal action may be deemed to have elected a remedy and thus may be precluded from foreclosing upon the security consequently lenders in those states where an election of remedy provision exists will usually proceed first against the security finally other statutory provisions designed to protect borrowers from exposure to large deficiency judgments that might result from bidding at belowmarket values at the foreclosure sale limit any deficiency judgment to the excess of the outstanding debt over the fair market value of the property at the time of the sale   leasehold risks mortgage loans may be secured by a mortgage on the borrower’s leasehold interest in a ground lease leasehold mortgage loans are subject to certain risks not associated with mortgage loans secured by a lien on the fee estate of the borrower the most significant of these risks is that if the borrower’s leasehold were to be terminated upon a lease default the leasehold mortgagee would lose its security this risk may be lessened if the ground lease requires the lessor to give the leasehold mortgagee notices of lessee defaults and an opportunity to cure them permits the leasehold estate to be assigned to and by the leasehold mortgagee or the purchaser at a foreclosure sale and contains certain other protective provisions typically included in a “mortgageable” ground lease        cooperative shares mortgage loans may be secured by a security interest on the borrower’s ownership interest in shares and the proprietary leases appurtenant thereto allocable to cooperative dwelling units that may be vacant or occupied by nonowner tenants those loans are subject to certain risks not associated with mortgage loans secured by a lien on the fee estate of a borrower in real property this kind of loan typically is subordinate to the mortgage if any on the cooperative’s building which if foreclosed could extinguish the equity in the building and the proprietary leases of the dwelling units derived from ownership of the shares of the cooperative further transfer of shares in a cooperative are subject to various regulations as well as to restrictions under the governing documents of the cooperative and the shares may be cancelled in the event that associated maintenance charges due under the related proprietary leases are not paid typically a recognition agreement between the lender and the cooperative provides among other things the lender with an opportunity to cure a default under a proprietary lease   under the laws applicable in many states “foreclosure” on cooperative shares is accomplished by a sale in accordance with the provisions of article  of the ucc and the security agreement relating to the shares article  of the ucc requires that a sale be conducted in a “commercially reasonable” manner which may be dependent upon among other things the notice given the debtor and the method manner time place and terms of the sale article  of the ucc provides that the proceeds of the sale will be applied first to pay the costs and expenses of the sale and then to satisfy the indebtedness secured by the lender’s security interest a recognition agreement however generally provides that the lender’s right to reimbursement is subject to the right of the cooperative to receive sums due under the proprietary leases   bankruptcy laws   generally the bankruptcy code and related state laws may interfere with or affect the ability of a lender to realize upon collateral andor to enforce a deficiency judgment for example under the bankruptcy code virtually all actions including foreclosure actions and deficiency judgment proceedings are automatically stayed upon the filing of the bankruptcy petition and usually no interest or principal payments are made during the course of the bankruptcy case the delay and the consequences of a delay caused by an automatic stay can be significant also under the bankruptcy code the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or on behalf of a junior lienor may stay the senior lender from taking action to foreclose out a junior lien   under the bankruptcy code provided certain substantive and procedural safeguards for the lender are met the amount and terms of a mortgage secured by property of the debtor may be modified in addition under certain circumstances the outstanding amount of the loan secured by the real property may be reduced to the thencurrent value of the property with a corresponding partial reduction of the amount of the lender’s security interest pursuant to a confirmed plan or lien avoidance proceeding thus leaving the lender a general unsecured creditor for the difference between the value and the outstanding balance of the loan other modifications may include the reduction in the amount of each scheduled payment which reduction may result from a reduction in the rate of interest andor the alteration of the repayment schedule with or without affecting the unpaid principal balance of the loan andor an extension or reduction of the final maturity date some courts have approved bankruptcy plans based on the particular facts of the reorganization case that effected the curing of a mortgage loan default by paying arrearages over a number of years also under federal bankruptcy law a bankruptcy court may permit a debtor through its rehabilitative plan to deaccelerate a secured loan and to reinstate the loan even though the lender accelerated the mortgage loan and final judgment of foreclosure had been entered in state court provided no sale of the property had yet occurred prior to the filing of the debtor’s petition this may be done even if the plan of reorganization does not provide for payment in full of the amount due under the original loan thus the full amount due under the original loan may never be repaid other types of significant modifications to the terms of the mortgage may be acceptable to the bankruptcy court such as making distributions to the mortgage holder of property other than cash or the substitution of collateral which is the “indubitable equivalent” of the real property subject to the mortgage or the subordination of the mortgage to liens securing new debt provided that the lender’s secured claim        is “adequately protected” as such term is defined and interpreted under the bankruptcy code often depending on the particular facts and circumstances of the specific case   the bankruptcy code provides that a lender’s perfected prepetition security interest in leases rents and hotel revenues continues in the postpetition leases rents and hotel revenues unless a bankruptcy court orders to the contrary “based on the equities of the case” the equities of a particular case may permit the discontinuance of security interests in prepetition leases and rents thus unless a court orders otherwise revenues from a mortgaged property generated after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed will normally constitute “cash collateral” under the bankruptcy code debtors may only use cash collateral upon obtaining the lender’s consent or a prior court order finding that the lender’s interest in the mortgaged property and the cash collateral is “adequately protected” as the term is defined and interpreted under the bankruptcy code in addition to postpetition rents any cash held by a lender in a lockbox or reserve account would also constitute “cash collateral” under the bankruptcy code so long as the lender is adequately protected a debtor’s use of cash collateral may be for its own benefit or for the benefit of any affiliated entity group that is also subject to bankruptcy proceedings including use as collateral for new debt it should be noted however that the court may find that the lender has no security interest in either prepetition or postpetition revenues if the court finds that the loan documents do not contain language covering accounts room rents or other forms of personalty necessary for a security interest to attach to hotel revenues   federal bankruptcy law provides generally that rights and obligations under an unexpired lease of the debtorlessee may not be terminated or modified at any time after the commencement of a case under the bankruptcy code solely because of a provision in the lease to that effect or because of certain other similar events this prohibition on socalled “ipso facto clauses” could limit the ability of the trustee to exercise certain contractual remedies with respect to the leases on any mortgaged property in addition section  of the bankruptcy code operates as an automatic stay of among other things any act to obtain possession of property from a debtor’s estate which may delay a trustee’s exercise of those remedies including foreclosure in the event that a lessee becomes the subject of a proceeding under the bankruptcy code for example a mortgagee would be stayed from enforcing an assignment by a borrower of rents and leases related to a mortgaged property if the related borrower was in a bankruptcy proceeding the legal proceedings necessary to resolve the issues could be timeconsuming and might result in significant delays in the receipt of the assigned rents similarly the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or on behalf of a lessee of a mortgaged property would result in a stay against the commencement or continuation of any state court proceeding for past due rent for accelerated rent for damages or for a summary eviction order with respect to a default under the related lease that occurred prior to the filing of the lessee’s petition while relief from the automatic stay to enforce remedies may be requested it can be denied for a number of reasons including where the collateral is “necessary to an effective reorganization” for the debtor and if a debtor’s case has been administratively consolidated with those of its affiliates the court may also consider whether the property is “necessary to an effective reorganization” of the debtor and its affiliates taken as a whole   rents and leases may also escape an assignment i if the assignment is not fully perfected under state law prior to commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding ii to the extent such rents and leases are used by the borrower to maintain the mortgaged property or for other court authorized expenses iii to the extent other collateral may be substituted for the rents and leases or iv to the extent the bankruptcy court determines that the lender is adequately protected   in addition the bankruptcy code generally provides that a trustee or debtorinpossession may with respect to an unexpired lease of nonresidential real property before the earlier of i  days after the filing of a bankruptcy case or ii the entry of an order confirming a plan subject to approval of the court a assume the lease and retain it or assign it to a third party or b reject the lease if the trustee or debtorinpossession fails to assume or reject the lease within the time specified in the preceding sentence subject to any extensions by the bankruptcy court the lease will be deemed rejected and the property will be surrendered to the lessor the bankruptcy court may for cause shown extend the day period up to  days for a total of  days if the lease is assumed the trustee in bankruptcy on behalf of the lessee or the lessee as debtorinpossession or the assignee if applicable must cure any        defaults under the lease compensate the lessor for its losses and provide the lessor with “adequate assurance” of future performance however these remedies may in fact be insufficient and the lessor may be forced to continue under the lease with a lessee that is a poor credit risk or an unfamiliar tenant if the lease was assigned if the lease is rejected the rejection generally constitutes a breach of the executory contract or unexpired lease immediately before the date of filing the petition as a consequence the other party or parties to the lease such as the borrower as lessor under a lease generally would have only an unsecured claim against the debtor for damages resulting from the breach which could adversely affect the security for the related mortgage loan in addition pursuant to section b of the bankruptcy code a lessor’s damages for lease rejection in respect of future rent installments are limited to the rent reserved by the lease without acceleration for the greater of one year or  percent not to exceed three years of the remaining term of the lease   if a trustee in bankruptcy on behalf of a lessor or a lessor as debtorinpossession rejects an unexpired lease of real property the lessee may treat the lease as terminated by the rejection or in the alternative the lessee may remain in possession of the leasehold for the balance of the term and for any renewal or extension of the term that is enforceable by the lessee under applicable nonbankruptcy law the bankruptcy code provides that if a lessee elects to remain in possession after a rejection of a lease the lessee may offset against rents reserved under the lease for the balance of the term after the date of rejection of the lease and the related renewal or extension of the lease any damages occurring after that date caused by the nonperformance of any obligation of the lessor under the lease after that date   in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding involving a borrower action may be taken seeking the recovery as a preferential transfer of any payments made by such borrower or made directly by the related lessee under the related mortgage loan to the trust fund payments on long term debt may be protected from recovery as preferences if they qualify for the “ordinary course” exception under the bankruptcy code or if certain of the other defenses in the bankruptcy code are applicable whether any particular payment would be protected depends upon the facts specific to a particular transaction   in addition in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding involving any borrower an action may be taken to avoid the transaction or any component of the transaction such as joint and several liability on the related mortgage loan as an actual or constructive fraudulent conveyance under state or federal law any payment by a borrower in excess of its allocated share of the loan could be challenged as a fraudulent conveyance by creditors of that borrower in an action outside a bankruptcy case or by the representative of the borrower’s bankruptcy estate in a bankruptcy case generally under federal and most state fraudulent conveyance statutes the incurrence of an obligation or the transfer of property by a person will be subject to avoidance under certain circumstances if the person did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such obligation or transfer and i was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by such obligation or transfer ii was engaged in business or a transaction or was about to engage in business or a transaction for which any property remaining with the person constituted unreasonably small capital or iii intended to or believed that it would incur debts that would be beyond the person’s ability to pay as such debts matured the measure of insolvency will vary depending on the law of the applicable jurisdiction however an entity will generally be considered insolvent if the present fair salable value of its assets is less than x the sum of its debts or y the amount that would be required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts as they become absolute and matured accordingly a lien granted by a borrower to secure repayment of the loan in excess of its allocated share could be avoided if a court were to determine that i such borrower was insolvent at the time of granting the lien was rendered insolvent by the granting of the lien was left with inadequate capital or was not able to pay its debts as they matured and ii the borrower did not when it allowed its property to be encumbered by a lien securing the entire indebtedness represented by the loan receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for pledging such property for the equal benefit of each other borrower   under sections b and f of the bankruptcy code a trustee or a borrower as debtor in possession may under certain circumstances despite the provisions of the related mortgage to the contrary sell the related mortgaged property free and clear of all liens which liens would then attach to        the proceeds of such sale such a sale may be approved by a bankruptcy court even if the proceeds are insufficient to pay the secured debt in full   pursuant to section  of the bankruptcy code a bankruptcy court may under certain circumstances authorize a debtor to obtain credit after the commencement of a bankruptcy case secured among other things by senior equal or junior liens on property that is already subject to a lien in the bankruptcy case of general growth properties filed on april   the debtors initially sought approval of a debtorinpossession loan to the corporate parent entities guaranteed by the propertylevel special purpose entities and secured by second liens on their properties although the debtorinpossession loan subsequently was modified to eliminate the subsidiary guarantees and second liens there can be no assurance that in the event of a bankruptcy of the sponsor of the borrower the sponsor of the borrower would not seek approval of a similar debtorinpossession loan or that a bankruptcy court would not approve a debtorinpossession loan that included such subsidiary guarantees and second liens on such subsidiaries’ properties   a trustee in bankruptcy in some cases may be entitled to collect its costs and expenses in preserving or selling the mortgaged property ahead of payment to the lender in certain circumstances a debtor in bankruptcy may have the power to grant liens senior to the lien of a mortgage and analogous state statutes and general principles of equity may also provide a borrower with means to halt a foreclosure proceeding or sale and to force a restructuring of a mortgage loan on terms a lender would not otherwise accept moreover the laws of certain states also give priority to certain tax liens over the lien of a mortgage or deed of trust under the bankruptcy code if the court finds that actions of the mortgagee have been unreasonable the lien of the related mortgage may be subordinated to the claims of unsecured creditors   certain of the borrowers may be partnerships the laws governing limited partnerships in certain states provide that the commencement of a case under the bankruptcy code with respect to a general partner will cause a person to cease to be a general partner of the limited partnership unless otherwise provided in writing in the limited partnership agreement this provision may be construed as an “ipso facto” clause and in the event of the general partner’s bankruptcy may not be enforceable certain limited partnership agreements of the borrowers may provide that the commencement of a case under the bankruptcy code with respect to the related general partner constitutes an event of withdrawal assuming the enforceability of the clause is not challenged in bankruptcy proceedings or if challenged is upheld that might trigger the dissolution of the limited partnership the winding up of its affairs and the distribution of its assets unless i at the time there was at least one other general partner and the written provisions of the limited partnership permit the business of the limited partnership to be carried on by the remaining general partner and that general partner does so or ii the written provisions of the limited partnership agreement permit the limited partners to agree within a specified time frame often  days after the withdrawal to continue the business of the limited partnership and to the appointment of one or more general partners and the limited partners do so in addition the laws governing general partnerships in certain states provide that the commencement of a case under the bankruptcy code or state bankruptcy laws with respect to a general partner of the partnerships triggers the dissolution of the partnership the winding up of its affairs and the distribution of its assets those state laws however may not be enforceable or effective in a bankruptcy case the dissolution of a borrower the winding up of its affairs and the distribution of its assets could result in an acceleration of its payment obligation under the borrower’s mortgage loan which may reduce the yield on the certificates in the same manner as a principal prepayment   in addition the bankruptcy of the general or limited partner of a borrower that is a partnership or the bankruptcy of a member of a borrower that is a limited liability company or the bankruptcy of a shareholder of a borrower that is a corporation may provide the opportunity in the bankruptcy case of the partner member or shareholder to obtain an order from a court consolidating the assets and liabilities of the partner member or shareholder with those of the mortgagor pursuant to the doctrines of substantive consolidation or piercing the corporate veil in such a case the respective mortgaged property for example would become property of the estate of the bankrupt partner member or shareholder not only would the mortgaged property be available to satisfy the claims of creditors of the partner member or        shareholder but an automatic stay would apply to any attempt by the trustee to exercise remedies with respect to the mortgaged property however such an occurrence should not affect the trustee’s status as a secured creditor with respect to the mortgagor or its security interest in the mortgaged property   a borrower that is a limited partnership in many cases may be required by the loan documents to have a special purpose entity as its sole general partner and a borrower that is a general partnership in many cases may be required by the loan documents to have as its general partners only entities that are special purpose entities a borrower that is a limited liability company may be required by the loan documents to have a special purpose member or a springing member all borrowers that are tenantsincommon may be required by the loan documents to be special purpose entities these provisions are designed to mitigate the risk of the dissolution or bankruptcy of the borrower partnership or its general partner a borrower limited liability company or its member if applicable or a borrower that is a tenantincommon however we cannot assure you that any borrower partnership or its general partner or any borrower limited liability company or its member if applicable or a borrower that is a tenantincommon will not dissolve or become a debtor under the bankruptcy code   environmental risks   real property pledged as security for a mortgage loan may be subject to certain environmental risks under federal law including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended also known as “cercla” and the laws of certain states failure to perform the remediation required or demanded by the state or federal government of any condition or circumstance that   · may pose an imminent or substantial endangerment to human health or welfare or the environment     · may result in a release or threatened release of any hazardous material     · may give rise to any environmental claim or demand or     · may give rise to a lien on the property to ensure the reimbursement of remedial costs incurred by the federal or state government in several states the lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against the property of particular concern may be those mortgaged properties which are or have been the site of manufacturing industrial or hazardous material treatment storage or disposal activity those environmental risks may give rise to a a diminution in value of property securing a mortgage note or the inability to foreclose against the property or b in certain circumstances as more fully described below liability for cleanup costs or other remedial actions which liability could exceed the value of the property the aggregate assets of the owner or operator or the principal balance of the related indebtedness   the state of the law is currently unclear as to whether and under what circumstances cleanup costs or the obligation to take remedial actions could be imposed on a secured lender under the laws of some states and under cercla a lender may become liable as an “owner” or an “operator” of a contaminated mortgaged property for the costs of remediation of releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at the mortgaged property the liability may attach if the lender or its agents or employees have participated in the management of the operations of the borrower even though the environmental damage or threat was caused by a prior owner operator or other third party   excluded from cercla’s definition of “owner or operator” is any person “who without participating in the management of a vessel or facility holds indicia of ownership primarily to protect his security interest” the “securedcreditor exemption” this exemption for holders of a security interest such as a secured lender applies only in circumstances when the lender seeks to protect its security interest in the contaminated facility or property thus if a lender’s activities encroach on the actual management of that facility or property or of the borrower the lender faces potential liability as an “owner or operator” under cercla similarly when a lender forecloses and takes title to a contaminated facility or property        whether it holds the facility or property as an investment or leases it to a third party under some circumstances the lender may incur potential cercla liability   amendments to cercla provide examples of permissible actions that may be undertaken by a lender holding security in a contaminated facility without exceeding the bounds of the securedcreditor exemption subject to certain conditions and limitations additionally the amendments provide certain protections from cercla liability as an “owner or operator” to a lender who forecloses on contaminated property as long as it seeks to divest itself of the facility at the earliest practicable commercially reasonable time on commercially reasonable terms the amendments also limit the potential liability of lenders under the federal solid waste disposal act for costs of responding to leaking underground storage tanks however the protections afforded lenders under the amendments are subject to terms and conditions that have not been clarified by the courts moreover the cercla securedcreditor exemption does not necessarily affect the potential for liability in actions under other federal or state laws which may impose liability on “owners or operators” but do not incorporate the securedcreditor exemption furthermore the securedcreditor exemption does not protect lenders from other bases of cercla liability such as that imposed on “generators” or “transporters” of hazardous substances   environmental cleanup costs may be substantial it is possible that those costs could become a liability of the applicable trust fund and occasion a loss to certificateholders if those remedial costs were incurred   in a few states transfers of some types of properties are conditioned upon cleanup of contamination prior to transfer it is possible that a property securing a mortgage loan could be subject to these transfer restrictions if this occurs and if the lender becomes the owner upon foreclosure the lender may be required to clean up the contamination before selling the property   the cost of remediating hazardous substance contamination at a property can be substantial if a lender is or becomes liable it can bring an action for contribution against the owner or operator that created the environmental hazard but that person or entity may be without substantial assets accordingly it is possible that these costs could become a liability of a trust fund and occasion a loss to certificateholders of the related series   to reduce the likelihood of this kind of loss the related pooling agreement may provide that the master servicer may not on behalf of the trust fund acquire title to a mortgaged property or take over its operation unless the master servicer based on a report prepared by a person who regularly conducts environmental site assessments has made the determination that it is appropriate to do so there can be no assurance that any environmental site assessment obtained by the master servicer will detect all possible environmental contamination or conditions or that the other requirements of the related pooling and servicing agreement even if fully observed by the master servicer will in fact insulate the related trust fund from liability with respect to environmental matters   even when a lender is not directly liable for cleanup costs on property securing loans if a property securing a loan is contaminated the value of the security is likely to be affected in addition a lender bears the risk that unanticipated cleanup costs may jeopardize the borrower’s repayment neither of these two issues is likely to pose risks exceeding the amount of unpaid principal and interest of a particular loan secured by a contaminated property particularly if the lender declines to foreclose on a mortgage secured by the property   if a lender forecloses on a mortgage secured by a property the operations of which are subject to environmental laws and regulations the lender will be required to operate the property in accordance with those laws and regulations compliance could be complicated and may entail substantial expense   in addition a lender may be obligated to disclose environmental conditions on a property to government entities andor to prospective buyers including prospective buyers at a foreclosure sale or following foreclosure that disclosure may decrease the amount that prospective buyers are willing to pay for the affected property and thereby lessen the ability of the lender to recover its investment in a loan upon foreclosure        dueonsale and dueonencumbrance   certain of the mortgage loans may contain “dueonsale” and “dueonencumbrance” clauses that purport to permit the lender to accelerate the maturity of the loan if the borrower transfers or encumbers the related mortgaged property the garnst germain depository institutions act of  the “garn act” generally preempts state laws that prohibit the enforcement of dueonsale clauses by providing among other things that “dueonsale” clauses in certain loans are enforceable within certain limitations as set forth in the garn act therefore subject to those limitations a master servicer may have the right to accelerate the maturity of a mortgage loan that contains a “dueonsale” provision upon transfer of an interest in the property whether or not the master servicer can demonstrate that the transfer threatens its security interest in the property   subordinate financing   certain of the mortgage loans may not restrict the ability of the borrower to use the mortgaged property as security for one or more additional loans where a borrower encumbers a mortgaged property with one or more junior liens the senior lender is subjected to additional risk first the borrower may have difficulty servicing and repaying multiple loans moreover if the subordinate financing permits recourse to the borrower as is frequently the case and the senior loan does not a borrower may have more incentive to repay sums due on the subordinate loan second acts of the senior lender that prejudice the junior lender or impair the junior lender’s security may create a superior equity in favor of the junior lender for example if the borrower and the senior lender agree to an increase in the principal amount of or the interest rate payable on the senior loan the senior lender may lose its priority to the extent any existing junior lender is harmed or the borrower is additionally burdened third if the borrower defaults on the senior loan andor any junior loan or loans the existence of junior loans and actions taken by junior lenders can impair the security available to the senior lender and can interfere with or delay the taking of action by the senior lender moreover the bankruptcy of a junior lender may operate to stay foreclosure or similar proceedings by the senior lender   default interest and limitations on prepayments   mortgage notes and mortgages may contain provisions that obligate the borrower to pay a late charge or additional interest if payments are not timely made and in some circumstances may prohibit prepayments for a specified period andor condition prepayments upon the borrower’s payment of prepayment fees or yield maintenance penalties in certain states there are or may be specific limitations upon the late charges which a lender may collect from a borrower for delinquent payments certain states also limit the amounts that a lender may collect from a borrower as an additional charge or fee if the loan is prepaid in addition the enforceability of provisions that provide for prepayment fees or penalties upon an involuntary prepayment is unclear under the laws of many states   applicability of usury laws   title v of the depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act of  “title v” provides that state usury limitations shall not apply to certain types of residential including multifamily but not commercial first mortgage loans originated by certain lenders after march   a similar federal statute was in effect with respect to mortgage loans made during the first three months of  the statute authorized any state to reimpose interest rate limits by adopting before april   a law or constitutional provision that expressly rejects application of the federal law in addition even where title v is not so rejected any state is authorized by the law to adopt a provision limiting discount points or other charges on mortgage loans covered by title v certain states have taken action to reimpose interest rate limits andor to limit discount points or other charges   in any state in which application of title v has been expressly rejected or a provision limiting discount points or other charges has been adopted no mortgage loan originated after the date of that state action will if originated after that rejection or adoption be eligible for inclusion in a trust fund unless  the mortgage loan provides for an interest rate discount points and charges as are permitted in that state or         the mortgage loan provides that the terms are to be construed in accordance with the laws of another state under which the interest rate discount points and charges would not be usurious and the borrower’s counsel has rendered an opinion that the choice of law provision would be given effect   statutes differ in their provisions as to the consequences of a usurious loan one group of statutes requires the lender to forfeit the interest due above the applicable limit or impose a specified penalty under this statutory scheme the borrower may cancel the recorded mortgage or deed of trust upon paying its debt with lawful interest and the lender may foreclose but only for the debt plus lawful interest a second group of statutes is more severe a violation of this type of usury law results in the invalidation of the transaction thereby permitting the borrower to cancel the recorded mortgage or deed of trust without any payment or prohibiting the lender from foreclosing   servicemembers civil relief act   under the terms of the servicemembers civil relief act the “relief act” a borrower who enters military service after the origination of that borrower’s mortgage loan including a borrower who was in reserve status and is called to active duty after origination of the mortgage loan upon notification by such borrower shall not be charged interest including fees and charges in excess of  per annum during the period of that borrower’s active duty status in addition to adjusting the interest the lender must forgive any such interest in excess of  unless a court or administrative agency orders otherwise upon application of the lender the relief act applies to individuals who are members of the army navy air force marines national guard reserves coast guard and officers of the us public health service or the national oceanic and atmospheric administration assigned to duty with the military because the relief act applies to individuals who enter military service including reservists who are called to active duty after origination of the related mortgage loan no information can be provided as to the number of loans with individuals as borrowers that may be affected by the relief act application of the relief act would adversely affect for an indeterminate period of time the ability of any servicer to collect full amounts of interest on certain of the mortgage loans any shortfalls in interest collections resulting from the application of the relief act would result in a reduction of the amounts distributable to the holders of the related series of certificates and would not be covered by advances or any form of credit support provided in connection with those certificates in addition the relief act imposes limitations that would impair the ability of the servicer to foreclose on an affected mortgage loan during the borrower’s period of active duty status and under certain circumstances during an additional threemonth period thereafter   type of mortgaged property   the lender may be subject to additional risk depending upon the type and use of the mortgaged property in question for instance mortgaged properties which are hospitals nursing homes or convalescent homes may present special risks to lenders in large part due to significant governmental regulation of the operation maintenance control and financing of health care institutions mortgages on mortgaged properties which are owned by the borrower under a condominium form of ownership are subject to the declaration bylaws and other rules and regulations of the condominium association mortgaged properties which are hotels or motels may present additional risk to the lender in that          hotels and motels are typically operated pursuant to franchise management and operating agreements which may be terminable by the operator and          the transferability of the hotel’s operating liquor and other licenses to the entity acquiring the hotel either through purchase or foreclosure is subject to the vagaries of local law requirements   in addition mortgaged properties which are multifamily properties or cooperatively owned multifamily properties may be subject to rent control laws which could impact the future cash flows of those properties        americans with disabilities act   under title iii of the americans with disabilities act of  and rules promulgated under this act the “ada” in order to protect individuals with disabilities public accommodations such as hotels restaurants shopping centers hospitals schools and social service center establishments must remove architectural and communication barriers which are structural in nature from existing places of public accommodation to the extent “readily achievable” in addition under the ada alterations to a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility are to be made so that to the maximum extent feasible the altered portions are readily accessible to and usable by disabled individuals the “readily achievable” standard takes into account among other factors the financial resources of the affected site owner landlord or other applicable person in addition to imposing a possible financial burden on the borrower in its capacity as owner or landlord the ada may also impose these requirements on a foreclosing lender who succeeds to the interest of the borrower as owner or landlord furthermore since the “readily achievable” standard may vary depending on the financial condition of the owner or landlord a foreclosing lender who is financially more capable than the borrower of complying with the requirements of the ada may be subject to more stringent requirements than those to which the borrower is subject   antimoney laundering economic sanctions and bribery   many jurisdictions have adopted wideranging antimoney laundering economic and trade sanctions and anticorruption and antibribery laws and regulations collectively the “requirements”  any of the depositor the issuing entity the underwriters the master servicer the special servicer or the trustee could be requested or required to obtain certain assurances from prospective investors intending to purchase certificates and to retain such information or to disclose information pertaining to them to governmental regulatory or other authorities or to financial intermediaries or engage in due diligence or take other related actions in the future  it is the policy of the depositor the issuing entity the underwriters the master servicer the special servicer and the trustee to comply with requirements to which they are or may become subject and to interpret such requirements broadly in favor of disclosure  failure to honor any request by the depositor the issuing entity the underwriters the master servicer the special servicer or the trustee to provide requested information or take such other actions as may be necessary or advisable for the depositor the issuing entity the underwriters the master servicer the special servicer or the trustee to comply with any requirements related legal process or appropriate requests whether formal or informal may result in among other things a forced sale to another investor of such investor’s certificates  in addition each of the depositor the issuing entity the underwriters the master servicer the special servicer and the trustee intends to comply with the us bank secrecy act the united and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of  the “patriot act” and any other antimoney laundering and antiterrorism economic and trade sanctions and anticorruption or antibribery laws and regulations of the united states and other countries and will disclose any information required or requested by authorities in connection therewith   potential forfeiture of assets   federal law provides that assets including property purchased or improved with assets derived from criminal activity or otherwise tainted or used in the commission of certain offenses is subject to the blocking requirements of economic sanctions laws and regulations and can be blocked andor seized and ordered forfeited to the united states of america a number of offenses can trigger such a blocking andor seizure and forfeiture including among others violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act the bank secrecy act the money laundering control act the usa patriot act and the regulations issued pursuant to all of them as well as the controlled substance laws in many instances the united states may seize the property civilly without a criminal prosecution    in the event of a forfeiture proceeding a financial institution that is a lender may be able to establish its interest in the property by proving that a its mortgage was executed and recorded before the commission of the illegal conduct from which the assets used to purchase or improve the property were        derived or before the commission of any other crime upon which the forfeiture is based or b at the time of the execution of the mortgage despite appropriate due diligence it “did not know or was reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture” however there is no assurance that such a defense will be successful    material federal income tax consequences   the following is a general discussion of the anticipated material federal income tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of certificates the discussion below does not purport to address all federal income tax consequences that may be applicable to particular categories of investors some of which may be subject to special rules further the authorities on which this discussion is based are subject to change or differing interpretations and any change or interpretation could apply retroactively no rulings have been or will be sought from the internal revenue service the “irs” with respect to any of the federal income tax consequences discussed below accordingly the irs may take contrary positions this discussion reflects the applicable provisions of the code as well as regulations the “remic regulations” promulgated by the us department of treasury the “treasury” investors should consult their own tax advisors in determining the federal state local and other tax consequences to them of the purchase ownership and disposition of certificates   for purposes of this discussion  references to the mortgage loans include references to the mortgage loans underlying mbs included in the mortgage assets and  where the applicable prospectus supplement provides for a fixed retained yield with respect to the mortgage loans underlying a series of certificates references to the mortgage loans will be deemed to refer to that portion of the mortgage loans held by the trust fund which does not include the retained interest references to a “holder” or “certificateholder” in this discussion generally mean the beneficial owner of a certificate   federal income tax consequences for remic certificates   general   with respect to a particular series of certificates an election may be made to treat the trust fund or one or more segregated pools of assets in the trust fund as one or more remics within the meaning of code section d a trust fund or a portion of a trust fund as to which a remic election is made will be referred to as a “remic pool” for purposes of this discussion certificates of a series as to which one or more remic elections are made are referred to as “remic certificates” and will consist of one or more classes of “regular certificates” and one class of residual certificates in the case of each remic pool qualification as a remic requires ongoing compliance with certain conditions with respect to each series of remic certificates cadwalader wickersham  taft llp counsel to the depositor will deliver its opinion generally to the effect that assuming          the making of an election          compliance with the pooling agreement and any other governing documents and          compliance with any changes in the law including any amendments to the code or applicable treasury regulations under the code   each remic pool will qualify as a remic   in that case the regular certificates will be considered to be “regular interests” in the remic pool and generally will be treated for federal income tax purposes as if they were newly originated debt instruments and the residual certificates will be considered to be “residual interests” in the remic pool the prospectus supplement for each series of certificates will indicate whether one or more remic elections with respect to the related trust fund will be made in which event references to “remic” or “remic pool” below shall be deemed to refer to that remic pool if so specified in the applicable        prospectus supplement the portion of a trust fund as to which a remic election is not made may be treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes see “—federal income tax consequences for certificates as to which no remic election is made” below   characterization of investments in remic certificates   remic certificates held by a domestic building and loan association will constitute “a regular or residual interest in a remic” within the meaning of code section acxi but only in the same proportion that the assets of the remic pool would be treated as “loans    secured by an interest in real property which is    residential real property” such as single family or multifamily properties but not commercial properties within the meaning of code section acv or as other assets described in code section ac and otherwise will not qualify for that treatment remic certificates held by a real estate investment trust will constitute “real estate assets” within the meaning of code section cb and interest including original issue discount on the regular certificates and income with respect to residual certificates will be considered “interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property” within the meaning of code section cb if received by a real estate investment trust in the same proportion that for both purposes the assets of the remic pool would be so treated if at all times  or more of the assets of the remic pool qualify for each of the foregoing respective treatments the remic certificates will qualify for the corresponding status in their entirety mortgage loans held by the remic pool that have been defeased with us treasury obligations will not qualify for the foregoing treatments for purposes of code section cb payments of principal and interest on the mortgage loans that are reinvested pending distribution to holders of remic certificates qualify for that treatment where two remic pools are a part of a tiered structure they will be treated as one remic for purposes of the tests described above respecting asset ownership of more or less than  regular certificates will be “qualified mortgages” for another remic for purposes of code section ga remic certificates held by a regulated investment company will not constitute “government securities” within the meaning of code section bai remic certificates held by certain financial institutions will constitute an “evidence of indebtedness” within the meaning of code section c   qualification as a remic   in order for the remic pool to qualify as a remic there must be ongoing compliance on the part of the remic pool with the requirements set forth in the code the remic pool must fulfill an asset test which requires that no more than a de minimis portion of the assets of the remic pool as of the close of the third calendar month beginning after the “startup day” which for purposes of this discussion is the date of issuance of the remic certificates and at all times thereafter may consist of assets other than “qualified mortgages” and “permitted investments” the remic regulations provide a safe harbor pursuant to which the de minimis requirement is met if at all times the aggregate adjusted basis of the nonqualified assets is less than  of the aggregate adjusted basis of all the remic pool’s assets an entity that fails to meet the safe harbor may nevertheless demonstrate that it holds no more than a de minimis amount of nonqualified assets a remic also must provide “reasonable arrangements” to prevent its residual interest from being held by “disqualified organizations” and must furnish applicable tax information to transferors or agents that violate this requirement the pooling agreement for each series will contain a provision designed to meet this requirement see “—taxation of residual certificates—taxrelated restrictions on transfer of residual certificates—disqualified organizations” below   a qualified mortgage is any obligation that is principally secured by an interest in real property and that is either transferred to the remic pool on the startup day in exchange for regular or residual interests or is either purchased by the remic pool within a threemonth period thereafter or represents an increase in the loan advanced to the obligor under its original terms in each case pursuant to a fixed price contract in effect on the startup day qualified mortgages include i whole mortgage loans such as the mortgage loans ii certificates of beneficial interest in a grantor trust that holds mortgage loans including certain of the mbs iii regular interests in another remic such as mbs in a trust as to which a remic election has been made iv loans secured by timeshare interests and v loans secured by shares held by a tenant stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation provided in general               the fair market value of the real property security including buildings and structural components is at least  of the principal balance of the related mortgage loan or mortgage loan underlying the mortgage certificate either at origination or as of the startup day an original loantovalue ratio of not more than  with respect to the real property security or          substantially all the proceeds of the mortgage loan or the underlying mortgage loan were used to acquire improve or protect an interest in real property that at the origination date was the only security for the mortgage loan or underlying mortgage loan   if the mortgage loan has been significantly modified prior to the closing date other than in connection with a default or reasonably foreseeable default it must meet the loantovalue test in the first bullet point of the preceding sentence as of the date of the last modification or at closing a qualified mortgage includes a qualified replacement mortgage which is any obligation that would have been treated as a qualified mortgage if it were transferred to the remic pool on the startup day and that is received either  in exchange for any qualified mortgage within a threemonth period thereafter or  in exchange for a defective obligation within a twoyear period thereafter a “defective obligation” includes   · a mortgage in default or as to which default is reasonably foreseeable     · a mortgage as to which a customary representation or warranty made at the time of transfer to the remic pool has been breached     · a mortgage that was fraudulently procured by the mortgagor and     · a mortgage that was not in fact principally secured by real property but only if the mortgage is disposed of within  days of discovery   a mortgage loan that is defective as described in the th clause in the immediately preceding sentence that is not sold or if within two years of the startup day exchanged within  days of discovery ceases to be a qualified mortgage after that day period   permitted investments include cash flow investments qualified reserve assets and foreclosure property a cash flow investment is an investment earning a return in the nature of interest of amounts received on or with respect to qualified mortgages for a temporary period not exceeding  months until the next scheduled distribution to holders of interests in the remic pool a qualified reserve asset is any intangible property held for investment that is part of any reasonably required reserve maintained by the remic pool to provide for payments of expenses of the remic pool or amounts due on the regular or residual interests in the event of defaults including delinquencies on the qualified mortgages lower than expected reinvestment returns prepayment interest shortfalls and certain other contingencies in addition a reserve fund limited to not more than  of the remic pool’s initial assets may be used to provide a source of funds for the purchase of increases in the balances of qualified mortgages pursuant to their terms a reserve fund will be disqualified if more than  of the gross income from the assets in the fund for the year is derived from the sale or other disposition of property held for less than three months unless required to prevent a default on the regular interests caused by a default on one or more qualified mortgages a reserve fund must be reduced “promptly and appropriately” to the extent no longer required foreclosure property is real property acquired by the remic pool in connection with the default or imminent default of a qualified mortgage provided the depositor had no knowledge that the mortgage loan would go into default at the time it was transferred to the remic pool foreclosure property generally must be disposed of prior to the close of the third calendar year following the acquisition of the property by the remic pool with an extension that may be granted by the irs   in addition to the foregoing requirements the various interests in a remic pool also must meet certain requirements all of the interests in a remic pool must be either of the following  one or more classes of regular interests or  a single class of residual interests on which distributions if any are made pro rata a regular interest is an interest in a remic pool that is issued on the startup day with fixed terms is designated as a regular interest and unconditionally entitles the holder to receive a specified principal amount or other similar amount and provides that interest payments or other similar        amounts if any at or before maturity either are payable based on a fixed rate or a qualified variable rate or consist of a specified nonvarying portion of the interest payments on qualified mortgages the specified portion may consist of a fixed number of basis points a fixed percentage of the total interest or a fixed or qualified variable or inverse variable rate on some or all of the qualified mortgages minus a different fixed or qualified variable rate the specified principal amount of a regular interest that provides for interest payments consisting of a specified nonvarying portion of interest payments on qualified mortgages may be zero a residual interest is an interest in a remic pool other than a regular interest that is issued on the startup day and that is designated as a residual interest an interest in a remic pool may be treated as a regular interest even if payments of principal with respect to that interest are subordinated to payments on other regular interests or the residual interest in the remic pool and are dependent on the absence of defaults or delinquencies on qualified mortgages or permitted investments lower than reasonably expected returns on permitted investments unanticipated expenses incurred by the remic pool or prepayment interest shortfalls accordingly the regular certificates of a series will constitute one or more classes of regular interests and the residual certificates for each remic pool of that series will constitute a single class of residual interests on which distributions are made pro rata   if an entity such as the remic pool fails to comply with one or more of the ongoing requirements of the code for remic status during any taxable year the code provides that the entity will not be treated as a remic for that year and thereafter in this event an entity with multiple classes of ownership interests may be treated as a separate association taxable as a corporation under treasury regulations and the regular certificates may be treated as equity interests in the remic pool the code however authorizes the treasury department to issue regulations that address situations where failure to meet one or more of the requirements for remic status occurs inadvertently and in good faith and disqualification of the remic pool would occur absent regulatory relief investors should be aware however that the conference committee report to the tax reform act of  the “reform act” indicates that the relief may be accompanied by sanctions such as the imposition of a corporate tax on all or a portion of the remic pool’s income for the period of time in which the requirements for remic status are not satisfied   exchangeable certificates if a series of certificates includes exchangeable certificates each class of exchangeable certificates will represent beneficial ownership of one or more interests in one or more remic regular interests the related prospectus supplement will specify whether each class of exchangeable certificates represents a proportionate or disproportionate interest in each underlying remic regular interest the exchangeable certificates will be created sold and administered pursuant to an arrangement that will be treated as a grantor trust under subpart e part i of subchapter j of the code the tax treatment of exchangeable certificates is discussed under “—tax treatment of exchangeable certificates” below   taxation of regular certificates   general   a regular interest will be treated as a newly originated debt instrument for federal income tax purposes in general interest original issue discount and market discount on a regular certificate will be treated as ordinary income to a holder of the regular certificate the “regular certificateholder” as they accrue and principal payments on a regular certificate will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the regular certificateholder’s basis in the regular certificate allocable thereto other than accrued market discount not yet reported as ordinary income regular certificateholders must use the accrual method of accounting with regard to regular certificates regardless of the method of accounting otherwise used by those regular certificateholders   original issue discount   accrual certificates and principalonly certificates will be and other classes of regular certificates may be issued with “original issue discount” within the meaning of code section a holders of any class of regular certificates having original issue discount generally must include original issue discount in ordinary income for federal income tax purposes as it accrues in accordance with the constant yield        method that takes into account the compounding of interest in advance of receipt of the cash attributable to that income the following discussion is based in part on treasury regulations the “oid regulations” under code sections  through  and in part on the provisions of the reform act regular certificateholders should be aware however that the oid regulations do not adequately address certain issues relevant to prepayable securities such as the regular certificates to the extent those issues are not addressed in those regulations the depositor intends to apply the methodology described in the conference committee report to the reform act we cannot assure you that the irs will not take a different position as to those matters not currently addressed by the oid regulations moreover the oid regulations include an antiabuse rule allowing the irs to apply or depart from the oid regulations where necessary or appropriate to ensure a reasonable tax result in light of the applicable statutory provisions a tax result will not be considered unreasonable under the antiabuse rule in the absence of a substantial effect on the present value of a taxpayer’s tax liability investors are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the discussion in this prospectus and the appropriate method for reporting interest and original issue discount with respect to the regular certificates   each regular certificate except to the extent described below with respect to a regular certificate on which principal is distributed by random lot “random lot certificates” will be treated as a single installment obligation for purposes of determining the original issue discount includible in a regular certificateholder’s income the total amount of original issue discount on a regular certificate is the excess of the “stated redemption price at maturity” of the regular certificate over its “issue price” the issue price of a class of regular certificates offered pursuant to this prospectus generally is the first price at which a substantial amount of regular certificates of that class is sold to the public excluding bond houses brokers and underwriters although unclear under the oid regulations the depositor intends to treat the issue price of a class as to which there is no substantial sale as of the issue date or that is retained by the depositor as the fair market value of that class as of the issue date the issue price of a regular certificate also includes the amount paid by an initial regular certificateholder for accrued interest that relates to a period prior to the issue date of the regular certificate unless the regular certificateholder elects on its federal income tax return to exclude that amount from the issue price and to recover it on the first distribution date the stated redemption price at maturity of a regular certificate always includes the original principal amount of the regular certificate but generally will not include distributions of stated interest if those interest distributions constitute “qualified stated interest” under the oid regulations qualified stated interest generally means interest payable at a single fixed rate or a qualified variable rate as described below provided that those interest payments are unconditionally payable at intervals of one year or less during the entire term of the regular certificate because there is no penalty or default remedy in the case of nonpayment of interest with respect to a regular certificate it is possible that no interest on any class of regular certificates will be treated as qualified stated interest however except as provided in the following three sentences or in the applicable prospectus supplement because the underlying mortgage loans provide for remedies in the event of default we intend to treat interest with respect to the regular certificates as qualified stated interest distributions of interest on an accrual certificate or on other regular certificates with respect to which deferred interest will accrue will not constitute qualified stated interest in which case the stated redemption price at maturity of the regular certificates includes all distributions of interest as well as principal on those regular certificates likewise we intend to treat an “interest only” class or a class on which interest is substantially disproportionate to its principal amount a socalled “superpremium” class as having no qualified stated interest where the interval between the issue date and the first distribution date on a regular certificate is shorter than the interval between subsequent distribution dates the interest attributable to the additional days will be included in the stated redemption price at maturity   under a de minimis rule original issue discount on a regular certificate will be considered to be zero if the original issue discount is less than  of the stated redemption price at maturity of the regular certificate multiplied by the weighted average maturity of the regular certificate for this purpose the weighted average maturity of the regular certificate is computed as the sum of the amounts determined by multiplying the number of full years ie rounding down partial years from the issue date until each distribution is scheduled to be made by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of each distribution included in the stated redemption price at maturity of the regular certificate and the denominator of which is the stated redemption price at maturity of the regular certificate the        conference committee report to the reform act provides that the schedule of distributions should be determined in accordance with the assumed rate of prepayment of the mortgage loans the “prepayment assumption” and the anticipated reinvestment rate if any relating to the regular certificates the prepayment assumption with respect to a series of regular certificates will be set forth in the related prospectus supplement holders generally must report de minimis original issue discount pro rata as principal payments are received and that income will be capital gain if the regular certificate is held as a capital asset however under the oid regulations regular certificateholders may elect to accrue all de minimis original issue discount as well as market discount and market premium under the constant yield method see “—election to treat all interest under the constant yield method” below   a regular certificateholder generally must include in gross income for any taxable year the sum of the “daily portions” as defined below of the original issue discount on the regular certificate accrued during an accrual period for each day on which it holds the regular certificate including the date of purchase but excluding the date of disposition we intend to treat the monthly period ending on the day before each distribution date as the accrual period with respect to each regular certificate a calculation will be made of the original issue discount that accrues during each successive full accrual period or shorter period from the date of original issue that ends on the day before the related distribution date on the regular certificate the conference committee report to the reform act states that the rate of accrual of original issue discount is intended to be based on the prepayment assumption other than as discussed below with respect to a random lot certificate the original issue discount accruing in a full accrual period would be the excess if any of          the sum of a the present value of all of the remaining distributions to be made on the regular certificate as of the end of that accrual period that are included in the regular certificate’s stated redemption price at maturity and b the distributions made on the regular certificate during the accrual period that are included in the regular certificate’s stated redemption price at maturity over          the adjusted issue price of the regular certificate at the beginning of the accrual period   the present value of the remaining distributions referred to in the preceding sentence is calculated based on          the yield to maturity of the regular certificate at the issue date          events including actual prepayments that have occurred prior to the end of the accrual period and          the prepayment assumption   for these purposes the adjusted issue price of a regular certificate at the beginning of any accrual period equals the issue price of the regular certificate increased by the aggregate amount of original issue discount with respect to the regular certificate that accrued in all prior accrual periods and reduced by the amount of distributions included in the regular certificate’s stated redemption price at maturity that were made on the regular certificate in those prior periods the original issue discount accruing during any accrual period as determined in this paragraph will then be divided by the number of days in the period to determine the daily portion of original issue discount for each day in the period with respect to an initial accrual period shorter than a full accrual period the daily portions of original issue discount must be determined according to an appropriate allocation under any reasonable method   under the method described above the daily portions of original issue discount required to be included in income by a regular certificateholder generally will increase to take into account prepayments on the regular certificates as a result of prepayments on the mortgage loans that exceed the prepayment assumption and generally will decrease but not below zero for any period if the prepayments are slower than the prepayment assumption an increase in prepayments on the mortgage loans with respect to a series of regular certificates can result in both a change in the priority of principal        payments with respect to certain classes of regular certificates and either an increase or decrease in the daily portions of original issue discount with respect to those regular certificates   in the case of a random lot certificate we intend to determine the yield to maturity of that certificate based upon the anticipated payment characteristics of the class as a whole under the prepayment assumption in general the original issue discount accruing on each random lot certificate in a full accrual period would be its allocable share of the original issue discount with respect to the entire class as determined in accordance with the preceding paragraph however in the case of a distribution in retirement of the entire unpaid principal balance of any random lot certificate or portion of that unpaid principal balance a the remaining unaccrued original issue discount allocable to that certificate or to that portion will accrue at the time of that distribution and b the accrual of original issue discount allocable to each remaining certificate of the class or the remaining unpaid principal balance of a partially redeemed random lot certificate after a distribution of principal has been received will be adjusted by reducing the present value of the remaining payments on that class and the adjusted issue price of that class to the extent attributable to the portion of the unpaid principal balance of the class that was distributed we believe that the foregoing treatment is consistent with the “pro rata prepayment” rules of the oid regulations but with the rate of accrual of original issue discount determined based on the prepayment assumption for the class as a whole you are advised to consult your tax advisors as to this treatment   the treasury proposed regulations on august   that create a special rule for accruing original issue discount on regular certificates providing for a delay between record and payment dates such that the period over which original issue discount accrues coincides with the period over which the regular certificateholder’s right to interest payment accrues under the governing contract provisions rather than over the period between distribution dates if the proposed regulations are adopted in the same form as proposed taxpayers would be required to accrue interest from the issue date to the first record date but would not be required to accrue interest after the last record date the proposed regulations are limited to regular certificates with delayed payment for periods of fewer than  days the proposed regulations are proposed to apply to any regular certificate issued after the date the final regulations are published in the federal register   acquisition premium   a purchaser of a regular certificate at a price greater than its adjusted issue price but less than its stated redemption price at maturity will be required to include in gross income the daily portions of the original issue discount on the regular certificate reduced pro rata by a fraction the numerator of which is the excess of its purchase price over the adjusted issue price and the denominator of which is the excess of the remaining stated redemption price at maturity over the adjusted issue price alternatively a subsequent purchaser may elect to treat all of the acquisition premium under the constant yield method as described below under the heading “—election to treat all interest under the constant yield method” below   variable rate regular certificates   regular certificates may provide for interest based on a variable rate under the oid regulations interest is treated as payable at a variable rate if generally          the issue price does not exceed the original principal balance by more than a specified amount and          the interest compounds or is payable at least annually at current values of   a     one or more “qualified floating rates”   b     a single fixed rate and one or more qualified floating rates   c     a single “objective rate” or        d     a single fixed rate and a single objective rate that is a “qualified inverse floating rate”   a floating rate is a qualified floating rate if variations in the rate can reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds where the rate is subject to a fixed multiple that is greater than  but not more than  the rate may also be increased or decreased by a fixed spread or subject to a fixed cap or floor or a cap or floor that is not reasonably expected as of the issue date to affect the yield of the instrument significantly an objective rate other than a qualified floating rate is a rate that is determined using a single fixed formula and that is based on objective financial or economic information provided that the information is not  within the control of the depositor or a related party or  unique to the circumstances of the depositor or a related party a qualified inverse floating rate is a rate equal to a fixed rate minus a qualified floating rate that inversely reflects contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds an inverse floating rate that is not a qualified floating rate may nevertheless be an objective rate a class of regular certificates may be issued under this prospectus that does not have a variable rate under the oid regulations for example a class that bears different rates at different times during the period it is outstanding so that it is considered significantly “frontloaded” or “backloaded” within the meaning of the oid regulations it is possible that a class of this type may be considered to bear “contingent interest” within the meaning of the oid regulations the oid regulations as they relate to the treatment of contingent interest are by their terms not applicable to regular certificates however if final regulations dealing with contingent interest with respect to regular certificates apply the same principles as the current regulations those regulations may lead to different timing of income inclusion than would be the case under the variable interest regulations furthermore application of those principles could lead to the characterization of gain on the sale of contingent interest regular certificates as ordinary income investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the appropriate treatment of any regular certificate that does not pay interest at a fixed rate or variable rate as described in this paragraph   under the remic regulations a regular certificate  bearing a rate that qualifies as a qualified floating rate under the oid regulations that is tied to current values of a variable rate or the highest lowest or average of two or more variable rates including a rate based on the average cost of funds of one or more financial institutions or a positive or negative multiple of a rate plus or minus a specified number of basis points or that represents a weighted average of rates on some or all of the mortgage loans including a rate that is subject to one or more caps or floors each a “variable rate” or  bearing one or more of these variable rates for one or more periods or one or more fixed rates for one or more periods and a different variable rate or fixed rate for other periods qualifies as a regular interest in a remic accordingly if so indicated in the related prospectus supplement we intend to treat regular certificates that qualify as regular interests under this rule in the same manner as obligations bearing a variable rate for original issue discount reporting purposes   the amount of original issue discount with respect to a regular certificate bearing a variable rate of interest will accrue in the manner described above under “—original issue discount” with the yield to maturity and future payments on that regular certificate generally to be determined by assuming that interest will be payable for the life of the regular certificate based on the initial rate or if different the value of the applicable variable rate as of the pricing date for the relevant class generally we intend to treat variable interest as qualified stated interest other than variable interest on an interestonly or superpremium class which will be treated as nonqualified stated interest includible in the stated redemption price at maturity ordinary income reportable for any period will be adjusted based on subsequent changes in the applicable interest rate index   although unclear under the oid regulations unless required otherwise by applicable final regulations we intend to treat regular certificates bearing an interest rate that is a weighted average of the net interest rates on mortgage loans or mortgage certificates having fixed or adjustable rates as having qualified stated interest except to the extent that initial “teaser” rates cause sufficiently “backloaded” interest to create more than de minimis original issue discount the yield on those regular certificates for purposes of accruing original issue discount will be a hypothetical fixed rate based on the fixed rates in the case of fixed rate mortgage loans and initial “teaser rates” followed by fully indexed rates in the case of adjustable rate mortgage loans in the case of adjustable rate mortgage loans the        applicable index used to compute interest on the mortgage loans will be the index in effect on the pricing date or possibly the issue date and in the case of initial teaser rates will be deemed to be in effect beginning with the period in which the first weighted average adjustment date occurring after the issue date occurs adjustments will be made in each accrual period either increasing or decreasing the amount of ordinary income reportable to reflect the actual passthrough interest rate on the regular certificates   deferred interest   under the oid regulations all interest on a regular certificate as to which there may be deferred interest is includible in the stated redemption price at maturity thereof accordingly any deferred interest that accrues with respect to a class of regular certificates may constitute income to the holders of such regular certificates prior to the time distributions of cash with respect to such deferred interest are made   market discount   a purchaser of a regular certificate also may be subject to the market discount rules of code section  through  under these code sections and the principles applied by the oid regulations in the context of original issue discount “market discount” is the amount by which the purchaser’s original basis in the regular certificate exclusive of accrued qualified stated interest  is exceeded by the thencurrent principal amount of the regular certificate or  in the case of a regular certificate having original issue discount is exceeded by the adjusted issue price of that regular certificate at the time of purchase the purchaser generally will be required to recognize ordinary income to the extent of accrued market discount on the regular certificate as distributions includible in the stated redemption price at maturity of the regular certificate are received in an amount not exceeding that distribution the market discount would accrue in a manner to be provided in treasury regulations and should take into account the prepayment assumption the conference committee report to the reform act provides that until regulations are issued the market discount would accrue either  on the basis of a constant interest rate or  in the ratio of stated interest allocable to the relevant period to the sum of the interest for that period plus the remaining interest as of the end of that period or in the case of a regular certificate issued with original issue discount in the ratio of original issue discount accrued for the relevant period to the sum of the original issue discount accrued for that period plus the remaining original issue discount as of the end of that period you also generally will be required to treat a portion of any gain on a sale or exchange of the regular certificate as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount accrued to the date of disposition under one of the foregoing methods less any accrued market discount previously reported as ordinary income as partial distributions in reduction of the stated redemption price at maturity were received you will be required to defer deduction of a portion of the excess of the interest paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred to purchase or carry a regular certificate over the interest distributable on those regular certificates the deferred portion of an interest expense in any taxable year generally will not exceed the accrued market discount on the regular certificate for that year the deferred interest expense is in general allowed as a deduction not later than the year in which the related market discount income is recognized or the regular certificate is disposed of as an alternative to the inclusion of market discount in income on the foregoing basis you may elect to include market discount in income currently as it accrues on all market discount instruments you acquired in that taxable year or thereafter in which case the interest deferral rule will not apply see “—election to treat all interest under the constant yield method” below regarding an alternative manner in which that election may be deemed to be made   market discount with respect to a regular certificate will be considered to be zero if the market discount is less than  of the remaining stated redemption price at maturity of the regular certificate multiplied by the weighted average maturity of the regular certificate determined as described above in the third paragraph under “—original issue discount” remaining after the date of purchase it appears that de minimis market discount would be reported in a manner similar to de minimis original issue discount see “—original issue discount” above treasury regulations implementing the market discount rules have not yet been issued and therefore investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules you should also consult revenue procedure  concerning the        elections to include market discount in income currently and to accrue market discount on the basis of the constant yield method   premium   a regular certificate purchased at a cost excluding any portion of the cost attributable to accrued qualified stated interest greater than its remaining stated redemption price at maturity generally is considered to be purchased at a premium if you hold a regular certificate as a “capital asset” within the meaning of code section  you may elect under code section  to amortize that premium under the constant yield method the election to amortize premium applies to all the premium bonds you hold at the beginning of the taxable year and to all premium bonds you acquire thereafter final regulations with respect to amortization of bond premium do not by their terms apply to prepayable obligations such as the regular certificates however the conference committee report to the reform act indicates a congressional intent that the same rules that will apply to the accrual of market discount on installment obligations will also apply to amortizing bond premium under code section  on installment obligations such as the regular certificates although it is unclear whether the alternatives to the constant yield method described above under “—market discount” are available amortizable bond premium will be treated as an offset to interest income on a regular certificate rather than as a separate deduction item see “—election to treat all interest under the constant yield method” below regarding an alternative manner in which the code section  election may be deemed to be made   election to treat all interest under the constant yield method   a holder of a debt instrument such as a regular certificate may elect to treat all interest that accrues on the instrument using the constant yield method with none of the interest being treated as qualified stated interest for purposes of applying the constant yield method to a debt instrument subject to an election  “interest” includes stated interest original issue discount de minimis original issue discount market discount and de minimis market discount as adjusted by any amortizable bond premium or acquisition premium and  the debt instrument is treated as if the instrument were issued on the holder’s acquisition date in the amount of the holder’s adjusted basis immediately after acquisition it is unclear whether for this purpose the initial prepayment assumption would continue to apply or if a new prepayment assumption as of the date of the holder’s acquisition would apply a holder generally may make an election on an instrument by instrument basis or for a class or group of debt instruments however if you make the election with respect to a premium bond then you are deemed to make the election to amortize premium for all the premium bonds you hold at the beginning of the taxable year and all premium bonds you acquire thereafter if you make the election with respect to a market discount bond then you are deemed to make the election to accrue market discount for all the market discount bonds you acquire at the beginning of the taxable year and all market discount bonds you acquire thereafter the election is made on the holder’s federal income tax return for the year in which the debt instrument is acquired and is irrevocable except with the approval of the irs you should consult their own tax advisors regarding the advisability of making an election   prepayment premiums   prepayment premiums actually collected on the mortgage loans will be distributed to the regular certificates as described in “description of the offered certificates—distributions” in the prospectus supplement it is not entirely clear under the code when the amount of prepayment premiums so allocated should be taxed to the holders of the regular certificates but it is not expected for federal income tax reporting purposes that prepayment premiums will be treated as giving rise to any income to the holder of such classes of certificates prior to the trustee’s actual receipt of a prepayment premium prepayment premiums if any may be treated as paid upon the retirement or partial retirement of the regular certificates the irs may disagree with these positions certificateholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the treatment of prepayment premiums        sale or exchange of regular certificates   if you sell or exchange a regular certificate you will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference if any between the amount received other than amounts allocable to accrued interest and your adjusted basis in the regular certificate the adjusted basis of a regular certificate generally will equal the cost of the regular certificate to the seller increased by any original issue discount or market discount previously included in the seller’s gross income with respect to the regular certificate and reduced by amounts included in the stated redemption price at maturity of the regular certificate that were previously received by the seller by any amortized premium and by previously recognized losses   except as described above with respect to market discount and except as provided in this paragraph any gain or loss on the sale or exchange of a regular certificate realized by an investor who holds the regular certificate as a capital asset will be capital gain or loss and will be longterm or shortterm depending on whether the regular certificate has been held for the applicable holding period described below that gain will be treated as ordinary income as follows          if a regular certificate is held as part of a “conversion transaction” as defined in code section c up to the amount of interest that would have accrued on the regular certificateholder’s net investment in the conversion transaction at  of the appropriate applicable federal rate under code section d in effect at the time the taxpayer entered into the transaction minus any amount previously treated as ordinary income with respect to any prior disposition of property that was held as a part of that transaction          in the case of a noncorporate taxpayer to the extent the taxpayer has made an election under code section d to have net capital gains taxed as investment income at ordinary rates or          to the extent that the gain does not exceed the excess if any of a the amount that would have been includible in the gross income of the holder if its yield on the regular certificate were  of the applicable federal rate as of the date of purchase over b the amount of income actually includible in the gross income of that holder with respect to the regular certificate   in addition gain or loss recognized from the sale of a regular certificate by certain banks or thrift institutions will be treated as ordinary income or loss pursuant to code section c longterm capital gains of certain noncorporate taxpayers generally are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income or shortterm capital gains of those taxpayers for property held for more than one year the maximum tax rate for corporations is the same with respect to both ordinary income and capital gains   treatment of losses   holders of regular certificates will be required to report income with respect to regular certificates on the accrual method of accounting without giving effect to delays or reductions in distributions attributable to defaults or delinquencies on the mortgage loans allocable to a particular class of regular certificates except to the extent it can be established that those losses are uncollectible accordingly the holder of a regular certificate may have income or may incur a diminution in cash flow as a result of a default or delinquency but may not be able to take a deduction subject to the discussion below for the corresponding loss until a subsequent taxable year in this regard investors are cautioned that while they may generally cease to accrue interest income if it reasonably appears that the interest will be uncollectible the irs may take the position that original issue discount must continue to be accrued in spite of its uncollectibility until the debt instrument is disposed of in a taxable transaction or becomes worthless in accordance with the rules of code section    under code section  holders of regular certificates that are corporations or that otherwise hold the regular certificates in connection with a trade or business should in general be allowed to deduct as an ordinary loss a loss sustained during the taxable year on account of those regular certificates becoming wholly or partially worthless and in general holders of regular certificates that are not corporations and do not hold the regular certificates in connection with a trade or business will be        allowed to deduct as a shortterm capital loss any loss with respect to principal sustained during the taxable year on account of a portion of any class or subclass of those regular certificates becoming wholly worthless although the matter is not free from doubt noncorporate holders of regular certificates should be allowed a bad debt deduction at that time as the principal balance of any class or subclass of those regular certificates is reduced to reflect losses resulting from any liquidated mortgage loans below a holder’s basis in the regular certificates the irs however could take the position that noncorporate holders will be allowed a bad debt deduction to reflect those losses only after all mortgage loans remaining in the trust fund have been liquidated or that class of regular certificates has been otherwise retired the irs could also assert that losses on the regular certificates are deductible based on some other method that may defer those deductions for all holders such as reducing future cash flow for purposes of computing original issue discount this may have the effect of creating “negative” original issue discount which would be deductible only against future positive original issue discount or otherwise upon termination of the class notwithstanding the foregoing it is not clear whether holders of interestonly certificates are entitled to any deduction under code section  for bad debt losses you are urged to consult your own tax advisors regarding the appropriate timing amount and character of any loss sustained with respect to the regular certificates special loss rules are applicable to banks and thrift institutions including rules regarding reserves for bad debts banks and thrift institutions are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the treatment of losses on regular certificates   tax treatment of exchangeable certificates   in general the exchangeable certificates for a series may represent either  beneficial ownership of proportionate interests in each related exchangeable certificate corresponding to that exchangeable certificate or  beneficial ownership of disproportionate interests in the related exchangeable certificates corresponding to that exchangeable certificate the prospectus supplement for any series offering exchangeable certificates will specify whether the exchangeable certificates for such series represent either proportionate or disproportionate interests in the related exchangeable certificates an exchangeable certificate may be  a remic regular certificate or  a standard certificate representing beneficial ownership in one or more uncertificated remic regular interests   exchangeable certificates representing proportionate interests in two or more related exchangeable certificates if an exchangeable certificate represents beneficial ownership of a proportionate interest in each related exchangeable certificate corresponding to that exchangeable certificate then each beneficial owner of such an exchangeable certificate should account separately for its ownership interest in each related exchangeable certificate underlying that exchangeable certificate as if such related exchangeable certificate were a regular certificate as described under “—taxation of regular certificates” if a beneficial owner of an exchangeable certificate acquires an interest in two or more underlying related exchangeable certificates other than in an exchange described under “description of the certificates—exchangeable certificates” in this prospectus the beneficial owner must allocate its cost to acquire that exchangeable certificate among the underlying related exchangeable certificates in proportion to their relative fair market values at the time of acquisition when such a beneficial owner sells the exchangeable certificate the owner must allocate the sale proceeds among the underlying related exchangeable certificates in proportion to their relative fair market values at the time of sale   under the oid regulations if two or more debt instruments are issued in connection with the same transaction or related transaction determined based on all the facts and circumstances those debt instruments are treated as a single debt instrument for purposes of the provisions of the code applicable to oid unless an exception applies under this rule if an exchangeable certificate represents beneficial ownership of two or more related exchangeable certificates those related exchangeable certificates could be treated as a single debt instrument for oid purposes in addition if the two or more related exchangeable certificates underlying an exchangeable certificate were aggregated for oid purposes and a beneficial owner of an exchangeable certificate were to i exchange that exchangeable certificate for the underlying related exchangeable certificates ii sell one of those related exchangeable certificates and iii retain one or more of the remaining related exchangeable certificates the beneficial owner might be treated as having engaged in a “coupon stripping” or “bond stripping” transaction within        the meaning of code section  under code section  a beneficial owner of an exchangeable certificate that engages in a coupon stripping or bond stripping transaction must allocate its basis in the original exchangeable certificate between the underlying related exchangeable certificates sold and the related exchangeable certificates retained in proportion to their relative fair market values as of the date of the stripping transaction the beneficial owner then must recognize gain or loss on the related exchangeable certificates sold using its basis allocable to those related exchangeable certificates also the beneficial owner then must treat the related exchangeable certificates underlying the exchangeable certificates retained as a newly issued debt instrument that was purchased for an amount equal to the beneficial owner’s basis allocable to those related exchangeable certificates accordingly the beneficial owner must accrue interest and oid with respect to the related exchangeable certificates retained based on the beneficial owner’s basis in those related exchangeable certificates   as a result when compared to treating each related exchangeable certificate underlying an exchangeable certificate as a separate debt instrument aggregating the related exchangeable certificates underlying an exchangeable certificate could affect the timing and character of income recognized by a beneficial owner of such an exchangeable certificate moreover if code section  were to apply to a beneficial owner of an exchangeable certificate much of the information necessary to perform the related calculations for information reporting purposes generally would not be available to the trustee because it may not be clear whether the aggregation rule in the oid regulations applies to the exchangeable certificates and due to the trustee’s lack of information necessary to report computations that might be required by code section  the trustee will treat each related exchangeable certificate underlying an exchangeable certificate as a separate debt instrument for information reporting purposes prospective investors should note that if the two or more related exchangeable certificates underlying an exchangeable certificate were aggregated the timing of accruals of oid applicable to such an exchangeable certificate could be different than that reported to holders and the irs prospective investors are advised to consult their own tax advisors regarding any possible tax consequences to them if the irs were to assert that the related exchangeable certificates underlying an exchangeable certificate should be aggregated for oid purposes   exchangeable certificates representing disproportionate interests in related exchangeable certificates if an exchangeable certificate represents beneficial ownership of a disproportionate interest in the related exchangeable certificates corresponding to that exchangeable certificate then the tax consequences to the beneficial owner of the exchangeable certificate will be determined under code section  except as discussed below under code section  a beneficial owner of an exchangeable certificate will be treated as owning “stripped bonds” to the extent of its share of principal payments and “stripped coupons” to the extent of its share of interest payment on the underlying related exchangeable certificates if an exchangeable certificate entitles the holder to payments of principal and interest on an underlying related exchangeable certificate the irs could contend that the exchangeable certificate should be treated i as an interest in the underlying related exchangeable certificate to the extent that the exchangeable certificate represents an equal pro rata portion of principal and interest on the underlying related exchangeable certificate and ii with respect to the remainder as an installment obligation consisting of “stripped bonds” to the extent of its share of principal payments or “stripped coupons” to the extent of its share of interest payments for purposes of information reporting however each exchangeable certificate will be treated as a single debt instrument regardless of whether it entitles the holder to payments of principal and interest   under code section  each beneficial owner of an exchangeable certificate must treat the exchangeable certificate as a debt instrument originally issued on the date the owner acquires it and as having oid equal to the excess if any of its “stated redemption price at maturity” over the price paid by the owner to acquire it the stated redemption price at maturity for an exchangeable certificate is determined in the same manner as described with respect to regular certificates under “—taxation of regular certificates—original issue discount”   if the exchangeable certificate has oid the beneficial owner must include the oid in its ordinary income for federal income tax purposes as the oid accrues which may be prior to the receipt of the cash attributable to that income although the matter is not entirely clear a beneficial owner should accrue oid        using a method similar to that described with respect to the accrual of oid on a regular certificate under “—taxation of regular certificates—original issue discount” a beneficial owner however determines its yield to maturity based on its purchase price for a particular beneficial owner it is not clear whether the prepayment assumption used for calculating oid would be one determined at the time the exchangeable certificate is acquired or would be the prepayment assumption for the underlying related exchangeable certificates   in light of the application of code section  a beneficial owner of an exchangeable certificate generally will be required to compute accruals of oid based on its yield possibly taking into account its own prepayment assumption the information necessary to perform the related calculations for information reporting purposes however generally will not be available to the trustee accordingly any information reporting provided by the trustee with respect to the exchangeable certificates which information will be based on pricing information as of the closing date will largely fail to reflect the accurate accruals of oid for these certificates prospective investors therefore should be aware that the timing of accruals of oid applicable to an exchangeable certificate generally will be different than that reported to holders and the irs prospective investors are advised to consult their own tax advisors regarding their obligation to compute and include in income the correct amount of oid accruals and any possible tax consequences should they fail to do so   the rules of code section  also apply if i a beneficial owner of one or more exchangeable certificates exchanges them for another exchangeable certificate ii the beneficial owner sells some but not all of such exchanged exchangeable certificates and iii the combination of retained exchangeable certificates cannot be exchanged for the related underlying exchangeable certificates as of the date of such a sale the beneficial owner must allocate its basis in the underlying related exchangeable certificates between the part of the related exchangeable certificates underlying the exchangeable certificates sold and the part of the related exchangeable certificates underlying the exchangeable certificates retained in proportion to their relative fair market values code section  treats the beneficial owner as purchasing the exchangeable certificates retained for the amount of the basis allocated to the retained exchangeable certificates and the beneficial owner must then accrue any oid with respect to the retained exchangeable certificates as described above code section  does not apply however if a beneficial owner exchanges the underlying related exchangeable certificates for other exchangeable certificates and retains all such exchangeable certificates see “—treatment of exchanges” below   upon the sale of an exchangeable certificate a beneficial owner will realize gain or loss on the sale in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized and its adjusted basis in the exchangeable certificate the owner’s adjusted basis generally is equal to the owner’s cost of the exchangeable certificate or portion of the cost of the related exchangeable certificates allocable to the exchangeable certificate increased by income previously included and reduced but not below zero by distributions previously received and by any amortized premium if the beneficial owner holds the exchangeable certificate as a capital asset any gain or loss realized will be capital gain or loss except to the extent provided under “—sale or exchange of regular certificates”   although the matter is not free from doubt if a beneficial owner acquires in one transaction other than an exchange described under “—treatment of exchanges” below a combination of exchangeable certificates that may be exchanged for underlying related exchangeable certificates the owner should be treated as owning the underlying related exchangeable certificates in which case code section  would not apply if a beneficial owner acquires such a combination in separate transactions the law is unclear as to whether the combination should be aggregated or each exchangeable certificate should be treated as a separate debt instrument you should consult your tax advisors regarding the proper treatment of exchangeable certificates in this regard   treatment of exchanges if a beneficial owner of one or more exchangeable certificates exchanges them for the related exchangeable certificates in the manner described under “description of the certificates—exchangeable certificates” in this prospectus the exchange will not be taxable in such a case the beneficial owner will be treated as continuing to own after the exchange the same combination        of interests in each underlying related exchangeable certificate that it owned immediately prior to the exchange   taxation of residual certificates   taxation of remic income   generally the “daily portions” of remic taxable income or net loss will be includible as ordinary income or loss in determining the federal taxable income of holders of residual certificates “residual certificateholders” and will not be taxed separately to the remic pool the daily portions of remic taxable income or net loss of a residual certificateholder are determined by allocating the remic pool’s taxable income or net loss for each calendar quarter ratably to each day in that quarter and by allocating that daily portion among the residual certificateholders in proportion to their respective holdings of residual certificates in the remic pool on that day remic taxable income is generally determined in the same manner as the taxable income of an individual using the accrual method of accounting except that          the limitations on deductibility of investment interest expense and expenses for the production of income do not apply          all bad loans will be deductible as business bad debts and          the limitation on the deductibility of interest and expenses related to taxexempt income will apply   the remic pool’s gross income includes interest original issue discount income and market discount income if any on the mortgage loans reduced by amortization of any premium on the mortgage loans plus income from amortization of issue premium if any on the regular certificates plus income on reinvestment of cash flows and reserve assets plus any cancellation of indebtedness income upon allocation of realized losses to the regular certificates the remic pool’s deductions include interest and original issue discount expense on the regular certificates servicing fees on the mortgage loans other administrative expenses of the remic pool and realized losses on the mortgage loans the requirement that residual certificateholders report their pro rata share of taxable income or net loss of the remic pool will continue until there are no certificates of any class of the related series outstanding   the taxable income recognized by a residual certificateholder in any taxable year will be affected by among other factors the relationship between the timing of recognition of interest and original issue discount or market discount income or amortization of premium with respect to the mortgage loans on the one hand and the timing of deductions for interest including original issue discount on the regular certificates or income from amortization of issue premium on the regular certificates on the other hand in the event that an interest in the mortgage loans is acquired by the remic pool at a discount and one or more of those mortgage loans is prepaid the residual certificateholder may recognize taxable income without being entitled to receive a corresponding amount of cash because  the prepayment may be used in whole or in part to make distributions in reduction of principal on the regular certificates and  the discount on the mortgage loans which is includible in income may exceed the deduction allowed upon those distributions on those regular certificates on account of any unaccrued original issue discount relating to those regular certificates when there is more than one class of regular certificates that distribute principal sequentially this mismatching of income and deductions is particularly likely to occur in the early years following the issuance of the regular certificates when distributions in reduction of principal are being made in respect of earlier classes of regular certificates to the extent that those classes are not issued with substantial discount if taxable income attributable to that kind of mismatching is realized in general losses would be allowed in later years as distributions on the later classes of regular certificates are made taxable income may also be greater in earlier years than in later years as a result of the fact that interest expense deductions expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount of that series of regular certificates may increase over time as distributions in reduction of principal are made on the lower yielding classes of regular certificates whereas to the extent that the remic pool includes fixed rate mortgage loans interest income with        respect to any given mortgage loan will remain constant over time as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount of that loan consequently residual certificateholders must have sufficient other sources of cash to pay any federal state or local income taxes due as a result of that mismatching or unrelated deductions against which to offset that income subject to the discussion of “excess inclusions” below under “—limitations on offset or exemption of remic income” the timing of that mismatching of income and deductions described in this paragraph if present with respect to a series of certificates may have a significant adverse effect upon the residual certificateholder’s aftertax rate of return   basis and losses   the amount of any net loss of the remic pool that you may take into account is limited to the adjusted basis of the residual certificate as of the close of the quarter or time of disposition of the residual certificate if earlier determined without taking into account the net loss for the quarter the initial adjusted basis of a purchaser of a residual certificate is the amount paid for that residual certificate the adjusted basis will be increased by the amount of taxable income of the remic pool reportable by the residual certificateholder and will be decreased but not below zero first by a cash distribution from the remic pool and second by the amount of loss of the remic pool reportable by the residual certificateholder any loss that is disallowed on account of this limitation may be carried over indefinitely with respect to the residual certificateholder as to whom that loss was disallowed and may be used by that residual certificateholder only to offset any income generated by the same remic pool   you will not be permitted to amortize directly the cost of your residual certificate as an offset to its share of the taxable income of the related remic pool however that taxable income will not include cash received by the remic pool that represents a recovery of the remic pool’s basis in its assets that recovery of basis by the remic pool will have the effect of amortization of the issue price of the residual certificates over their life however in view of the possible acceleration of the income of residual certificateholders described under “—taxation of remic income” above the period of time over which the issue price is effectively amortized may be longer than the economic life of the residual certificates   a residual certificate may have a negative value if the net present value of anticipated tax liabilities exceeds the present value of anticipated cash flows the remic regulations appear to treat the issue price of a residual interest as zero rather than a negative amount for purposes of determining the remic pool’s basis in its assets regulations have been issued addressing the federal income tax treatment of “inducement fees” received by transferees of noneconomic remic residual interests these regulations require inducement fees to be included in income over a period reasonably related to the period in which the related remic residual interest is expected to generate taxable income or net loss to its holder under two safe harbor methods inducement fees are permitted to be included in income i in the same amounts and over the same period that the taxpayer uses for financial reporting purposes provided that such period is not shorter than the period the remic is expected to generate taxable income or ii ratably over the remaining anticipated weighted average life of all the regular and residual interests issued by the remic determined based on actual distributions projected as remaining to be made on such interests under the prepayment assumption if the holder of a residual interest sells or otherwise disposes of the residual interest any unrecognized portion of the inducement fee would be required to be taken into account at the time of the sale or disposition prospective purchasers of the residual certificates should consult with their tax advisors regarding the effect of these regulations   further to the extent that your initial adjusted basis other than an original holder in the residual certificate is greater than the corresponding portion of the remic pool’s basis in the mortgage loans you will not recover a portion of that basis until termination of the remic pool unless future treasury regulations provide for periodic adjustments to the remic income otherwise reportable by that holder the remic regulations currently in effect do not so provide see “—treatment of certain items of remic income and expense—market discount” below regarding the basis of mortgage loans to the remic pool and “—sale or exchange of a residual certificate” below regarding possible treatment of a loss upon termination of the remic pool as a capital loss        treatment of certain items of remic income and expense   although we intend to compute remic income and expense in accordance with the code and applicable regulations the authorities regarding the determination of specific items of income and expense are subject to differing interpretations we make no representation as to the specific method that will be used for reporting income with respect to the mortgage loans and expenses with respect to the regular certificates and different methods could result in different timing of reporting of taxable income or net loss to you or differences in capital gain versus ordinary income   original issue discount and premium generally the remic pool’s deductions for original issue discount and income from amortization of issue premium on the regular certificates will be determined in the same manner as original issue discount income on regular certificates as described under “—taxation of regular certificates—original issue discount” and “—variable rate regular certificates” without regard to the de minimis rule described in that section and “—premium” above   deferred interest any deferred interest that accrues with respect to any adjustable rate mortgage loans held by the remic pool will constitute income to the remic pool and will be treated in a manner similar to the deferred interest that accrues with respect to regular certificates as described under “—taxation of regular certificates—deferred interest” above   market discount the remic pool will have market discount income in respect of mortgage loans if in general their unpaid principal balances exceed the basis of the remic pool allocable to those mortgage loans the remic pool’s basis in those mortgage loans is generally the fair market value of the mortgage loans immediately after the transfer of the mortgage loans to the remic pool the remic regulations provide that the basis is equal in the aggregate to the issue prices of all regular and residual interests in the remic pool or the fair market value at the closing date in the case of a retained class in respect of mortgage loans that have market discount to which code section  applies the accrued portion of the market discount would be recognized currently as an item of ordinary income in a manner similar to original issue discount market discount income generally should accrue in the manner described under “—taxation of regular certificates—market discount” above   premium generally if the basis of the remic pool in the mortgage loans exceeds the unpaid principal balances of the mortgage loans the remic pool will be considered to have acquired those mortgage loans at a premium equal to the amount of that excess as stated above the remic pool’s basis in mortgage loans is the fair market value of the mortgage loans based on the aggregate of the issue prices or the fair market value of retained classes of the regular and residual interests in the remic pool immediately after the transfer of the mortgage loans to the remic pool in a manner analogous to the discussion above under “—taxation of regular certificates—premium” a remic pool that holds a mortgage loan as a capital asset under code section  may elect under code section  to amortize premium on whole mortgage loans or mortgage loans underlying mbs or mbs that are remic regular interests under the constant yield method amortizable bond premium will be treated as an offset to interest income on the mortgage loans rather than as a separate deduction item premium with respect to those mortgage loans may be deductible in accordance with a reasonable method regularly employed by the related holder the allocation of the premium pro rata among principal payments should be considered a reasonable method however the irs may argue that the premium should be allocated in a different manner such as allocating the premium entirely to the final payment of principal   limitations on offset or exemption of remic income   a portion or all of the remic taxable income includible in determining your federal income tax liability will be subject to special treatment that portion referred to as the “excess inclusion” is equal to the excess of remic taxable income for the calendar quarter allocable to a residual certificate over the daily accruals for that quarterly period of   of the longterm applicable federal rate that would have applied to the residual certificate if it were a debt instrument on the startup day under code section d multiplied by  the adjusted issue price of such residual certificate at the beginning of that quarterly period for this purpose the adjusted issue price of a residual certificate at the beginning        of a quarter is the issue price of the residual certificate plus the amount of those daily accruals of remic income described in this paragraph for all prior quarters decreased by any distributions made with respect to that residual certificate prior to the beginning of that quarterly period accordingly the portion of the remic pool’s taxable income that will be treated as excess inclusions will be a larger portion of that income as the adjusted issue price of the residual certificates diminishes and all such taxable income will be so treated if the adjusted issue price of the residual certificate is zero   the portion of your remic taxable income consisting of the excess inclusions generally may not be offset by other deductions including net operating loss carryforwards on your return however net operating loss carryovers are determined without regard to excess inclusion income further if you are an organization subject to the tax on unrelated business income imposed by code section  the excess inclusions will be treated as unrelated business taxable income to you for purposes of code section  in addition remic taxable income is subject to  withholding tax with respect to certain persons who are not us persons as defined below under “—taxrelated restrictions on transfer of residual certificates—foreign investors” below and that portion attributable to excess inclusions is not eligible for any reduction in the rate of withholding tax by treaty or otherwise see “—taxation of certain foreign investors—residual certificates” below finally if a real estate investment trust or a regulated investment company owns a residual certificate a portion allocated under treasury regulations yet to be issued of dividends paid by the real estate investment trust or a regulated investment company could not be offset by net operating losses of its shareholders would constitute unrelated business taxable income for taxexempt shareholders and would be ineligible for reduction of withholding to certain persons who are not us persons   in addition the code provides three rules for determining the effect of excess inclusions on your alternative minimum taxable income of a residual certificateholder first your alternative minimum taxable income is determined without regard to the special rule discussed above that taxable income cannot be less than excess inclusions second your alternative minimum taxable income for a taxable year cannot be less than the excess inclusions for the year third the amount of any alternative minimum tax net operating loss deduction must be computed without regard to any excess inclusions   taxrelated restrictions on transfer of residual certificates   disqualified organizations if any legal or beneficial interest in a residual certificate is transferred to a disqualified organization as defined below a tax would be imposed in an amount equal to the product of  the present value of the total anticipated excess inclusions with respect to that residual certificate for periods after the transfer and  the highest marginal federal income tax rate applicable to corporations the remic regulations provide that the anticipated excess inclusions are based on actual prepayment experience to the date of the transfer and projected payments based on the prepayment assumption the present value rate equals the applicable federal rate under code section d as of the date of the transfer for a term ending with the last calendar quarter in which excess inclusions are expected to accrue the tax generally would be imposed on the transferor of the residual certificate except that where the transfer is through an agent including a broker nominee or other middleman for a disqualified organization the tax would instead be imposed on that agent however a transferor of a residual certificate would in no event be liable for the tax with respect to a transfer if the transferee furnishes to the transferor an affidavit that the transferee is not a disqualified organization and as of the time of the transfer the transferor does not have actual knowledge that the affidavit is false the tax also may be waived by the treasury department if the disqualified organization promptly disposes of the residual interest and the transferor pays income tax at the highest corporate rate on the excess inclusions for the period the residual certificate is actually held by the disqualified organization   in addition if a passthrough entity as defined below has excess inclusion income with respect to a residual certificate during a taxable year and a disqualified organization is the record holder of an equity interest in that entity then a tax is imposed on the entity equal to the product of  the amount of excess inclusions on the residual certificate that are allocable to the interest in the passthrough entity during the period the interest is held by the disqualified organization and  the highest marginal federal corporate income tax rate this tax would be deductible from the ordinary gross income of the        passthrough entity for the taxable year the passthrough entity would not be liable for the tax if it has received an affidavit from the record holder that it is not a disqualified organization or stating the holder’s taxpayer identification number and during the period that person is the record holder of the residual certificate the passthrough entity does not have actual knowledge that the affidavit is false   if an “electing large partnership” as defined in code section  holds a residual certificate all interests in the electing large partnership are treated as held by disqualified organizations for purposes of the tax imposed upon a passthrough entity by code section ec an exception to this tax otherwise available to a passthrough entity that is furnished certain affidavits by record holders of interests in the entity and that does not know the affidavits are false is not available to an electing partnership   for these purposes          “disqualified organization” means any of i the united states any state or political subdivision thereof any possession of the united states or any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing other than an instrumentality which is a corporation if all of its activities are subject to tax and a majority of its board of directors is not selected by such governmental unit ii a foreign government any international organization or any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing iii any organization other than certain farmers’ cooperatives described in section  of the code which is exempt from the tax imposed by chapter  of the code including the tax imposed by section  of the code on unrelated business taxable income on any excess inclusions as defined in section ec of the code with respect to the class r certificates except certain farmers’ cooperatives described in section  of the code iv rural electric and telephone cooperatives described in section ac of the code v an “electing large partnership” as defined in section  of the code and vi any other person so designated by the trustee or the certificate administrator based upon an opinion of counsel as provided to the trustee or the certificate administrator at no expense to the trustee or the certificate administrator that the holding of an ownership interest in a class r certificate by such person may cause either i any remic pool to fail to qualify as a remic at any time that the certificates are outstanding or ii any person having an ownership interest in any class of certificates other than such person to incur a liability for any federal tax imposed under the code that would not otherwise be imposed but for the transfer of an ownership interest in a class r certificate to such person the terms “united states” “state” and “international organization” shall have the meanings set forth in section  of the code or successor provisions and          “passthrough entity” means any regulated investment company real estate investment trust common trust fund partnership trust or estate and certain corporations operating on a cooperative basis except as may be provided in treasury regulations any person holding an interest in a passthrough entity as a nominee for another will with respect to that interest be treated as a passthrough entity   the pooling agreement with respect to a series of certificates will provide that no legal or beneficial interest in a residual certificate may be transferred unless  the proposed transferee provides to the transferor and the trustee an affidavit providing its taxpayer identification number and stating that the transferee is the beneficial owner of the residual certificate is not a disqualified organization and is not purchasing the residual certificates on behalf of a disqualified organization ie as a broker nominee or other middleman and  the transferor provides a statement in writing to the depositor and the trustee that it has no actual knowledge that the affidavit is false moreover the pooling agreement will provide that any attempted or purported transfer in violation of these transfer restrictions will be null and void and will vest no rights in any purported transferee each residual certificate with respect to a series will bear a legend referring to the restrictions on transfer and each residual certificateholder will be deemed to have agreed as a condition of ownership of the residual certificates to any amendments to the related pooling agreement required under the code or applicable treasury regulations to effectuate the foregoing restrictions information necessary to compute an applicable excise tax must be furnished to the irs and to the requesting party within  days of the request and the depositor or the trustee may charge a fee for computing and providing that information        noneconomic residual interests the remic regulations would disregard certain transfers of residual certificates in which case the transferor would continue to be treated as the owner of the residual certificates and thus would continue to be subject to tax on its allocable portion of the net income of the remic pool under the remic regulations a transfer of a “noneconomic residual interest” as defined below to a residual certificateholder other than a residual certificateholder who is not a us person as defined under “—foreign investors” below is disregarded for all federal income tax purposes if a significant purpose of the transferor is to impede the assessment or collection of tax a residual interest in a remic including a residual interest with a positive value at issuance is a “noneconomic residual interest” unless at the time of the transfer  the present value of the expected future distributions on the residual interest at least equals the product of the present value of the anticipated excess inclusions and the highest corporate income tax rate in effect for the year in which the transfer occurs and  the transferor reasonably expects that the transferee will receive distributions from the remic at or after the time at which taxes accrue on the anticipated excess inclusions in an amount sufficient to satisfy the accrued taxes the anticipated excess inclusions and the present value rate are determined in the same manner as set forth under “—disqualified organizations” above the remic regulations explain that a significant purpose to impede the assessment or collection of tax exists if the transferor at the time of the transfer either knew or should have known that the transferee would be unwilling or unable to pay taxes due on its share of the taxable income of the remic under the remic regulations a safe harbor is provided if  the transferor conducted at the time of the transfer a reasonable investigation of the financial condition of the transferee and found that the transferee historically had paid its debts as they came due and found no significant evidence to indicate that the transferee would not continue to pay its debts as they came due in the future  the transferee represents to the transferor that it understands that as the holder of the noneconomic residual interest the transferee may incur tax liabilities in excess of cash flows generated by the interest and that the transferee intends to pay taxes associated with holding the residual interest as they become due  the transferee represents to the transferor that it will not cause income from the residual certificate to be attributable to a foreign permanent establishment or fixed base within the meaning of an applicable income tax treaty of the transferee or any other person and  either the “formula test” or the “assets test” each described below is satisfied the pooling agreement with respect to each series of certificates will require the transferee of a residual certificate to certify to the matters in clauses   and  of the preceding sentence as part of the affidavit described under the heading “—disqualified organizations” above the transferor must have no actual knowledge or reason to know that those statements are false   the formula test is satisfied if the present value of the anticipated tax liabilities associated with holding the noneconomic residual interest cannot exceed the sum of   i         the present value of any consideration given to the transferee to acquire the interest   ii      the present value of the expected future distributions on the interest and   iii       the present value of the anticipated tax savings associated with holding the interest as the remic generates losses   for purposes of these computations the transferee is assumed to pay tax at the highest rate of tax specified in code section b currently  or in certain circumstances the alternative minimum tax rate further present values generally are computed using a discount rate equal to the shortterm federal rate set forth in code section d for the month of the transfer and the compounding period used by the transferee   the assets test is satisfied if i the transferee must be a domestic “c” corporation other than a corporation exempt from taxation or a regulated investment company or real estate investment trust that meets certain gross and net asset tests generally  million of gross assets and  million of net assets for the current year and the two preceding fiscal years ii the transferee must agree in writing that any subsequent transferee of the residual interest would meet the requirements for a safe harbor transfer and iii the facts and circumstances known to the transferor on or before the date of the transfer        must not reasonably indicate that the taxes associated with ownership of the residual interest will not be paid by the transferee   foreign investors the remic regulations provide that the transfer of a residual certificate that has “tax avoidance potential” to a “foreign person” will be disregarded for all federal tax purposes this rule appears intended to apply to a transferee who is not a us person a “nonus person” unless the transferee’s income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the united states a residual certificate is deemed to have tax avoidance potential unless at the time of the transfer  the future value of expected distributions equals at least  of the anticipated excess inclusions after the transfer and  the transferor reasonably expects that the transferee will receive sufficient distributions from the remic pool at or after the time at which the excess inclusions accrue and prior to the end of the next succeeding taxable year for the accumulated withholding tax liability to be paid if the nonus person transfers the residual certificates back to a us person the transfer will be disregarded and the foreign transferor will continue to be treated as the owner unless arrangements are made so that the transfer does not have the effect of allowing the transferor to avoid tax on accrued excess inclusions   unless otherwise stated in the related prospectus supplement a residual certificate may not be purchased by or transferred to any person that is not a us person the term “us person” means a citizen or resident of the united states a corporation or partnership except to the extent provided in applicable treasury regulations created or organized in or under the laws of the united states any state or the district of columbia including any entity treated as a corporation or partnership for federal income tax purposes an estate that is subject to united states federal income tax regardless of the source of its income or a trust if a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of that trust and one or more such us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of that trust or to the extent provided in applicable treasury regulations certain trusts in existence on august   that have elected to be treated as us persons   in addition under temporary and final treasury regulations effective august   a us partnership having a partner who is not a us person will be required to pay withholding tax in respect of excess inclusion income allocable to such nonus partner even if no cash distributions are made to such partner accordingly the pooling agreement will prohibit transfer of a residual certificate to a us person treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes any beneficial owner of which other than through a us corporation is or is permitted to be under the related partnership agreement a nonus person   sale or exchange of a residual certificate   upon the sale or exchange of a residual certificate you will recognize gain or loss equal to the excess if any of the amount realized over your adjusted basis as described under “—basis and losses” above in the residual certificate at the time of the sale or exchange in addition to reporting the taxable income of the remic pool you will have taxable income to the extent that any cash distribution to you from the remic pool exceeds the adjusted basis on that distribution date that income will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of the residual certificates it is possible that the termination of the remic pool may be treated as a sale or exchange of residual certificates in which case you will have an adjusted basis in the residual certificates remaining when your interest in the remic pool terminates and if you hold the residual certificate as a capital asset under code section  then you will recognize a capital loss at that time in the amount of the remaining adjusted basis   any gain on the sale of residual certificates will be treated as ordinary income  if you hold the residual certificates as part of a “conversion transaction” as defined in code section c up to the amount of interest that would have accrued on your net investment in the conversion transaction at  of the appropriate applicable federal rate in effect at the time the taxpayer entered into the transaction minus any amount previously treated as ordinary income with respect to any prior disposition of property that was held as a part of that transaction or  if you are a noncorporate taxpayer to the extent that you have made an election under code section d to have net capital gains taxed as investment        income at ordinary income rates in addition gain or loss recognized from the sale of a residual certificate by certain banks or thrift institutions will be treated as ordinary income or loss pursuant to code section c   the conference committee report to the reform act provides that except as provided in treasury regulations yet to be issued the wash sale rules of code section  will apply to dispositions of residual certificates where the seller of those certificates during the period beginning six months before the sale or disposition of the residual certificate and ending six months after the sale or disposition acquires or enters into any other transaction that results in the application of section  any residual interest in any remic or any interest in a “taxable mortgage pool” such as a nonremic owner trust that is economically comparable to a residual certificate   mark to market regulations   the treasury has issued regulations the “mark to market regulations” under code section  relating to the requirement that a securities dealer mark to market securities held for sale to customers this marktomarket requirement applies to all securities of a dealer except to the extent that the dealer has specifically identified a security as held for investment the mark to market regulations provide that for purposes of this marktomarket requirement a residual certificate is not treated as a security and thus may not be marked to market   taxes that may be imposed on the remic pool   prohibited transactions   income from certain transactions by the remic pool called prohibited transactions will not be part of the calculation of income or loss includible in the federal income tax returns of residual certificateholders but rather will be taxed directly to the remic pool at a  rate prohibited transactions generally include          the disposition of a qualified mortgage other than for   a     substitution within two years of the startup day for a defective including a defaulted obligation or repurchase in lieu of substitution of a defective including a defaulted obligation at any time or for any qualified mortgage within three months of the startup day   b     foreclosure default or imminent default of a qualified mortgage   c     bankruptcy or insolvency of the remic pool or   d     a qualified complete liquidation          the receipt of income from assets that are not the type of mortgages or investments that the remic pool is permitted to hold          the receipt of compensation for services or          the receipt of gain from disposition of cash flow investments other than pursuant to a qualified liquidation   notwithstanding  and  it is not a prohibited transaction to sell remic pool property to prevent a default on regular certificates as a result of a default on qualified mortgages or to facilitate a cleanup call generally an optional termination to save administrative costs when no more than a small percentage of the certificates is outstanding the remic regulations indicate that the modification of a mortgage loan generally will not be treated as a disposition if it is occasioned by a default or reasonably foreseeable default an assumption of the mortgage loan the waiver of a dueonsale or        dueonencumbrance clause or the conversion of an interest rate by a mortgagor pursuant to the terms of a convertible adjustable rate mortgage loan   contributions to the remic pool after the startup day   in general the remic pool will be subject to a tax at a  rate on the value of any property contributed to the remic pool after the startup day exceptions are provided for cash contributions to the remic pool          during the three months following the startup day          made to a qualified reserve fund by a residual certificateholder          in the nature of a guarantee          made to facilitate a qualified liquidation or cleanup call and          as otherwise permitted in treasury regulations yet to be issued   net income from foreclosure property   the remic pool will be subject to federal income tax at the highest corporate rate on “net income from foreclosure property” determined by reference to the rules applicable to real estate investment trusts generally property acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure would be treated as “foreclosure property” for a period ending with the third calendar year following the year of acquisition of that property with a possible extension net income from foreclosure property generally means gain from the sale of a foreclosure property that is inventory property and gross income from foreclosure property other than qualifying rents and other qualifying income for a real estate investment trust   it is not anticipated that the remic pool will receive income or contributions subject to tax under the preceding three paragraphs except as described in the applicable prospectus supplement with respect to net income from foreclosure property on a commercial or multifamily residential property that secured a mortgage loan in addition if so disclosed in the applicable prospectus supplement it is not anticipated that any material state income or franchise tax will be imposed on a remic pool   liquidation of the remic pool   if a remic pool adopts a plan of complete liquidation within the meaning of code section faai which may be accomplished by designating in the remic pool’s final tax return a date on which that adoption is deemed to occur and sells all of its assets other than cash within a day period beginning on the date of the adoption of the plan of liquidation the remic pool will not be subject to the prohibited transaction rules on the sale of its assets provided that the remic pool credits or distributes in liquidation all of the sale proceeds plus its cash other than amounts retained to meet claims to holders of regular certificates and residual certificateholders within the day period   administrative matters   the remic pool will be required to maintain its books on a calendar year basis and to file federal income tax returns for federal income tax purposes in a manner similar to a partnership the form for that income tax return is form  us real estate mortgage investment conduit remic income tax return the trustee will be required to sign the remic pool’s returns treasury regulations provide that except where there is a single residual certificateholder for an entire taxable year the remic pool will be subject to the procedural and administrative rules of the code applicable to partnerships including the determination by the irs of any adjustments to among other things items of remic income gain loss deduction or credit in a unified administrative proceeding the residual certificateholder owning the largest percentage interest in the residual certificates will be obligated to act as “tax matters person” as defined in applicable treasury regulations with respect to the remic pool each residual        certificateholder will be deemed by acceptance of the residual certificates to have agreed  to the appointment of the tax matters person as provided in the preceding sentence and  to the irrevocable designation of the trustee as agent for performing the functions of the tax matters person   limitations on deduction of certain expenses   an investor who is an individual estate or trust will be subject to limitation with respect to certain itemized deductions described in code section  to the extent that those itemized deductions in the aggregate do not exceed  of the investor’s adjusted gross income in addition code section  provides that itemized deductions otherwise allowable for a taxable year of an individual taxpayer with income above certain thresholds will be reduced by the lesser of   of the excess if any of adjusted gross income over a statutory threshold or   of the amount of itemized deductions otherwise allowable for that year in the case of a remic pool those deductions may include deductions under code section  for the servicing fee and all administrative and other expenses relating to the remic pool or any similar expenses allocated to the remic pool with respect to a regular interest it holds in another remic those investors who hold remic certificates either directly or indirectly through certain passthrough entities may have their pro rata share of those expenses allocated to them as additional gross income but may be subject to those limitations on deductions in addition those expenses are not deductible at all for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax and may cause those investors to be subject to significant additional tax liability temporary treasury regulations provide that the additional gross income and corresponding amount of expenses generally are to be allocated entirely to the holders of residual certificates in the case of a remic pool that would not qualify as a fixed investment trust in the absence of a remic election however that additional gross income and limitation on deductions will apply to the allocable portion of those expenses to holders of regular certificates as well as holders of residual certificates where those regular certificates are issued in a manner that is similar to passthrough certificates in a fixed investment trust in general that allocable portion will be determined based on the ratio that a remic certificateholder’s income determined on a daily basis bears to the income of all holders of regular certificates and residual certificates with respect to a remic pool as a result individuals estates or trusts holding remic certificates either directly or indirectly through a grantor trust partnership s corporation remic or certain other passthrough entities described in the foregoing temporary treasury regulations may have taxable income in excess of the interest income at the passthrough rate on regular certificates that are issued in a single class or otherwise consistently with fixed investment trust status or in excess of cash distributions for the related period on residual certificates if so indicated in the related prospectus supplement all those expenses will be allocable to the residual certificates   taxation of certain foreign investors   regular certificates   interest including original issue discount distributable to regular certificateholders who are nonresident aliens foreign corporations or other nonus persons will be considered “portfolio interest” and therefore generally will not be subject to  united states withholding tax provided that the nonus person  is not a “percent shareholder” within the meaning of code section hb of or a controlled foreign corporation described in code section cc related to the remic or possibly one or more borrowers and  provides the trustee or the person who would otherwise be required to withhold tax from those distributions under code section  or  with an appropriate statement signed under penalties of perjury identifying the beneficial owner and stating among other things that the beneficial owner of the regular certificate is a nonus person the appropriate documentation includes form wben in the case of an individual or form wbene in the case of an entity if the nonus person is eligible for the benefits of the portfolio interest exemption or an exemption based on a treaty form weci if the nonus person is eligible for an exemption on the basis of its income from the regular certificate being effectively connected to a united states trade or business form wbene or form wimy if the nonus person is a trust depending on whether such trust is classified as the beneficial owner of the regular certificate and form wimy with supporting documentation as specified in the treasury regulations required to substantiate exemptions        from withholding on behalf of its partners if the nonus person is a partnership an intermediary other than a partnership must provide form wimy revealing all required information including its name address taxpayer identification number the country under the laws of which it is created and certification that it is not acting for its own account a “qualified intermediary” must certify that it has provided or will provide a withholding statement as required under treasury regulations section ev but need not disclose the identity of its account holders on its form wimy and may certify its account holders’ status without including each beneficial owner’s certification a non“qualified intermediary” must additionally certify that it has provided or will provide a withholding statement that is associated with the appropriate forms w and w required to substantiate exemptions from withholding on behalf of its beneficial owners the term “intermediary” means a person acting as a custodian a broker nominee or otherwise as an agent for the beneficial owner of a regular certificate a “qualified intermediary” is generally a foreign financial institution or clearing organization or a nonus branch or office of a us financial institution or clearing organization that is a party to a withholding agreement with the irs   if that statement or any other required statement is not provided  withholding will apply unless the interest on the regular certificate is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the united states by the nonus person in that latter case the nonus person will be subject to united states federal income tax at regular rates prepayment premiums distributable to regular certificateholders who are nonus persons may be subject to  united states withholding tax investors who are nonus persons should consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific tax consequences to them of owning a regular certificate   residual certificates   the conference committee report to the reform act indicates that amounts paid to residual certificateholders who are nonus persons are treated as interest for purposes of the  or lower treaty rate united states withholding tax treasury regulations provide that amounts distributed to residual certificateholders may qualify as “portfolio interest” subject to the conditions described in “—regular certificates” above but only to the extent that  the mortgage loans including mortgage loans underlying certain mbs were issued after july   and  the trust fund or segregated pool of assets in the trust fund as to which a separate remic election will be made to which the residual certificate relates consists of obligations issued in “registered form” within the meaning of code section f generally whole mortgage loans will not be but mbs and regular interests in another remic pool will be considered obligations issued in registered form furthermore a residual certificateholder will not be entitled to any exemption from the  withholding tax or lower treaty rate to the extent of that portion of remic taxable income that constitutes an “excess inclusion” see “—taxation of residual certificates—limitations on offset or exemption of remic income” above if the amounts paid to residual certificateholders who are nonus persons are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the united states by nonus persons  or lower treaty rate withholding will not apply instead the amounts paid to nonus persons will be subject to united states federal income tax at regular rates if  or lower treaty rate withholding is applicable those amounts generally will be taken into account for purposes of withholding only when paid or otherwise distributed or when the residual certificate is disposed of under rules similar to withholding upon disposition of debt instruments that have original issue discount see “—taxation of residual certificates—taxrelated restrictions on transfer of residual certificates—foreign investors” above concerning the disregard of certain transfers having “tax avoidance potential” and the withholding tax obligations of us partnerships having nonus persons as partners investors who are nonus persons should consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific tax consequences to them of owning residual certificates   fatca   under sections  through  of the code “fatca” “foreign financial institutions” will be required to enter into an agreement with the irs requiring them to obtain and to disclose to the irs information about certain of their us investors if any fatca also requires certain other foreign entities to obtain and disclose information about their investors to the relevant withholding agent who would in turn be required to provide such information to the irs fatca imposes a  withholding tax on        certain payments of income and gross proceeds to an applicable foreign entity which includes foreign financial institutions as well as certain other financial

federal income tax consequences for certificates as to which no remic election is made   standard certificates   general   in the event that no election is made to treat a trust fund or a segregated pool of assets in the trust fund with respect to a series of certificates that are not designated as “—stripped certificates” as described below as a remic certificates of that kind of series are referred to as “standard certificates” in the opinion of cadwalader wickersham  taft llp the trust fund will be classified as a grantor trust under subpart e part  of subchapter j of the code and not as an association taxable as a corporation or a “taxable mortgage pool” within the meaning of code section i where there is no fixed retained yield with respect to the mortgage loans underlying the standard certificates the holder of a standard certificate a “standard certificateholder” in that series will be treated as the owner of a pro rata undivided interest in the ordinary income and corpus portions of the trust fund represented by its standard certificate and will be considered the beneficial owner of a pro rata undivided interest in each of the mortgage loans subject to the discussion under “—recharacterization of servicing fees” below accordingly the holder of a standard certificate of a particular series will be required to report on its federal income tax return its pro rata share of the entire income from the mortgage loans represented by its standard certificate including interest at the coupon rate on those mortgage loans original issue discount if any prepayment fees assumption fees and late payment charges received by the master servicer in accordance with that standard certificateholder’s method of accounting a standard certificateholder generally will be able to deduct its share of the servicing fee and all administrative and other expenses of the trust fund in accordance with its method of accounting provided that those amounts are reasonable compensation for services rendered to that trust fund however investors who are individuals estates or trusts who own standard certificates either directly or indirectly through certain passthrough entities will be subject to limitation with respect to certain itemized deductions described in code section  including deductions under code section  for the servicing fee and all the administrative and other expenses of the trust fund to the extent that those deductions in the aggregate do not exceed two percent of an investor’s adjusted gross income in addition code section  provides that itemized deductions otherwise allowable for a taxable year of an individual taxpayer with income above certain thresholds will be reduced by the lesser of   of the excess if any of adjusted gross income over a statutory threshold or   of the amount of itemized deductions otherwise allowable for that year as a result those investors holding standard certificates directly or indirectly through a passthrough entity may have aggregate taxable income in excess of the aggregate amount of cash received on those standard certificates with respect to interest at the passthrough rate on those standard certificates in addition those expenses are not deductible at all for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax and may cause the investors to be subject to significant additional tax liability moreover where there is fixed retained yield with respect to the mortgage loans underlying a series of standard certificates or where the servicing fee is in excess of reasonable servicing compensation the transaction will be subject to the application of the “stripped bond” and “stripped coupon” rules of the code as described under “—stripped certificates” and “—recharacterization of servicing fees” below        tax status   in the opinion of cadwalader wickersham  taft llp standard certificates will have the following status for federal income tax purposes          standard certificate owned by a “domestic building and loan association” within the meaning of code section a will be considered to represent “loanssecured by an interest in real property which is    residential real property” within the meaning of code section acv provided that the real property securing the mortgage loans represented by that standard certificate is of the type described in that section of the code          standard certificate owned by a real estate investment trust will be considered to represent “real estate assets” within the meaning of code section cb to the extent that the assets of the related trust fund consist of qualified assets and interest income on those assets will be considered “interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property” to such extent within the meaning of code section cb          standard certificate owned by a remic will be considered to represent an “obligation    which is principally secured by an interest in real property” within the meaning of code section gaa to the extent that the assets of the related trust fund consist of “qualified mortgages” within the meaning of code section ga   premium and discount   standard certificateholders are advised to consult with their tax advisors as to the federal income tax treatment of premium and discount arising either upon initial acquisition of standard certificates or thereafter   premium the treatment of premium incurred upon the purchase of a standard certificate will be determined generally as described under “—federal income tax consequences for remic certificates—taxation of residual certificates—treatment of certain items of remic income and expense—premium” above   original issue discount the original issue discount rules will be applicable to a standard certificateholder’s interest in those mortgage loans originated with original issue discount under the oid regulations the original issue discount could arise by the charging of points by the originator of the mortgages in an amount greater than a statutory de minimis exception including a payment of points currently deductible by the borrower under applicable code provisions or under certain circumstances by the presence of “teaser rates” on the mortgage loans   original issue discount must generally be reported as ordinary gross income as it accrues under a constant interest method that takes into account the compounding of interest in advance of the cash attributable to that income if so indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement no prepayment assumption will be assumed for purposes of that accrual however code section  provides for a reduction in the amount of original issue discount includible in the income of a holder of an obligation that acquires the obligation after its initial issuance at a price greater than the sum of the original issue price and the previously accrued original issue discount less prior payments of principal accordingly if the mortgage loans acquired by a standard certificateholder are purchased at a price equal to the then unpaid principal amount of the mortgage loans no original issue discount attributable to the difference between the issue price and the original principal amount of the mortgage loans ie points will be includible by that holder   market discount standard certificateholders also will be subject to the market discount rules to the extent that the conditions for application of those sections are met market discount on the mortgage loans will be determined and will be reported as ordinary income generally in the manner described under “—federal income tax consequences for remic certificates—taxation of regular certificates—market discount” above except that the ratable accrual methods described there will not apply and it is unclear        whether a prepayment assumption would apply rather the holder will accrue market discount pro rata over the life of the mortgage loans unless the constant yield method is elected if so indicated in the related prospectus supplement no prepayment assumption will be assumed for purposes of that accrual   recharacterization of servicing fees   if the servicing fee paid to the master servicer were deemed to exceed reasonable servicing compensation the amount of that excess would represent neither income nor a deduction to certificateholders in this regard there are no authoritative guidelines for federal income tax purposes as to either the maximum amount of servicing compensation that may be considered reasonable in the context of this or similar transactions or whether in the case of the standard certificate the reasonableness of servicing compensation should be determined on a weighted average or loanbyloan basis if a loanbyloan basis is appropriate the likelihood that the amount would exceed reasonable servicing compensation as to some of the mortgage loans would be increased irs guidance indicates that a servicing fee in excess of reasonable compensation “excess servicing” will cause the mortgage loans to be treated under the “stripped bond” rules that guidance provides safe harbors for servicing deemed to be reasonable and requires taxpayers to demonstrate that the value of servicing fees in excess of those amounts is not greater than the value of the services provided   accordingly if the irs’s approach is upheld a servicer who receives a servicing fee in excess of those amounts would be viewed as retaining an ownership interest in a portion of the interest payments on the mortgage loans under the rules of code section  the separation of ownership of the right to receive some or all of the interest payments on an obligation from the right to receive some or all of the principal payments on the obligation would result in treatment of those mortgage loans as “stripped coupons” and “stripped bonds” subject to the de minimis rule discussed under “—stripped certificates” below each stripped bond or stripped coupon could be considered for this purpose as a noninterest bearing obligation issued on the date of issue of the standard certificates and the original issue discount rules of the code would apply to that holder while standard certificateholders would still be treated as owners of beneficial interests in a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes the corpus of the trust could be viewed as excluding the portion of the mortgage loans the ownership of which is attributed to the master servicer or as including that portion as a second class of equitable interest applicable treasury regulations treat that arrangement as a fixed investment trust since the multiple classes of trust interests should be treated as merely facilitating direct investments in the trust assets and the existence of multiple classes of ownership interests is incidental to that purpose in general a recharacterization should not have any significant effect upon the timing or amount of income reported by a standard certificateholder except that the income reported by a cash method holder may be slightly accelerated see “—stripped certificates” below for a further description of the federal income tax treatment of stripped bonds and stripped coupons   sale or exchange of standard certificates   upon sale or exchange of a standard certificate a standard certificateholder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale other than amounts allocable to accrued interest and its aggregate adjusted basis in the mortgage loans and the other assets represented by the standard certificate in general the aggregate adjusted basis will equal the standard certificateholder’s cost for the standard certificate increased by the amount of any income previously reported with respect to the standard certificate and decreased by the amount of any losses previously reported with respect to the standard certificate and the amount of any distributions received on those standard certificates except as provided above with respect to market discount on any mortgage loans and except for certain financial institutions subject to the provisions of code section c that gain or loss would be capital gain or loss if the standard certificate was held as a capital asset however gain on the sale of a standard certificate will be treated as ordinary income  if a standard certificate is held as part of a “conversion transaction” as defined in code section c up to the amount of interest that would have accrued on the standard certificateholder’s net investment in the conversion transaction at  of the appropriate applicable federal rate in effect at the time the taxpayer entered into the transaction minus any amount previously treated as ordinary income with respect to any prior disposition        of property that was held as a part of that transaction or  in the case of a noncorporate taxpayer to the extent the taxpayer has made an election under code section d to have net capital gains taxed as investment income at ordinary income rates longterm capital gains of certain noncorporate taxpayers generally are subject to lower tax rates than ordinary income or shortterm capital gains of those taxpayers for property held for more than one year the maximum tax rate for corporations is the same with respect to both ordinary income and capital gains   stripped certificates   general   pursuant to code section  the separation of ownership of the right to receive some or all of the principal payments on an obligation from ownership of the right to receive some or all of the interest payments results in the creation of “stripped bonds” with respect to principal payments and “stripped coupons” with respect to interest payments for purposes of this discussion certificates that are subject to those rules will be referred to as “stripped certificates” stripped certificates include interestonly certificates entitled to distributions of interest with disproportionately small nominal or no distributions of principal and principalonly certificates entitled to distributions of principal with disproportionately small nominal or no distributions of interest as to which no remic election is made   the certificates will be subject to those rules if          we or any of our affiliates retain for our own account or for purposes of resale in the form of fixed retained yield or otherwise an ownership interest in a portion of the payments on the mortgage loans          the master servicer is treated as having an ownership interest in the mortgage loans to the extent it is paid or retains servicing compensation in an amount greater than reasonable consideration for servicing the mortgage loans see “—standard certificates—recharacterization of servicing fees” above and          certificates are issued in two or more classes or subclasses representing the right to nonprorata percentages of the interest and principal payments on the mortgage loans   in general a holder of a stripped certificate will be considered to own “stripped bonds” with respect to its pro rata share of all or a portion of the principal payments on each mortgage loan andor “stripped coupons” with respect to its pro rata share of all or a portion of the interest payments on each mortgage loan including the stripped certificate’s allocable share of the servicing fees paid to the master servicer to the extent that those fees represent reasonable compensation for services rendered see discussion under “—standard certificates—recharacterization of servicing fees” above although not free from doubt for purposes of reporting to stripped certificateholders the servicing fees will be allocated to the stripped certificates in proportion to the respective entitlements to distributions of each class or subclass of stripped certificates for the related period or periods the holder of a stripped certificate generally will be entitled to a deduction each year in respect of the servicing fees as described under “—standard certificates—general” above subject to the limitation described there   code section  treats a stripped bond or a stripped coupon as an obligation issued at an original issue discount on the date that the stripped interest is purchased although the treatment of stripped certificates for federal income tax purposes is not clear in certain respects at this time particularly where the stripped certificates are issued with respect to a mortgage pool containing variablerate mortgage loans in the opinion of cadwalader wickersham  taft llp  the trust fund will be treated as a grantor trust under subpart e part  of subchapter j of the code and not as an association taxable as a corporation or a “taxable mortgage pool” within the meaning of code section i and  each stripped certificate should be treated as a single installment obligation for purposes of calculating original issue discount and gain or loss on disposition this treatment is based on the interrelationship of code section  code sections  through  and the oid regulations while under code section  computations with respect to stripped certificates arguably should be made in one of the        ways described under “—taxation of stripped certificates—possible alternative characterizations” below the oid regulations state in general that two or more debt instruments issued by a single issuer to a single investor in a single transaction should be treated as a single debt instrument for original issue discount purposes the applicable pooling agreement will require that the trustee make and report all computations described below using this aggregate approach unless substantial legal authority requires otherwise   furthermore treasury regulations provide for the treatment of a stripped certificate as a single debt instrument issued on the date it is purchased for purposes of calculating any original issue discount in addition under these regulations a stripped certificate that represents a right to payments of both interest and principal may be viewed either as issued with original issue discount or market discount as described below at a de minimis original issue discount or presumably at a premium this treatment suggests that the interest component of that stripped certificate would be treated as qualified stated interest under the oid regulations other than in the case of an interestonly stripped certificate or a stripped certificate on which the interest is substantially disproportionate to the principal amount further these final regulations provide that the purchaser of a stripped certificate will be required to account for any discount as market discount rather than original issue discount if either  the initial discount with respect to the stripped certificate was treated as zero under the de minimis rule or  no more than  basis points in excess of reasonable servicing is stripped off the related mortgage loans this market discount would be reportable as described under “—federal income tax consequences for remic certificates—taxation of regular certificates—market discount” above without regard to the de minimis rule there assuming that a prepayment assumption is employed in that computation   status of stripped certificates   no specific legal authority exists as to whether the character of the stripped certificates for federal income tax purposes will be the same as that of the mortgage loans although the issue is not free from doubt in the opinion of cadwalader wickersham  taft llp stripped certificates owned by applicable holders should be considered to represent “real estate assets” within the meaning of code section cb “obligations principally secured by an interest in real property” within the meaning of code section gaa and “loans    secured by an interest in real property which is    residential real property” within the meaning of code section acv and interest including original issue discount income attributable to stripped certificates should be considered to represent “interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property” within the meaning of code section cb provided that in each case the mortgage loans and interest on those mortgage loans qualify for that treatment   taxation of stripped certificates   original issue discount except as described under “—general” above each stripped certificate will be considered to have been issued at an original issue discount for federal income tax purposes original issue discount with respect to a stripped certificate must be included in ordinary income as it accrues in accordance with a constant interest method that takes into account the compounding of interest which may be prior to the receipt of the cash attributable to that income based in part on the oid regulations and the amendments to the original issue discount sections of the code made by the reform act the amount of original issue discount required to be included in the income of a holder of a stripped certificate referred to in this discussion as a “stripped certificateholder” in any taxable year likely will be computed generally as described under “—federal income tax consequences for remic certificates—taxation of regular certificates—original issue discount” and “—variable rate regular certificates” above however with the apparent exception of a stripped certificate qualifying as a market discount obligation as described under “—general” above the issue price of a stripped certificate will be the purchase price paid by each holder of the stripped certificate and the stated redemption price at maturity will include the aggregate amount of the payments other than qualified stated interest to be made on the stripped certificate to that stripped certificateholder presumably under the prepayment assumption        if the mortgage loans prepay at a rate either faster or slower than that under the prepayment assumption a stripped certificateholder’s recognition of original issue discount will be either accelerated or decelerated and the amount of the original issue discount will be either increased or decreased depending on the relative interests in principal and interest on each mortgage loan represented by that stripped certificateholder’s stripped certificate while the matter is not free from doubt the holder of a stripped certificate should be entitled in the year that it becomes certain assuming no further prepayments that the holder will not recover a portion of its adjusted basis in that stripped certificate to recognize an ordinary loss if it is a corporation or a shortterm capital loss if it is not a corporation and does not hold the stripped certificate in connection with a trade or business equal to that portion of unrecoverable basis   as an alternative to the method described above the fact that some or all of the interest payments with respect to the stripped certificates will not be made if the mortgage loans are prepaid could lead to the interpretation that the interest payments are “contingent” within the meaning of the oid regulations the oid regulations as they relate to the treatment of contingent interest are by their terms not applicable to prepayable securities such as the stripped certificates however if final regulations dealing with contingent interest with respect to the stripped certificates apply the same principles as the oid regulations those regulations may lead to different timing of income inclusion that would be the case under the oid regulations furthermore application of those principles could lead to the characterization of gain on the sale of contingent interest stripped certificates as ordinary income investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the appropriate tax treatment of stripped certificates   in light of the application of code section  a beneficial owner of a stripped certificate generally will be required to compute accruals of original issue discount based on its yield possibly taking into account its own prepayment assumption the information necessary to perform the related calculations for information reporting purposes however generally will not be available to the trustee accordingly any information reporting provided by the trustee with respect to the stripped certificates which information will be based on pricing information as of the closing date will largely fail to reflect the accurate accruals of original issue discount for these certificates prospective investors therefore should be aware that the timing of accruals of original issue discount applicable to a stripped certificate generally will be different than that reported to holders and the irs prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding their obligation to compute and include in income the correct amount of original issue discount accruals and any possible tax consequences to them if they should fail to do so   sale or exchange of stripped certificates sale or exchange of a stripped certificate prior to its maturity will result in gain or loss equal to the difference if any between the amount received and the stripped certificateholder’s adjusted basis in that stripped certificate as described under “—federal income tax consequences for remic certificates—taxation of regular certificates—sale or exchange of regular certificates” above to the extent that a subsequent purchaser’s purchase price is exceeded by the remaining payments on the stripped certificates by more than the statutory de minimis amount that subsequent purchaser will be required for federal income tax purposes to accrue and report that excess as if it were original issue discount in the manner described above it is not clear for this purpose whether the assumed prepayment rate that is to be used in the case of a stripped certificateholder other than an original stripped certificateholder should be the prepayment assumption or a new rate based on the circumstances at the date of subsequent purchase   purchase of more than one class of stripped certificates where an investor purchases more than one class of stripped certificates it is currently unclear whether for federal income tax purposes those classes of stripped certificates should be treated separately or aggregated for purposes of the rules described above        possible alternative characterizations the characterizations of the stripped certificates discussed above are not the only possible interpretations of the applicable code provisions for example the stripped certificateholder may be treated as the owner of          one installment obligation consisting of that stripped certificate’s pro rata share of the payments attributable to principal on each mortgage loan and a second installment obligation consisting of that stripped certificate’s pro rata share of the payments attributable to interest on each mortgage loan          as many stripped bonds or stripped coupons as there are scheduled payments of principal andor interest on each mortgage loan or          a separate installment obligation for each mortgage loan representing the stripped certificate’s pro rata share of payments of principal andor interest to be made with respect thereto   alternatively the holder of one or more classes of stripped certificates may be treated as the owner of a pro rata fractional undivided interest in each mortgage loan to the extent that the stripped certificate or classes of stripped certificates in the aggregate represent the same pro rata portion of principal and interest on that mortgage loan and a stripped bond or stripped coupon as the case may be treated as an installment obligation or contingent payment obligation as to the remainder final regulations issued regarding original issue discount on stripped obligations make the foregoing interpretations less likely to be applicable the preamble to those regulations states that they are premised on the assumption that an aggregation approach is appropriate for determining whether original issue discount on a stripped bond or stripped coupon is de minimis and solicits comments on appropriate rules for aggregating stripped bonds and stripped coupons under code section    because of these possible varying characterizations of stripped certificates and the resultant differing treatment of income recognition stripped certificateholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the proper treatment of stripped certificates for federal income tax purposes    medicare tax on “net investment income”   certain noncorporate us persons may be subject to an additional  medicare tax on “net investment income” see “—federal income tax consequences for

year to each standard certificateholder or stripped certificateholder at any time during that year the information prepared on the basis described above as the trustee deems to be necessary or desirable to enable those certificateholders to prepare their federal income tax returns the information will include the amount of original issue discount accrued on certificates held by persons other than certificateholders exempted from the reporting requirements the amounts required to be reported by the trustee may not be equal to the proper amount of original issue discount required to be reported as taxable income by a certificateholder other than an original certificateholder that purchased at the issue price in particular in the case of stripped certificates if so provided in the applicable prospectus supplement the reporting will be based upon a representative initial offering price of each class of stripped certificates the trustee will also file the original issue discount information with the irs if a certificateholder fails to supply an accurate taxpayer identification number or if the secretary of the treasury determines that a certificateholder has not reported all interest and dividend income required to be shown on his federal income tax return backup withholding at a current rate of  may be required in respect of any reportable payments as described under “—federal income tax consequences for remic certificates—backup withholding” above   the irs has published final regulations which establish a reporting framework for interests in “widely held fixed investment trusts” and place the responsibility of reporting on the person in the ownership chain        who holds an interest for a beneficial owner a widelyheld fixed investment trust is defined as an arrangement classified as an “investment trust” under treasury regulations section c in which any interest is held by a middleman which includes but is not limited to i a custodian of a person’s account ii a nominee and iii a broker holding an interest for a customer in street name   under these regulations in connection with a grantor trust the trustee will be required to file form  or any successor form with the irs with respect to holders of the certificates who are not “exempt recipients” a term that includes corporations trusts securities dealers middlemen and certain other nonindividuals and do not hold such certificates through a middleman to report in accordance with the provisions of the pooling and servicing agreement the grantor trust’s gross income and in certain circumstances unless the trustee reports under the safe harbor as described in the last sentence of this paragraph if any trust assets were disposed of or certificates are sold in secondary market sales the portion of the gross proceeds relating to the trust assets that are attributable to such holder the same requirements would be imposed on middlemen holding certificates on behalf of holders under certain circumstances the trustee may report under the safe harbor for widelyheld mortgage trusts as such term is defined under treasury regulations section    these regulations also require that the trustee make available information regarding interest income and information necessary to compute any original issue discount to i exempt recipients including middlemen and noncalendar year taxpayers upon request in accordance with the requirements of the regulations and ii holders who do not hold their certificates through a middleman the information must be provided to parties

certain foreign investors   treasury regulations provide that interest or original issue discount paid by the trustee or other withholding agent to a nonus person evidencing ownership interest in mortgage loans will be “portfolio interest” and will be treated in the manner and those persons will be subject to the same certification and reporting requirements described under “—federal income tax consequences for remic certificates—taxation of certain foreign investors—regular certificates” above   holders that are “foreign financial institutions” may be required to provide additional

federal income tax consequences described in “material federal income tax consequences” you should consider the state and local tax consequences of the acquisition ownership and disposition of the offered certificates state and local tax law may differ substantially from the corresponding federal law and the discussion above does not purport to describe any aspect of the tax laws of any state or other jurisdiction thus you should consult your own tax advisors with respect to the various tax consequences of investments in the offered certificates   certain erisa considerations   general   the employee retirement income security act of  as amended or erisa and the code impose certain requirements on retirement plans and on certain other employee benefit plans and arrangements including individual retirement accounts and annuities keogh plans collective investment        funds insurance company separate accounts and some insurance company general accounts in which those plans accounts or arrangements are invested that are subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of erisa and section  of the code all of which are referred to as “plans” and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to plans in connection with the investment of plan assets certain employee benefit plans such as governmental plans as defined in erisa section  and if no election has been made under section d of the code church plans as defined in section  of erisa are not subject to erisa requirements however those plans may be subject to the provisions of other applicable federal state or local law “similar law” materially similar to the foregoing provisions of erisa or the code moreover those plans if qualified and exempt from taxation under sections a and a of the code are subject to the prohibited transaction rules set forth in section  of the code   erisa generally imposes on plan fiduciaries certain general fiduciary requirements including those of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that a plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the plan in addition erisa and the code prohibit a broad range of transactions involving assets of a plan and persons “parties in interest” who have certain specified relationships to the plan unless a statutory regulatory or administrative exemption is available certain parties in interest that participate in a prohibited transaction may be subject to an excise tax imposed pursuant to section  of the code unless a statutory regulatory or administrative exemption is available these prohibited transactions generally are set forth in section  of erisa and section  of the code special caution should be exercised before the assets of a plan are used to purchase an offered certificate if with respect to those assets the depositor the master servicer or the trustee or one of their affiliates either a has investment discretion with respect to the investment of those assets of that plan or b has authority or responsibility to give or regularly gives investment advice with respect to those assets for a fee and pursuant to an agreement or understanding that the advice will serve as a primary basis for investment decisions with respect to those assets and that the advice will be based on the particular investment needs of the plan or c is an employer maintaining or contributing to the plan   before purchasing any offered certificates with plan assets a plan fiduciary should consult with its counsel and determine whether there exists any prohibition to that purchase under the requirements of erisa or section  of the code whether any prohibited transaction class exemption or any individual administrative prohibited transaction exemption as described below applies including whether the appropriate conditions set forth in those exemptions would be met or whether any statutory prohibited transaction exemption is applicable and further should consult the applicable prospectus supplement relating to that series of offered certificates fiduciaries of plans subject to a similar law should consider the need for and the availability of an exemption under such applicable similar law   plan asset regulations   a plan’s investment in offered certificates may cause the trust assets to be deemed plan assets section  of the regulations of the united states department of labor “dol” as modified by section  of erisa provides that when a plan acquires an equity interest in an entity the plan’s assets include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets of the entity unless certain exceptions not applicable to this discussion apply or unless the equity participation in the entity by “benefit plan investors” that is plans and entities whose underlying assets include plan assets is not “significant” for this purpose in general equity participation in a trust fund will be “significant” on any date if immediately after the most recent acquisition of any certificate  or more of any class of certificates is held by benefit plan investors   in general any person who has discretionary authority or control respecting the management or disposition of plan assets and any person who provides investment advice with respect to those assets for a fee is a fiduciary of the investing plan if the trust assets constitute plan assets then any party exercising management or discretionary control regarding those assets such as a master servicer a special servicer or any subservicer may be deemed to be a plan “fiduciary” with respect to the investing plan and thus subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions and prohibited transaction provisions of        erisa and the code in addition if the trust assets constitute plan assets the purchase of offered certificates by a plan as well as the operation of the trust fund may constitute or involve a prohibited transaction under erisa or the code   administrative exemptions   several underwriters of mortgagebacked securities have applied for and obtained individual administrative erisa prohibited transaction exemptions the “exemptions” which can only apply to the purchase and holding of mortgagebacked securities which among other conditions are sold in an offering with respect to which that underwriter serves as the sole or a managing underwriter or as a selling or placement agent if one of the exemptions might be applicable to a series of certificates the related prospectus supplement will refer to the possibility as well as provide a summary of the conditions to the applicability plan fiduciaries should and other potential investors who may be analyzing the potential liquidity of their investment may wish to consult with their advisors regarding the exemptions   insurance company general accounts   sections i and iii of prohibited transaction class exemption “ptce”  exempt from the application of the prohibited transaction provisions of sections a b and a of erisa and section  of the code transactions in connection with the acquisition of a security such as a certificate issued by a trust fund as well as the servicing management and operation of a trust such as the trust fund in which an insurance company general account has an interest as a result of its acquisition of certificates issued by the trust provided that certain conditions are satisfied if these conditions are met insurance company general accounts investing assets that are treated as assets of plans would be allowed to purchase certain classes of certificates which do not meet the ratings requirements of the exemptions all other conditions of the exemptions would have to be satisfied in order for ptce  to be available before purchasing any class of offered certificates an insurance company general account seeking to rely on sections i and iii of ptce  should itself confirm that all applicable conditions and other requirements have been satisfied   section c to erisa provides certain exemptive relief from the provisions of part  of title i of erisa and section  of the code including the prohibited transaction restrictions imposed by erisa and the related excise taxes imposed by the code for transactions involving an insurance company general account pursuant to section c of erisa the dol issued regulations “c regulations” generally effective july   to provide guidance for the purpose of determining in cases where insurance policies supported by an insured’s general account are issued to or for the benefit of a plan on or before december   which general account assets constitute plan assets any assets of an insurance company general account which support insurance policies issued to a plan after december   or issued to plans on or before december   for which the insurance company does not comply with the c regulations may be treated as plan assets in addition because section c of erisa does not relate to insurance company separate accounts separate account assets are still generally treated as plan assets of any plan invested in that separate account insurance companies contemplating the investment of general account assets in the offered certificates should consult with their counsel with respect to the applicability of section c of erisa   unrelated business taxable income residual certificates   the purchase of a residual certificate by any employee benefit plan qualified under code section a and exempt from taxation under code section a including most varieties of plans may give rise to “unrelated business taxable income” as described in code sections  and e further prior to the purchase of residual certificates a prospective transferee may be required to provide an affidavit to a transferor that it is not nor is it purchasing a residual certificate on behalf of a “disqualified organization” which term as defined above includes certain taxexempt entities not subject to code section  including certain governmental plans as discussed above under the caption “material federal income tax consequences—federal income tax consequences for remic        certificates—taxation of residual certificates—taxrelated restrictions on transfer of residual certificates—disqualified organizations”   due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties imposed upon persons involved in prohibited transactions it is particularly important that potential investors who are plan fiduciaries or who are investing plan assets consult with their counsel regarding the consequences under erisa and the code of their acquisition and ownership of certificates   the sale of certificates to a plan is in no respect a representation by the depositor or the underwriter that this investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by plans generally or by any particular plan or that this investment is appropriate for plans generally or for any particular plan   legal investment   if so specified in the related prospectus supplement certain classes of offered certificates will constitute “mortgage related securities” for purposes of the secondary mortgage market enhancement act of  as amended “smmea” generally the only classes of offered certificates which will qualify as “mortgage related securities” will be those that  are rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization as defined in section a of the exchange act “nrsro” and  are part of a series evidencing interests in a trust fund consisting of loans originated by certain types of originators specified in smmea and secured by first liens on real estate   while section e of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act amended smmea effective july   so as to require the sec to establish creditworthiness standards by that date in substitution for the foregoing ratings test the sec has neither proposed nor adopted a rule establishing new creditworthiness standards for purposes of smmea as of the date of this prospectus however the sec has issued a transitional interpretation release no  effective july   which provides that until such time as final rules establishing new standards of creditworthiness become effective the standard of creditworthiness for purposes of the definition of the term “mortgage related security” is a security that is rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least one nrsro depending on the standards of creditworthiness that are ultimately established by the sec it is possible that certain classes of offered certificates specified to be “mortgage related securities” for purposes of smmea in the related prospectus supplement may no longer qualify as such as of the time such new standards are effective   the appropriate characterization of the offered certificates under various legal investment restrictions and thus the ability of investors subject to those restrictions to purchase the offered certificates are subject to significant interpretive uncertainties except as may be specified in the related prospectus supplement with regard to the status of certain classes of offered certificates as “mortgage related securities” for purposes of smmea no representations are made as to the proper characterization of the offered certificates for legal investment financial institution regulatory or other purposes or as to the ability of particular investors to purchase any offered certificates under applicable legal investment restrictions further any ratings downgrade of a class of offered certificates by an nrsro to less than an “investment grade” rating ie lower than the top four rating categories may adversely affect the ability of an investor to purchase or retain or otherwise impact the regulatory characteristics of that class the uncertainties described above and any unfavorable future determinations concerning the legal investment or financial institution regulatory characteristics of the offered certificates may adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the offered certificates   accordingly all investors whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations regulatory capital requirements or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal advisors in determining whether and to what extent the offered certificates constitute legal investments or are subject to investment capital or other regulatory restrictions        method of distribution   the offered certificates offered by this prospectus and by the related prospectus supplements will be
