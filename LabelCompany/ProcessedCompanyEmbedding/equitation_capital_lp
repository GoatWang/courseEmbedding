refinancing of all or a portion of our outstanding indebtedness and funding of working capital requirements or capital expendituresmarket commentary product  crude tanker markets the product tanker market experienced lower charter rates in the third quarter of  compared to the previous quarter as lack of arbitrage opportunities and high product inventories had a negative impact on tonnemile demand according to the international energy agency oecd total inventories stood at a record level of  billion barrels in july  limiting petroleum product seaborne movements year to date we have seen an increased number of product tanker deliveries which have weighed on the charter market however analysts expect this to be the last year of significant vessel deliveries in the medium range mr segment as these are expected to markedly decline from  onwards on the other hand strong us gasoline consumption particularly in the first part of the quarter on the back of the peak summer driving season and rising chinese product exports supported the product tanker spot market and partly offset weakness in other trading areasin the time charter market mr rates and activity weakened in the third quarter of  as a result of the softer spot marketon the supply side there was minimal activity in terms of new orders for product tankers and the orderbook currently stands at  its lowest level since  in addition the product tanker orderbook continued to experience slippage during the first nine months of  as approximately  of the expected mr and handy size tanker newbuildings were not delivered on schedule analysts estimate that net fleet growth in  for mr product tankers will be around  in  while overall demand growth will be approximately  as intraasian products trade is expected to grow by  in  supported by surging chinese products exports and firm oil demand in the regionsuezmax spot earnings declined compared to the previous quarter the declaration of force majeure for most of the quarter at a number of nigerian export terminals as a result of militant attacks on oil facilities led to a significant decline in the volume of cargoes available for suezmaxes in the west african market concurrently seasonally weak demand and an increased number of crude tanker newbuilding entering the market kept suezmax rates under pressure on the positive side the suezmax market was supported by solid chinese crude imports and increased crude flows from iran during the third quarter the suezmax spot market rebounded however in mid september on the back of a recovery of nigerian crude exports and higher crude shipments from russiaoverall during the period the market remained slow with only limited fixtures reported at decreased rates due to the depressed spot marketon the supply side the suezmax orderbook represented at the end of the third quarter of  approximately  of the current fleet however contracting activity has been subdued with just eleven suezmax tankers ordered year to date suezmax tanker demand is projected to continue growing in  on the back of firm growth in chinese and indian crude imports partly offset by weaker export volumes from west africa during the force majeure period in  crude suezmax deadweight demand is projected to increase by  whereas the fleet is forecasted to expand by neopanamax container market the container charter market remained mostly flat when compared to the previous quarter as most vessel classes charter rates were close to historically low levels the increase in demand for neo panamax vessels due to the new panama canal locks was largely offset by disappointing overall growth in demand for containerized cargo as well as the bankruptcy of hanjin shipping which added new tonnage to the list of idle vesselsby the end of the third quarter of  the idle container fleet had consequently increased from below  in the previous quarter to  at the end of the third quarter of analysts have revised their estimate for the demand for containerized cargo for fullyear  down to  from  in the previous quarter and their estimate for the increase in tonnage supply for fullyear  to  from  in the previous quarterthe total container vessel demolition until september  amounted to  teu while the full year forecast points to a record level of recycled container capacity in excess of  teu the average age of scrapped tonnage was  years down from  years in as of the date hereof the container orderbook stands at  of the current fleet down from  in the previous quarter and is the lowest since  while slippage for  teu container vessels amounted to overall market participants expect that the container vessel supply picture might improve further as the weaker rate environment is expected to induce increased slippage of new deliveries and demolition of existing shipsmanagement commentary mr jerry kalogiratos chief executive and chief financial officer of the partnerships general partner commentedwe are pleased to have achieved a number of important milestones during the last few months first we concluded our negotiations with hmm and we successfully liquidated the equity compensation received from hmm by recovering approximately  of our total charter hire loss under the charter restructuring agreements second we agreed to acquire a modern eco mr product tanker from capital maritime with an attractive charter to cargill we have funded part of the acquisition cost with the proceeds from the sale of the hmm equity compensation it is also worth highlighting that our sponsor capital maritime has received units as part of the purchase price at a significant premium to the latest closing price of our common units additionally we launched the atm offering for up to  million with the aim of raising further capital over a period of time for vessel acquisitions and general corporate purposesregarding recent market developments we note that the demand fundamentals for tankers and especially product tankers remain solid on the back of refinery capacity relocation increased tonnemiles and the low oil price environment however the high oil product inventories and the increased supply of tanker vessels has recently weighed on vessel earnings the limited number of new tanker ordering thus far this year and the rationalization of excess shipyard capacity combined with solid industry fundamentals are positive trends for the tanker markets in the medium to longrunfinally we are delighted that with the expected expansion of our fleet our board of directors has approved the increase of our quarterly distribution from the fourth quarter  onwards to  per common unit depending on our access to the financial markets our objective is to pursue additional accretive transactions going forward and expand our asset base with a view to further increasing the long term distributable cash flow of the partnershipconference call and webcasttoday october   the partnership will host an
