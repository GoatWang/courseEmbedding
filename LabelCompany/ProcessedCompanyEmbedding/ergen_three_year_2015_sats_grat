dish networks charlie ergen is the most hated man in hollywood  hollywood reporter the hollywood reporter dish networks charlie ergen is the most hated man in hollywood  pm pdt  by eriq gardner facebook twitter email me print comments his company has been labeled the worst place to work in america hes being sued by all four networks and his adskipping hopper could decimate tv industry economics as thr examines the troubling potential outcome of the entertainment business ugliest fight this story first appeared in the april  issue of the hollywood reporter magazine in  a few months before charlie ergen cofounded the company that would become dish network he and a gambling buddy strode into a lake tahoe casino with the intention of winning a fortune by counting cards ergen then  had bought a book called playing blackjack as a business and studied the cheat sheets unfortunately for him a security guard caught his pal lipsyncing numbers as the cards were dealt the two were kicked out and subsequently banned from the casino more than three decades later ergen now  again stands accused of cheating the house  but this time the house is here nestled in the confines of executive suites from burbank to beverly boulevard and now ergens englewood cobased dish network the nations thirdlargest satellitecable tv provider a public company thats grown from a  startup to an empire with  million subscribers and  billion in annual revenue is the entertainment industrys enemy no  with increasing frequency ergen has engaged in ugly highstakes games of chicken with hollywood in his brutal battle over ballooning carriage fees with amc he dropped the walking dead and mad men network from the dish system for months he also has spent years fighting with broadcasters over the practice of distantly retransmitting tv signals without a license and even was caught violating a promise to stop that he made under oath  all while dish was named americas worst company to work for by a watchdog website but all that was just preamble to the hopper photos the dead and the red the walking dead cast in character and on the red carpet in january  dish introduced the proprietary dvr service that allows consumers to autohop or watch the entire primetime lineup of the broadcast networks commercialfree without even having to fastforward through ads immediately after its introduction cbs nbc abc and fox filed lawsuits arguing that dish if allowed to continue offering the hopper will put them out of business the networks want a judge to grant an injunction and fox is appealing the denial of a shutdown while making a renewed attempt to enjoin the hopper  after dish added mobile capabilities amid the legal challenge ergen who is married with five kids and has seen his personal net worth swell to an estimated  billion making him th on the most recent forbes list of richest people expresses confidence that he will win the legal fight and says it is time that the broadcasters get on board some people are averse to change but the advertising model is going to change with or without the hopper he recently told analysts what were saying to the broadcasters is theres a way for you not to put your head in the sand  the broadcasters reject the assessment services like hopper that undermine the economic fabric of our business arent just illegal they potentially destroy our ability to give the public what it wants cbs chairman and ceo leslie moonves tells thr adds nbc broadcasting chairman ted harbert i think this is an attack on our ecosystem not surprisingly hopper has become extremely popular the year before dish began offering the service for free to customers the company lost  subscribers since then dish added back  were a little bit like an indiana jones movie a sanguine ergen said about his company at the all things digital conference feb  were always in trouble we always get out of it were always going from alligators to guys with arrows to snakes we want to win ergen declined comment for this piece story dish networks charlie ergen made m in total compensation in  at a time when big four broadcast network ratings have hit historic lows with fox down  percent this season and nbc being beaten in the to demo by univision during the february sweep its hard enough to pitch advertisers on delivering eyeballs to ads  as the nets will do in may at the annual  billion upfront presentations its even harder when a major satellite carrier is touting its ability to completely eliminate commercials from the viewer experience networks hope that if research agencies like nielsen start placing emphasis on those who watch programming a week after an initial live telecast it will help keep advertisers in line but analyst richard greenfield asks c vs c who is kidding whom about watching commercials during dvrd programming interestingly such tv carriers as time warner cable and directv though presumably in possession of the same technological capability have not provided products that have triggered such industry venom maybe theres a reason for that ergen has presented hopper as a consumer right while simultaneously telling analysts that programmers have devalued content by making tv shows available on netflix and suing espn for among other things allowing streaming cbs is trying to rescind its licensing contract with dish by claiming that ergen and his top lieutenants fraudulently hid their plans for the hopper in contract meetings in  and in february dish claimed cbs forced the big bang theory actress kaley cuoco to delete a sponsored tweet endorsing hopper even though there was no evidence the actress was pressured at a march event honoring moonves cuoco announced i would like to take this opportunity to say one thing leslie f the dish network as hollywood reluctantly enters the digital age new players like barry dillers aereo tv service are challenging traditional revenue streams and squaring off against the networks in court dillers aereo survived an initial legal challenge april  when an appeals court allowed it to stay in business at least until a trial even among these threats though dish represents perhaps the most aggressive and wellfunded disrupter and its controlled by a man who has the money and inclination to take the fight to its legal and for hollywood very scary conclusion yes hes known by some within his organization to be a pennypinching loudmouth they treat their employees like slaves says one online employee review but its one thing to scream at underlings and install a scanning device to police tardiness yes he really did that its quite another to destroy evidence and mislead judges in a courtroom  dish has been sanctioned for such behavior story espn ordered to pay dish network  million for breach of contract its all enough to ask if charlie ergen is the most hated man in hollywood what should the industry do about him ergen now is gearing up for a fight that could answer that question in september a licensing agreement expires between dish and the walt disney co the coming talks between the companies represent the first major negotiation since the introduction of the hopper disney hardly wishes to bless a tech product like the hopper by renewing its deal with dish but its nearly impossible for a media company to walk away from the billions of dollars ergen is paying for programming pagebreak this friendandfoe dilemma is the essential conundrum dish presents six months before its deal with disney was set to expire dish wasnt at any negotiation table but rather in a courtroom taking disneys espn unit to trial for allegedly offering dish competitors better prices naturally ergen has been hailed as a hero by consumer advocates who appreciate his willingness to toy with a tv model that has become sacred to hollywood conglomerates when it comes to trying out new things and keeping costs down in a competitive market you need a firstmover like dish says john bergmayer at public knowledge a notforprofit rights organization notes vijay jayant an analyst who has been following dish for years at isi group charlies attitude is at some point theyll negotiate with me on my terms hes bluffing until hes not story dish network to write down  million for blockbuster uk if dish exihibits a special form of aggression observers credit this to its billionaire founder and his companys precarious position in the competitive videodistribution industry charlie ergen was born in tennessee to a physicist father who is credited as coining the phrase china syndrome to describe the containment shortcomings of a nuclear reactor accident after playing small forward on the state universitys basketball team charlie earned a business degree from wake forest university in  then worked as a financial analyst at fritolay two years later at  he stunned his family by retiring  or rather he took advantage of the discounts his future wife cantey mcadam got working as a flight attendant to travel the world he also fiddled with becoming a professional poker and blackjack player then in  his buddy jim defranco told him about a big satellite dish getting signals from outer space according to a wake forest commencement address ergen gave in  together with defranco and mcadam the three sank  of their personal savings into a suburban denver startup called echostar an avid mountain climber who has scaled mount kilimanjaro and mount everest ergen steadily has grown his business  now officially known as screamingallcaps dish  into one of the  largest corporations in the world averaging about  billion in annual profits ergen controls  percent of voting power at the company dish thrived in large part by focusing on the hilly rural areas of the country where cable tv lines did not run  and of course a willingness to brawl with anyone getting in the way dish employees adversaries and analysts say no one exploits the judicial system like ergen does to gain a competitive advantage a judge a decade ago noted that ergen had violated a pledge made under penalty of perjury to stop distantly retransmitting local tv signals an appeals court wrote in  that there was no indication that echostar was ever interested in complying with the satellite home viewer act and added we seem to have discerned a pattern and practice of violating the act in every way imaginable story trial begins in dish networks  million lawsuit against espn during the mids when ergen was fighting tivo over who owned rights to dvr technology not only did tivo convince a court that dish had violated a patent but the judge in the case found it distasteful that ergens company would engage in an ad campaign that touted its dvrs as better than tivo while continuing to infringe tivos patent in  dish officially was sanctioned by the court the parties later settled perhaps most notoriously there were the irate judges who officiated dishs recent battle with cablevisionamc after dish terminated a year deal to carry the voom networks a suite of  littlewatched hd channels such as kung fu hd and film fest hd in the early days of the case dish was penalized for bad faith or gross negligence in the destruction of internal company emails a visibly angry new york supreme court judge richard lowe later threatened to launch an investigation unless dish documents were turned over the suit became so ugly that at one point dish executive carolyn crawford hit the father of the opposing sides lawyer on her way out of the courtroom she later apologized in open court in a sexual harassment case in maryland in  a judge wrote that echostar was guilty of gross spoliation of evidence in a  trademark dispute a judge said of dish lawyers that he had never encountered such divisiveness or contentiousness in his  years on the bench most corporations have an institutional bias against litigation and see it as necessary evil says one network insider but for charlie thats how he likes to run his company youll never see him suing in his home state though their name is mud in colorado judges are on to them in fact when dish filed suit in may  in an attempt to beat broadcasters to court and have a judge declare the hopper legal it did so in new york story cbs seeks to unwind retrans agreement with dish network dish continues to be pugnacious at every turn the federal trade commission and justice department are jointly pursuing a lawsuit against the company for allegedly violating telemarketing sales rules by placing unwanted calls to millions of consumers dish also uses every opportunity it has to tout its hopper as the tech product so great that the networks wont let anybody hear about it even while telling judges that the hopper is not so different from other dvrs ambush spin is common at dish on industry news websites employees regularly leave comments meant to slyly promote dish services one writer at allthingsd was so fed up that in  he penned a column titled dear dish network your spam makes me sad please stop the press release issued by dish in the kaley cuoco flap is another example there was no source of the alleged cbs demand to delete her tweet and cbs flatly denied it pushed to corroborate such an allegation dish spokesman john hall will only say we were contacted by someone close to the situation who told us that cbs asked her to remove the tweet barbara roehrig worked at echostar during the mid’s and was the companys first female senior executive she remembers constantly sparring with ergen who sometimes would threaten to walk into a room and fire all the employees he called the craziness pack the modus operandi is yelling there and it takes a toll says roehrig adding that she still stays in touch with many in dishs middle management who refuse to ascend to the companys executive ranks because of the emotional turmoil that it brings weve all been in the line of charlies ranting pagebreak dish was named americas worst company to work for by the website  wall street based on scathing reviews on the job site glassdoorcom employees have been subjected to badge reports where they are redflagged for showing up minutes late when they travel staffers are asked to take redeye flights share hotel rooms and reimburse the company if they tip more than  percent one fieldservice specialist tells thr in my office you are not even allowed to use the restroom in the mornings before leaving on your route or in the evenings until youre off the clock a dish rep says the company abandoned its badge reports in january and disputes that employees are forced to take redeye flights and arent allowed bathroom breaks after dish was hit with bad press management attempted to intervene dish ceo joe clayton sent employees an email that stated in part if you are happy here at dish and believe the company is moving in the right direction log on to glassdoorcom and provide feedback at dishs colorado headquarters company leaders shoot down questions about whether dish truly is the meanest of mean companies i think it is a challenging place to work admits dave shull a dish senior vp in charge of content acquisition deals he says its common for meetings to get animated but embraces the companys aggressive ethos you can always be a follower a slave to competition and hope for the best says shull or you can lead the charge try to expand market share and innovate when you ski or ride horses what happens when you sit back is that you lose control we lean in story cbs chief leslie moonves involved in decision to revoke ces award to dish networks hopper after several years of growth dish like the rest of the cable and satellite industry has been facing new challenges in  pay tv providers added only a few tens of thousands of subscribers according to analyst estimates and the overall trajectory isnt good in reaction dish has been aggressive in keeping customer bills lower than those of its rivals dishs subscriberrelated expenses increased to  billion in  up  percent from the previous year which the company attributes to rising programming costs by comparison directv spent more than  billion on programming in  and another  billion on service about a  percent increase id venture to guess that dishs programming increases are among the lowest in the business says jayant still that might not be enough dish now competes with such internetbased tv services as netflix and hulu subscribing to both costs only about a third of the  for a basic dish package as well as webandtv combos offered by the likes of time warner cable and comcast unlike its rivals dish has struggled to expand into businesses other than satellite tv service in  it completed an acquisition of blockbuster but couldnt leverage the brand into a viable netflix competitor dish has been attempting to do more with its wireless spectrum assets which it has paid roughly  billion to acquire but has been frustrated by fcc roadblocks the company lately has been attempting to get a wireless network service off the ground holding talks with google and making an aggressive bid to acquire part of g network pioneer clearwire corp for now though dish remains a onetrick pony in the words of analyst jayant unlike comcast it doesnt create any programming itself unlike time warner cable or verizon it isnt able to offer triple play of televisioninternetphone service what it has is the hopper which leads one lawyer defending the networks to conclude ergen would rather ask for forgiveness than permission some legal observers believe that dish will succeed in court in november a federal judge declined to grant a preliminary injunction to stop the hopper and said that fox faces an uphill road in arguing that dish has committed copyright infringement and breached its contracts with the network the judge wasnt totally convinced of the legality of dishs system however and some attorneys believe the broadcasters ultimately will prevail i think a court is going to side with the networks because of the economics though a new legal test might need to be fashioned because this doesnt fit the usual standards says bryan sullivan at early sullivan story dish network makes  billion bid to buy clearwire corp as the lawsuit plays out dishs ability to stay in the game might depend on the outcome of coming carriage negotiations ergen will be making a multibilliondollar bet that disney cant afford to walk away from dishs  million subscribers but if it signs a new deal it will send a signal that broadcasters have been a tad hyperbolic when it comes to the threat they allege the hopper to be if the offer is not right dish could head down a new path it might stream disneys abc anyway without a contract but in partnership with a company like dillers aereo whose own technology of capturing overtheair tv signals and transmitting them privately online likely will be hashed out in a messy trial dish and aereo reportedly have held talks with each other recently or dish could abandon the quickly growing cost of licensing espns live sports to further position the satellite distributor as the cheap alternative in the marketplace but thats undoubtedly risky analysts are getting a little edgy on a recent earnings call dishs management was asked to address whats going to happen we are a big customer of disneys answered clayton i would not expect them to take it down with the autohop as the reason added ergen our checks are pretty big dish pays disney roughly  billion a year for espn alone but thats not quite enough to settle the analyst community i have no idea what is going to happen admits jayant as the recent dishespn lawsuit highlighted thanks to most favored nation provisions which guarantee that no rival will get a better deal subscriber rates are intertwined throughout the tv industry if disney accepts less than market value from dish it likely will have to give discounts to other distributors too and walking away from dish might not necessarily mean losing all  million pay tv consumers if some of them defect to rival services a recent survey by lazard capital found that  percent to  percent of pay tv subscribers would cancel or switch their service if they lost a top broadcast network and  percent would cancel if they lost espn if anything contents leverage over distributors is strengthening concludes analyst barton crockett story ces dish network ups ante with new hopper features the last time disney and dish made a deal in  the negotiations took a year now theres just a few months until the license expires in september and the very dealmakers who will be meeting with one another just sat uncomfortably side by side for three weeks in a courtroom disney declines comment about whether it would look past the hopper whose legality likely will not be settled before the two sides need to make a deal a disney spokesperson says any renewal with dish would be consistent with established marketplace terms dishs shull wont say whether ergen or his execs have met with disney but says he hopes that the two companies will be able to work out their differences is ergen about to get comeuppance for his nasty behavior or will broadcasters bow to what many believe is the inevitable evolution of the ad business by years end the outcome of the disneydish negotiations could signal where the industry is headed for some folks it becomes personal says shull for me its business theres always some difference of opinion but with

nominating committee   the nominating committee operates under a charter adopted by the board  the principal function of the nominating committee is to identify review and recommend independent director nominees for selection by the board and to consider all director nominees in light of the entirety of their credentials  the nominating committee held two meetings and took no action by written consent during   the current members of the nominating committee are messrs ortolf schroeder federico and wade with mr federico serving as chairman  the board has determined that each member of the nominating committee meets the independence requirements of nasdaq and sec rules and regulations   board criteria and board selection process   the nominating committee considers candidates suggested by its members other directors senior management and shareholders as appropriate  no search firms or other advisors were retained to identify prospective nominees during the past fiscal year  in considering whether to recommend a prospective nominee for selection by the board the nominating committee considers the entirety of the prospective nominee’s credentials including but not limited to the following diverse factors i their reputation and character ii their ability and willingness to devote sufficient time to board duties iii their educational background iv their business and professional achievements experience and industry background v their independence from management under listing standards and the corporation’s governance guidelines and vi the needs of the board and the corporation  the nominating committee does not assign specific weights to any particular criteria and no particular criterion is necessarily applicable to all prospective nominees  however the corporation believes that the backgrounds and qualifications of the directors considered as a group should provide a diverse mix of experience knowledge and abilities that will allow the board to fulfill its responsibilities  the nominating committee recommends if necessary measures to be taken so that the board reflects the appropriate balance of experience knowledge and abilities required for the board as a whole and contains at least the minimum number of independent directors required by applicable laws and regulations   the nominating committee has not adopted a written policy with respect to the consideration of candidates proposed by shareholders or with respect to nominating anyone to our board other than nonemployee directors  a shareholder who wishes to recommend a prospective nominee for the board should notify the corporation’s secretary or any member of the nominating committee in writing in accordance with the process described in “shareholder communications” below with whatever supporting material the shareholder considers appropriate  it is the practice of the nominating committee to consider whether to nominate any person nominated by a shareholder pursuant to the provisions of the corporation’s bylaws relating to shareholder nominations   board leadership structure   the board currently separates the role of chairman of the board from the role of chief executive officer with mr charles w ergen serving as chairman and mr michael t dugan serving as chief executive officer and president of the corporation  mr dugan is responsible for the daytoday management of the corporation and mr ergen primarily identifies strategic priorities and leads the discussion and execution of strategy for the corporation  we believe this leadership structure is appropriate for the corporation and in the best interest of our shareholders because among other reasons separating the chairman and chief executive officer roles allows us to efficiently develop and implement corporate strategy that is consistent with the board’s oversight role while facilitating strong daytoday executive leadership  among other things separation of these roles allows our chief executive officer and other members of senior management to focus on our daytoday business while at the same time the board is able to take advantage of the unique blend of leadership experience and knowledge of our industry and business that mr ergen brings to the role of chairman in providing guidance to and oversight of management    the board’s role in risk oversight   the board has ultimate responsibility for oversight of the corporation’s risk management processes  the board discharges this oversight responsibility through regular reports received from and discussions with senior management on areas of material risk exposure to the corporation  these reports and board discussions include among other things operational financial legal and regulatory and strategic risks  additionally the corporation’s risk management processes are intended to identify manage and control risks so that they are appropriate considering the corporation’s scope operations and business objectives  the board or the appropriate committee in the case of risks in areas for which responsibility has been delegated to a particular committee engages with the appropriate members of senior management to enable its members to understand and provide input to and oversight of our risk identification risk management and risk mitigation strategies  the audit committee meets regularly in executive session without management present to among other things discuss the corporation’s risk management culture and processes  as part of its charter our audit committee is responsible for  discussing the corporation’s policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management and reviewing contingent liabilities and risks that may be material to the corporation  when a committee receives a report from a member of management regarding areas of risk the chairman of the relevant committee is expected to report on the discussion to the board to the extent necessary or appropriate  this enables the board to coordinate risk oversight particularly with respect to interrelated or cumulative risks that may involve multiple areas for which more than one committee has responsibility  the board or applicable committee also has authority to engage external advisors as necessary a discussion of our risk assessment of compensation programs and practices is described in “risk assessment” in the compensation discussion and analysis section below on page  of this proxy statement   other information about our board of directors   compensation committee interlocks and

our directors executive officers and holders of more than  of our common stock to file reports with the sec regarding their ownership and changes in ownership of our equity securities we believe that during  our directors executive officers and  shareholders complied with all section a filing requirements with the exception of the inadvertent omission of  class a shares from the form  filed by mr david j rayner on november   in addition on february   mr anders n johnson filed a form  reporting that  class a shares were reported in his form  filed on july   but such  class a shares were inadvertently omitted in each subsequent form  filed by mr johnson  in making these statements we have relied upon examination of copies of forms   and  provided to us and the written representations of our directors and officers  executive compensation and other information   compensation discussion and analysis this compensation discussion and analysis “cda” addresses our compensation objectives and policies for our neos the elements of neo compensation and the application of those objectives and policies to each element of compensation for our neos for fiscal year    our neos in  were messrs michael t dugan anders n johnson pradman p kaul david j rayner and kranti k kilaru all of our neos were employed and solely compensated by echostar during   with the exception of mr kaul who entered into an agreement regarding his employment with hughes prior to our acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of hughes communications in  the “hughes acquisition” none of our neos are party to an employment agreement with us   overall executive compensation program objectives and policies   compensation philosophy   our executive compensation program was guided by the following key principles in    • attraction retention and motivation of executive officers over the longterm • recognition of individual performance • recognition of the achievement of companywide and group performance goals if any and • creation of shareholder value by aligning the interests of management and shareholders through equity incentives general compensation levels   the total compensation opportunities both base salaries and incentives offered to our neos have been designed to ensure that they are competitive with market compensation levels support our executive recruitment retention and motivation objectives reward individual group and companywide performance and contribute to our success by aligning the interests of our executive officers and shareholders   in determining the overall compensation of our neos the corporation considers the subjective recommendations of our chairman mr ergen and our chief executive officer and president mr dugan who may take into account the following factors i information described in “compilation of certain peer group data” below including the base salaries and range of the percentage increases in base salaries for named executive officers of the companies contained in the peer group data as defined in “compilation of certain peer group data” below ii the executive’s performance and contributions andor considerations of retention including without limitation the executive’s success in achieving individual group and companywide goals and the extent to which the executive’s individual efforts resulted in tangible increases in corporate division or department success iii whether the performance goals of any shortterm or longterm incentive plans were met and the payouts that would become payable upon achievement of those performance goals iv the value of historic and current components of each neo’s compensation including the base salary and any bonus or incentive compensation paid to the neo in the prior year v the value of equity awards previously granted to the executive vi echostar’s overall financial and business performance vii the performance of the neo’s business unit viii the rate of standard annual merit increases for employees who are performing at a satisfactory level ix the expected compensation to be paid to other senior officers in the applicable year in relation to a particular neo x whether the neo was promoted or newly hired in the prior or applicable year and xi equity awards that would normally be granted upon a promotion in accordance with our policies for promotions  this approach to general compensation levels is not formulaic or standard and does not utilize formalized benchmarking and the weight given to any particular factor in determining a particular neo’s compensation depends on the subjective consideration of all factors described above in the aggregate   with respect to equity incentive compensation we generally attempt to ensure that our neos have appropriate incentives tied to the performance of our class a shares  therefore we may grant more equity awards to a particular neo in a given year if a substantial portion of the neo’s equity incentives are vested and the underlying stock is capable of being sold  in addition the amount of equity incentives andor severance benefits may be considered when determining whether to grant equity incentives to an neo in a particular year we also generally take into account whether an neo has recently been promoted in determining whether to grant equity awards to that individual we may grant equity awards based on a number of subjective criteria including an neo’s position and role in our success and whether an neo has made any exceptional contributions to our success mr ergen recommends the compensation committee reviews and discusses and the board of directors ultimately approves the base salary compensation of mr dugan messrs ergen and dugan recommend the compensation committee reviews and discusses and the board of directors ultimately approves the base salary compensation of our other neos  after considering these recommendations and other considerations discussed above the board of directors determines the annual base salary for each neo the compensation  committee also makes and approves grants of options and other equitybased compensation to our neos pursuant to our executive officer bonus incentive plan the compensation committee also determines and establishes applicable payout targets and performance metrics for the payment of shortterm cash incentive awards determines whether and to what extent such performance metrics have been met for each neo for a particular year and approves shortterm cash incentive awards the compensation committee and the board of directors place substantial weight on mr ergen’s recommendations regarding all compensation matters in light of his role as chairman and as our controlling shareholder    compilation of certain peer group data   in connection with the approval process for our  executive officer compensation management prepared a compilation of the compensation components for the named executive officers of companies similar in size andor industry to echostar as disclosed in their respective publiclyfiled proxy statements the “peer group data”  the surveyed companies included loral space  communications inc cisco systems inc viasat communications inc akamai technologies inc earthlink holdings corp frontier communications corporation idt corporation and sba communications corporation  the peer group data along with other information obtained from media reports or other generally available sources related to executive compensation is used solely as a subjective frame of reference rather than for benchmarking compensation for the neos  we do not utilize a formulaic or standard formalized benchmarking level or element in setting our executive compensation relative to that of other companies  generally we believe our overall executive compensation lags behind most of the companies contained in our peer group data in the areas of shortterm incentives and severance packages and may be competitive over time in equity compensation   deductibility of compensation   section m of the internal revenue code of  as amended the “internal revenue code” places a limit on the tax deductibility of compensation in excess of  million paid to certain “covered employees” of a publicly held corporation generally the corporation’s chief executive officer and its next three most highly compensated executive officers other than the chief financial officer in the year that the compensation is paid  this limitation applies to compensation that is not considered performancebased under section m of the internal revenue code  we may structure our compensation programs where feasible to minimize or eliminate the impact of the limitations of section m of the internal revenue code  however there is no assurance that any aspect of our compensation program has met or will in the future meet the requirements of section m of the internal revenue code to be considered deductible compensation and nondeductible compensation in excess of the application limitation may be paid in addition we retain discretion to approve annual shortterm longterm or other compensation arrangements in a manner that does not permit the compensation to qualify for tax deductibility under section m of the internal revenue code use of compensation consultants   no compensation consultants were retained by the corporation the board of directors or the compensation committee to evaluate or recommend the setting of executive compensation during the past fiscal year   implementation of executive compensation program objectives and policies   elements of executive compensation the primary components of our executive compensation program include • base salary • equity incentive compensation shortterm andor longterm in the form of stock options andor restricted stock units offered under echostar’s stock incentive plan • shortterm cash incentive compensation • k plan and • other compensation including perquisites personal benefits and posttermination compensation our long and shortterm incentive compensation generally include conditional andor performancebased cash or equity incentive compensation and discretionary bonuses  the components of our executive compensation program combine to promote the objectives and policies described above  base salary k plan benefits and other benefits and perquisites provided generally to employees provide a minimum level of compensation for our neos  longterm equity andor performancebased incentive compensation align neo compensation with the creation of longterm shareholder value and generally promotes retention  shortterm cash or equity incentives reward individual group or company performance and achievement of shorterterm goals important to the corporation  we have not required that a certain percentage of an executive’s compensation be provided in one form versus another  however our goal is to award compensation that is reasonable in relation to our compensation program and objectives when all elements of potential compensation are considered  each element of our executive compensation and the rationale for each element are described below   base salary   we have traditionally included salary in our executive compensation package under the belief that it is appropriate that some portion of the compensation paid to our executives be provided in a form that is fixed and liquid occurring over regular intervals the board of directors has traditionally been free to set base salary at any level deemed appropriate with the compensation committee setting the base salary of the chairman the compensation committee and the board of directors typically review base salaries of our neos  any increases or decreases in base salary on a yearoveryear basis have usually been dependent on a combination of the factors outlined above in “general compensation levels” with particular emphasis on • echostar’s overall financial and business performance • the performance of the neo’s business unit • the neo’s individual contributions to echostar and • the rate of standard annual merit increases for employees who are performing at a satisfactory level   equity incentive compensation   we believe that our executive officers generally will be better able to contribute to our longterm success and help build incremental shareholder value if they have a stake in our future success and value  we believe this stake helps retain executives and focuses the executive officers’ attention on managing as owners with equity positions and aligns their interests with the interests of our shareholders  equity awards therefore have generally represented an important component of our compensation program for most of our neos we have attempted to create general incentives with standard stock option grants and conditional or performancebased incentives through awards that may include payouts in cash or equity  grants of equity incentive compensation have usually been dependent on a combination of the factors outlined above in “general compensation levels”   to aid in our retention of employees options and restricted stock unit awards granted under our stock incentive plan including those granted to our neos generally vest at the rate of  per year and in the case of options have exercise prices not less than the fair market value of our class a shares on the date of grant or the last trading day prior to the date of grant if the date of grant is not a trading day  generally our option agreements and restricted stock unit agreements with executive officers have included acceleration of vesting upon a change in control for those executive officers who are terminated by us or the surviving entity as applicable for any reason other than for cause during the twentyfour month period following such change in control   stock incentive plan we have adopted an employee stock incentive plan which we refer to as the amended and restated  stock incentive plan the “ stock incentive plan” the purpose of the  stock incentive plan is to provide incentives to attract and retain executive officers and other key employees  the  stock incentive plan is administered by our compensation committee and the compensation committee retains discretion subject to plan limits to modify the terms of outstanding awards and to reprice awards  awards available to be granted under the  stock incentive plan include i stock options ii stock appreciation rights iii restricted stock and restricted stock units iv performance awards v dividend equivalents and vi other stockbased awards  we generally grant equity awards on the first day of each calendar quarter following the quarter in which the award was approved and have set exercise prices at not less than the fair market value of our class a shares on the date of grant or the last trading day prior to the date of grant if the grant date is not a trading day  as of december   there were i outstanding options to purchase approximately  million of our class a shares ii  outstanding restricted stock units and iii approximately  million of our class a shares remaining available for issuance under the  stock incentive plan  our option and restricted stock unit awards generally vest at the rate of  per year commencing one year from the date of grant prior to february  we also granted to certain of our neos fully vested stockbased awards under our employee innovator recognition program which is available to all of our eligible employees after february  our executive officers including our neos are no longer eligible to receive awards under our employee innovator recognition program if approved by our shareholders at the annual meeting the  employee stock incentive plan will be used for equity grants to our named executive officers after the date of the annual meeting see proposal  for additional information regarding the  employee stock incentive plan  class b chairman stock option plan we have adopted a class b chairman stock option plan which we refer to as the  class b chairman stock option plan the purpose of the  class b chairman stock option plan is to promote the interests of the corporation by aiding in the retention of mr ergen who our board of directors believes is crucial to assuring our future success to offer mr ergen incentives to put forth maximum efforts for our future success and to afford mr ergen an opportunity to acquire additional proprietary interests in the corporation  mr ergen abstained from our board of directors’ vote regarding the adoption of the  class b chairman stock option plan  awards available to be granted under the  class b chairman stock option plan include nonqualified stock options and dividend equivalent rights with respect to our class b shares  up to four million shares of our class b shares are available for awards under the  class b chairman stock option plan  only mr ergen is eligible to participate in the  class b chairman stock option plan  no awards have been granted under the  class b chairman stock option plan   employee stock purchase plan we have an employee stock purchase plan which we refer to as the espp  the purpose of the espp is to provide our eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the corporation through the purchase of our class a shares  generally fulltime employees who have been employed by the corporation for at least one calendar quarter are eligible to participate in the espp  employee stock purchases are made through payroll deductions  under the terms of the espp each employee’s deductions are limited so that the maximum such employee may purchase under our espp is  in fair market value of class a shares per year  stock purchases are made on the last business day of each calendar quarter at  of the closing price of the class a shares on that date the espp is intended to qualify under section  of the internal revenue code and thereby provide participating employees with an opportunity to receive certain favorable income tax consequences as to stock purchase rights under the espp our neos participate in the espp on the same terms as our other employees if approved by our shareholders at the annual meeting the ar  espp will amend and restate the espp see proposal  for additional information regarding the ar  espp   shortterm cash incentive compensation   we have adopted a shortterm cash incentive program for our neos which we refer to as the executive officer bonus incentive plan  the executive officer bonus incentive plan is a cash bonus plan intended to promote the success of echostar by providing performanceoriented incentives to motivate our executive officers whose decisions and performance have a significant impact on our success and to reward them for superior managerial performance and our successful growth participants in the executive officer bonus incentive plan include those executive officers of echostar who are subject to section  of the exchange act as the compensation committee may designate from time to time as participants in the executive officer bonus incentive plan under the executive officer bonus incentive plan bonuses are paid in cash and are based on target award amounts for each year determined by the compensation committee for each participant and on the achievement of corporate and business segment performance metrics established by the compensation committee for each fiscal year from among those set forth in the executive officer bonus incentive plan for each participant  of the payout target is based on the achievement of companywide performance metrics and  of the payout target is based on the achievement of applicable business segment performance metrics individual awards under the executive officer bonus incentive plan may range between zero and an amount equal to or exceeding  of the applicable target award amount as determined by the compensation committee for each participant certain of our neos and other executive officers who are subject to section  of the exchange act are eligible to receive and have received shortterm cash incentive payments for  pursuant to the executive officer bonus incentive plan see “summary compensation table” below we may provide a discretionary cash bonus to the extent that we consider an individual to have made an extraordinary contribution towards echostar’s performance  none of our neos received a discretionary cash bonus for  k plan   we have adopted a definedcontribution taxqualified k plan for eligible echostar employees including our executives to facilitate our employees’ ability to save some percentage of their cash compensation for retirement  new employees become immediately eligible for participation in the k plan upon the commencement of their employment  participants in the k plan are entitled to contribute up to  of their eligible compensation subject to the maximum contribution limit provided by the internal revenue code  eligible employees have the option to make aftertax contributions under the k plan so that they may contribute up to  of their compensation on a pretax andor aftertax basis subject to the internal revenue code limits all employee contributions to the k plan are immediately vested the corporation matches  cents on the dollar for the first  of each employee’s salary contributions to the k plan for a total of  match on a pretax basis up to a maximum of  annually the corporation match is calculated each pay period there is an employee contribution in addition we may make an annual discretionary contribution to the k plan in cash or our stock all corporation contributions under the k plan vest at  per year and are  vested after an eligible employee has completed five  years of employment our neos participate in the k plan including corporate contributions on the same terms as our other employees    nonqualified plan we have adopted a nonqualified plan for the benefit of a select group of officers the “nonqualified plan” including our neos whose benefits under our k plan are limited by the internal revenue code  nonqualified plan participants may elect to contribute up to  of their eligible compensation into the nonqualified plan on a pretax basis each payroll period  we do not match any employee contributions in the nonqualified plan  participants are always  vested in the contributions they make into the nonqualified plan  during  all of our neos were eligible to participate in the nonqualified plan and mr rayner was the only neo who contributed to the nonqualified plan see “nonqualified deferred compensation” below   perquisites personal benefits posttermination compensation and other compensation   we have traditionally offered numerous plans and other benefits to our executive officers on the same terms as other employees  these plans and benefits have included medical vision and dental insurance life insurance the espp and the k plan as well as discounts on our and other companies’ products and services  relocation benefits may also be provided and reimbursed but are individually negotiated when they occur  in some years we have permitted certain neos and their family members and guests to use our corporate aircraft for personal use during  mr dugan was the only neo that used our corporate aircraft for personal use see “summary compensation table” below we have also paid on behalf of mr kaul amounts relating to excess medical benefits personal liability insurance and financial planning services pursuant to programs put in place by hughes prior to the hughes acquisition see “summary compensation table” below we have not traditionally had any plans in place to provide severance benefits to employees  however generally stock options and restricted stock units have been granted to our executive officers subject to acceleration of vesting upon a change in control for those executive officers who are terminated by us or the surviving entity as applicable for any reason other than for cause during the twentyfour month period following such change in control  in addition mr kaul has severance benefits that were approved by the board of directors of hughes as part of his employment agreement prior to the hughes acquisition and which were modified by our compensation committee during  see “potential payments upon termination or following a change in control” below   shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation   we provided our shareholders with the opportunity to cast a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation at the annual meeting of shareholders held in october   over  of the voting power represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on that matter voted to approve on a nonbinding advisory basis the compensation paid to our named executive officers as described in the proxy statement for that meeting  the compensation committee reviewed these voting results after such meeting and the corporation did not change its approach to executive compensation in   or  as a direct result of the vote  in  our shareholders approved on a nonbinding advisory basis that we should provide our shareholders with the opportunity to cast a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation at our annual meeting of shareholders at least once every three years for information on this year’s shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation see proposal nos  and     executive compensation   we generally make decisions with respect to executive compensation for a particular compensation year in the first or second quarter of the applicable year  with respect to the executive compensation of our neos we reviewed total compensation of each neo and the factors outlined above in “general compensation levels” as described in “general compensation levels” above we aim to provide compensation that is competitive with market practice with an emphasis on providing a substantial portion of overall compensation in the form of equity incentives the compensation committee and the board of directors placed substantial weight on mr ergen’s recommendations regarding all executive compensation matters in light of his role as chairman and as our controlling shareholder    compensation of our chief executive officer and president    base salary   base salary for our chief executive officer and president is reviewed and discussed by the compensation committee and determined by the board of directors primarily based on mr ergen’s recommendations  mr ergen made a recommendation with respect to the  base salary of our chief executive officer and president after considering the factors outlined above in “general compensation levels” placing primary weight on a mr dugan’s base salary in  b mr dugan’s performance in  and c whether in mr ergen’s subjective view an increase in base salary was warranted based on such performance or in order to retain mr dugan in determining mr dugan’s  base salary mr ergen recommended the compensation committee reviewed discussed and recommended and the board of directors determined that mr dugan’s existing base compensation was already within the range of market  compensation indicated in the peer group data in light of our practices with respect to base salaries and that therefore an increase over mr dugan’s  base salary was not necessary    cash bonus   we may provide a discretionary cash bonus to the extent that we consider an individual to have made an extraordinary contribution towards echostar’s performance  no discretionary cash bonus was paid to mr dugan in  see “summary compensation table” below  shortterm cash incentive compensation the purpose of shortterm cash incentives under our executive officer bonus incentive plan is to provide performanceoriented incentives to motivate the achievement of superior

compensation committee did not make any shortterm cash incentive awards to mr dugan for  under the executive officer bonus incentive plan see “summary compensation table” below  equity incentives   with respect to equity incentives we primarily evaluate the position of our chief executive officer and president to ensure that he has appropriate incentives tied to the performance of our class a

“general compensation levels” above including among other things the equity awards necessary to retain mr dugan the value of mr dugan’s existing equity awards and whether our mr dugan is entitled to severance payments mr ergen did not recommend and the compensation committee did not make any equity incentive awards to mr dugan in  the compensation committee determined on april   that mr dugan would receive a grant of  restricted stock units “rsus” with a grant date of july   mr dugan’s rsus vested based upon certain quarterly andor cumulative earnings goals subject to the compensation committee’s authorization to determine and calculate the achievement of each goal in accordance with the terms of the  stock incentive plan and a restricted stock unit agreement the “earnings goals”

kilaru an option to purchase  class a shares in each case to ensure that each neo had appropriate incentives tied to the performance of our class a shares see “grants of planbased awards” below   risk assessment   we believe that our compensation programs and practices which consist primarily of fixed cash salary and cash and equity incentive awards assist in our efforts to mitigate excessive risk taking by our employees we annually review the cash and equity incentive programs for the corporation’s senior officers including our executive officers who are the employees whose actions could expose the corporation to the most significant business risks  we concluded that certain features of these programs tend to reduce the likelihood of excessive risk taking these features include a compensation mix that delivers a substantial portion of compensation in the form of longterm equity awards to create incentives to work for the longterm growth of the corporation multiyear vesting of equity awards use of shortterm incentive awards that reward individual group or company performance and achievement of shorterterm goals important to the corporation thus reducing the incentive to take shortterm risks that are not consistent with the corporation’s goals and the compensation committee and board of directors’ ongoing oversight to ensure the corporation’s compensation programs and practices appropriately balance the interests of employees and shareholders   for the foregoing reasons the board of directors believes that the corporation’s compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the corporation compensation committee report   the compensation committee is appointed by the board of directors to discharge certain of the board of directors’ responsibilities relating to compensation of echostar’s executive officers based on the review of the compensation discussion and analysis and discussions

the audit committee or • request for approval of services by members of the audit committee acting by written consent the request may be made with respect to either specific services or a type of service for predictable or recurring services  all of the fees paid by us to kpmg llp for services rendered in  and  were preapproved by the audit committee  report of the audit committee   the role of the audit committee is to assist the board of directors in its oversight of echostar’s financial reporting process as is more fully described in our charter  echostar’s management is responsible for its financial reporting process including its system of internal controls and for the preparation and presentation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  echostar’s independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing those financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  our responsibility is to monitor and review these processes  it is not our duty or our responsibility to conduct auditing or accounting reviews or procedures  we are not and may not be employees of echostar and we may not represent ourselves to be or to serve as accountants or auditors by profession or experts in the fields of accounting or auditing  therefore we have relied without independent verification on representations by echostar’s management that its financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we have also relied on representations of echostar’s independent registered public accounting firm included in their report on its financial statements  our oversight does not provide us with an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles or policies or appropriate internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations  furthermore our considerations and discussions with echostar’s management and independent registered public accounting firm do not assure that echostar’s financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that the audit of echostar’s financial statements has been carried out in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states “pcaob” or that echostar’s independent registered public accounting firm is in fact “independent”   in the performance of our oversight function we reviewed and discussed with echostar’s management its audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended december    we also discussed these audited financial statements with echostar’s independent registered public accounting firm  our discussions with the independent registered public accounting firm included matters required to be discussed pursuant to the rules adopted by the pcaob  we also discussed with them their independence and any relationship that might affect their objectivity or independence  in connection with these discussions we received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from kpmg llp required by applicable requirements of the pcaob  finally we have considered whether the nonaudit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm are compatible with maintaining their independence   based on the reviews and discussions referred to above we are not aware of any relationship between the independent registered public accounting firm and echostar that affects the objectivity or independence of the independent registered public accounting firm  based on these discussions and our review discussed above we recommended to the board of directors that its audited financial statements for fiscal year  be included in echostar’s annual report on form k for the year ended december   for filing with the securities and exchange commission   respectfully submitted   the audit committee   c michael schroeder chairman tom a ortolf anthony m federico william david wade    proposal  — advisory vote on executive compensation as required by section a of the exchange act and related sec rules we are seeking a nonbinding advisory vote from our shareholders to approve the compensation paid to our neos as disclosed in this proxy statement shareholders are being asked to approve the following resolution at the annual meeting   resolved that the shareholders of echostar corporation the “corporation” hereby approve on a nonbinding advisory basis the compensation paid to the corporation’s named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to item  of regulation sk in the corporation’s proxy statement for its  annual meeting of shareholders including the compensation discussion and analysis compensation tables and related narrative discussion therein   the board believes that the compensation paid to our neos as described more fully in the “compensation discussion and analysis” section of this proxy statement is appropriate and advances our key compensation principles including attraction retention and motivation of executive officers over the longterm recognition of individual performance and companywide and group performance goals and creation of shareholder value by aligning the interests of management and our shareholders through equity incentives  we urge shareholders to read the “compensation discussion and analysis” section compensation tables and related narrative discussion in this proxy statement for a more detailed discussion of our compensation programs and policies the compensationrelated actions taken in fiscal  and the compensation paid to our neos although this vote on the compensation paid to our neos is advisory and nonbinding the board and the compensation committee value shareholders’ opinions and will consider the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation policies and decisions  currently the advisory vote on executive compensation occurs every three years  accordingly unless changed by the board the next advisory vote on executive compensation will occur at the  annual meeting of shareholders the board of directors unanimously recommends a vote for approval on a nonbinding advisory basis of the compensation paid to our neos as disclosed in this proxy statement   charles w ergen our chairman currently beneficially owns equity securities representing approximately  of our total voting power  please see “equity security ownership and related matters” above  mr ergen has indicated his intention to vote in favor of proposal   accordingly approval of proposal  is assured notwithstanding a contrary vote by any or all shareholders other than mr ergen  proposal  — advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation section a of the exchange act and related sec rules require us to seek a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders at least once every six years to determine whether advisory votes on executive compensation should be held every one two or three years  accordingly in connection with this proposal  shareholders may vote on a nonbinding bases whether future advisory votes on executive compensation should be held   •                   every year   •                   every two years or   •                   every three years   we urge shareholders to review the information presented in connection with proposal  in this proxy statement as well as the “compensation discussion and analysis” section compensation tables and related narrative discussion in this proxy statement for a more detailed discussion of our compensation programs and policies and the compensation paid to our neos   the board has determined that holding a –nonbinding advisory vote by shareholders on executive compensation every three years is most appropriate for echostar and recommends that shareholders vote to hold such nonbinding advisory votes in the future every three years the board believes that holding a nonbinding advisory vote by shareholders every three years offers the closest alignment with echostar’s approach to executive compensation and the underlying philosophy that seeks to enhance the longterm growth of the corporation and to attract retain and motivate our executive officers over the long term the board believes a threeyear cycle for the nonbinding advisory vote by shareholders on executive compensation will allow investors to better judge our programs in relation to our longterm performance and will foster a more longterm view of our compensation program by our shareholders   although this vote on the frequency of future nonbinding advisory votes by shareholders on executive compensation is advisory and nonbinding the board and the compensation committee value shareholders’ opinions and will consider the outcome of the vote when considering the frequency of future nonbinding advisory votes by shareholders on executive compensation   the board of directors unanimously recommends a vote for “every three years” under proposal  charles w ergen our chairman currently beneficially owns equity securities representing approximately  of our total voting power  please see “equity security ownership and related matters” above  mr ergen has indicated his intention to vote for “every three years” under proposal   accordingly approval of “every three years” under proposal  is assured notwithstanding any other votes by any or all shareholders other than mr ergen  proposal  — echostar corporation  stock incentive plan we are asking our shareholders to approve the  employee stock incentive plan and its material terms to enable us to continue to offer equity compensation awards to our existing and new hire employees and other service providers the board adopted and approved the  employee stock incentive plan on march   subject to the approval of our shareholders at the annual meeting if approved by our shareholders at the annual meeting the  employee stock incentive plan will become effective upon such approval by the shareholders of the corporation at the annual meeting the “effective date” and if not previously terminated by the board the  employee stock incentive plan will terminate on december  st of the year in which the tenyear anniversary of the effective date occurs if our shareholders do not approve the  employee stock incentive plan we will continue to use our  stock incentive plan until its expiration on january   following which we may be restricted in our ability to successfully attract and retain highly skilled employees including members of our management team the alternative to using equity awards for retention and incentive purposes would be to increase cash compensation we do not believe increasing cash compensation to make up for any shortfall in equity awards would be practicable or advisable because we believe that a combination of equity awards and cash compensation provide a more effective compensation vehicle than cash alone for attracting retaining and motivating our employees and that equity awards align employees and shareholder interests any significant increase in cash compensation in lieu of equity awards could substantially increase our operating expenses and reduce our cash flow from operations which may adversely affect our business and operating results we also do not believe that such a program would be likely to have significant longterm retention value and would not serve to align our employees’ interests to those of our shareholders in the absence of equity incentives we believe that it is in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders to implement the  employee stock incentive plan because equitybased compensation generally provides employees with longterm exposure to the corporation’s performance and aligns employees’ interests with those of our shareholders in addition we believe that our future success depends in large part upon our ability to maintain a competitive position in attracting retaining and motivating key personnel and our stock award program is a primary vehicle for offering longterm incentives to our employees we are asking for approval of a share reserve under the  employee stock incentive plan of a total of  shares if our shareholders approve the  employee stock incentive plan we anticipate that the shares available under the  employee stock incentive plan will be sufficient to meet our expected needs for approximately five years the  employee stock incentive plan is also designed to provide us the ability to grant awards that are fully deductible for federal income tax purposes section m of the internal revenue code generally denies a corporate tax deduction for annual compensation exceeding  million paid to the chief executive officer and other “covered employees” as determined under section m of the internal revenue code and applicable guidance however certain types of compensation including performancebased compensation are generally excluded from this deductibility limit to enable compensation in connection with certain awards under the  employee stock incentive plan to qualify as “performancebased” within the meaning of section m of the internal revenue code the  employee stock incentive plan imposes certain limits on the sizes of such awards as further described below by approving the  employee stock incentive plan our shareholders will be approving eligibility requirements for participation in the  employee stock incentive plan the other material terms of the  employee stock incentive plan and awards granted under the  employee stock incentive plan including limits on the numbers of shares or compensation that could be made to participants and approving among other things performance measures upon which specific performance goals applicable to certain awards would be based notwithstanding the foregoing we retain the ability to grant awards under the  employee stock incentive plan that do not qualify as “performancebased” compensation within the meaning of section m of the internal revenue code our named executive officers have an interest in this proposal as they will be eligible to receive stock awards under the  employee stock incentive plan if it is approved the board of directors has approved and is asking our shareholders to approve the  employee stock incentive plan summary of material terms of the  employee stock incentive plan the following is a summary of the material terms of the  employee stock incentive plan  the summary and the features of the  employee stock incentive plan set forth below do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the provisions of the  employee stock incentive plan attached as appendix a to this proxy statement “share” referred to throughout this proposal means a share of our class a common stock or such other securities or property of the corporation as may become subject to awards pursuant to an adjustment under the  employee stock incentive plan purpose  the purpose of the  employee stock incentive plan is to advance the interests of the corporation and its subsidiaries by aiding the corporation in attracting motivating and retaining existing and new hire employees and other service providers capable of assuring the future success of the corporation to offer the participants incentives to put forth maximum efforts for the success of the corporation’s business and to afford the participants an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the corporation  administration the  employee stock incentive plan will be administered by the “plan committee” as defined

terms and conditions stock options options granted under the  employee stock incentive plan provide grantees with the right to purchase shares at a predetermined exercise price  the per share exercise price of an option granted under the  employee stock incentive plan will be determined by the plan committee at the time of grant provided that the purchase price per share for each option must not be

a brief description of the us federal income tax consequences of the  employee stock incentive plan under the internal revenue code based on laws and regulations in effect on the date of this proxy statement which laws and regulations are subject to change and does not purport to be a complete description of the federal tax aspects of the  employee stock incentive plan or to address any state local foreign or estate and gift tax consequences that may arise in connection with receiving any awards under the  employee stock incentive plan this description is not intended to and does not provide or supplement tax advice to recipients of awards recipients are advised to consult with their own independent tax advisors with respect to the specific tax consequences that in light of their particular circumstances might arise in connection with their receipt of awards under the  employee stock incentive plan including any state local or foreign tax consequences and the effect if any of gift estate and inheritance taxes the following tax discussion is a general description of certain expected federal income tax results under current law stock options the grant of an incentive stock option or a nonqualified stock option would not result in income for the grantee or in a deduction for echostar the exercise of a nonqualified stock option would result in ordinary income for the grantee and a deduction for echostar measured by the difference between the option price and the fair market value of the shares received at the time of exercise income tax withholding would be required the exercise of an incentive stock option would not result in income for the grantee if the grantee i does not dispose of the shares within two years after the date of grant and one year after the acquisition of the underlying shares upon exercise of the option and ii is an employee of echostar or a subsidiary of echostar from the date of grant until three months before the exercise date if these requirements are met the basis of the shares upon later disposition would be the option exercise price for such shares any gain will be taxed to the employee as longterm capital gain and echostar would not be entitled to a deduction the excess of the fair market value on the exercise date over the option exercise price is an item of tax preference potentially subject to the alternative minimum tax if the grantee of an award disposes of the shares prior to the expiration of the applicable holding periods the grantee would recognize ordinary income and echostar would be entitled to a deduction equal to the lesser of the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date minus the option exercise price or the amount realized on disposition minus the option exercise price any gain in excess of the ordinary income portion would be taxable as longterm or shortterm capital gain sars performance awards and dividend equivalents the grant of a sar a performance award or a dividend equivalent generally should not result in income for the grantee or a deduction for echostar upon the exercise of a sar or the receipt of shares or cash under a performance award or dividend equivalent the grantee would recognize ordinary income and echostar would be entitled to a deduction equal to the fair market value of the shares or the amount of any cash received income tax withholding would be required restricted stock and restricted stock units the grant of restricted stock should not result in income for the grantee or in a deduction for echostar for federal income tax purposes assuming the shares transferred are subject to restrictions resulting in a “substantial risk of forfeiture” as intended by echostar and no section b of the internal revenue code election is made if there are no such restrictions or an internal revenue code section b  election is made the grantee would recognize ordinary income upon receipt of the shares the grant of restricted stock units generally should not result in income for the grantee or a deduction for echostar dividends paid to the grantee of restricted stock while the stock remained subject to restriction would be treated as compensation for federal income tax purposes upon the lapses of restrictions the grantee generally should receive ordinary income and echostar would be entitled to a deduction measured by the fair market value of the shares at the time of lapse or at the time of receipt of shares or cash in respect of a restricted stock grant income tax withholding would be required internal revenue code section m with certain exceptions section m limits deduction for compensation in excess of  million paid to the chief executive officer and certain other “covered employees” whose compensation is reported in the summary compensation table included in the corporation’s annual proxy statements however compensation paid to such employees will not be subject to such deduction limitation if it is considered “qualified performancebased compensation” within the meaning of section m which among other requirements requires stockholder approval of the performance measures available under a plan notwithstanding the adoption of the  employee stock incentive plan by stockholders we reserve the right to pay our employees including recipients of awards under the  employee stock incentive plan  amounts that may or may not be deductible under section m or other provisions of the internal revenue code in addition it is possible that performancebased compensation that is intended to be exempt from the deduction limit under section m may not meet the requirements to qualify for such exemption            internal revenue code section a certain of the awards under the  employee stock incentive plan may constitute “nonqualified deferred compensation” subject to section a of the internal revenue code  failure to comply with the requirements of the provisions of the internal revenue code regarding participant elections and the timing of payment distributions could result in the affected participants being required to recognize ordinary income for tax purposes earlier than the times otherwise applicable as described in the above discussion and to pay substantial penalties internal revenue code section g under certain circumstances accelerated vesting exercise or payment of

plan gives the plan committee discretion to determine which executive officers employees consultants and advisors of the corporation and its subsidiaries will receive awards under the  employee stock incentive plan because of this discretion it is not possible at present to specify the persons to whom awards will be granted in the future or the amounts and types of individual grants while the benefits or amounts that would have been received by or allocated to plan participants for the last completed fiscal year if the  employee stock incentive plan had been in effect cannot be determined see the “grants of planbased awards” table on page  for a description of the equity incentive awards made to our named executive officers during the year ended december   under our existing incentive plans the board of directors unanimously recommends a vote for the approval of the echostar corporation  stock incentive plan for the reasons outlined above charles w ergen our chairman currently beneficially owns equity securities representing approximately  of our total voting power  please see “equity security ownership and related matters” above  mr ergen has indicated his intention to vote in favor of proposal   accordingly approval of proposal  is assured notwithstanding a contrary vote by any or all shareholders other than mr ergen  proposal  — echostar corporation  non e mployee director stock incentive plan we are asking our shareholders to approve the  director plan and its material terms to enable us to continue to offer equity compensation awards to our existing and future eligible directors the board adopted and approved the  director plan on march   subject to the approval of our shareholders at the annual meeting if approved by our shareholders at the annual meeting the  director plan will become effective upon approval by the shareholders of the corporation at the annual meeting the “ director plan effective date” and if not previously terminated by the board the  director plan will terminate on december st of the year in which the tenyear anniversary of the  director plan effective date occurs if our shareholders do not approve the  director plan we will continue to use our  director plan until the shares reserved under that plan are all allocated following which we may be restricted in our ability to successfully attract and retain highly skilled nonemployee directors the alternative to attract and retain nonemployee directors would be to increase cash compensation we do not believe increasing cash compensation to make up for any shortfall in equity awards would be practicable or advisable because we believe that a combination of equity awards and cash compensation provide a more effective compensation vehicle than cash alone for attracting retaining and motivating nonemployee directors and that equity awards align nonemployee director and shareholder interests any significant increase in cash compensation in lieu of equity awards could substantially increase our operating expenses and reduce our cash flow from operations which may adversely affect our business and operating results we also do not believe that such a program would be likely to have significant longterm retention value and would not serve to align our nonemployee directors’ interests to those of our shareholders in the absence of equity incentives we believe that it is in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders to implement the  director plan because equitybased compensation generally provides nonemployee directors with longterm exposure to the corporation’s performance and aligns their interests with those of our shareholders in addition we believe that our future success depends in large part upon our ability to maintain a competitive position in attracting retaining and motivating nonemployee directors and our stock award program is a primary vehicle for offering longterm incentives to nonemployee directors the  director plan authorizes the grant of equitybased awards to our existing or new directors who are not employees of echostar or its subsidiaries “nonemployee directors” there are currently five such directors similar to the  director plan the purpose of the  director plan is to advance the interest of echostar through the motivation attraction and retention of nonemployee directors while the  director plan provided the corporation with the ability only to grant stock options the  director plan provides the ability to grant a variety of equity awards as described further below we are asking for approval of a share reserve under the  director plan of a total of  shares if our shareholders approve the  director plan we anticipate that the shares available under the  director plan will be sufficient to meet our expected needs for approximately five years our nonemployee directors have an interest in this proposal as they will be eligible to receive stock awards under the  director plan if it is approved the board of directors has approved and is asking our shareholders to approve the  director plan summary of material terms of the  director plan the following is a summary of the material terms of the  director plan the summary and the features of the  director plan set forth below do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety

securities or property of the corporation as may become subject to awards pursuant to an adjustment under the  director plan purpose  the purpose of the  director plan is to advance the interest of echostar through the motivation attraction and retention of nonemployee directors administration the  director plan will be administered by the board of directors of echostar and the board of

for grants of the following specific types of director awards each director award will be evidenced by an award agreement together with any award statement or supplemental documents a “director award agreement” which will govern that director award’s terms and conditions nonqualified stock options options granted under the  director plan provide grantees with the right to purchase shares at a predetermined exercise price the per share exercise price of a nonqualified stock option granted under the  director plan will be determined by the director plan committee at the time of grant provided that the purchase price per share for each option must not be less than  of the fair market value of the shares as of the date of grant each option will be exercisable at such dates and in such installments as determined by the director plan committee each option terminates at the time determined by the director plan committee provided that the term of each nonqualified stock option may not exceed ten years from the date of grant shares issued upon the exercise of an option may not be sold or otherwise disposed of by nonemployee directors within six months after the date of the grant

tax discussion is a general description of certain expected federal income tax results under current law  stock options the grant of a nonqualified stock option would not result in income for the grantee or in a deduction for echostar  the exercise of a nonqualified stock option would result in ordinary income for the grantee and a deduction for echostar measured by the difference between the option price and the fair market value of the shares received at the time of exercise sars and dividend equivalents the grant of a sar or a dividend equivalent generally should not result in income for the grantee or a deduction for echostar upon the exercise of a sar or the receipt of shares or cash under a sar or dividend equivalent the grantee would recognize ordinary income and echostar would be entitled to a deduction equal to the fair market value of the shares or the amount of any cash received restricted stock and restricted stock units the grant of restricted stock should not result in income for the grantee or in a deduction for echostar for federal income tax purposes assuming the shares transferred are subject to restrictions resulting in a “substantial risk of forfeiture” as intended by echostar and no section b of the internal revenue code election is made if there are no such restrictions or an internal revenue code section b election is made the grantee would recognize ordinary income upon receipt of the shares the grant of restricted stock units generally should not result in income for the grantee or a deduction for echostar dividends paid to the grantee of restricted stock while the stock remained subject to restriction would be treated as compensation for federal income tax purposes upon the lapses of restrictions the grantee generally should receive ordinary income and echostar would be entitled to a deduction measured by the fair market value of the shares at the time of lapse or at the time of receipt of shares or cash in respect of a restricted stock grant            internal revenue code section a certain of the director awards under the  director plan may constitute “nonqualified deferred compensation” subject to section a

circumstances might arise in connection with their purchase of shares under the ar  espp including any state local or foreign tax consequences and the effect if any of gift estate and inheritance taxes the following tax discussion is a general description of certain expected federal income tax results under current law the ar  espp is intended to be an “employee stock purchase plan” as defined in section  of the internal revenue code  under the internal revenue code a participant will not have taxable income solely due to his or her eligibility to purchase shares under the ar  espp no income will be taxable to a participant until the shares purchased under the ar  espp are sold or otherwise disposed of upon sale or other disposition of the shares the participant will generally be subject to tax and the amount of the tax will depend upon the holding period if the shares are sold or otherwise disposed of more than two years from the first day of the relevant offering period and more than one year from the date the shares are purchased then the participant generally will recognize ordinary income measured as the lesser of i the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of such sale or disposition over the purchase price or ii an amount equal to  of the fair market value of the shares as of the first day of the applicable payment period any amount in excess of the amount that the participant recognized as compensation income will be longterm capital gain if the participant sells the shares at a loss if sales proceeds are less than the purchase price after satisfying these waiting periods then the loss will be a longterm capital loss if the participant sells the shares prior to satisfying these waiting periods then he or she will have engaged in a “disqualifying disposition” upon a disqualifying disposition the participant will have compensation income equal to the value of the shares on the day he or she purchased the stock less the purchase price the participant also will have a capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the sales proceeds and the value of the shares on the day he or she purchased the shares this capital gain or loss will be longterm if the participant has held the shares for more than one year and otherwise will be shortterm we are not entitled to a deduction for amounts taxed as ordinary income or capital gain to a participant except to the extent ordinary income is recognized by participants upon a sale or disposition of shares prior to the expiration of the holding periods described above in all other cases no deduction is allowed to us new plan benefits because benefits under the ar  espp depend on employees’ elections to participate in the ar  espp and the fair market value of the shares at various future dates it is not possible to determine future benefits that will be received by executive officers and other employees under the ar  espp  the board of directors unanimously

mikefcable takeaway dish network founder and chairman charlie ergen says outgoing ceo’s joe clayton’s daytoday focus and flair for marketing gave him the space to plot a new course dish network founder and chairman charlie ergen had a problem   “there came a point in time when i realized four years ago that for dish to transform itself into more of a connectivity company that transformation was going to take  of my efforts” ergen said   so ergen reached out to longtime friend industry veteran and fellow southerner joe clayton to be his no    “i asked joe if he would be interested in becoming ceo of dish it was at a board dinner on thursday night he said he was going to fly home and talk to his wife and get back to me on sunday he was in denver ready to take the job on”   that decisiveness convinced ergen who in the past had tapped other executives as dish’s president and chief operating officer with limited success that he had the right man for the job   four years later clayton leaves just as what could be the next transformational product for the industry — subscription overthetop service sling tv — gains steam   ‘knew how to make decisions’   “what was different was that joe had been a ceo and so joe knew how to make decisions” ergen said “whereas a lot of executives will say they have to think about it and analyze it a month later they give you an answer and two months later they move when joe got here he got a monthly hotel room and a few weeks later he had a house in the denver area”   clayton has spent a career making decisions including some industrytransforming ones harking back to his days as executive vice president of marketing and sales at thomson consumer electronics where he was instrumental in the development and launch of consumer equipment for the first directbroadcast satellite tv service directv   from there clayton moved to frontier corp where he spent two years as ceo moving to global crossing as president after it acquired frontier in  he served as ceo of sirius satellite radio from  until  and was chairman of the company until  when it merged with xm satellite radio   “he was in many ways the grandfather of the dbs directbroadcast satellite business” ergen said “in terms of the history he should get a lot more credit for the success of the dbs business than he does”   clayton joined dish at a time of transition what ergen at the time called his “seinfeld strategy” referring to the tv show’s habit of not revealing what episodes were truly about until the final minutes   ergen had spent the past few years assembling wireless spectrum assets and analysts and investors were searching for clues into dish’s ultimate strategy   “i’ve been watching what charlie has been doing putting this amalgamation of assets together” clayton said back in june  shortly after taking on the dish job “i’m here to help run the daytoday operations my job and my challenge is to improve the financial and commercial performance and save some time for charlie to help put the grand vision together and complete the puzzle”   and it has been a rousing success dish’s stock price has more than doubled in value since clayton came on board — it closed at  per share on his first day on the job june   and grew to  per share as of march    while much of dish’s stock appreciation over the past four years is largely due to its wireless pursuits clayton has played a key role in keeping the core satellitetv business intact while laying the foundation for new products and pursuits such as the company’s hopper digital video recorder and the sling tv product   three years turned into five   but when clayton accepted the dish position he initially said he would only stick around for three years   “at the end of three years i knew there were a couple of auctions coming up in ” ergen said referring to the federal aws wirelessspectrum auctions in which dish was a major bidder “i told him i needed to do the auctions and once the auctions were over we’d be ready to move on without him he stayed with us an extra nine months to help us through the auction process”   those auctions could prove to be the next stepping stone in dish’s ongoing transformation — the satellite tv company spent about  billion in securing licenses across the country spectrum that could be used to bolster its fledgling fixed wireless broadband service dishnet which now has about  subscribers mostly in rural areas or a broader wireless product that would most likely require a partner   wunderlich securities media analyst matt harrigan who has followed ergen and dish for years said that while the jury is still out on the ultimate value of the spectrum dish still has several opportunities to use the spectrum outside of the obvious options of selling it or building it out   “i believe him ergen when he says it’s not two alternatives it’s more a matter of  alternatives” harrigan said adding that he expects a more firm decision in the next five years “he’s not going to get anything done by  so that accelerates into ”   ergen who controls the majority of dish’s vote and has played a role in every major decision at the company since he founded it in  has been largely and rightly credited with its success but without clayton and the rest of his team taking over daytoday operations and embracing tasks that ergen himself said were outside of the chairman’s own skill set he said dish wouldn’t be where it is today   one of clayton’s tasks was to improve employee communications and communications throughout the company in general something ergen said he was unable to do   “joe’s biggest contribution to dish is that he built on the culture we already had but he improved it” ergen said “because this was a fulltime job for him he was a better ceo in terms of how he communicated to employees and he had a good eye for talent and he had a good eye to improve that talent”   that culture is unlike any other fortune  company ergen added but perhaps because of their shared southern roots — clayton is a kentucky native and ergen is from tennessee — clayton meshed well with the dish mindset   “we’re different than a lot of companies in the type of people that we want” ergen said “we’re quite a bit different than the average fortune  company we’re looking for individuals who are willing to go on the adventure with us and who are willing to tolerate risks   “that’s the epitome of the dish culture — we’re allin” ergen continued “once he made the decision in his mind to be allin he was allin”   ceo dressed for success   dish isn’t the type of company that likes to talk a lot about its plans — it would rather just go ahead and execute them ergen added a concept that clayton embraced immediately but clayton who is not quite as casual a dresser as his chairman also made his own imprint in the company   “joe’s a formal guy he came to work every day in a suit and tie” ergen said “within a few weeks i started noticing there were a lot more coats and ties around here a simple thing like that probably made the discipline a little better”   clayton also brought a level of enthusiasm that was would have been unheard of under the lowkey ergen’s helm   when dish launched its hopper digital video recorder in  at the consumer electronics show in las vegas clayton made the announcement holding a live kangaroo   and when he heralded the latest product — sling tv — clayton was followed on the ces stage by a marching band and a team of actors dressed as kangaroos a situation ergen admitted he would be unlikely to see himself in   “he’s a great promoter” ergen said “that’s not a skill set i have he improved the morale and the enthusiasm of the workforce”   but clayton wasn’t just a cheerleader he also proved to be a valuable counsel to the chairman and one who was unafraid to point his boss in new directions   ergen remembered the initial meetings around the hopper a wholehome dvr that allowed customers to record entire seasons of shows and to skip commercials in select shows after their original air it was a controversial and revolutionary product but at first it had an extremely runofthemill name   “the hopper was to be called basically the model ” ergen said “joe said the consumer won’t know what ‘’ means either call it something scientific or call it something fun and he said you need to make the product fun”   clayton came back a few days later with a list of possible names he and his team had drawn up including the hop box — ergen said he at first thought clayton said “hot box” which puzzled him until the ceo explained it was named for the ability to “hop” the signal across dvrs in the home like a kangaroo that eventually morphed into the hopper ergen came up with the joey name for the hopper’s slave receivers a play both on the kangaroo theme of the hopper and a joey is a baby kangaroo on clayton’s first name   even as clayton heads off into the sunset ergen is still not finished with his grand vision for dish   “we’re in year four of a year transition of the company which is to transform from being strictly a video satellitetv company to a total wireless company with connectivity at its core” ergen said “our industry is probably going to change probably more rapidly in the next four years than it has in the last four years we have to transform with that that’s quite of an adventure to do that because we will obsolete some of our current business”   dish’s move into the overthetop arena with the sling tv a streaming video product with a core of about  channels including espn for  per month could be seen by some as a replacement for traditional pay tv but ergen said its main goal is to get younger viewers used to paying for what they watch   “our goal is to make sure our programming partners have a longerterm business and make more money and more revenue than they otherwise would had they not done it with us” ergen said adding that dish also is striving to get younger viewers into the pay tv universe at an earlier period in their lives “it’s much easier to get somebody into the pay tv universe when they start college or get their first apartment because they grow up with you” ergen continued “the product this generation wants is a much different product than the one i grew up with these people are not going to go to a grid guide and wait for american idol to start at  o’clock they grew up with google search”   ergen doesn’t see sling tv as the tool to dismantle the existing programming bundle either he added that is already happening   “there are plusses and minuses” ergen said “we’re going to get more people into the pay tv universe and we’re going to have more meaningful content to deliver to customers that is more personalized for them but it’s competition to the big  bundle for television that big bundle isn’t going to go away anytime soon but it probably a mature product”   tv providers need to keep up   ergen added that it is up to the industry to keep abreast of customer needs something he said the sling tv team is doing every day   “we’re now getting feedback on pain points within sling tv” ergen said “we’ve eliminated a lot of the pain points in contract and ease of install and immediate gratification and so forth but now people would like to have more streams they would like to have the ability to record shows in the cloud they would like this channel or that channel with our partners we’re going to have to look at all of these issues   “i think iptv will be a big factor in our industry” ergen continued “it will be as big as dbs was there was cable then there was dbs and then phone companies and what i call managed networks now we’re moving to the internet and iptv itself unmanaged networks i think are going to have a dramatic impact on our industry   “like anything else when you have dramatic impact there are going to be winners and losers and our job at dish is to make sure we’re on the winning side” want to read more stories like this get our free newsletter here tags   joe clayton   dish network   charlie ergen
