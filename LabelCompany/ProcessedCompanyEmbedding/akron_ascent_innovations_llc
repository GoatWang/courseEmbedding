akron ascent innovations bioinspired approach to hasslefree mounting and attachmentakron ascent innovations aai is pioneering a new way to attach that takes the mess damage and hassle out of adhesivesakron ascent innovations aai was founded in  to commercialize a new approach to attach objects to various surfaces  for lack of a better word we call it a dry adhesive but its not like any adhesive youve ever seen  it isnt sticky but it can secure sheets films pictures cards packages photos frames and even high capacity hooks to walls and other surfaces without damage  even better it can be repositioned and often reused depending on the application which gives a world of new opportunities not possible with conventional adhesives big grip  no stickadhesive technology hasnt changed much in the past few thousand years  the stronger the stick the better the glue and the more pain involved when it comes time to remove it damage freeaais repositionable and cleanly removable dry adhesives are the perfect solution for imperfect and indecisive decorators dry adhesiveaai is pioneering a dry adhesive technology based on solid nanofibers that conform intimately to surfaces  the strength is remarkable but without the stick and hassle of conventional adhesives learn more news featured jun   featured news nsf innovation crains kevin white jun   featured news nsf innovation

interactions between particles also increase with surface area which poses a big challenge this is also part of the reason why electrospun nanofibers can stay together without a binder when used as a

manufacturing kevin white jul  0 electrospinning electrospinning manufacturing kevin white aai is the first company to use electrospinning to produce dry adhesives which offers the potential for solventfree environmentally friendly adhesives that are strong when you need them but can be easily removed from surfaces without leaving behind a residue or causing damageproduce nanofibers can be used to produce dry adhesives  electrospinning is a versatile technique to fabricate nanofibers with finely controlled nanostructures that are useful for a range of properties including adhesives  most importantly electrospinning offers a scalable route to control these structures with a resolution that can typically only be achieved with much more time consuming batch processes such as lithography jul  0 electrospinning electrospinning manufacturing kevin white jul  0 electrospinning electrospinning manufacturing kevin white jul  0 kevin white jul  0 kevin white dry adhesion primer jul  0 kevin white jul  0 kevin white aai’s dry adhesive technology is based on the principle of contact splitting which is a robust and reversible elastic mechanism of adhesion commonly exploited by animals such as flies beetles spiders and the most prolific climber of all the gecko  all surfaces have some attractive force between them arising from weak intermolecular forces known as van der waals vdw forces  this force decreases linearly with the size of the contact but the resulting stress force divided by area increases  as a result a surface made up on a large number of small contact sites will have an immensely larger interaction with a target surface than a smooth one jul  0 kevin white jul  0 kevin white contact uswe look forward to hearing from you  name  name first name last
