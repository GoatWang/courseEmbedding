the symbol frt safe harbor language certain matters discussed within this press release may be deemed to be forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws although federal realty believes the expectations reflected in the forwardlooking statements are based on reasonable assumptions it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained these factors include but are not limited to the risk factors described in our annual report on form k filed on february   and include the following risks that our tenants will not pay rent may vacate early or may file for bankruptcy or that we may be unable to renew leases or relet space at favorable rents as leases expire risks that we may not be able to proceed with or obtain necessary approvals for any redevelopment or renovation project and that completion of anticipated or ongoing property redevelopments or renovation projects that we do pursue may cost more take more time to complete or fail to perform as expected risks that we are investing a significant amount in groundup development projects that may not perform as planned may be dependent on third parties to deliver critical aspects of certain projects requires spending a substantial amount upfront in infrastructure and assumes receipt of public funding which has been committed but not entirely funded risks normally associated with the real estate industry including risks that occupancy levels at our properties and the amount of rent that we receive from our properties may be lower than expected that new acquisitions may fail to perform as expected that competition for acquisitions could result in increased prices for acquisitions that costs associated with the periodic maintenance and repair or renovation of space insurance and other operations may increase that environmental issues may develop at our properties and result in unanticipated costs and because real estate is illiquid that we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate risks that our growth will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital risks associated with general economic conditions including local economic conditions in our geographic markets risks of financing such as our ability to consummate additional financings or obtain replacement financing on terms which are acceptable to us our ability to meet existing financial covenants and the limitations imposed on our operations by those covenants and the possibility of increases in interest rates that would result in increased interest expense and risks related to our status as a real estate investment trust commonly referred to as a reit for federal income tax purposes such as the existence of complex tax regulations relating to our status as a reit the effect of future changes in reit requirements as a result of new legislation and the adverse consequences of the failure to qualify as a reit given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance

realty investment trust frt a dividend aristocrat and one of the best reits in the world  modest money facebookfacebooktwittertwitterlinkedinlinkedinrssrssgooglegoogle investing reviews business career credit debt financial advice investing real estate retirement real estate investment trusts reits are the best and easiest way for income investors to profit from rental properties without any of the hassle paperwork or illiquidity that goes with personally owning real estate of course now that interest rates are rising for the first time in nearly a decade many investors are concerned about whether it’s a good time to invest in this highyield sector fortunately the highestquality reits have proven track records of growing in all manner of economic and interest rate environments none more so than federal realty investment trust frt which is one of america’s oldest reits and has grown its dividend every year since   years and counting at a very impressive average annual rate of  in fact federal realty is the only real estate company in the dividend aristocrats list here let’s take a closer look at federal realty to see just if this company deserves to be considered one of the world’s best high dividend stocks and a worthy candidate for a diversified income portfolio business overview founded in  in rockville maryland federal realty is one of america’s and the world’s oldest reits it has traditionally specialized in highquality neighborhood shopping centers anchored by grocery stores and located in large highly affluent markets source federal realty investor presentation federal realty owns  properties totaling  million square feet however the biggest growth potential for the reit lies in premium mixed usage retail properties in which retail is combined with residential office and hotel components and rented to highend retailers that are least at risk of being disrupted by ecommerce from giants such as amazon amzn that’s why federal realty also owns over  premium apartments in some of america’s fastestgrowing and strongest rental markets business analysis when it comes to wellmanaged longterm focused reits with a history of consistent dividend growth federal realty is literally the best in the reit industry in fact its record of  consecutive years of unbroken annual payout growth means that in  the company will become the first and only reit dividend king investors can see all of the dividend kings here federal realty has been able to achieve such consistent performance in all sorts of economic and interest rate environments including interest rates of  thanks to its conservative culture and triple net lease business model specifically that means that federal realty’s tenants pay all taxes insurance and maintenance costs and federal merely sits back and collects its highprofit rent which is under very longterm leases average remaining lease is  years that creates highly consistent and recurring funds from operation ffo which ultimately pays the company’s highly secure and steadily growing dividend of course given the fact that the reit industry is highly commoditized the fact that management has been able to build several key competitive advantages is also key to the longterm success story in the case of federal realty its competitive advantage is due to management’s multipronged longterm growth strategy management believes this fivepart strategy will enable the reit to achieve  to  annual ffo growth over the longterm the first part involves owning properties located in the densest and most affluent areas of the country to maximize the prosperity of its tenants in fact over three quarters of the company’s properties are located in these core markets the second quality factor is management’s disciplined approach to maintaining and improving its properties in order to attract more premium tenants and achieve higher lease rates management has been able to achieve impressive  to  returns on investment for this kind of “tactical redevelopment” historically that’s because combined with the premium locations of its properties its more upscale focus has allowed it to achieve by far the best rental rates in its industry even better federal realty has been able to maintain high occupancy  with these high leases and even grow them at impressive rates far quicker than its peers more important is that this strong increase in leases is a longterm trend not just the result of a strengthening economy over the past five years as you can see below management has been able to grow its rental leases by double the rate of the industry average over the last two decades   and given that the new leases signed in the past year have averaged  per square foot this impressive trend is likely to continue for some time – even despite the current turmoil in brickandmortar retail combined with disciplined new property acquisitions these steadily rising rental rates have allowed federal realty to post strong and consistent sales increases in what is otherwise a slow growth market source simply safe dividends next management uses strong cost discipline and growing economies of scale to convert that sales growth into steady and even improving margins and returns on capital in fact thanks to its premium focus federal realty enjoys the highest profitability in its industry including a  ffo margin that means that just over half its revenues are available to help fund its dividend source morningstar gurufocus the final component of its longterm growth strategy is also the most important competitive advantage any reit can have – a very low cost of capital a low weighted average cost of capital wacc is critical to longterm growth because of how the reit business model is structured legally reits can avoid corporate taxes if they pay out  of taxable income as unqualified dividends which explains the industry’s high dividend yield as a result unlike most corporations which fund growth through retaining profits and cash flow reits must fund most of their expansion through external debt and equity markets ie selling new shares in other words external capital is always flowing into a reit meaning that it can be challenging to determine how well management is using shareholder’s cash is the reit really maximizing longterm shareholder value or merely growing for the sake of growth and increasing management’s salaries the two best ways to determine this are to look at the trend in ffo per share over time as well as whether or not a reit’s return on invested capital roic is greater than its cost of capital a highquality reit will be careful to only buy new properties and upgrade its existing ones if it results in shareholder accretion in other words marginal ffo will be greater than the shares sold to help finance any improvement to or acquisitions of new properties that ensures that ffo per share which ultimately funds the dividend is increasing in order to be able to make accretive capital allocation decisions a reit needs access to low cost capital of which there are three sources retained ffo debt and equity as you can see federal realty has a very even split between these three capital sources combined with very low costs of debt courtesy of its industryleading balance sheet and a rockbottom cost of equity due to a high share price premium the company has bountiful access to some of the cheapest capital in all of the real estate sector and much lower than its roic  source earnings releases gurufocus fast graphs simply safe dividends management guidance that helps ensure that this reit is building longterm shareholder wealth thanks to very strong capital allocation decisions by one of the best management teams in the business it’s no accident that federal realty’s capital costs are so low across the board for example retaining such a large amount of ffo means that not only is the dividend protected by a large safety buffer but also that frt can minimize shareholder diluting equity issuances which makes it easier to grow ffo per share and the dividend more consistently and faster than its peers   meanwhile the cost of debt is mostly determined by the stock’s credit rating which at a is tied for the second highest of any reit that required management to take a longterm disciplined and conservative approach to debt including not overleveraging itself in the last eight years when interest rates were at their lowest levels in history finally the low cost of equity is precisely because federal realty’s longterm dividend growth record has made it the gold standard of not just retail reits but global reits in general in other words due to its strong and consistent growth which has allowed frt shares to generate doubledigit annual total returns over the past two decades wall street is giving this stock a welldeserved premium that ensures it access to some of the cheapest capital in the industry with which to keep growing overall federal realty’s high quality property portfolio focus on large and affluent markets conservative balance sheet low cost of capital and longterm dividend growth track record make it one of the highest quality reits in america key risks while federal realty with its unbeatable history of steady and impressive growth seems to be a relatively lowrisk stock there are nonetheless three main risks to be aware of first the majority of the company’s growth pipeline rests in mixed use properties specifically there are  properties that management wants to develop and believes can achieve  to  returns on investment while expanding its leasable retail space by  or  million square feet however the thing to remember about these projects is that they are far more complex that most retail only properties in particular they require numerous partner developers to help finance the hotel office or apartment components of the properties which means the risk is that some of these projects may end up faling through especially if an economic downturn results in the reit’s business partners not being able to line up the funding to complete their components of the joint ventures next is the risk that longterm changes in consumer retail preferences might ultimately might hurt many of the reit’s tenants because while highend retailers with stores located in very high density and wealthy areas may have continued to do well in the age of amazon thus far there’s nothing guaranteeing that this trend will continue after all many wealthy folks have amazon prime and enjoy shopping online especially as the company expands its premium offerings and speeds up deliveries to as fast as one hour in certain large cities finally we can’t forget that rising interest rates while not a death knell to the reit industry can still hurt its short to mediumterm growth prospects that’s because reits are one of the most interest rate sensitive equity classes due to their need for constant infusions of new external capital in fact mall reits have an average beta to yield of  meaning that for every  increase in year us treasury yields their dividend yields can be expected to rise  source hoya capital real estate if the federal reserve’s longterm forecast of a  increase in longterm rates by the end of  is correct that would mean that federal realty’s yield could rise to  potentially resulting in nearly a  share price decline while longterm investors wouldn’t be harmed by this in fact they’d benefit from better yields on new capital and reinvested dividends shorterterm more risk averse invetors such as retirees living off the  rule could be more significantly impacted and should keep this risk in mind the good news is that for longterm investors either those who are  years away from retirement or retirees funding all of their living expenses with dividends is that even in a higher rate environment federal realty should still be able to grow despite an increase in its cost of capital that’s because frt’s high profitability means that even in such a scenario its cost of capital would still likely allow for accretive though possibly slower growth federal realty’s dividend safety we analyze  years of dividend data and  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend our dividend safety score answers the question “is the current dividend payment safe” we look at some of the most important financial factors such as current and historical eps and fcf payout ratios debt levels free cash flow generation industry cyclicality roic trends and more dividend safety scores range from  to  and conservative dividend investors should stick with firms that score at least  since tracking the data companies cutting their dividends had an average dividend safety score below  at the time of their dividend reduction announcements we wrote a detailed analysis reviewing how dividend safety scores are calculated what their realtime track record has been and how to use them for your portfolio here federal realty has a dividend safety score of  meaning that its dividend appears to not only be highly secure and dependable but also one of the safest dividends in all of reitdom that’s not surprising given the company’s impressive  year dividend growth streak what explains federal realty’s dividend safety three main factors the first is the highly dependable cash flow provided by longterm rental agreements with a highly diversified group of highquality tenants you can see that most of the company’s  largest tenants have investmentgrade credit ratings and are spread across different industries source federal realty earnings supplement presentation federal realty’s top  tenants combined also only make up  of its total rental revenue and no tenant exceeds  of total annualized base rent that helps ensure that any individual distressed retailer such as one that goes bankrupt and thus stops paying rent doesn’t end up hurting the reit’s cash flow enough to threaten the dividend that’s because of the second protective factor the very low ffo payout ratio which management generally keeps around  sources earnings releases gurufocus   this conservative payout ratio not only helps the company retain its low cost of capital because retained ffo is free but also helps to ensure steady and secure payouts even during times of economic distress such as the financial crisis finally federal realty’s dividend is protected by its strong balance sheet at first glance the reit’s high leverage ratio and negative free cash flow may make it seem like frt has too much debt enough to potentially threaten the payout source simply safe dividends however remember that free cash flow is calculated by subtracting all capital expenditures including growth that’s funded by external sources in other words because of the capitalintensive nature of the reit industry one in which lots of debt is both expected and necessary we need to keep debt metrics in perspective and when we compare federal realty’s debt levels to its peers it becomes obvious that it’s actually one of the safest stocks in the industry that’s courtesy of the below average leverage ratio net debtebitda and low debt to capital ratio this explains the company’s very strong credit rating which gives the reit such a low cost of debt and helps with its low overall cost of capital sources morningstar fast graphs in addition it’s important to be aware of two other metrics the interest coverage ratio and the fixedcharge coverage ratio operating incomeinterest and preferred dividends a good rule of thumb is that you want a reit to have values of at least three for both metrics indicating that cash flow is easily covering short and mediumterm liabilities source federal realty investor presentation frt’s interest rate coverage ratio of  is one of the highest of any reit and its fixedcharge coverage ratio has not only been above three pretty much during its entire history but has actually been steadily growing in recent years in fact the fixedcharge coverage ratio is now among the strongest in its industry and helps to explain why its dividend growth has been so much better than its lowerquality more highly leveraged peers over the past decade the fact that many of its peers have negative dividend growth rates over the past  years due mostly to having to cut their payouts during the financial crisis is a testament to both the importance of a fortresslike balance sheet and frt’s conservative use of debt over the past half century federal realty’s dividend growth our dividend growth score answers the question “how fast is the dividend likely to grow” it considers many of the same fundamental factors as the safety score but places more weight on growthcentric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios scores of  are average  or higher is very good and  or lower is considered weak federal realty’s dividend growth score of  indicates that investors could see somewhat below average relative to the sp ’s year median payout growth of  dividend growth in the future that’s not that surprising given that frt has become famous for its slow but steady pace of dividend increases of course given that management has generally maintained a very steady ffo payout ratio of about  which is where it currently sits the dividend is likely to grow at about the same pace as ffo per share going forward fortunately management’s longterm strategy should be able to achieve about  to  growth in net operating income and ffo meaning that the payout should rise at approximately that pace valuation over the past year concerns over rising interest rates and a bear market in retail reits have caused federal realty to underperform the sp  by about  as a result the stock’s current priceadjusted funds from operation or affo the reit equivalent of free cash flow and a far more appropriate valuation metric than a pe ratio is  which is below its longterm historical average of  of course that’s still much higher than the industry average of  and among the highest of any equity reit however given its strong fundamentals and the fact that frt is a year away from becoming a dividend king this blue chip reit is likely always going to command a strong price premium from a yield perspective frt’s current dividend yield of  a threeyear high though one of the lowest in the overall reit sector is still above its longterm historical yield of  more importantly if we compare that  yield against the other dividend kings that frt will be joining in  it’s  yield compares well against slowergrowing blue chips such as cocacola ko  procter  gamble pg  emerson electric emr  northwest natural gas company nwn  the bottom line is that federal realty as one of the best reits in the world will likely always have a relatively low yield as far as reits go however with potential longterm annual total returns of  to    yield   to  annual earnings growth frt is still a potentially solid income growth investment at today’s relatively depressed price the biggest wildcard is future growth in the brickandmortar retail industry but frt’s diversified tenant base and unique focus on highend consumers have served it well thus far conclusion federal realty’s impressive dividend security fortresslike balance sheet long dividend growth streak and conservative management team make it one of the highest quality reits in the market the stock’s sharp underperformance over the past year makes federal realty a more timely longterm income growth investment to consider as well at least for investors willing to play the role of contrarian in

also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a

your terms expect to see and ad for your business how can i keep my costs down while your first instinct may be to lower your budget first try lowering your maximum bids yes this could mean fewer
