fund specific risks salient midstream  mlp fund principal investment risks a summary of certain risks associated with an investment in the fund is set forth below the summary is not complete and an investor should carefully review the more detailed risks applicable to the fund set forth in the fund’s preliminary prospectus closedend funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value the risk of loss due to this discount may be greater for initial investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after completion of the offering an investment in the fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not designed to be a complete investment program the fund is designed to be a longterm investment and not as a trading vehicle additional risks as the resources of the underlying mlps deplete production and cash flows steadily decline which may decrease distribution rates to the fund as applicable mlp funds with international holdings are subject to currency fluctuation risk differences in accounting principles and country specific risks given the energy sector focus of many mlps a sustained decline in the demand for energy products could adversely affect mlp revenues and cash flows no operating or trading history the fund is a newlyorganized nondiversified closedend management investment company and has no operating or public trading history being a newlyorganized company the fund is subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business including the risk that the fund will not achieve its investment objective and that the value of an investment could decline substantially investment and market risk an investment in the fund’s common shares is subject to investment risk including the possible loss of the entire amount that you invest an investment in the fund’s common shares is not intended to constitute a complete investment program and should not be viewed as such the value of the securities in which the fund invests like other market investments may move up or down sometimes rapidly and unpredictably your investment in the fund’s common shares at any point in time may be worth less than your original investment even after taking into account the reinvestment of distributions risks relating to mlps in investments an investment in mlp units involves risks that differ from a similar investment in equity securities such as common stock of a corporation holders of mlp units have the rights typically afforded to limited partners in a limited partnership as compared to common stockholders of a corporation holders of mlp units have more limited control and limited rights to vote on matters affecting the partnership there are certain tax risks associated with an investment in mlp units additionally conflicts of interest may exist among common unit holders subordinated unit holders and the general partner or managing member of an mlp midstream sector risk certain risks inherent in investing in midstream companies and mlps include changes in the supply and demand for natural resources depletion of reserves changes in governmental regulations changes in commodity prices inability to consummate acquisitions or realize the benefits therefrom dependency on affiliates the occurrence of significant natural or manmade catastrophes terrorist activities government instability and the occurrence of extreme weather conditions derivates risk the fund may purchase and sell derivative investments such as exchangelisted and overthecounter put and call options on securities equity fixed income interest rate and currency indices and other financial instruments and enter into various interest rate transactions such as swaps or credit default swaps the fund also may purchase derivative investments that combine features of these instruments the use of derivatives has risks including high price volatility government intervention nonperformance by the counterparty and the imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets the possible default of the other party to the transaction or illiquidity of the derivative investments furthermore the ability to successfully use these techniques depends on salient capital advisors llc’s ability to predict pertinent market movements which cannot be assured the use of derivatives may result in losses greater than if they had not been used may require the fund to sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices other than current market values may limit the amount of appreciation the fund can realize on an investment or may cause the fund to hold a security that the fund might otherwise sell in addition amounts paid by the fund as premiums and cash or other assets held in margin accounts with respect to derivative transactions are not otherwise available to the fund for investment purposes options risk the fund currently expects to write covered call options on portfolio positions in an amount up to  of the value of total assets in its portfolio with the purpose of generating realized gains the fund also intends to write uncovered call options in an amount up to  of the value of total assets in its portfolio and purchase put options as part of its hedging strategy as the writer of a covered call option during the option’s life the fund gives up the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike price of the call but the fund retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline the seller of an uncovered call option assumes the risk of a theoretically unlimited loss as a result of an increase in the market price of the underlying security above the exercise price of the option the buyer of a put or call option assumes the risk of losing its entire premium invested in the option short sales risk a short sale creates the risk of an unlimited loss in that the price of the underlying security could theoretically increase without limit thus increasing the cost of buying the securities that were sold short to cover the short position there can be no assurance that the securities necessary to cover a short position will be available for purchase the fund intends to limit its use of short sales to  of the value of total assets in the portfolio use of leverage under normal market conditions the fund intends to leverage instruments in an amount that represents approximately  of its total assets which represents approximately  of net assets including proceeds from such leverage instruments however as market conditions develop the fund may use leverage instruments in amounts that represent greater than  leverage to the extent permitted by the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” any subsidiary c corporations used by the fund will comply with the  act restrictions on borrowing and will be included in the fund’s leverage calculations leverage instruments will have seniority over the common shares and may be secured by the assets of the fund the fund currently anticipates leveraging its assets through borrowings from banks and other financial institutions the fund currently anticipates that it will enter into at least one credit facility in an amount up to   of total assets although the use of leverage by the fund may create an opportunity for increased return for common shareholders it also results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any losses there is no assurance that the fund’s use of leverage will be successful delay in use of proceeds although the fund currently intends to invest the proceeds from the sale of the common shares within three months after the closing of this offering such investments may be delayed if suitable investments are unavailable at the time the trading market and volumes for the midstream companies and mlps in which the fund intends to invest may at times be less liquid than the market for other securities cash flow risk a substantial portion of the cash flow received by the fund is derived from its investment in equity securities of midstream companies and mlps the amount of cash that any such company has available to pay its equity holders in the form of distributionsdividends depends on the amount of cash flow generated from such company’s operations interest rate risk the yields for equity securities of mlps and certain midstream mlps and midstream companies are susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates and the prices of such equity securities may decline when interest rates rise rising interest rates could adversely impact the financial performance of energy companies by increasing their cost of capital interest rates are at or near historic lows and as a result they are likely to rise over time capital markets risk global financial markets and economic conditions have been and continue to be volatile due to a variety of factors as a result the cost of raising capital in the debt and equity capital markets has increased while the ability to raise capital from those markets has diminished if funding is not available when needed or is available only on unfavorable terms midstream companies and mlps may not be able to meet their obligations as they come due moreover without adequate funding midstream companies and mlps may be unable to execute their growth strategies complete future acquisitions take advantage of other business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on their revenues and results of operations equity securities risk equity securities are sensitive to general movements in the stock market and a drop in the stock market may depress the price of securities to which the fund has exposure debt securities risk debt securities in which the fund invests are subject to many of the risks described elsewhere in this section in addition they are subject to credit risk interest rate risk prepayment risk and depending on their quality other special risks risks associated with an investment in initial public offerings “ipos’ securities purchased in ipos are often subject to the general risks associated with investments in companies with small market capitalizations and typically to a heightened degree securities issued in ipos have no trading history and information about the companies may be available for very limited periods in addition the prices of securities sold in an ipo may be highly volatile privately held company risk privately held companies are not subject to sec reporting requirements are not required to maintain their accounting records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are not required to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as a result salient capital advisors llc may not have timely or accurate information about the business financial condition and results of operations of the privately held companies in which the fund invests in addition the securities of privately held companies are generally illiquid and entail the risks described under—“liquidity risk” below liquidity risk securities with limited trading volumes may display volatile or erratic price movements therefore it may be more difficult for the fund to buy and sell significant amounts of such securities without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices interest rate hedging risk interest rate transactions that the fund may use for hedging purposes will expose the fund to certain risks that differ from the risks associated with its portfolio holdings the fund’s success in using hedging instruments is subject to salient capital advisors llc’s ability to predict correctly changes in the relationships of such hedging instruments to its interest rate risk and there can be no assurance that salient capital advisors llc’s judgment in this respect will be accurate concentration risk the focus of the fund’s portfolio on companies within the midstream sector may present more risks than if its portfolio were broadly diversified over numerous sectors of the economy inflation risk inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investment will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money as inflation increases the real value of the common shares and distributions can decline portfolio turnover risk the fund anticipates that its annual portfolio turnover rate will range between  and  excluding the turnover from its hedging program but the rate may vary greatly from year to year a higher portfolio turnover rate results in correspondingly greater brokerage commissions and other transactional expenses that are borne by the fund management risk dependence on key personnel of salient capital advisors llc the fund’s portfolio is subject to management risk because it is actively managed salient capital advisors llc applies investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for us but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results the fund depends upon salient capital advisors llc’s key personnel for its future success and upon their access to certain individuals and investments in the midstream sector the departure of any of salient capital advisors llc’s portfolio managers or the senior management of salient capital advisors llc could have a material adverse effect on salient capital advisors llc’s ability to achieve the fund’s investment objective in addition the fund can offer no assurance that salient capital advisors llc will remain its investment adviser or that the fund will continue to have access to salient capital advisors llc’s industry contacts and deal flow conflicts of interest of salient capital advisors llc conflicts of interest may arise because salient capital advisors llc and its affiliates generally carry on substantial investment activities for other clients in which the fund will have no interest salient capital advisors llc or its affiliates may have financial incentives to favor certain of such accounts over the fund any of their proprietary accounts and other customer accounts may compete with the fund for specific trades risk of owning securities of affiliates from time to time the fund may “control” or may be an “affiliate” of one or more of its portfolio companies which depending on securities and exchange commission interpretations may result in restrictions being imposed on the size of positions that may be taken for the fund or on the type of investments that the fund could make competition risk there are a limited number of other companies including other publicly traded investment companies and private funds which may serve as alternatives to the fund for investment in a portfolio of companies in the midstream sector valuation risk market prices may not be readily available for any restricted or unregistered investments in public companies or investments in private companies made by the fund due to the difficulty in valuing these securities and the absence of an active trading market for these investments the fund may not be able to realize these securities’ carrying value or may have to delay their sale in order to do so restricted securities the fund may invest in unregistered or otherwise restricted securities restricted securities may be more difficult to value and the fund may have difficulty disposing of such assets either in a timely manner or for a reasonable price nondiversified status overall risk can be reduced by investing in securities from a diversified pool of issuers while overall risk is increased by investing in securities of a small number of issuers credit market and other risks associated with its investment strategies or techniques may be more pronounced for the fund than for a fund that is more “diversified” antitakeover provisions provisions of the declaration of trust and bylaws could have the effect of discouraging delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of the fund’s common shareholders as a result these provisions may deprive the fund’s common shareholders of opportunities to sell common shares at a premium over the then current market price of common shares market discount risk shares of closedend management investment companies frequently trade at prices lower than their net asset value which is commonly referred to as “trading at a discount” the risk of loss due to this discount may be greater for initial investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after completion of the offering an investment in the fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not designed to be a complete investment program the fund is designed to be a longterm investment and not as a trading vehicle legal and regulatory risk legal and regulatory changes may materially adversely affect the fund the regulation of the us and nonus securities and futures markets and investment funds such as the fund has undergone substantial change in recent years and such change may continue tax risks the fund’s ability to meet its investment objective will depend in part on the level of taxable income and distributions the fund receives from the equity securities in which the fund invests a factor over which the fund has no control if an mlp were treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes such mlp would be obligated to pay us federal income tax on its income at the corporate tax rate the amount of cash available for distribution by the mlp would be reduced and distributions received by the fund would be taxed under us federal income tax laws applicable to corporate
