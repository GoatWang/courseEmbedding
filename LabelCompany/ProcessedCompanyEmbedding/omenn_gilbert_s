goals for as crucial and large an area as the environment is ambitious i gather your task is to envision what the goals should be  years from now and to build the research and technology base to prepare for achieving that vision themes certain themes are well developed in the papers that have been prepared for this meeting first sustainable development i think theres still a task to explain this widely used phrase but basically its the convergence of economic and environmental objectives for the longterm the second theme not often highlighted in environmental circles is the crucial role of population numbers and consumption patterns human activities account for most of the environmental problems were trying to redress or anticipate though we should not neglect natural disasters and the opportunities to anticipate and mitigate their effects third we need a stewardship strategy that combines pollution prevention and aggressive cleanup the most dramatic examples of lack of

soviet union finally we must somehow engage everyone through the media and through our communities to translate interest and support for protection of health and environment into core values and personal responsibility at an international level we need to draw the united states and all other countries together to share objectives to achieve harmonization of test methods and risk assessment for chemicals and other hazards to recognize ways in which environmental issues may be used or misused in trade negotiations under new trade agreements and to bring the environment into the center of discussions about international relations and economic development risk is the coin of the realm in protecting health and the environment risk assessment risk communication and risk reduction strategies can help us determine priorities and help to persuade those who are paying basically the taxpayers and consumers that there is a decent return on our investment in risk management we are stretching beyond the limits of science to discuss risk so it is not surprising that scientists disagree on risk estimates or on what should be done if anything to reduce those risks nevertheless the public finds such disagreement disconcerting and the cartoonists mock us in assessing health and ecological risks we are stretching our knowledge of mechanisms and our capabilities below the range of exposures subject to the direct observations or experiments that are the domain of science the extrapolation to low dose exposures reflects models assumptions speculation and judgment we need to explain better what is known and what is speculated objectives of risk assessment risk assessment has been developed to address several different kinds of tasks first the laws covering pharmaceuticals and pesticides require that the responsible federal regulatory agencies fda and epa balance risks and benefits anticancer drugs antimicrobial agents and pesticides are designed to be toxic to living things balancing the benefits and risks depends on the margin of safety patterns of use and appropriate protections other laws such as the clean air act do not explicitly authorize balancing benefits and risks a second risk management strategy is to set target levels of risk usually as federal guidance to the states devolution to the states will be an increasing theme over the next few years probably for the year period you are addressing there will be more and more responsibility laid on states and localities which will have to come together to deal with the fact that environmental pollution does not respect geographic or political boundaries this strategy is used for food contaminants and water pollutants target levels page  share cite suggested citationgilbert s omenn

can be measured if contaminant concentrations are above the target level the food cannot be sold or the facilities discharging to water are out of compliance if the contaminants are below the target level the food or water is ok safe presents negligible risk third everybody has to set priorities in the face of limited resources regulatory agencies environmental groups consumer groups and manufacturers must decide where to invest their efforts people and dollars including their effort to explain to the public what theyre up against in trying to prevent hazards or develop products finally and most neglected is the use of risk assessment to determine what weve accomplished one source of skepticism about risk assessment and about our whole program of environmental stewardship and cleanup is that many people really dont understand how much has been accomplished in the last  years despite welldocumented gains in air quality water quality habitat protection product safety waste disposal recycling and pollution prevention we should put ourselves to the test of predicting what can be done to reduce effects or at least exposures and then determine whether the steps that were taken the investments that were made really did accomplish those reductions for regulatory decisionmaking it is essential to have a guiding framework for risk management we have such a framework for risk assessment developed in the carter administration figure  and adapted in the red book the  national research council report risk assessment in the federal government managing the process nrc

decisions and strategies for risk reduction this framework can be applied quite generally in fact people use such thinking intuitively in their daily lives and in making judgments about any public policy of interest to them as i will tell you in a few moments in the context of the risk commission many people are uncomfortable with the term risk probabilistic expressions and estimates of risk come out of science engineering and mathematical modeling there is a perception that risk and risk analysis can be easily manipulated and is dominated by experts who see the world differently from ordinary people we must take account of that discomfort and distrust if we hope to use these constructs broadly with all stakeholders the presidentialcongressional commission on risk assessment and risk management i was asked to speak specifically about the risk commission table  lists the membership all political appointees six appointed by the congress three appointed by the administration the

risk management policy issues • consistency across agencies the title conveys the main theme science and judgment that report is important input for our commission our mandate has five components table  i want to talk about each of these briefly and see if it stimulates discussion first the uses and limitations of risk assessment i broadly hinted at one of the basic problems that there are people in our society and wellorganized groups who are skeptical about the intentions of risk assessment who do not see risk assessment as a neutral framing mechanism but as a tool of people who are expert in its use and employed by those who want to have risk assessments done we must address that distrust and discomfort and persuade folks that this is an approach to problemsolving that can be utilized by all the limitations are actually embedded in the science too much of what weve done in risk assessment in my opinion and in the emerging opinion of the commission as we prepare for recommendations to congress next spring has been focused on individual chemicals one chemical at a time lay people do not associate exposures with one chemical at a time they know that we have many many exposures in our daily lives there are hundreds of measured chemicals in contaminated water and contaminated air there are thousands of chemicals most of them already known to be carcinogenic in cigarette smoke so the fact that we talk about only one chemical at a time and present an elaborate risk assessment for one chemical stretches our credibility we must find ways of thinking about mixtures and testing the effects of mixtures in risk reduction we must indicate how much impact our actions could have in the broader contexts of all sources of air pollution or cancer rates or habitat protection the second limitation is that there has been an obsession with risk associated with chemicals particularly from industrial and agricultural activities for the most part people have come to neglect the risks associated with microorganisms but people in milwaukee were reminded when an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis affected  people in  in seattle and in several other cities and states there was an outbreak of toxigenic e coli with deaths of children and dozens of children now on longterm kidney dialysis as a result medical and industrial uses and more dramatically the department of energy nuclear weapons production sites remind us that we must think about mixtures of radiation and chemical exposures and understand the similarities and differences in their effects their mechanisms and their doseresponse curves and take some lessons from one into the page  share cite suggested citationgilbert s omenn university of washington national research council  linking

fractionation studies in radiobiology and in medical radiotherapy we tend to ignore the rate of exposure in chemical toxicology and just average over a year or an eighthour working period sometimes we have shortterm exposure limits but for the most part we just average exposures as if that covered the situation those limitations in our science base limit the use of risk assessment as an analytical tool because the data are not there to address questions that state and local health officers and lay people logically expect us to address the second mandate involves exposure scenarios exposure assessment is the element of risk assessment that has been ridiculed the most—and for good reason it became standard practice at epa and in other agencies to postulate that the exposure of an individual or of a population could be characterized in a precautionary way by a mostexposed individual a hypothetical person with her or his nose in the fence line for  years breathing at a maximal breathing rate with maximal assumptions compounded to its credit the epa has moved away from this method in recent risk assessments toward a highend reallife individual or some subgroup of the upper end of the distribution this is a promising development another aspect of exposure assessment is recognition of different population groups theres been quite a lot of attention lately including an nrc report on pesticides in the diets of infants and children nrc  and environmental group advocacy around the special protections required for infants and children who have much smaller body mass and may have special dietary intakes as in the case of fruit drinks and baby foods with pesticide residues we need to pay more attention to special exposures differences in metabolism and differences with age we need to make them real and understandable to people who are the decisionmakers and ultimately to the public trying to understand what the exposure scenarios are and which populations most need to be protected third one of the best pieces of the nrc report science and judgment in risk assessment in my opinion was the distinction between variability and uncertainty there is much variability in human populations due to inherited differences in metabolism or in susceptibility at the site of action nutrition other exposures effects of age early in life and late in life coexisting diseases and personal behaviors all of that can be investigated and characterized but some aspects are not observable and rest on assumptions and models this problem plagues the standard extrapolation from observable ranges for example with tumors in  to  percent of animals exposed to try to make a judgment that the risk is less than one in a million for lifetime excess human cancer risk in a upperbound worstcase scenario that enormous extrapolation of at least a factor of  covers uncertainty that cannot be addressed by real data modelers are undeterred of course monte carlo simulations and other

to come out with a twopronged recommendation here we are quite keen to see probability distributions utilized for exposure parameters where you actually have data on adherence of chemicals to soils and release rates on distribution of body weight in the population on distribution of consumption of tap water or soil by children and so forth exposure estimates can use real data and the distributions can actually be validated for a particular site if its a sitespecific problem we are not comfortable with probabilistic uncertainty analysis for the overall risk assessment or for the health effects when we dont even know whether the chemical can be properly classified as an agent causing cancer or birth defects or not we have been told over and over by nontechnical specialists that decisionmakers dont want all that stuff qualitative judgments and full descriptions of the reasons for uncertainty are most welcome however what they really want from the technicians the risk assessors is guidance is it a problem or is it not a problem im a busy person ive got a full plate is this something that requires my attention or not that is not well captured with probability distributions and monte carlo simulations theres a great risk that those folks just glaze over walk away and distrust all the risk assessment information we are aware that theres quite a debate about what can be called bright lines the notion that if youre above a certain value its a problem if youre below a certain value its not a problem of course there are enormous assumptions that go into a bright line you may set say  upper bound for lifetime cancer excess risk as the cut point for whats acceptable or not maybe it should be  one in  that bright line was adopted by the state of california and accepted by industry and the environmentalists in california for labeling of chemicals under proposition  that compromise between  preferred by industry and  preferred by environmentalists was crucial to the smooth work on proposition  after all the strife at the beginning roe and omenn  but lets be clear there are numerous assumptions that go into that risk calculation reflecting different future use scenarios particularly the commission would like to encourage technical work to support choices of bright lines for exposures and emissions as i have emphasized risk cannot be measured but exposure levels can be measured we do this now for water pollutants and for food contaminants we say you can sell peanuts and corn with aflatoxin b below a particular measured level but not above in this way risk assessors and risk managers help bridge the gap between the people who want to have a practical basis for making a decision and taking action and explaining it and those who would like to deal with all the riskrelated assumptions and details fresh every time the fourth area of the commissions mandate is a set of risk management issues for risk reduction the biggest items here have to do with economic analyses and comparisons of risks its no secret that the regulatory reform agenda in the congress is heavily tied to the notion of benefitcost analysis it is shocking to page  share cite suggested citationgilbert s omenn university of washington national research council  linking science and technology to societys environmental

assume the estimates of costs and of monetized benefits would be highly reliable not requiring attention to assumptions uncertainties and peer review were amazed that numbers like the gross domestic product or the census or the unemployment rate are published with no uncertainty comment we know theres plenty of uncertainty in those numbers they are estimates they are commonly revised as you know  maybe others would like to address this matter we have strongly urged the congress to encourage costeffectiveness analysis we believe that costs should be considered and should be evaluated in making decisions about health and environmental protection the last five presidents including the present president have demanded that of their agency heads through executive order once the objective is determined to reduce exposures to certain levels to protect against cancers birth defects neurotoxicity or immunological effects or to protect habitat or achieve otehr environmental objects it should be clear that we want to do so in the least costly manner it should not be a burden to an agency head to stand before the public and explain that the benefits expected to be achieved through these regulatory actions justify the costs by whatever metric that person feels capable of marshaling to build public support for the decision finally we were mandated to address consistency across federal agencies it is a bone of contention with numerous parties that agencies including programs within epa seem to take different approaches with similar data sometimes thats required by current statutes or by the current interpretations of those statutes at least other times its lack of coordination lack of a common strategy a failure to share data or failure to compromise on assumptions like body weight extrapolation from rodents to humans we believe there are many ways to improve consistency this matter was of great interest to the carnegie commission task force on regulatory and judicial decisionmaking theres quite a lot of work internationally on harmonization testing protocols risk assessment strategies and standards we expect harmonization to be increasingly important with

really are in this country toxic agents come in right in the middle of the list sixty thousand deaths roughly estimated is not an insignificant number this estimate is fairly well justified in the original article and by many background articles and it is certainly worthy of extensive reduction before closing let me mention one other item the cleanup at doe facilities the legacy of  years of accumulation decomposition and migration of radioactive and chemical contamination the polling paper in your meeting book describes how technology has been at the core of many human activities that have led to pollutants and contamination as well as population growth and its attendant problems at the same time people have a great faith that technology can provide a fix to any problem after crucial technical advances that helped our nation prevail in world war ii and now in the cold war we are left with a task that will take at least  years for the cleanup the estimated price tag of  billion in  dollars represents promissory notes against the precious discretionary funds of the us government surely a source of tremendous future state and federal confrontation the department of energy has responded to the need for effective and continuing stakeholder involvement there is considerable uncertainty about the technical assessments and priorities upon which those cleanup plans and associated promissory notes were built and there has been a congressional demand for riskbased integrated assessment of the present risks and the risks and costeffectiveness of remediation options the recommendations of the national research council report called building consensus nrc b turned out in  days from the time doe assistant secretary tom grumbly made the request to the academy at a meeting in november  are very compatible with how our risk commission feels about stakeholder involvement in comprehensive iterative risk assessments the word iterative has a lot of baggage science and judgment in risk assessment suggested a very conservative first analysis a screening analysis to be followed by a more substantial analysis our commission is anxious about that recommendation because we believe all this work should be done in the open disclosed to the public involving the public once a very high risk estimate is generated under extremely conservative assumptions we believe it is impossible to retain the publics confidence when a more careful assessment with more data is reported to justify a much lower risk estimate it is very hard we feel to overcome the sense that
