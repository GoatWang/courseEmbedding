project portfolio contact the keatingcompanieskeatingconsultingroberthendersonarchitectkeatingenvironmentalmanagement the phoenix suite   arch street philadelphia pa   p  f keating kms kc rha kem experienced diligent focused welcome to kms development partnersa different kind of development company about kms development partners may be a new name but it’s founded on the values and entrepreneurial spirit that have guided three highly accomplished individuals—dan keating iii dennis martin and mike sencindiver the partnership bears the trademarks of unique individual skills and collective success together they have developed millions of square feet of space today valued in the billions of dollars and continue to manage over two million square feet of space through many years of association in a predecessor company keating development company they have crafted a unique portfolio of projects that is perhaps best defined as opportunistic and value focused the projects take many forms many working on behalf of large institutional and government clients others for our own account and still others to meet the specific project delivery requirements of a private sector client they vary greatly in size but project size and scale has always been subordinate to project economics value creation and project viability services kms offers a full range of development services from conceptual planning and entitlement through asset and property management site due diligence project finance leedsustainability analyses site environmental analyses publicprivate partnership formation entity structuring yield analysesmaster plan civic engagement historic preservation analyses transitoriented development security studies owner’s representative services asset management property management site due diligence site due diligence is a process common to all of our projects and typically includes a broad range of project entitlement activities we are especially proud of our project approval success rate that spans an exceptional range of project types—from mixeduse development to commercial and multifamily residential—to both urban and suburban locations requiring either new construction or restoration and reuse of existing structures many of our projects have required substantial rezoning effort and many others have required specialized analyses and management of for example historic preservation and archaeological analyses detailed security studies or a waterfront approvals and redevelopment process please refer to other services for our projectspecific experience in these areas project finance project finance asks the question “how does the project get paid for” the principals of kms have answered this question as owners developers and owner’s representatives we have done so in the varied stages of the real estate cycle and in both good and bad economic times the principals have raised both equity and debt equity has sometimes come from internal capital and has also been raised from third parties both private and institutional the debt for our projects has been provided by banks institutional lenders such as insurance companies and pension funds public bond issues certificates of participation and government insured mortgages we have taken many paths to reducing project capital cost—for example using tax credits on some projects and public grants on others in every instance our goal is to provide the lowest cost and most efficient capital ensuring both initial delivery and long term viability of the project representative projects include the phoenix at clarendon arlington va a mixeduse development using internal and institutional equity and bank debt the phoenix philadelphia pa a mixeduse development using institutional equity bank and institutional debt and historic tax credit financing the stegmaier at federal square wilkesbarre pa a federal office project using a public bond issue based on a credit lease leedsustainability analyses most of our projects are based on the core principles of leed certification and long term building sustainability in part because much of our portfolio is located in both large and smaller metropolitan areas and is often designed to meet the long term and enduring needs of large institutional clients our experience in developing to achieve leed certification typically results in projects that receive a level of certification beyond our client’s original goal for example the irs regional headquarters was slated to achieve basic leed certification and ultimately received a leed gold certification our success can be attributed to a very knowledgeable and senior staff many with leed accreditation who can quickly chart a path to achieving design phase certification then follow with demonstrated success in the complicated construction phase audit process site environmental analyses site environmental analyses are typically part of due diligence on all of our projects in large part because most of our portfolio is situated on previously developed property working with our sister company kem and others we have overseen many forms of site remediation work that are required by state and local agencies as a condition of redevelopment remediation activities have included for example removal of contaminated soil abatement of asbestos and in certain instances encapsulation of contamination that will allow for redevelopment of a site our work has also included the development of storm water management plans that meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements some examples of this work include sugarhouse casino philadelphia pa at this riverfront site the former home of a sugar refinery we managed the removal and in some cases reuse of fill on this industrial site working closely with state regulatory agencies to assure an early completion of this large remediation project octavius v catto school  stockton station park camden nj this extraordinarily complex site environmental effort included development and management of a state and community approved plan for remediation of hazardous materials in many areas of the seventeen acre property publicprivate partnership formation the principals of kms have been creating publicprivate partnerships for nearly two decades long before this form of project delivery became a solution of choice for many of today’s infrastructure challenges our experience is rooted in the long history of the keating organization servicing the needs of public institutions beginning in the early ’s we were engaged in helping colleges find creative ways to finance and deliver academic buildings and student housing similarly we helped hospitals finance and deliver medical office buildings beginning in  we began a working relationship with the united states postal service usps and the united states general services administration to finance and deliver federal courthouses and office buildings on underutilized postal service property in the middle ’s we expanded this form of partnership to include county and municipal buildings and facilities for colleges and universities these relationships continue to this day we have now completed projects valued at well over  billion in publicprivate partnerships with each project we began with the question of how to deliver the project at the least cost of occupancy to our client always working within their specific constraints kms has the experience and skills to answer this question and has consistently demonstrated an ability to work collaboratively with public partners representative projects include irs regional headquarters philadelphia pa a one million square foot facility redeveloped on usps land civic square ii new brunswick nj a middlesex county administration building city of new brunswick municipal building and renovated post office mostly on usps land rutgers public safety building new brunswick nj a new public safety building academic facilities and parking garage for rutgers university developed in collaboration with public partner new brunswick development corporation entity structuring each development project brings a unique set of challenges entitlement design project cost and project finance these challenges create risk furthermore each project offers a unique set of participants with varying appetites for and ability to assume risk particularly in the case of public partners the principals have used entity structuring to limit the risks on projects and assign these risks to the parties who can and should bear those risks our engagement in this process has led to unique credit lease structures that have navigated federal leasing constraints congressional approvals and the limitations on public borrowing these structures have also addressed the specific requirements of pension funds and municipal entities as well as the needs of project users through capital and operating leases we are particularly proud of an oftendemonstrated ability to craft lease structures that meet the needs of our partners matching their tolerance for risk with their role in the project representative projects include the phoenix at clarendon arlington va a privately owned and financed  million project developed on united states postal service usps property irs regional headquarters philadelphia pa a one million square foot federal office building that was redeveloped on usps property civic square ii new brunswick nj a new county administration building new municipal building and renovated post office mostly on usps land yield analysesmaster plan this activity is one of our earliest predevelopment activities that is typically performed in house the work can take the form of conceptual plans that internally allow us to develop a preliminary understanding of the range of options for property development these same plans are often used to graphically illustrate options and value to the property ownerprospective client the analyses have addressed many types of development from plans for large tracts of land to proposals for redevelopment of a building many have represented the potential for mixeduse development that includes multifamily residential retail and office space others illustrate concepts for courthouses and government office buildings and still others address hospitality and gaming opportunities visit the keating rha site for examples of these analyses civic engagement this service encompasses the many ways in which the company has worked with local groups to develop a project that successfully meets both client and broader community needs our approach to this work is always defined by the specific requirements of the projects and interests of the community it has for example included community forums to discuss project alternatives design charrettes and regularly scheduled project reviews that are part of a more structured review and approvals process examples of this engagement process include octavius v catto school camden nj a new demonstration school project that included many meetings with the local community to discuss the school program new playground and park facilities and the range of programs to be provided by the new boys  girls club that are part of the school complex the phoenix at clarendon arlington va this mixeduse development of united states postal service property required many rounds of meetings and charrettes with local community groups to resolve traffic environmental historic preservation mix of uses and building massingdensity issues sugarhouse casino philadelphia pa this project became a poster child for civic engagement in philadelphia spanning a total of four years in the project approvals process the company conducted dozens of official meeting s with the community but also arranged countless smaller forums with focus on specific community issues ranging from traffic archaeology and waterfront development approvals to jobs creation and formation of a community service district with long term support from the casino historic preservation analyses our work on united states postal service usps and other historic properties has produced a broad portfolio of experience that addresses the disposition of historic structures spanning much of the past twenty years many of these structures are community icons and most of them have been the subject of a section  assessment that we have often directed on behalf of the usps our work on usps and other historic properties has produced consistently successful project results that have satisfied the stringent requirement of state historic preservation offices across the country six states we are proud of this record…it illustrates the potential to match historic preservation objectives with sound economic development some examples irs regional headquarters philadelphia pa the phoenix philadelphia pa the phoenix at clarendon arlington va united states district courthouse  post office lynchburg va united states district courthouse waco tx transitoriented development the focus of kms development—urban and suburban infill properties—has produced a project portfolio that is filled with transitoriented development many of our project awards—the irs regional headquarters and the phoenix in philadelphia the phoenix at clarendon in arlington va and heldrich plaza in new brunswick nj—acknowledge the importance of this emphasis we know that many owners now value the importance of transitoriented development experience as the following list illustrates we have consistently delivered that project service for much of the past twenty years irs regional headquarters philadelphia pa the phoenix philadelphia pa keystonemercy office campus conshohocken pa the phoenix at clarendon arlington va arlington road residential bethesda md heldrich plaza new brunswick nj transit gateway village new brunswick nj old oakland housing oakland ca security studies our active role in the development of government facilities—courthouses office and public safety buildings—has made security issues a frequent focus of our work with our early projects in the ’s we developed a solid body of knowledge in the design and management of secure facilities like courthouses now a total of nine facilities the advent of terroristrelated activities brought new focus and experience in this service area we have enlarged our range of expertise and expert consultant base to include those who model the impacts of blast on structures below see one example of this work for the irs regional headquarters analyze the impacts of building progressive collapse offer innovative solutions to reinforcing historic structures to withstand blast and identify creative solutions to meeting secure perimeter requirements on tight urban sites this accumulated knowledge positions us to address today’s complex security requirements of government institutional and corporate clients owner’s representative services the company offers a broad portfolio of owner’s representative experience our success in growing this portfolio can be attributed to the signature of our service we think act and manage like an owner…because we are an owner we are and have been in the shoes of the owner for over two decades…and nothing makes us more aware of the owner’s need to balance daytoday budgetary and long term management requirements than being in that same
