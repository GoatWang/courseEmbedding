insider trading is not defined in the federal securities laws but generally is used to refer to the use of material nonpublic information to trade in securities whether or not one is an insider or the communications of material nonpublic information to others while the law concerning insider trading is not static it is generally understood that the law prohibits � �page� code of ethics � trading by an insider while in possession of material nonpublic information or trading by a noninsider while in possession of material nonpublic information where the information either was disclosed to the noninsider in violation of an insiders duty to keep it confidential or was misappropriated or  communicating material deemed nonpublic information to others � c�� identifying inside information before

would consider important in making his or her investment decisions ��� is this information that would substantially affect the market price of the securities if generally disclosed ��� what is the source of the information ��� has the information been effectively communicated to the marketplace� � � if after consideration of the above you believe that the information is material and nonpublic or if you have questions as to whether the information is material and nonpublic you should report the matter to management or designated principal or is designee and refrain from trading with respect to the security involved and refrain from communicating the information in question to any one other than management or designated principal or his designee either inside or outside of the firm until you have received instructions on the matter from management or designated principal or his designee the elements of insider trading and the penalties for such unlawful conduct are discussed below i�����who is an insider the concept of insider is broad it includes officers directors and employees of a company and may include principal shareholders in addition a person can be a temporary insider if he or she enters into a special confidential relationship in the conduct of a companys affairs and as a result is given access to information solely for the companys purposes a temporary insider can include among others a companys attorneys accountants consultants bank lending officers and the employees of such organizations in addition rochdale may become a temporary insider of a company it advises or for which it performs other services according to the supreme court the company must expect the individual to keep the disclosed nonpublic information confidential and the relationship must at least imply such a duty before the individual will be considered an insider � ii�����what is material information trading on inside information is not a basis for liability unless the information is material material information generally is defined as information for which there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making his or her investment decisions or information that is reasonably certain to have a substantial effect on the price of a companys securities� � iii�����what is nonpublic information information is nonpublic until it has been effectively communicated to the market place one must be able to point to some fact to show that the information is generally public for example information found in a report filed with the sec or appearing in reuters economic services the wall street journal or other publications of general circulation would be considered public iv�����what are the penalties for insider trading penalties for trading on or communicating material nonpublic information are severe both for individuals involved in such unlawful conduct and their employers a person can be subject to some or all of the penalties below even if he or she does not personally benefit from the violation penalties include civil injunctions treble damages disgorgement of parties jail sentences fines for the person who

of  or three times the amount of the profit gained or loss avoided in addition any violation of this policy statement can be expected to result in serious sanctions by rochdale including dismissal of the persons involved �for example information that has been published in a newspaper or magazine of general publication such as reuters or the wall street journal would be deemed to have been
