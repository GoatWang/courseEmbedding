the call over to françois françois locohdonou  f networks inc thank you jason id like to begin by echoing my welcome to everyone on this call thank you for joining us today im thrilled to be taking the helm of f a company that represents such a strong platform for growth and innovation my confidence in f has only been bolstered by the time i have spent with our teams our customers and our partners this past month part of the major appeal of joining f in the first place was its broad array of industryleading products that customers love and its long record of successful execution in both sales and service but i can say that my early insight into fs position is also defined by the technical depth of talent and worldclass operations and systems that i see here i have the luxury of a fresh perspective to see just how deep the passion and loyalty run at f and i say that coming from ciena where the teams focus rivals f in terms of innovation and customer service beyond the companys core assets and its people fs core expertise in application services is a critical differentiator with the speed at which this digital economy runs the number of businesscritical applications and the services they need will only increase this insatiable demand for more applications and more application services bodes very well for f because we stand in front of more applications than any other company in the industry we understand better than anyone how to make those applications perform and how to secure them in the near term i intend to build on the foundation laid during john mcadams tenure as ceo and my immediate priority is maintaining our focus on the plans outlined in last novembers analyst and investor meeting those execution priorities are closely aligned with my own view of trends in customer demands and the opportunities ahead specifically we will continue to expand the breadth of application services including security that we offer our customers and we will accelerate our efforts to make our solutions easily deployable in the combinations our customers choose in the public cloud private cloud colocation facilities and our own cloudbased platform silverline as well as in the data center i want to conclude by thanking the global f team partners and customers for their incredibly warm welcome in my first month on board and in the months to come i look forward to connecting with fs wider analyst and investor community as well as reacquainting myself with those of you with whom i have worked in the past id now like to turn the call over to andy for a review of our second quarter andrew reinland  f networks inc thank you françois with françois new to f my prepared remarks for q are a bit expanded and will flow as follows i will open with highlevel comments on the quarterly results next share a number of q customer wins followed by an update on products for q then i will give more detail on revenue and other selected financial results as is normal and conclude with commentary on new products and functionality being introduced in q combined with our q outlook f delivered revenue of  million in fiscal q reflecting yearoveryear revenue growth of  the majority of this growth came from sales strength in the us highlighted by strong enterprise and service provider sales offset by continued weakness in emea and lowerthanexpected services revenue we were particularly pleased to see product revenue growth accelerate to  yearoveryear in q up from  yearoveryear growth in the prior quarter gaap eps was  per share for the quarter while nongaap earnings per share was  during q we had a number of large wins that helped drive product revenue growth and reflect our continuing focus on opportunities in security and the cloud to cope with the explosive growth of traffic resulting from its unlimited data plans a large us service provider is deploying viprion gi firewalls across mobile switching centers which will support over  million subscribers nationwide viprions superior scalability and highperformance enable the customer to replace its existing firewalls on a smaller footprint at significantly lower cost as part of its cloud edge strategy a top us financial institution needed to provide secure access to thirdparty affiliates such as mortgage companies and credit card processors their decision to deploy viprion in an equinix based colocation facility provided an extensible platform that can be used to lock their thirdparty affiliates to specific applications the viprion solution also enables millisecond response times as they build and access applications in the cloud in emea a large government agency launched a project that includes plans to go digital in every court and tribunal this involves initially moving three key services and later expanding to  to the microsoft azure cloud platform the agency has license virtual additions of ltm afm and asm allowing it to operating applications seamlessly between onprem and the cloud ensuring the same level of security closer to home a large beverage retailer and a silverline ddos customer expanded its silverline services with the new threeyear contract that includes silverlines waf protection as well under the new contract both the ddos and waf services will also be extended to the companys workloads in azure these another major wins during the quarter as well as significant opportunities in the pipeline continue to validate fs ability to deliver products that meet the increasingly varied and complex needs of our customers as they migrate towards hybrid infrastructures contributing to stronger product revenue growth the entire family of new iseries appliances was available for the entire quarter customer response has been positive and we continue to be happy with the uptick of the new platforms which was in line with prior appliance refresh cycles we launched tmos  during q which includes a number of important new features among them enhancements to enterprise and service provider protocols including dns http and tcp and the addition of mqtt support which is specific for iot workloads we also introduced new security features and functions including oauth  identity support and improvements to behavioral ddos bot detection and fingerprinting also included with the launch of the tmos  is the new highperformance gig version of our virtual edition in addition we continue to see steady demand for a gig viprion blade which now includes availability of our vcmp functionality other new security products introduced during the quarter include our new herculon product family which allows our sales force to sell ddos hybrid defender and ssl orchestrator in a standalone form factor or as solutions on bigip and finally we made our waf solution available as a utility offering in the microsoft azure marketplace switching gears to detailed results for the quarter product revenue of  million grew  yearoveryear and represented  of total revenue service revenue of  million also grew  yearoveryear and accounted for  of total revenue revenue from the americas accounted for  of total revenue during the quarter up  from the second quarter of  emea contributed  of revenue up  yearoveryear while apac contributed  of revenue reflecting yearoveryear growth of  and japan at  was down slightly yearoveryear enterprise customers represented  of total sales during the quarter service providers accounted for  and government sales were  including  of total sales from us federal in q we had four greater than  distributors westcon which accounted  of total revenue ingram micro which represented  of total revenue tech data formerly avnet representing  and arrow contributing  our gaap gross margin in q was  our nongaap gross margin was  gaap operating expenses were  million nongaap operating expenses were  million gaap operating margin was  our nongaap operating margin was  and our gaap effective tax rate for q was  our nongaap effective tax rate was  turning to the balance sheet cash flow from operations was  million in q we repurchased  million shares of our common stock at an average price of  for a total of  million we ended the quarter with approximately  billion in cash and investments dso at the end of q was  days inventories were  million capital expenditures for the quarter were  million deferred revenue increased  yearoveryear to  million we ended the quarter with approximately  employees an increase of  from the prior quarter moving on to new products and outlook for q in q we will introduce new products and functionality that further extend our opportunities across onprem public cloud and private cloud architectures first we will introduce our support for bigip in the google public cloud we will also be releasing app connector  which enables our customers to connect the public and private cloud application infrastructures effectively extending their private cloud workloads into the public cloud in addition we will launch a set of technologies that enable microservice environments including our container connector which orchestrates bigips with microservice environments and a new application services proxy which links components within microservice environments and we will release the next version of bigiq which further increases its scalability and will provide our customers with enhanced visibility and analytics as we look to the back half of the year we continue to foresee momentum from the business drivers we outlined at the beginning of the year the continued adoption of our iseries products accelerating sales of software solutions and fs growing relevance in cloud environments all serve as a foundation for continued product revenue growth while we are pleased with the uptick the products introduced in the first half of the year and excited about the opportunities the continuing influx of new products represent we feel that the ongoing uncertainty in emea merits prudence as we approach our outlook for q with this in mind our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal  is  million to  million gaap gross margin is anticipated to be in the  range including approximately  million of stockbased compensation expense and  million in amortization of purchased intangible assets nongaap gross margin is expected to be at or around  we anticipate gaap operating expenses in the range of  million to  million this includes approximately  million of stockbased compensation expense and  million in amortization of purchased intangible assets for q we are forecasting a gaap effective tax rate of  and a nongaap effective tax rate of  our gaap eps target is  to  per share our nongaap eps target is  to  per share we plan to increase our head count by up to  employees in the current quarter and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around  million we would like to thank the entire f team our partners and customers for their support last quarter and with that well now hand the call over for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you speakers participants we will now begin the questionandanswer session speakers our first question will come from the line ittai kidron of oppenheimer your line is open ittai kidron  oppenheimer  co inc thanks and françois and jason good luck to you on your new roles andy i guess youre going to be the speaker for tonight maybe we can dive a little bit into whats going on in europe and on the weakness that youre seeing there first of all is there a way for you to kind of quantify to us how much you missed over there im just trying to gauge if your report have been fine where do you think you would have landed relative to your original guide and then is there any color you can give about that weakness whether it be enterprise service provider adc security north europe south europe uk fxdriven competitivedriven anything that you can give would be greatly appreciated andrew reinland  f networks inc yeah yeah so two things id highlight there related to guide id be reluctant to quantify but emea combined with the shortfall that we saw on services which – we had talked last quarter about services continuing to decline but then through the year wed see it shallow out and then start to grow again it ended up dropping a little more than we anticipated and that was us just misreading the tea leaves on some endoflife products so to get that out there coming back to emea the combination of those two yeah they wouldve had impact on the number we think so thats why were highlighting it and it has our focus and then in terms of what were seeing there john did you want to john d dilullo  f networks inc well this is john dilullo so we have a very experienced team there and i think theyre doing well but were definitely seeing a few delays in a couple of areas i think some of that is connected to some macro conditions people are trying to understand exactly what it means what brexit means from a data residency perspective and then also some of the new data protection regulations that are coming out and i think thats pausing things for us and thats whats causing a bit of the delay there in order flow and we have a couple of execution problems too that were working through weve put some new leadership in the uk and in germany and were doing a lot more to map the teams to some of the public cloud growth opportunities out there and also doing a lot more training but i think were making progress ittai kidron  oppenheimer  co inc okay andy just a followup on that on your outlook youve mentioned it conservative just given the issues that youre seeing can you give us a little bit more color about your working assumptions into europe specifically for the next quarter or are you assuming no improvement whatsoever in the region how do we think about your level of conservatism with regards to that region andrew reinland  f networks inc yeah im not sure conservatism is the word id use on this because i think weve been talking with the sales organization evaluating the pipeline looking at the business weve highlighted this for a number of quarters now this really isnt a new dynamic for us and i think taking it all in collectively we looked at the picture that we thought we could expect from the business at this time and factored that into the guidance and thats resulted in the guidance we gave you today ittai kidron  oppenheimer  co inc very good good luck guys operator our next question will come from the line of jess lubert of wells fargo securities your line is open jess lubert  wells fargo securities llc hi guys thanks for taking my question and françois welcome to the team couple questions maybe just first can you talk about linearity in the quarter average deal sizes and the percentage of revenue from new appliances and then in past product cycles weve typically seen a fairly healthy acceleration in product growth in the quarters following the big initial launch so i was hoping to understand if you think well see a similar trajectory in the second half of this year andrew reinland  f networks inc yeah jess and you might have to help me if i miss one of your questions but i think you started with linearity and actually early in the quarter we felt pretty good about our start in january as we got through the first month we felt pretty good about it and then started to see it taper off it was similar to the prior quarter in that middle month kind of pull back and then landed okay i would put it and then to your question on our product refresh one thing we talk about a lot is the uptake in the product refresh and i think at times we dont draw the conclusion we want you to draw when we make these comments because we talk about – in the first full quarter we want to see roughly  and we see that increasing over four quarters to  and so when does that really kick in for us is a driver and if we look back historically really its when we start to get into the higher percentages of the sales being represented by those new appliances that we really see the full driver so we did feel we saw some good wins this quarter and it did impact the product revenue growth that we saw but we think were going to see that get through q and start to build after that jess lubert  wells fargo securities llc and then average deal size and i guess would love it if you could touch on just kind of how the public cloud is playing into the results youre seeing and what gives you confidence the public cloud can be an opportunity and isnt the cause of some of the weakness youre seeing here andrew reinland  f networks inc yeah so on the average deal size i think last quarter we were at right around  this quarter it moved up a little bit  so one of the things that is giving us confidence is seeing the average deal size move up a little bit but our  million plus size deals were actually pretty strong across the rest of the world and when we evaluate our business thats an important metric for that and then for cloud john d dilullo  f networks inc yeah on the public cloud jess i think what were seeing is that customers are at varying stages of their cloud adoption strategy where when customers havent made their decision on public cloud migrations or really their architectural decisions and theyre a little bit hesitant thats not as good for us when they have made their decisions and they are actually embarking on a cloud strategy then were seeing multiple catalysts for us in fact weve done some analysis around that and were seeing that those customers who have moved to the public cloud that were f customers before actually tend to spend more with us once theyve made those moves so thats kind of a catalyst for us silverline is a catalyst for us as our own proposition in the cloud so were seeing sort of multiple catalysts emerge but really for us its really good when customers have made their architectural decision and they actually have moved to the cloud thats when things accelerate for us jess lubert  wells fargo securities llc thanks guys operator our next question will come from the line of jeffrey kvaal of nomura instinet your line is open jeffrey thomas kvaal  nomura  instinet thank you very much françois let me add my voice to those congratulating you on the seat i know that the people on ciena certainly miss you and jason i am looking forward to working with you as well let me begin maybe andy by digging into your commentary on the product refresh being in line with the prior one the prior one was a little bit more diffused in terms of its timeliness this is a little tighter and yet the product revenue was still able to get up to about  growth yearoveryear for a few quarters is that the kind of inline that you were referencing or if you could put some more color around that id appreciate it andrew reinland  f networks inc yeah specifically my inline was the uptick of the appliances in sales so not necessarily the – i dont know that i can verify your  i mean it definitely did when it got to full steam drive very solid revenue growth and so when we look at it internally we look at the uptick and start to watch when it gets – were in the second quarter its in line in terms of percent with what weve seen previously your comments very fair it was more elongated before so were trying to factor that in and then looking at how its going to drive product and as i said we have our guidance and we think well see that really start to kick in as we exit q jeffrey thomas kvaal  nomura  instinet okay so would it be fair to say then it will be the june and september quarters where you should see the peak yearoveryear of comparables and that should be materially higher than where we are today andrew reinland  f networks inc yeah well you have our guidance for june right so im going to let that stand as it is then i think as we go into q which is our calendar q has its own dynamics and i think well see it play in there and then really as we expand out  months to  months and if you look historically thats when weve seen it be a real strong driver jeffrey thomas kvaal  nomura  instinet okay and then lastly the gross margin obviously very good again are you seeing any reasons why that would drift up given the rising mix of software andrew reinland  f networks inc yeah we always talk about that as software becomes more prominent in our business that naturally is going to carry up to gross margin historically weve looked look at that as an opportunity to derive top line growth probably the most prominent example recently is investments in silverline and i think well continue to do that and balance that tradeoff of investment against higher gross margin jeffrey thomas kvaal  nomura  instinet thank you very much talk soon andrew reinland  f networks inc thanks okay operator our next question will come from the line of jayson noland of baird your line is open jayson a noland  robert w baird  co inc okay great thank you françois i wanted to start with you and ask your initial thoughts i know you havent been in the seat long but maybe if you could add some color and then any adjustments you see necessary to make here regarding areas of focus i heard you mentioned security in your prepared remarks françois locohdonou  f networks inc yes thank you jayson well sort of early observations as i said it in my prepared remarks really really excited to be here and i thought before joining and even more now that f has a very significant opportunity and has a big platform for growth largely because of this insatiable demand for applications and that sort of application networking talent here and understanding around what it takes to make applications perform better go faster be more secure that talent and that understanding is unparalleled and so really for us the focus and the things that i want to make sure we execute on is making sure we remain in the critical path of applications wherever they are private cloud public cloud data centers and the company has already started executing on that but theres a ton of things that we can do to even expand the number of applications that we support as an example of that just yesterday we were meeting with one of our large fortune  customers they have over  applications and were only sitting and supporting a fraction of those applications and as they move to both their private cloud and some public cloud implementation weve got an opportunity to expand the number of applications that we support for that customer and so im really excited about that opportunity and then the other access of potential growth for us is expanding the number of application services that we offer security is one of them and weve already made a lot of headway in adding security capabilities to the adc but there are other things that we can do and so i see those two areas are important vectors for the company and the priority right now is to make sure that we execute on these vectors jayson a noland  robert w baird  co inc okay thank you and maybe a followup for andy youve mentioned  million run rate in software as an expectation exiting  is there upside or downside to that or are right on track andrew reinland  f networks inc i think were right on track jayson a noland  robert w baird  co inc okay ill leave it there thanks operator our next question will come from the line of simon leopold of raymond james your line is open simon m leopold  raymond james  associates inc great thank you very much given that the moving parts here – and by the way françois and jason both welcome as well let me extend that to you two i imagine youll hear this over and over again but wanted to see if you could talk about the past historical seasonal patterns for the company in that youve previously indicated operating margin in the second half of the year tend to move back towards the high range versus sort of mids in the first half of the year wondering if youre comfortable reiterating that perspective at this point even if youre not guiding for the balance of the year on revenue andrew reinland  f networks inc yeah i think specifically what we say and this on the october call is we gave general guidelines of guidance and we have said pretty consistently over the last three or four years that we expect op margin with seasonality to pull back in q and q because its important for us to not slow the machine down on our investing and head count to try to overly – ill use the term overly manage op margin and then on strength of revenue see that increase in the back half so i believe that plays out on revenue strength again and you have our guidance as i said for q and then well give guidance for q and see where that takes us simon m leopold  raymond james  associates inc great and then in terms of a product trends im looking for some indication of how to think about the herculon family i know its new and youre just coming come into market but what kind of expectations do you have in terms of contributions and i think part of the thing im struggling with is with security youre entering a market thats relatively mature with lots of competitors and historically its been difficult i think for f to sort of break out from the adc market and you certainly have had security features within your platforms but now you have the security appliance id like to see if you can help us level set basically get a good expectation of how much contribution we should expect from specifically herculon products maybe one year out how should we think about that as a contribution thank you françois locohdonou  f networks inc thank you simon its françois here so youre correct in that we have made some enhancements to the adc platform that include a number of security offerings if you look at our overall revenue growth we had actually very strong growth lets say north of doubledigit yearonyear growth in the security space overall in our portfolio in the second quarter and thats primarily driven by security addons that weve put on top of the adc platform the herculon product is just out in the market now its really early days so we dont expect it to have really meaningful contribution for several quarters and youre right it is effectively our first family of purposebuilt platform for security and so theres an element of learning in the market that were going through over the next few quarters but we also believe that it addresses an important pain point and a growing pain point for a number of our customers so longer term we actually think we have a very compelling proposition and that theres going to be strong demand for the platform its really early days for us to quantify the contribution it will make to the business overall simon m leopold  raymond james  associates inc great thank you good luck with it operator our next question will come from the line of jim suva of citi your line is open jim suva  citigroup global markets inc thank you very much you mentioned some challenges in europe ranging all the way from brexit to regulations and all the type of things can you help us understand is there going to be the need to change your gotomarket strategy your sales force realign things do you feel you got the right efforts in place and is the majority of the shortfall in europe under your control or are you saying its more regulatory brexit uncertainty thats going on there thank you john d dilullo  f networks inc yeah jim its john dilullo so i think its definitely under control and some of these macro issues feel more like pauses rather than systemic issues the team that we have there is a very experienced team that was setting records just four five quarters ago so we think its a temporary collection of macro elements that we need to work through jim suva  citigroup global markets inc and then the resolution time you think will be when françois locohdonou  f networks inc so this is françois here well on the macro issues yeah i think its several months because as you know these macro issues theres both issues around data residency and sort of regulation thats being passed in europe there has also been macro issues around the political environment and as you know were going through specifically in continental europe a number of elections and a number of large projects frankly have been delayed because the uncertainty surrounding these elections is probably greater than its ever been in continental europe so that i think kind of works itself through as we get the results of these elections and the political uncertainty goes away in terms of the things that we control which are more around the sort of realignment of our resources with the right opportunities as john was saying we have some things in motion already but you probably know this and i know this with experience having spent a lot of time in europe that these issues take a long time to fix because theyre not – moving resources in europe isnt as simple and straightforward as it might be here in the united states andrew reinland  f networks inc and this is andy just one thing to add that were not seeing – and i think its important to highlight and was within johns comments was the competitive landscape there for us hasnt changed and obviously with the comments were putting out here just around the theater i mean we spend a lot of time talking with sales management making sure we understand whats going on and the one area that we came away feeling good about is competitively we feel as strong as ever and thats why john was highlighting that we saw deals pushing not deals losing and we think thats important to highlight so we are readdressing everything from the structure and how were aligning resources and the view of the market coming through in our guidance but i think thats worth highlighting on a positive note jim suva  citigroup global markets inc thank you so much for the details operator our next question will come from the line mark moskowitz of barclays your line is open mark moskowitz  barclays capital inc yes thanks good afternoon just trying to get a sense here if we can kind of try to figure out what the extrapolation is with the guidance and it kind of implies pretty much singledigit product revenue growth already so soon here with this product cycle does that mean were going to actually potentially see you guys decline next year from a product revenue perspective or are we missing something and then i just wanted to see if you could talk a little more about market share momentum and your confidence just given that amazon aws keeps taking share in pretty short order here if that continues how can you still grow longer term andrew reinland  f networks inc yeah yeah so ill take the first part of that question which is our view on growth and product and yes if you back into our guidance with what we give you that might look like its pulling back a little bit but broadly we think were going to be pushing hard on the top line and we think we have every opportunity with the drivers we have in place were talking about the shuttle series and a lot of the other products our viewpoint is not that i wouldnt comment on next year up or down but we believe were a growth company at our scale what does that mean well see we provide guidance quarterly but thats our number one priority to push the top line and were going to focus on execution and work to make that happen françois locohdonou  f networks inc and mark as it relates to aws were confident we can continue to grow over time and actually maintain or grow share if you look at the dynamics in the marketplace the overall adc market is growing the hardware adc market is probably flat to down whilst the virtual adc market is growing fairly rapidly within the growth of the virtual adc market there are use cases that potentially are best addressed by a simple implementation with the aws solution so if a small enterprise has a single use case that doesnt require a lot of application services but just simple load balancing then thats a scenario where theres a good fit for a waftype solution but there are a large number of use cases in the virtual adc space that are well addressed by our virtual edition and were seeing actually very significant revenue growth on our virtual edition and generally in software as a percentage of our revenues in general so were pretty confident that with what weve done and a number of the things we talked about today in terms of our road map that were going to continue to see growth in our virtual edition included in a number of use cases in the public and private cloud so were pretty confident that we address a large number of use cases and we can continue to grow jason willey  f networks inc take the next question please operator our next question will come from the line of george notter of jefferies your line is open george c notter  jefferies llc hey guys thanks very much i guess i wanted to ask a question to françois obviously youre new to the company youre taking a fresh look at the business i guess im wondering if there is any thoughts of looking at the capital allocation strategy of the company any new views on ma anything you could talk to on that front would be great thanks françois locohdonou  f networks inc thanks george and hi so let me start with capital allocation look i think i will start by saying that we see a great opportunity for f as a platform for growth and therefore were going to manage the business for longterm growth and as we do that that may or may not require a change in how we allocate capital going forward at this stage its too early to say whether that may or may not be the case but for the shortterm there isnt going to be a change in our capital allocation model that – i can say that definitively when it comes to ma george as you know i come from experience with an organization that has been quite acquisitive over the years and from my experience ma actually can be very effective for growth in the technology space and a number of these opportunities can help a company a lot but they can also go very wrong under the right circumstances so for me it is going to be all about discipline in the case of ma really being disciplined about our build versus buy choices really understanding why in some cases certain assets may be more valuable inside of f than outside of f and making sure that we have the right expertise in the company both to assess these opportunities and to make them successful if and when we pull the trigger on some acquisitions george c notter  jefferies llc thank you operator our next question will come from the line of alex henderson of needham your line is open alex henderson  needham  co llc sneaking under the wire so i was hoping we could get an angle on your expectation for verizons optical transport business in the core optical market for metro françois locohdonou  f networks inc no comment alex alex henderson  needham  co llc okay so since we cant do that and as an alternative i was hoping you could give us a little bit more granularity on what your revenue expectations are for the growth rate in softwareonly and the growth rate in public cloudonly as well as in securityonly and if software is increasing as a percentage of sales should we be expecting that to have a positive implication for the longer term gross margins because i assume that thats a highermargin product thanks andrew reinland  f networks inc yeah i think generally we look at the broader trends that were seeing across software security françois highlighted that our security had strong growth yearoveryear continue to expect that from software were not going to guide it specifically but the trends are there and we like what were seeing and as it relates to gross margin we talked about it a little bit earlier yeah it could push up gross margin were not guiding that we talk a lot about reinvesting that back in the business and well continue to evaluate that on a quarterly basis as we see the opportunity present itself to us but broadly the trends are there going in the right direction and we like where we sit alex henderson  needham  co llc could you give us any more color on the rates of growth as opposed to yes its nice i mean thats a pretty anemic way of describing the numbers relative to what you could provide françois locohdonou  f networks inc well alex i think we can say that the three areas that youve mentioned security softwarevirtual additions and public cloud are all growing faster than our overall revenues in this case of security i did mention earlier that we saw very strong doubledigit growth in the quarter in the case of the public cloud i think weve said before it is actually growing even faster than security but from a very small base to start with but i actually have some color for you alex having been here just a few weeks one of the areas of surprise for me was – a pleasant surprise – was to see how much we as a company are already doing in the public cloud on the various models perpetual licenses subscription also the number of customers buying our virtual edition by the drink  as a utility by the hour and the number of hours were billing in the public cloud is growing extremely rapidly so these are all areas of growth with – right now some more meaningful than others id say probably of these three overall software as you know as a percentage of our business is pretty large so thats a meaningful contribution public cloud isnt yet a meaningful contribution and security is growing and kind of in between those two alex henderson  needham  co llc okay thank you jason willey  f networks inc robert i think well take one more question operator thank you our next question will come from the line of simona jankowski of goldman sachs your line is open simona k jankowski  goldman sachs  co thank you very much and francois my congratulations to you as well andy i was hoping you can expand on the weakness you saw in services i was a little surprised to see it flat sequentially and looking back you guys have never had a flat sequential quarter in services before and when we chatted at a conference in midfebruary i think you were still seeing at that point consistent attach rates and renewals so maybe just give us a little more detail on what happened with the endoflife products that you were referencing there and how we should think about that going forward andrew reinland  f networks inc yeah and actually the way to look at this is were modeling it is sequentially it was basically flat up  million we think off of this new base we start to go to more normal growth rates again and really the driver to that is we did end of life a number of older boxes i think they averaged over  years old and they did have strong attach rates to them still renewal rates the impact of it frankly i just – i missed the modeling on it and the impact was bigger than i anticipated so thats where we ended up simona k jankowski  goldman sachs  co so maybe just to be clear on that because i think youve said before that youve got something like  units in the installed base that are over  years so of these over yearold endoflife products are there any additional ones that might stop maintenance in the coming quarters and has that now been factored into the expectation that this is the bottom andrew reinland  f networks inc yeah i dont think were going to see anything in the shortterm and wed advise you of that i would highlight surrounding this discussion that our deferred revenue was pretty strong in the quarter so we saw that go up  and the majority of that is annual maintenance so i would look at that too to balance the expectations but as i said when we started we now think off of this new base its a bit of reset but were going to start sequentially growing again at least in rough dollar basis consistent with what youve seen in the past simona k jankowski  goldman sachs  co okay thats very helpful and then just a quick one i might have missed it but did you say what percent software was as a percent of total revenue this quarter andrew reinland  f networks inc no we didnt break that out no simona k jankowski  goldman sachs  co okay all right thank you very much appreciate it françois locohdonou  f networks inc thanks simona andrew reinland  f networks inc yes thank you jason willey  f networks inc all right thank you wed like to thank everyone for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again in three months have a good rest of your day françois locohdonou  f networks inc
