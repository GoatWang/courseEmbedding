team faq contact us you are here home  about biolargo inc  biolargo story biolargo story the beginning kenneth reay code the ‘inventor’ entrusted with the biolargo technology began this journey of ours over  years ago when his father had a severe stroke and was left severely impaired bed ridden or wheel chair confined and in need of longterm convalescent care out of concern for his father’s great risk of secondary infection ken set out to find a way to extend his father’s life expectancy and improve his quality of life by reducing his risk of contracting disease and by reducing compounding risks of secondary infections that are so common in longterm care facilities through his scientific trials of blending low dose inorganic chemical compounds and absorbent materials he made what may just be called a “genuine discovery” when the biolargo technology is incorporated into products many of which are already widely known and in use those products become an effective tool in stopping the transmission of life threatening disease “all we had to do was figure out how to apply these naturally occurring compounds to products so they could do what they were created to do and put them to use out in the field where disease is most prevalent” – kenneth reay code kenneth reay code performs quality assurance the company has expanded the original technology to now include long list product designs and delivery systems keeping the original mission intact to “make life better” the company has a broad base of science and technology to impact our water – air – food – plants – animals – people making them clean safe  healthy biolargo technology disclaimer the products in which the biolargo technology can be used include both regulated and unregulated uses and applications

claims what is claimed is  an absorbent composition comprising a carrier substrate a hydrophillic resin in the carrier substrate a mixture of chemicals within the carrier substrate that are capable of generating iodine when exposed to water the mixture of chemicals including potassium iodine and cupric sulfate  the absorbent composition as defined in claim  wherein the mixture of chemicals includes potassium iodine and anhydrous cupric sulfate in a stoichiometric mixture of two parts potassium iodine for every one part anhydrous cupric sulfate  the absorbent composition as defined in claim  wherein the hydrophillic resin is polyacrylate  the absorbent composition as defined in claim  wherein the carrier substrate is a fabric sack  the absorbent composition as defined in claim  wherein the carrier substrate is a mass of fibres  the absorbent composition as defined in claim  wherein the mass of fibres are cellulose  the absorbent composition as defined in claim  wherein the mass of fibres include peat moss  the absorbent composition as defined in claim  wherein the carrier substrate is a foam cake description field of the inventionthe present invention relates to an absorbent composition and in particular an absorbent composition used in the transport of specimens of bodily fluids background of the invention an analysis of specimens of bodily fluids is extensively used in modern medicine as a diagnostic tool hundreds of thousands of such specimens are forwarded by air or ground transport for analysis every week a portion of these specimens contain highly infectious diseases and as such present a potential hazard to those persons handling the specimens during transport should a transport worker become infected there is a danger that the workers family and other members of the public with whom the transport worker is in communication will also become infected in recognition of the potential danger presented to the public the member nations of the international civil aviation organization icao have adopted packaging instructions for the transportation of medical biological and veterinary specimens the packaging instructions require the use of a leak proof secondary container the secondary container must have sufficient quantities of an absorbent composition to absorb the entire contents of the specimen container should a leak occur although the packaging described provides a measure of protection the use of an absorbent composition will not prevent diseases from becoming airborne in such cases the health of the laboratory worker is placed at risk when the secondary container is opened the health of the transport worker is similarly exposed to airborne diseases should the integrity of the secondary container become compromised summary of the invention what is required is an improved form of absorbent composition that will reduce or eliminate the danger presented by airborne diseases according to the present invention there is provided an absorbent composition which includes an absorbent and a mixture of chemicals with the absorbent that are capable of generating an antiseptic when exposed to water when the above described absorbent composition is used any leakage results in an antiseptic being generated to kill any organisms in the bodily fluids although beneficial results may be obtained through the use of various absorbents even more beneficial results may be obtained when the absorbent used is a hydrophillic resin hydrophillic resins are among the most efficient known absorbents although beneficial results may be obtained by generating various alternative antiseptics even more beneficial results may be obtained when the antiseptic generated is iodine iodine is commonly used in hospital topical antisepsis it is also used in the production of dyes the generation of iodine will cause discolouration within the secondary container leaving an unmistakable visual indication that leakage has occurred although beneficial results may be obtained through the use of the absorbent composition as described above even more beneficial results may be obtained in terms of adapting the absorbent composition to a wider range of uses when the absorbent and the mixture of chemicals are within a carrier substrate there are a variety of carrier substrates which can be used such as a fabric a powder a gel a mass of fibres or a foam cake brief description of the drawings these and other features of the invention will become more apparent from the following description in which reference is made to the appended drawings wherein fig a is a top plan view of an absorbent composition in accordance with the teachings of the present invention in a fabric sack carrier substrate fig b is a side

invention in a mass of fibre carrier substrate fig a is a side elevation view in section of an absorbent composition in accordance with the teachings of the present invention in a foam cake carrier substrate fig b is a top plan view of the absorbent composition illustrated in fig a detailed description of the preferred embodiment the preferred embodiment an absorbent composition will now be described with reference to figs a through b referring to figs a through b each of the illustrated embodiments includes an absorbent  together with a mixture of chemicals  with absorbent  that are capable of generating an antiseptic when exposed to water the various embodiments illustrated in figs a and b used different carrier substrates  in each case absorbent  has been selected to be compatible with the particular one of carrier substrates  used carrier substrates  are not essential but do broaden the range of uses for the absorbent composition the preferred form of absorbent  is a hydrophillic resin due to its relatively compact size and its superior absorbent capabilities this form of absorbent is not suited however for use with all carrier substrates  the preferred form of antiseptic is iodine the properties of iodine as an antiseptic are well known and it is already in wide spread use in hospital laboratories and the like iodine has an additional desirable property in that it leaves a dye marker as a visual indication that leakage has occurred chemicals  include potassium iodine and anhydrous cupric sulfate these chemicals are present in a stoichiometric mixture of two parts potassium iodine for every one part anhydrous cupric sulfate when chemicals  are exposed to water they generate iodine the chemical formula relating to the reaction that occurs to generate iodine is kicusoh ocuik so i arrowup boldh o referring to figs a and b in this first embodiment  carrier substrate  is a fabric sack and absorbent  is a polyacrylate hydrophillic resin this form of carrier substrate is suitable for use as a companion enclosure in secondary containers specified for the transportation or storage of medical and diagnostic specimens beneficial results have been obtained through the use of porous papers teabags synthetic fabrics and water soluble films which could be bonded or sewn together referring to fig  in this second embodiment  carrier substrate  a fabric impregnated absorbent  and absorbent  is a powder form sodium alginate beneficial results have been obtained through the use of polyester fiberfills of several densities and quiltings the polyester was selected in view of its dryness availability and absorbent characteristics in tests it was determined that blood would traverse a significant distance before clotting this form of carrier substrate is suitable for use in wrapping or taping containers on their exterior this provides an absorptive and cushioning surface referring to figs a and b in this third embodiment  carrier substrate  is an inert powder contained within a shaker  mixed with absorbent  also in powder form the absorbent powder is sodium alginate the ingredients are mixed pulverized and passed through a screen to ensure relatively uniform sizes of granules this form of carrier substrate is suitable for use as a spill responsive surface absorber it can also be used as a doping agent for the polyester fabric described above referring to figs a and b in this fourth embodiment  carrier substrate  is a gel into which absorbent  is mixed the absorbent is a polyacrylate hydrophillic resin the gel itself is compounded as a supersaturation of gelling agent it is supplied in film pouches including reactive constituents of the antiinfective generator this form of carrier substrate is suitable for use in transporting frozen specimens the thawing of the gel delays the thawing of the specimen with radioactive specimens the gel may contain radioopacifyers it should be noted however that the addition of heavy metal polyvalent ions makes necessary a significant increase in gelling agent in order to produce the gel referring to fig  in this fifth embodiment  carrier substrate  is a dissolvable gel capsule having absorbent  a granular preparation of the absorbent composition is placed in a water soluble gelatin package in capsular or cubical form the preferred powder absorbent is sodium alginate this form of carrier substrate is suitable for use as a companion enclosure to secondary containers specified for the transportation or storage of medical and diagnostic specimens referring to fig  in this sixth embodiment  carrier substrate  is a mass of cellulose fibres intermixed with peat moss  containing absorbent  the form of absorbent  is sodium alginate this form of carrier substrate is suitable for use as stuff packing or loose fill peat moss  must be subjected to significant prior oven drying in order to render it suitable for use referring to figs a and b in this seventh embodiment  carrier substrate  is a foam cake containing absorbent  beneficial results have been obtained through the use of polyurethane or extruded polystyrene products polyurethane is preferred due to its low moisture content the best mode of retaining the constituents in preactive form is by making foams by lyophilization of gels in toluene and freezedrying the foam cakes are then tumbled in an absorbent of powder form sodium alginate this form of carrier substrate is suitable for use as a molded foam carrier or as a cushioning device for a container the following cautionary note is included
