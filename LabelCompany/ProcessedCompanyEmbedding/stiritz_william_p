reuters brendan mcdermid correction an earlier version of this post identified william stiritz as the ceo of post holdings stiritz stepped down as ceo on november   to become executive chairman of the company barbariancapital was the first to point it out william bill stiritz — herbalifes largest shareholder — has gotten absolutely annihilated on his stake in the nutritional company according to our estimates he has lost about  million on his investment so far  stiritz is the former ceo of the food company post holdings herbalife — a multilevel marketing firm that sells nutrition products like weightloss shakes and vitamins— has been at the center of a hedge fund war for over two years activist investor bill ackman the ceo of pershing square capital publicly announced in december  that he was shorting the company to  ackmans thesis is that the company operates as a pyramid scheme that targets poor people he believes regulators specifically the federal trade commission will shut the company down the ftc opened an investigation in march   after ackman made his short public numerous hedge fund managers most notably carl icahn piled on by going long the stock in the months following ackmans initial presentation share of herbalife skyrocketed and ackman rocked up millions in paper losses  ackman is now back in the money on his position as the stock has declined in recent months and those who were long are feeling the pain  stiritz  has racked up hundreds of millions in paper losses according to our calculations  on sept   stiritz disclosed a huge long herbalife position at the time stiritz owned  shares or a  stake we estimated then that stiritzs herbalife stake was worth about  million the stock closed at  the day he disclosed that position on nov   when herbalife was at  and again on jan   when herbalife was at  stiritz added to his position he most recently held  shares or an  stake data compiled by bloomberg shows  since stiritz first reported the position shares of herbalife have slumped more than  the stock was trading down  on tuesday morning at  per share using the closing price of the days on which stiritz disclosed his stakes we calculate that he has lost an estimated  million on his herbalife investment so far the secondlargest shareholder is herbalifes ceo michael johnson and he owns just over  million shares  we dont know stiritzs personal net worth hes not mentioned on the billionaire lists from either forbes or bloomberg   stiritz is post holdings largest individual shareholder with approximately  shares bloomberg data shows his post
