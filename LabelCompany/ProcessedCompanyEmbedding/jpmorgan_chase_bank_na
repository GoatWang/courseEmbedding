the origin of this strand of jpmorgan chases history runs as follows at the turn of the nineteenth century obtaining a bank charter required an act of the state legislature this of course injected a powerful element of politics into the process and invited what today would be called corruption but then was regarded as business as usual hamiltons political enemy—and eventual murderer—aaron burr was able to create a bank by sneaking a clause into a charter for a company called the manhattan company to provide clean water to new york city the innocuouslooking clause allowed the company to invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise within six months of the companys creation and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe the company opened a bank the bank of the

of an empire of wealth by john steele gordon the origin of this strand of jpmorgan chases history runs as follows at the turn of the nineteenth century obtaining a bank charter required an act of the state legislature this of course injected a powerful element of politics into the process and invited what today would be called corruption but then was regarded as business as usual hamiltons political enemy—and eventual murderer—aaron burr was able to create a bank by sneaking a clause into a charter for a company called the manhattan company to provide clean water to new york city the innocuouslooking clause allowed the company to invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise within six months of the companys creation and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe the company opened a bank the bank of the manhattan company still in existence it is today j p morgan chase the largest bank in the united states led by david rockefeller during the s and s chase

to chase national bank and its subagents these facts were discovered when the fbi began its investigation in october  the purpose of the investigation was to follow germanamericans who had bought the marks however chase national bank’s executives were never federally prosecuted because chases lead attorney threatened to reveal fbi army and navy sources and methods in court publicly naming the

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
