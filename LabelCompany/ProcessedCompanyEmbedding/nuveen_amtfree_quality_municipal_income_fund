quality still shinesjul  about nuveen amtfree nea maks financial services registered investment advisor portfolio strategy reits mutual fundsmaks financial servicessummarya general update of nuveen amtfree quality muni income fund since our initial articledetailed discussion of portfolio changes over the last  monthsdetailed look of the various performance metrics including price total return and net asset value returnsover the last few articles we have looked at and updated a number of closed end fixed income funds articles one of the funds that we mentioned as a comparison for the blackrock municipal income fund mui is the nuveen amtfree quality municipal income fund nea unlike mui and the other cefs which we recently looked at and updated i have not done an indepth initial look at nea i have however talked about it at some length in my article ho ho ho mary brexit cefs on sale in this article i wanted to do both an update since june  and a more indepth look on this fund whats new over the last  months the federal reserve has raised interested rates and the economy has kept on sputtering along in the search for yield many closed end funds have had their discounts eliminated or even turned into premiums the one area of closed end fund investing that has not fared well however is municipal bond funds while some funds have managed to hang on others have been greatly impacted where has the nuveen amt free quality income fund ended up did quality help or merely preaching to the choir lets take a look fund updates at the time of our initial article  nea yielded an income only distribution of  and was trading at a discount of  to its net asset value today nea yields  and is trading at a discount of  source cef connect looking at the asset allocation that we can see the majority of the funds are fully invested with a small percentage in cash and cash equivalents source cef connect looking at the top  we can see a variety of funds representing the country with a large number of bonds seemingly being revenue backed bonds source nuveen cef website as more and more investors are getting concerned with the underling states credits we can see that il represents  of the portfolio and should be taken under advisement source nuveen cef website fortunately we can look at the top sectors of the fund and see that only about  of the portfolio is general obligation funds and the majority of the bonds are backed by revenues or guaranteed by the us government source nuveen cef website taking a deeper look at the maturities in the fund we can see that more than  of the funds bond mature more than  years from today there is about  of the fund that matures in  years or less source nuveen cef website the other aspect we can look at is the call exposure of the underlying portfolio even though more than  of the portfolio is  years out more than  of the portfolios bonds may be called in the next  years or sooner while not likely if interest rates fall municipalities may be in a position to refinance their debts source nuveen cef website looking at the underlying quality we can see that more than  of the portfolio is rated a or better only  of the portfolio is unrated even still unrated does not mean poor credit merely that the bond issue may be too small to rate economically source nuveen cef website looking at the portfolio broadly we can see that it is well diversified with over  holdings and true to the name none of the holdings are subject to amt tax high income earners will appreciate this further as per nuveen data we can see the average maturity is at  years more important to note i believe is the average effective duration of  years applying and adjusting for leverage we get an average duration of  years what this means is that if we have another  rise in interest rates the underlying portfolios nav should decline about  or  adjusted for the portfolios leverage source nuveen cef website performance update since our last article on june th  the funds share price has fallen  right in line with the duration numbers the total return however is only a loss of  once you account for the distribution the interesting note here is the underlying nav is only down  nea data by ycharts next we can take a look at the fund compared to the broader fixed income etfs and some muni closed end funds below is a chart looking at the total returns for the same time frame for a number of such investments first is the ishares national muni etf mub we further include the ishares core us agg bond index etf agg to look at the fund in relation to other municipal closed end funds we look at the vaneck vectors cef muni income etf xmpt and two of the larger muni funds the blackrock municipal quality cef myi and the eaton vance municipal bond cef eim nea total return price data by ycharts as we can clearly see the two broad unlevered etfs have been the least volatile and ending the time period down  and  the nuveen fund does seem to hold up to the quality name and ended the examined time period down  this is compared to a loss of  for the vaneck muni cef etf a loss of  for the blackrock fund and an outsized  loss for the eaton vance muni bond cef bottom line overall even though municipal closed end funds were hurt nea has held up quite well more importantly looking ahead i would be comfortable holding this fund particularly against funds such as the blackrock municipal bond cef mui which we discussed in our last article as nea has far less general obligation risk and less exposed to questionable credits such as il and nj going forward nea is going to be on my short list for cef investments to replace other funds that are sold due to todays lack of discounts or those trading at premiums i hope this update is helpful until the next update keep doing your due diligence for more information on the fund please take a look at my previous article ho ho ho merry brexit cefs on sale

versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible lowerquality debt securities generally offer higher yields but also involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be
