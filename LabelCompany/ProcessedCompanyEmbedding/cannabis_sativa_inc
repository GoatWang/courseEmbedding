tommy chong’s brand chong’s choice which sells a line of prerolled marijuana cigarettes has applied for a trademark for vaporizers and “tobacco” jarsaltai a brand of cannabis chocolates is seeking trademark protection for its name brand as a provider of information about medical cannabismary shapiro a san francisco attorney said the goal is to get something federally trademarked — and the more closely related to marijuana the better she is working with salinas firm indus holdings altai’s parent company on its trademark applicationonce a company has even applied to register a trademark it’s noted in a federal database when companies set out to submit trademark applications of their own they search that database to see if their brand name is already in use — and if so how it’s being usedthe goal of trademark law is to prevent consumer confusion and different companies can use the same name for products as long as their products are in different categories and wouldn’t cause confusionthe patent and trademark office would likely reject a trademark application for a soap brand with a name similar to unilever’s dove but it didn’t stop candy company mars from trademarking dovebrand chocolatethe same rules apply in the cannabis industry but it’s tricky unilever can make clear in its trademark application that dove makes soap which lets other companies know they shouldn’t try applying for a similar trademark for soaprelated productscannabis companies however have to be more circumspect hoping that a trademark for rolling papers or providing cannabis information will be enough of a hint that a company has laid claim to a cannabisrelated trademark“it raises a red flag that there’s a company already operating in the space” shapiro said “basically its a warning sign that someone else has claimed rights to the name in connection to cannabis”along with scaring off potential competitors there’s another potential benefit if the patent and trademark office were to start approving trademarks for cannabis products companies with cannabisrelated marks could be first in linegoing back to that notion of preventing confusion trademark protection can apply not only to products a company makes now but to products that a company might reasonably be expected to make later on — what trademark lawyers call the zone of natural expansioneven before unilever started making dovebrand shampoo it would have been hard for another firm to trademark that name as consumers might reasonably expect dove soap and shampoo to come from the same companythat’s why winter is helping one of his clients arizona cannabis candy company baked bros apply for a trademark on syrups and gummy candies that contain cbd a hemp extract that’s available nationwide the patent and trademark office has approved trademarks for other products containing cbdwinter said cbd is about as close to marijuana as the trademark office will go if the office approves bake bros’ application winter said he believes marijuana products would be within the company’s zone of expansion“from a legal standpoint if you have a hempbased product under your brand no one will be able to get a cannabisrelated trademark for a similar brand” he saidstill the“circle the wagons” strategy isn’t foolproof and it comes with challenges of its own to get and keep a trademark companies actually have to use itto maintain its “hi” clothing trademark cannabis sativa will actually have to sell some clothes they’re not widely available for now though hal lewis the company’s national sales manager said he plans to launch an online store this year chong’s choice will have to  keep selling jars and vaporizers which are available online and at marijuana shops in a few statesthat represents a threat for cannabis brands if customers love a company’s weed but not its other products the company could lose its trademark altogether said alison malsbury another attorney who specializes in cannabis trademarks“the patent and trademark office is looking for more than just token sales” she said “if you’re not continually using the trademark it can be canceled and you can lose everything”what’s more she and other attorneys note that the strategy cannabis companies are using remains untested unless and until the federal government decides to allow cannabis trademarks companies can’t be sure their cannabisadjacent trademarks will be able to carry over to pot products and so far there’s been little legal squabbling between cannabis companies meaning there’s not much precedent for companies to rely on “we dont really have any test cases” malsbury saidbut that could change as the cannabis industry continues to grow winter suspects disputes between cannabis companies have been rare in part because the industry is tightknitas money floods in and competition heats up he expects companies to develop sharper elbows“theres a fair amount of peer pressure within the industry to not use someone else’s brand” he said “but thats changing a little with the dynamic of multimillionaires and billionaires investing in the industry” caption the senate voted to
