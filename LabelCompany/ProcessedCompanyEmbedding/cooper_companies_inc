commenting on the results robert s weiss coopers president and chief executive officer said i am pleased with the strong start to our fiscal year coopervision continued to gain market share driven by growth in biofinity® and its day silicone hydrogel products coopersurgical made a lot of progress and posted strong results we are increasing our guidance for the year to reflect our first quarter

                                                                                                                                                            fiscal year  guidancethe company updated its fiscal year  guidance  nongaap earnings per share guidance for the full fiscal year excludes amortization of existing other intangible assets of approximately  million or  per share and other costs including integration expenses which we would not have otherwise incurred as part of our continuing operations  details are summarized as follows total revenue of    million cvi revenue    millioncsi revenue    million nongaap earnings per share of     other on march   closed  billion in new year senior unsecured credit facilities replacement of  billion revolving line of credit and new  million term loan  the proceeds of the term loan were used to repay certain existing indebtedness and will also be used to reduce the  million term loan due august  and for general corporate purposes reconciliation of gaap to nongaap resultsto supplement our financial results and guidance presented on a gaap basis we use nongaap measures that we believe are helpful in understanding our results the nongaap measures exclude costs which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations  these include costs related to acquisitions and integration activities severance and restructuring costs costs associated with the startup of new manufacturing facilities as well as certain legal costs described below  our nongaap financial results and guidance are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap  management uses supplemental nongaap financial measures internally to understand manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions  these nongaap measures are among the factors management uses in planning and forecasting for future periods  we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our consolidated operating results  our nongaap financial measures include the following adjustments along with the related income tax effects and changes in income attributable to noncontrolling interests we exclude the effect of amortization of intangible assets from our nongaap financial results  amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods however the amounts are affected by the timing and size of our acquisitionswe exclude the effect of acquisition related and integration expenses and the effect of restructuring expenses from our nongaap financial results  such expenses generally diminish over time with respect to past acquisitions however we generally will incur similar expenses in connection with any future acquisitions we incurred significant expenses in connection with our acquisitions and also incurred certain other operating expenses or income which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations many of these costs relate to our acquisition of sauflon pharmaceuticals ltd that closed in our fiscal fourth quarter of   acquisition related and integration expenses include items such as personnel costs for transitional employees other acquired employee related costs and integration related professional services  restructuring expenses consist of employee severance product rationalization facility and other exit costswe exclude costs associated with the startup of new manufacturing facilities  while these costs may recur for a period of time we do not consider them as part of our continuing operations these costs will be eliminated when the specific startup activities have been completedwe exclude certain legal costs related to thirdparty intellectual property claims and litigation filed against coopervision and other contact lens manufacturers relating to unilateral pricing policy upp as well as related lobbying costs  while we may incur similar costs and charges we do not consider them as part of our continuing operations guidance for earnings per share is provided on a nongaap basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting acquisitionrelated integration and restructuring charges and expenses  we are not able to provide a reconciliation of these nongaap items to expected reported gaap earnings per share due to the unknown effect timing and potential significance of such charges and expenses  management does not consider the excluded items as part of our continuing operations we also report revenue growth using the nongaap financial measure of pro forma which includes constant currency revenue management presents and refers to constant currency information so that revenue results may be evaluated excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to present this information current period revenue for entities reporting in currencies other than the united states dollar are converted into united states dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the corresponding period in the prior year to report pro forma revenue growth we include revenue for the comparison period when we did not own recently acquired companies we define the nongaap measure of free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures  we believe free cash flow is useful for investors as an additional measure of liquidity because it represents cash flows that are available for repayment of debt repurchases of our common stock or to fund our strategic initiatives   management uses free cash flow internally to understand manage make operating decisions and evaluate our business  in addition we use free cash flow to help plan and forecast future periods we also provide the metric of adjusted free cash flow that we believe represents our operations ability to generate cash by adjusting cash flow from operations for capital expenditures that are part of our ongoing operations and for acquisition related and integration costs  we believe adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors as an additional measure of performance because it reports elements of our operating activities and excludes cash flow elements that we
