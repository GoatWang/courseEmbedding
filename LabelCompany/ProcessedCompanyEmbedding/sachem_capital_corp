common shares in this offering will be approximately  million or approximately  million if the representative exercises its overallotment option in full after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us the principal purpose of this offering is to raise additional funds to increase our loan portfolio as a real estate finance company whose primary source of income is interest generated from our loan portfolio the only way for us to increase our revenue is to increase the size of our loan portfolio the table below sets forth our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions amount percentage funding loans     capital expenditures   working capital and general corporate purposes       funding loans approximately  million or  of the net proceeds of this offering will be used to fund new loans and grow our loan portfolio capital expenditures we plan to make various renovations to the building we purchased on main street in branford connecticut that will serve as our new corporate headquarters we estimate the cost of the renovations will be approximately  working capital as a result of our conversion to reit status and the consummation of this offering we expect that our general and administrative expenses such as compensation and other employeerelated expenses insurance rent legal and accounting will increase on account of our various reporting and compliance obligations and our expanded operations we may also use the net proceeds to pay down on a temporary basis the outstanding balance on the bankwell credit line pending the application of any portion of the net proceeds we may invest such funds in interest bearing accounts and shortterm interest bearing securities that are consistent with our intention to qualify as a reit and maintain our exemption from registration under the investment company act these investments are expected to provide lower returns than those we will seek to achieve from our loan portfolio the real estate finance market in connecticut is highly competitive our competitors include traditional lending institutions such as regional and local banks savings and loan institutions credit unions and other financial institutions as well as other market participants such as specialty finance companies reits investment banks insurance companies hedge funds private equity funds family offices and high net worth individuals in addition we estimate that in addition to us there are approximately five “hard money” lenders of significant size serving the connecticut real estate market many of these competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us including greater name recognition established lending relationships with customers financial resources and access to capital notwithstanding the intense competition and some of our competitive disadvantages we believe we have carved a niche for ourselves among small real estate developers owners and contractors throughout connecticut and in parts of massachusetts and new york because we are relatively wellcapitalized our ability to structure each loan to suit the needs of each individual borrower and our ability to act quickly in addition we believe we have developed a reputation among these borrowers as offering reasonable terms and providing outstanding customer service we believe our future success will depend on our ability to maintain and capitalize on our existing relationships with borrowers and brokers and to expand our borrower base by continuing to offer attractive loan products remain competitive in pricing and terms and provide superior service company description we are a connecticutbased real estate finance company that specializes in originating underwriting funding servicing and managing a portfolio of shortterm ie three years or less loans secured by first mortgage liens on real property located primarily in connecticut each loan is also personally guaranteed by the principals of the borrower which guaranty is typically collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor’s interest in the borrower our typical borrower is a small real estate investor who will use the proceeds to fund its acquisition renovation rehabilitation development andor improvement of residential or commercial properties located primarily in connecticut held for investment or sale the property may or may not be income producing we do not lend to owneroccupants our loans are referred to in the real estate finance industry as “hard money loans” we believe that upon completion of this offering we will meet all of the requirements to qualify as a real estate investment trust

amount of the loan as well as other fees relating to underwriting funding and managing the loan when we renew or extend a loan we generally receive additional “points” and other fees interest is always payable monthly in arrears as a matter of policy we do not make any loans if the original principal amount of the loan exceeds  of the value of the property securing the loan referred to as the “loantovalue ratio” in the case of construction loans the loantovalue ratio is based on the postconstruction value of the property in the case of loans having a principal amount in excess of  we require a formal appraisal by a licensed appraiser in the case of smaller loans we rely on readily available market data including tax assessment rolls recent sales transactions and brokers to evaluate the strength of the collateral our lender requires an appraisal for any loan in excess of  failure to obtain such an appraisal would render the loan ineligible for financing under our credit
