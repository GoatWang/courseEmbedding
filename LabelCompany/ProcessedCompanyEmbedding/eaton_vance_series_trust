objective the portfolio seeks total return through a combination of capital appreciation and dividend income by investing in a selection of dividendpaying international common stocks selection criteria in seeking to achieve the portfolios objective eaton vance distributors inc the sponsor sought the recommendations of an equity investment team of its affiliate eaton vance management the equity team the equity team used a selection strategy that began by analyzing stocks ranked in the second quintile of the msci world exus index  the index based on dividend yield as of the close of business on                   all of the stocks in the index and therefore the portfolio are of international companies listed on exchanges outside the us each tied economically to the country in which their stock is listed the foundation of the selection strategy is based on an investment theory that the second quintile of dividendpaying equity securities in the index generally represents a selection of companies with sound financial management strong business franchises and attractive valuations and may provide more sustainable dividends than those companies in the first quintile from this initial universe of stocks the equity team focused on companies with a stock price of at least  per share and a market capitalization exceeding  billion in finalizing their recommendations the equity team considered each companys history of paying andor increasing dividends over the last ten years as well as the average daily trading volume of its stock based upon the equity teams recommendations the sponsor selected a final portfolio of  dividendpaying common stocks for inclusion in the portfolio on an equally weighted basis while the portfolio has a term of approximately  months it is designed as part of a longterm investment strategy the sponsor may offer a subsequent series of the portfolio when the current portfolio terminates and you may be able to reinvest your proceeds into a subsequent series at a reduced sales charge repeatedly rolling over an investment in a unit investment trust will differ from longterm investments in other investment products when

perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these        security prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time        an issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future or may reduce the level of dividends declared this may result in a reduction in the value of your units        the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the initial offering period        the portfolio invests exclusively in stocks of foreign issuers  investments in foreign issuers could be affected by factors not present in the us including expropriation armed conflict confiscatory taxation lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards less publicly available financial and other information and potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations        the portfolio invests in stocks of smaller capitalization companies these stocks are often more volatile and have lower trading volumes than stocks of larger companies smaller capitalization companies may have limited products or financial resources management inexperience and less publicly available information        we do not actively manage the portfolio except in limited circumstances the portfolio will hold and may continue to buy shares of the same securities even if their market value declines      the msci world ex usa index captures large and midcap representation across  of  developed market countries

eaton vance unit trust  series        prospectus dated                   the trust the portfolios were created under the laws of the state of new york pursuant to a trust indenture and trust agreement the trust agreement dated the date of this prospectus the initial date of deposit among eaton vance distributors inc as sponsor eaton vance management as supervisor and evaluator and the bank of new york mellon as trustee on the initial date of deposit the sponsor deposited delivery statements relating to contracts for the purchase of the securities and cash or an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount required for these purchases with the trustee in exchange the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the portfolios unless otherwise terminated as provided in the trust agreement a portfolio will terminate on the mandatory termination date and any remaining securities will be liquidated or distributed by the trustee within a reasonable time as used in this prospectus the term securities means the securities including contracts to purchase these securities listed in each portfolio and any additional securities deposited into a portfolio as a result of a corporate action or similar event additional units of a portfolio may be issued at any time by depositing in the portfolio i additional securities ii contracts to purchase securities together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or iii cash or a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities as additional units are issued by a portfolio the aggregate value of the securities will be increased and the fractional undivided interest represented by each unit may be decreased the sponsor may continue to make additional deposits into a portfolio following the initial date of deposit provided that the additional deposits will be in amounts that will maintain as nearly as practicable the same percentage relationship among the number of shares of each security in the portfolio that existed immediately prior to the subsequent deposit investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because a portfolio will pay the associated brokerage or acquisition fees in the context of a unit investment trust such as your portfolio the term dilution refers to any reduction in the ownership percentage of such portfolios assets resulting from the creation of additional units due to round lot requirements in certain foreign securities markets and market value fluctuations the eaton vance international dividend fortitude portfolio may not be able to invest in each security on any subsequent date of deposit in the same proportion as existed on the initial date of deposit or immediately prior to the subsequent deposit of securities this could increase the potential for dilution of investments and variances in anticipated income in addition during the initial offering of units it may not be possible to buy a particular security due to regulatory or trading restrictions or corporate actions while such limitations are in effect additional units would be created by purchasing each of the securities in your portfolio that are not subject to those limitations this would also result in the dilution of the investment in any such security not purchased and potential variances in anticipated income purchases and sales of securities by your portfolio may impact the value of the securities this may especially be the case during the initial offering of units upon portfolio termination and in the course of satisfying large unit redemptions each unit of your portfolio initially offered represents an undivided interest in the portfolio at the close of the new york stock exchange on the initial date of deposit the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals  the number of units fractional interest of each unit in your portfolio and the estimated distributions per unit will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment to the extent that any units are redeemed to the trustee or additional units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the sponsor the fractional undivided interest in your portfolio represented by each unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly although the actual interest in your portfolio will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by unitholders which may include the sponsor or until the termination of

the individual securities but rather the entire pool of securities in the portfolios taken as a whole which are represented by the units investment risks all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of the securities in your portfolio you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that your portfolio will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk  market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your portfolio will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation political social or economic instability the financial condition of an issuer or sector and perceptions of an issuer or sector stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements the value of stocks often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably in response to market issuer or sectorspecific events even though your portfolio is supervised you should remember that we do not manage your portfolio your portfolio will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund dividend payment risk  dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling or unable to pay dividends on a security stocks represent ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders common stocks do not assure dividend payments dividends are paid only when declared by an issuers board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time if dividends received by a portfolio are insufficient to cover expenses redemptions or other portfolio costs it may be necessary for the portfolio to sell securities to cover such expenses redemptions or other costs any such sales may result in capital gains or losses to you see tax information foreign stocks the international dividend fortitude portfolio invests exclusively in stocks of foreign issuers investments in foreign issuers could be affected by factors not present in the united states including expropriation armed conflict confiscatory taxation lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards less publicly available financial and other information and potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations investments in foreign issuers can also be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates and political economic and market developments abroad including the imposition of economic and other sanctions by the united states or another country economic data as reported by sovereign governments and foreign issuers may be delayed inaccurate or fraudulent because foreign issuers may not be subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standard practices and requirements and regulatory measures comparable to those in the united states there may be less publicly available information about such foreign issuers settlements of securities transactions in foreign countries are subject to risk of loss may be delayed and are generally less frequent than in the united states foreign issuers may become subject to sanctions imposed by the united states or another country which could result in the immediate freeze of the foreign issuers assets or securities the imposition of such sanctions could impair the market value of the securities of such foreign issuers and limit the portfolios ability to buy sell receive or deliver the securities the purchase and sale of the foreign securities will occur in foreign securities markets certain of the factors stated above may make it impossible to buy or sell them in a timely manner or may adversely affect the value received on a sale of securities custody of certain of the securities in your portfolio may be maintained by a global custody and clearing institution which has entered into a subcustodian relationship with the trustee in addition round lot trading requirements exist in certain foreign securities markets these round lot trading requirements could cause the proportional composition and diversification of your portfolios securities to vary when your portfolio purchases additional securities or sells securities to satisfy expenses or unit redemptions this could have a material impact on investment performance and portfolio composition changes in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect the value of stocks denominated in foreign currencies and therefore an investment in units of the eaton vance international dividend fortitude portfolio to illustrate if a foreign stock rose  in price but the us dollar gained  against the related foreign currency a us investors return in this illustration would be reduced to about  this is because the foreign currency would buy fewer dollars or

france as a result the french economy has experienced significant volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about a prolonged economic downturn and rising government debt levels interest rates on frances debt may rise to levels that make it difficult for it to service high debt levels without significant financial help from among others the european central bank and could potentially result in default in addition the french economy is dependent to a significant extent on the economies of certain key trading partners including germany and other western european countries reduction in spending on french products and services or changes in any of the economies may cause an adverse impact on the french economy in addition france may be subject to acts of terrorism the french economy is dependent on agricultural exports and as a result is susceptible to fluctuations in demand for agricultural products united kingdom issuers the eaton vance international dividend fortitude

consumer products sector your portfolio may invest significantly in the common stocks of consumer products companies a category which includes consumer discretionary companies and consumer staples companies general risks of these companies include the general state of the economy intense competition consumer spending trends cyclicality of revenues and earnings currency fluctuations product liability litigation and increased governmental regulation a decline in the economy that results in a reduction of consumers disposable income can negatively impact spending habits competitiveness in the retail industry may require large capital outlays for the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory track the sale of items and gauge the success of sales campaigns retailers who sell their products over the internet have the potential to access more consumers but may require more sophisticated technology to remain competitive a weak economy and its effect on consumer spending would adversely affect consumer product companies financials sector your portfolio may invest significantly in financial services companies companies in the financial services sector include commercial banks industrial banks savings institutions finance companies diversified financial services companies investment banking firms securities brokerage houses investment advisory companies leasing companies insurance companies and companies providing similar services due to the wide variety of companies in the financial services sector they may behave and react in different ways in response to changes in economic and market conditions companies in the financial services sector are subject to several distinct risks such companies may be subject to systematic risk which may result due to factors outside the control of a particular financial institution  like the failure of another significant financial institution or material disruptions to the credit markets  that could adversely affect the ability of the financial institution to operate normally or may impair its financial condition financial services companies are typically affected by changes in interest rates and may be disproportionally affected as a result of volatile and or rising interest rates certain financial services companies may themselves have concentrated portfolios such as a high level of loans to real estate developers which makes them vulnerable to economic conditions that affect that industry companies in this sector are often subject to credit risk meaning they may have exposure to investments or agreements which under certain circumstances may lead to losses eg subprime loans further companies in the financial services sector are subject to intense competition companies in this sector are subject to regulatory risk where certain financial services companies may suffer setbacks if regulators change the rules under which they operate among the most prominent pieces of legislation following the financial crisis has been the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act enacted into federal law on july   the doddfrank act includes reforms and refinements to modernize existing laws to address emerging risks and issues in the nations evolving financial system it also establishes entirely new regulatory regimes including in areas such as systemic risk regulation overthecounter derivatives market oversight and federal consumer protection the doddfrank act is intended to cover virtually all participants in the financial services industry for years to come including banks thrifts depository institution holding companies mortgage lenders insurance companies industrial loan companies brokerdealers and other securities and investment advisory firms private equity and hedge funds consumers numerous federal agencies and the federal regulatory structure in particular certain provisions of the doddfrank act increase the capital requirements of certain financial services companies supervised by the federal reserve resulting in such companies incurring generally higher deposit premiums these types of regulatory changes may have adverse effects on certain issuers in your portfolio and could lead to decreases in such issuers profits or revenues in many cases the full impact of the doddfrank act on a financial institutions business remains uncertain because of the extensive rulemaking still to be completed the sponsor is unable to predict the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and any resulting regulation on the securities in your portfolio or on the financial services industry in general commercial banks including money center regional and community banks savings and loan associations and holding companies of the foregoing are especially subject to adverse effects of volatile interest rates concentrations of loans in particular industries or classifications such as real estate energy or subprime mortgages and significant competition the profitability of these businesses is to a significant degree dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds economic conditions in the real estate market may have a particularly strong effect on certain banks and savings associations commercial banks and savings associations are subject to extensive federal and in many instances state regulation neither such extensive regulation nor the federal insurance of deposits ensures the solvency or profitability of companies in this industry and there is no assurance against losses in

marketable or approved products or technologies many of these companies face substantial government regulations that can affect their prospects regulatory approvals often entailing lengthy application and testing procedures are also generally required before new drugs and certain medical devices and procedures may be introduced health care companies can also face risk of extensive competition and product liability litigation the health care and education reconciliation act of  incorporating the patient protection and affordable care act collectively the act has had a significant impact on the health care sector significant provisions of the act include the introduction of required health care coverage for most americans significant expansion in the number of americans eligible for medicaid modification of taxes and tax credits in the health care sector and subsidized insurance for low to middle income families the act also provides for more thorough regulation of private health insurance providers including a prohibition on the denial of coverage due to preexisting conditions although the implementation of the acts various provisions will take place over the next several years through  health care companies will face continuing and significant changes that may cause a decrease in profitability due to increased costs possible downward pressure on prices charged and other changes in the health care market the sponsor is unable to predict the full impact of the act on the securities in your portfolio as illustrated by the act congress may from time to time propose legislative action that will impact the health care sector the proposals may span a wide range of topics including cost and price controls which may include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs incentives for competition in the provision of health care services promotion of prepaid health care plans and additional tax incentives and penalties aimed at the health care sector the government could also reduce funding for health care related research many of the products and services of companies engaged in medical research and health care are also subject to relatively high risks of rapid obsolescence caused by progressive scientific and technological advances the research and development costs of bringing a new drug or medical product to market are substantial additionally such products are subject to risks such as the appearance of toxic effects following commercial introduction and manufacturing difficulties alternatively failure to gain approval for a new drug or product can have a substantial negative effect on a company and its stock the goods and services of health care issuers are also subject to risks of malpractice claims product liability claims or other litigation the enforcement of patent trademark and other intellectual property laws will affect the value of many such companies health care facility operators face risks related to demand for services the ability of the facility to provide required services emphasis on outpatient services management capabilities competitive forces that may result in price discounting efforts by insurers and government agencies to limit rates expenses the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and termination or restriction of government financial assistance such as

and government regulation these companies can also be adversely affected by interruption or reduction in supply of components or loss of key customers and failure to comply with certain industry standards an unexpected change in technology may also have a significant negative impact on a company the failure of a company to keep pace with rapidly changing technology and subsequently introduce new products can have a negative impact on the companys results technology companies may also be smaller andor less experienced with limited product lines markets or resources also stocks of certain

value per unit plus organization costs plus the sales charge the net asset value per unit is the value of the securities cash and other assets in your portfolio reduced by the liabilities of the portfolio divided by the total units outstanding the maximum sales charge equals  of the public offering price per unit at the time of purchase you pay the initial sales charge at the time you buy units the initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge percentage maximum of  of the public offering price per unit and the sum of the remaining fixed dollar deferred sales charge and the total fixed dollar creation and development fee the initial sales charge will be approximately  of the public offering price per unit depending on the public offering price per unit the deferred sales charge is fixed at  per unit your portfolio pays the deferred sales charge in installments as described under fees and expenses if any deferred sales charge payment date is not a business day we will charge the payment on the next business day if you purchase units after the initial deferred sales charge payment you will only pay that portion of the payments not yet collected if you redeem or sell your units prior to collection of the total deferred sales charge you will pay any remaining deferred sales charge upon redemption or sale of your units the initial and deferred sales charges are referred to as the transactional sales charge the transactional sales charge does not include the creation and development fee which compensates the sponsor for creating and developing your portfolio and is described under fees and expenses the creation and development fee is fixed at  per unit your portfolio pays the creation and development fee as of the close of the initial offering period as described under fees and expenses if you redeem or sell your units prior to collection of the creation and development fee you will not pay the creation and development fee upon redemption or sale of your units because the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit the actual charges will exceed the percentages shown under fees and expenses if the public offering price per unit falls below  and will be less than the percentages shown under fees and expenses if the public offering price per unit exceeds  in no event will the maximum total sales charge exceed  of the public offering price per unit since the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit your portfolio must charge these amounts per unit regardless of any decrease in net asset value however if the public offering price per unit falls to the extent that the maximum sales charge percentage results in a dollar amount that is less than the combined fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee your initial sales charge will be a credit equal to the amount by which these fixed dollar charges exceed your sales charge at the time you buy units in such a situation the value of securities per unit would exceed the public offering price per unit by the amount of the initial sales charge credit and the value of those securities will fluctuate which could result in a benefit or detriment to unitholders that purchase units at that price the initial sales charge credit is paid by the sponsor and is not paid by your portfolio the fees and expenses section shows the sales charge calculation at a  public offering price per unit and the following examples illustrate the sales charge at prices below and above  if the public offering price per unit fell to  the maximum sales charge would be   of the public offering price per unit which consists

the fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales charges and creation and development fee you will receive a credit equal to the difference between your total sales charge and these fixed dollar charges at the time you buy units large quantity purchases you can reduce your sales charge by increasing the size of your investment based upon the aggregate dollar amount of units purchased by a unitholder

unit trusts at a reduced sales charge you should contact your financial professional for more information about trusts currently available for exchanges before you exchange units you should read the prospectus of the new trust carefully and understand the risks and fees you should then discuss this option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment goals have changed whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax consequences an exchange is a taxable event to you we may discontinue this option at any time rollover  we may offer a subsequent series of each portfolio for a rollover when the portfolios terminate on the mandatory termination date you will have the option to  participate in a rollover and have your units reinvested into a subsequent trust series or  receive a cash distribution if you elect to participate in a cash rollover your units will be redeemed on the mandatory termination date as the redemption proceeds become available the proceeds including dividends will be invested in a new trust series at the public offering price for the new trust the trustee will attempt to sell securities to satisfy the redemption as quickly as practicable on the mandatory termination date we do not anticipate that the sale period will be longer than one day however certain factors could affect the ability to sell the securities and could impact the length of the sale period the liquidity of any security depends on the daily trading volume of the security and the amount available for redemption and reinvestment on any day we may make subsequent trust series available for sale at various times during the year of course we cannot guarantee that a subsequent trust or sufficient units will be available or that any subsequent trusts will offer the same investment strategies or objectives as the current portfolios we cannot guarantee that a rollover will avoid any negative market price consequences resulting from trading large volumes of securities market price trends may make it advantageous to sell or buy securities more quickly or more slowly than permitted by a portfolios procedures we may in our sole discretion modify a rollover or stop creating units of a trust at any time regardless of whether all proceeds of unitholders have been reinvested in a rollover if we decide not to offer a subsequent series unitholders

rollover but may not be entitled to a deduction for capital losses due to the wash sale tax rules due to the reinvestment in a subsequent trust no cash will be distributed to pay any taxes see tax information repeatedly rolling over an investment in a unit investment trust will differ from longterm investments in other investment products when considering the sales charges fees expenses and tax consequences attributable to a unitholder unlike many other investment products unit investment trusts have finite lives meaning that investors seeking to pursue a unit investment trust strategy over a multiyear period must periodically roll their proceeds into a newly formed trust with each rollover event unitholders will be subject to the tax consequences and expenses associated with redeeming units as well as the reduced sales charge applicable to rollover investments fees and expenses may vary significantly not only among various unit investment trust products but also when comparing unit investment trusts against other investment products such as mutual funds to allow for such a cost comparison the fees and expenses  example section provides an illustrated example of the potential costs a unitholder may bear if an initial investment and subsequent rollover investments are made over various time periods using the assumptions stated in that section distribution of

foreign withholding taxes in certain cases estimated net annual distributions may also be based upon several recently declared dividends of an issuer however common stocks do not assure dividend payments and therefore the amount of future dividend income to your portfolio is uncertain the actual net annual distributions may decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in a

are not managed funds and except as provided in the trust agreement securities generally will not be sold or replaced the sponsor may however direct that securities be sold in certain limited circumstances to protect a portfolio based on advice from the supervisor these situations may include events such as the issuer having defaulted on payment of any of its outstanding obligations or the price of a security has declined to such an extent or other credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the supervisor retention of the security would be detrimental to a portfolio if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger or acquisition has been announced affecting a security the trustee may either sell the security or accept an offer if the supervisor determines that the sale or exchange is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to unitholders in addition the trustee may sell securities to redeem units or pay portfolio expenses or deferred sales charges if securities or property are acquired by a portfolio the sponsor may direct the trustee to sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds to unitholders or to accept the securities or property for deposit in the portfolio should any contract for the purchase of any of the securities fail the sponsor will unless substantially all of the moneys held in a portfolio to cover the purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement refund the cash and sales charge attributable to the failed contract to all unitholders on or before the next distribution date the sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of securities if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors

proportion as shares held by other shareholders if the sponsor fails to provide instructions when your portfolio sells securities the composition and diversity of the securities in the portfolio may be altered however if the trustee sells securities to redeem units or to pay portfolio expenses or sales charges the trustee will do so as nearly as practicable on a pro rata basis in order to obtain the best price for your portfolio it may be necessary for the supervisor to specify minimum amounts in which blocks of securities are to be sold in effecting purchases and sales of portfolio

information this section summarizes some of the principal us federal income tax consequences of owning units of the portfolios as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect and this summary does not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example this summary generally does not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer a taxexempt entity financial institution person who marks to market their units or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your alternative minimum state local or foreign tax consequences of investing in a portfolio this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in your portfolio as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor portfolio status your portfolio intends to elect and to qualify annually as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if your portfolio qualifies under the tax law as a regulated investment company and distributes its income consistently with such qualification the portfolio generally will not pay federal income taxes but there is no assurance that the distributions made by your portfolio will eliminate all taxes for every year at the level of your portfolio distributions portfolio distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement reporting your portfolios distributions including the amounts of ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your tax rate for ordinary income however as further discussed below certain ordinary income distributions received from your portfolio may be taxed under current federal law at the capital gains tax rates certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by your portfolio from certain corporations may be reported by the portfolio as being eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate unitholders provided certain holding period requirements are met income from the portfolio and gains on the sale of your units may also be subject to a  federal tax imposed generally on net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals in addition your portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the unitholders basis in the units and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units the tax status of your distributions from your portfolio is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash the income from your portfolio that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any the tax laws may require you to treat certain distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year a distribution paid by your portfolio reduces the portfolios net asset value per unit on the date paid by the amount of the distribution accordingly a distribution paid shortly after a purchase of units by a unitholder would represent in substance a partial return of capital however it would be subject to income taxes sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your initial tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units   eaton vance unit trust  series        prospectus dated                   capital gains and losses and certain ordinary income dividends net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your portfolio and sell your units at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income in certain circumstances ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a regulated investment company such as your portfolio may be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualified dividend income received by the portfolio itself your portfolio will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken into account as qualified dividend income which is eligible for the capital gains tax rates there is no requirement that tax consequences be taken into account in administering your portfolio inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an inkind distribution of portfolio securities when you redeem your units in general this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will recognize gain or loss based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received and subject to certain limitations on the deductibility of losses under the tax rules unitholders will incur transaction costs in liquidating securities received in an inkind distribution and any such securities received will be subject to market risk until sold in the event that any securities received inkind are illiquid unitholders will bear the risk of not being able to sell such securities in the near term or at all rollovers and exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your portfolio rolled over into a future trust it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain and in general any loss will be treated as a capital loss however any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that units disposed of are replaced including through reinvestment of dividends within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after disposition of units or to the extent that the unitholder during such period acquires or enters into an option or contract to acquire substantially identical stock or securities in such a case the basis of the units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss deductibility of portfolio expenses  expenses incurred and deducted by your portfolio will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these portfolio expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income such deductions may be subject to limitation for taxpayers whose income exceeds certain levels foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust generally subject to applicable tax treaties distributions to you from your portfolio will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes other than dividends that your portfolio reports as capital gain dividends and will be subject to us income taxes including withholding taxes subject to certain exceptions described below you may be eligible under certain income tax treaties for a reduction in withholding rates however distributions received by a foreign investor from your portfolio that are properly reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes provided that your portfolio makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met the foreign account tax compliance act fatca  a  withholding tax on your portfolios distributions including capital gains distributions and on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of units generally applies if paid to a foreign entity unless i if the foreign entity is a foreign financial institution as defined under fatca the foreign entity undertakes certain due diligence reporting withholding and certification obligations ii if the foreign entity is not a foreign financial institution it identifies certain of its us investors or iii the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under fatca if required under the rules above and subject to the applicability of any intergovernmental agreements between the united states and the relevant foreign country withholding under fatca applies i with respect to distributions from your portfolio and ii with respect to

rate of withholding on such payment generally will be required to seek a refund or credit from the irs to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction your portfolio will not pay any additional amounts in respect of amounts withheld under fatca you should consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of fatca based on your individual circumstances foreign tax credit  if your portfolio invests in any foreign securities the tax statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your portfolio paid to other countries in this case dividends taxed to you will include your share of the taxes your portfolio paid to other countries you may be able to deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes if your portfolio meets certain requirements for passing through such deductions or credits to you backup withholding  by law your portfolio must withhold as backup withholding a percentage currently  of your taxable distributions and redemption proceeds if you do not provide your correct social security or taxpayer identification number and certify that you are not subject to backup withholding or if the irs instructs your portfolio to do so investors

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
