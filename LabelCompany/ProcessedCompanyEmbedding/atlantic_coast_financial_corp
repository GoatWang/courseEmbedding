holding company for atlantic coast bank the bank today reported earnings per diluted share of  and  for the three and six months ended june   respectively compared with earnings of  and  for the three and six months ended june   respectively commenting on the companys results john k stephens jr president and chief executive officer said atlantic coast again delivered a solid financial and operational performance in the second quarter of  driven by continued momentum in portfolio lending and deposit growth these increases underscore the success of our strategy to shift to a commercial business banking franchise and to expand our platform to attractive new markets in central florida while we continue to capitalize on our increasing standing in all of our markets at the same time we are pleased to note overall credit quality remained stable while the sale of our last significant foreclosed property resulted in the lowest level of oreo in more than  years looking forward our pipelines and new business development efforts are robust and we remain excited about the growth opportunities within our footprint especially considering our growing focus on commercial lending i believe our strengths position us well to achieve our aspirational goals and we have the team talent and tools needed to do so other significant highlights of the second quarter and first half of  included net interest income improved to  million and  million for the three and six months ended june   respectively from  million and  million for the three and six months ended june   respectively net interest margin was  for each of the three and six months ended june   respectively up from  and  for the three and six months ended june   respectively total loans including portfolio loans loans heldforsale and warehouse loans heldforinvestment increased  to  million at june   from  million at december   and  from  million at june   the companys loan growth since both june   and december   was driven primarily by increased commercial real estate lending in all of its markets this growth was somewhat offset by portfolio mortgage loan sales as part of the companys interest rate risk and balance sheet management strategies deposits increased  to  million at june   from  million at december   and  from  million at june   deposits excluding brokered deposits increased  to  million at june   from  million at december   and  from  million at june   wholesale funding which includes brokered deposits and federal home loan bank advances decreased  to  million at june   from  million at december   and  from  million at june   the increase in nonbrokered deposits and resulting decreased reliance on wholesale funding was driven primarily by the companys commercial deposit strategies put in place during  total assets increased to  million at june   from  million at december   primarily due to increases in portfolio loans which were partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents investment securities and other loans loans heldforsale and warehouse loans heldforinvestment and decreased from  million at june   primarily due to a decrease in investment securities and other loans which were partially offset by an increase in portfolio loans and cash and cash equivalents nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were  at june   compared with  at december   and  at june   because of the companys generally stable credit quality throughout  and continuing through the first half of  due to an overall slowing pace of loan reclassifications to nonperforming the company was able to reduce its loan loss provision for the three and six months ended june   compared with the same periods in  while maintaining in managements view an adequate ratio of allowance for portfolio loan losses to total portfolio loans the banks ratios of total riskbased capital to riskweighted assets and tier  core capital to adjusted total assets were  and  respectively at june   and each continued to exceed the levels –  and  respectively – currently required for the bank to be considered wellcapitalized tracy l keegan executive vice president and chief financial officer added improving net interest margin for both the second quarter and yeartodate period compared with the same periods last year again highlights our operational performance and momentum with respect to margin we were pleased to achieve  and  basis point improvements respectively as we continue to reduce our total cost of funds and grow higheryielding assets however competitive conditions continue to be a factor in pricing both loans and deposits and is something that we continually monitor regarding its impact on margin going forward while all banks are subject to similar pricing issues we remain

riskweighted capital ratios at june   compared with december   reflected an increase in riskweighted assets due to growth in portfolio loans and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investment

june   december   and june   respectively   while nonperforming assets have declined for three consecutive quarters the current level exceeded that of the yearearlier period reflecting the reclassification of two specific loans to nonperforming status during the third quarter of  that aside the companys overall credit quality remains stable as the general pace of loans reclassified to

losses has trended within a relatively narrow range over the past year it was slightly lower for the three months ended june   compared with the second quarter last year and was down  for the first six months ended june   versus the first half of  this reflects a trend of solid economic conditions in the companys markets which has led to continued low levels of net chargeoffs during the last  months the increase in the allowance for portfolio loan losses at june   compared with that at june   was attributable primarily to loan growth which reflected organic growth supplemented by strategic loan purchases that were offset partially by loan sales principal amortization and increased prepayments of one to fourfamily residential mortgages and home equity loans management believes the allowance for portfolio loan losses at june   is sufficient to absorb losses in portfolio loans as of the end of the period net chargeoffs remained at a low level during the three and six months ended june   but were higher compared with the same periods in  and during the three months ended march   primarily due to the chargeoff of one home equity loan and one commercial loan         net interest
