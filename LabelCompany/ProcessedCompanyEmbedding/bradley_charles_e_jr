latimes advertisement you are here lat home→collections→settlementsmorgan stanley to pay  million in bond casecourts settlement is called a major victory for accident victims whose trust funds had allegedly been looted and depletedjune  myron levin  times staff writer investment giant morgan stanley  co will pay  million to settle claims that it contributed to the looting of trust funds that provided living expenses for more than  victims of auto wrecks industrial accidents and botched medical procedures according to documents filed thursday in a los angeles classaction casethe settlement was hailed as a major victory by plaintiffs attorneys who said it assures a flow of income to their clients while the case against other bluechip defendants continuesseparately the company that triggered the disaster by losing a fortune in bonds filed a petition for bankruptcy reorganization this week in bridgeport conn the bankruptcy case will halt legal proceedings against the company stanwich financial services corp of stamford conn while it attempts to marshal its assets but litigation will go forward against a string of powerhouse firms accused of contributing to the loss of the bonds including bear stearns  co bank of america wells fargo bank and bankers trust co of new yorkthe case stems from the sudden cessation last fall of income payments to the victims who for years have relied on settlement checks to pay medical and living expenses the default led to the discovery that a stanwich affiliate had frittered away the bonds using them as collateral for loans from morgan which later sold them for nonpaymentmorgan did not admit liability and company officials declined comment on the settlementthe agreement brings recent recoveries in the case to  millionenough to give plaintiffs all payments due them until may the morgan settlement is the third and largest of the recoveries in april merrill lynch  co agreed in a settlement to meet all scheduled payments due this yearan amount originally estimated at  million but now calculated at  million in may bankers trust agreed to advance an additional  million although bankers remains a defendantthe morgan and merrill settlements need court approval and hearings before los angeles superior court judge peter d lichtman are scheduled for julyplaintiffs lawyer roman m silberfeld said the infusion of  million takes the financial pressure off victims who he said might otherwise have been forced through desperation to settle on the cheapthe case involves trust funds created to pay more than  million to people who had resolved serious accident claims through structured settlements the settlements were arranged in the s mostly by a merrill lynch affiliate and a second firm merrill acquired they involved buying us treasury bonds and using the interest to make monthly quarterly or twiceyearly payments over periods of  to  years until the default last november no one missed a paymentbut unknown to the plaintiffs control of the business had passed from merrill to a rhode island businessman and socialite named jonathan h pardee operating as settlement services treasury assignments inc pardee appointed a new trustee bankers trust to hold the bonds and disburse checks and pardee allegedly induced bankers to accept a permissive trust agreement that allowed settlement services to put the bonds in playaccording to court papers pardee entered into repurchase agreements with morgan stanley essentially a borrowing arrangement in which he used the treasury bonds as collateral for a multimilliondollar line of credit with marketing help from bear stearns pardee later sold settlement services to stanwich and its principals connecticut businessman charles e bradley sr and his son charles e bradley jr of orange countythe bradleys continued the practice of using the bonds to get investment cash from morgan according to the lawsuit the bradleys used  million of the loan proceeds to pay pardee for settlement services they allegedly lent at least  million more to other bradleycontrolled companies that were in weak financial conditionin march  morgan sold the bonds paying itself back from the proceeds and giving the balance to stanwich because people had continued to receive their income checks throughout the period until the default last november they were none the wiserpardee and the bradleys accused by the plaintiffs of fraud and other wrongs have denied wrongdoing defense lawyer steve hogan said the bradleys believed it was perfectly legal to borrow against the bonds which was why they bought settlement services in the first placehogan said stanwich filed for chapter  protection to gain time to liquidate loans and other investments the hope is to maximize the recovery on its assets so that it stanwich can pay these people as much money as possible and hopefully pay them in full moreseizure led to flojos deathhis  scores make his caserestaurant
