case we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since  from an investment perspective our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets we prefer equities over credit and credit over rates but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given  elevated valuations  limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and  limits to economic growth potential broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt in some respects our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into  the key difference for  revolves around four emerging transitions populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy and concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for deregulation transition will be an evolving theme in  and we will be revisiting it in our publications throughout the year in this investment outlook we highlight specific signposts we will be watching both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions three key questions is it time to derisk is it time to derisk no we think derisking would be premature at least from a purely returngenerating standpoint we expect the macro environment to remain supportive of risk assets during  amid a slowbutsteady expansion in developed markets and an acceleration of growth in some emerging markets view more what’s driving the

beyond conventional stock and bond market approaches we also think rangebound or volatile markets create opportunities for more dynamic investment strategies view more     transitions we’re watching in  globalism to populism the biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend stagnation to inflation we expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the us monetary to fiscal policy the focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending as central banks are stretching toward the

primary residence of  million or more or annual income of at least  advisors can purchase the fund through a number of platforms including schwab fidelity td ameritrade pershing jp morgan and millennium trust “the fund allows advisors to allocate to leading hedge funds at a smaller minimum of  than most hedge funds offer” said michael peck president and cochief investment officer of vivaldi asset management the fund’s advisor “we chose to partner with infinity capital partners to subadvise the fund because they have a track record of successfully managing a multistrategy fund of funds since ” “our experience and deep relationships give us access to a diversified roster of leading hedge fund managers” said jeff vale chief investment officer of infinity capital partners “we only work with blue chip institutional quality managers their typical minimums of  million or more are outside the reach of many investors” infinity’s chief investment officer jeff vale answered a few questions about the infinity core alternatives fund and its investment process q how do you select the multistrategy hedge fund managers for your portfolio a we screen the universe of roughly  to  hedge funds for managers that employ a multistrategy approach a minimum of a year operating history and  billion in assets under management that narrows the universe to roughly  funds that meet these criteria the one constant of our selected managers is their relentless focus on risk management we seek to find the best riskmanaged hedge fund managers with long histories of delivering high sharpe ratio returns or the highest returns for the risks taken we perform roughly two years of due diligence before making an initial investment with a manager q what is your objective with the fund a we seek to consistently maximize returns relative to risk the investment objective of the fund is to seek longterm capital growth the fund invests primarily in other hedge funds that invest or trade in a wide range of securities and to a lesser extent other property and currency interests the underlying managers have exposure to a broad range of strategies across a wide range of security types and regions primary strategies include longshort equity distressed securities event driven quantitative equity and securities arbitrage q who should consider this fund a the fund is appropriate for accredited investors who are seeking an alternative investment with low correlation to traditional equity and fixed income asset classes the fund offers diversified exposure within the alternative asset class and is a true complement to liquid alternative investments the fund may also be appropriate for an investor seeking attractive returns and downside protection q do you move assets around between managers or make tactical allocation decisions a no we push down the tactical allocation decisions to the multistrategy hedge fund managers with whom we invest we neither use hedge overlays nor try to outsmart the managers we have hired all of our hedge fund managers are global with many employees significant resources on the ground and opportunity sets that are broad and wellresearched q how do you determine how much is allocated to each manager a we strive to manage a balanced portfolio in practice the weights vary we manage against capacity as some managers may be hard or soft closed we believe in a concentrated approach with a portfolio of  to  managers although we do not want any one manager to represent more than  of the portfolio we rebalance the portfolio as needed however we do not actively trade the portfolio use leverage or employ hedge overlays q how do you monitor the selected hedge fund managers a we communicate regularly with the managers to gain insight into portfolio opportunities and their risk management process we have longstanding relationships with each manager including senior management portfolio managers research analysts and their investor relations professionals they recognize we are generally long term investors have committed capital and they know and trust us q why did you choose to offer a registered closedend investment fund instead of a liquid alternative mutual fund a daily liquidity and the overall constraints of a mutual fund limit the spectrum and opportunity set of hedge fund strategies some of the most attractive and noncorrelated strategies cannot be executed in a daily liquid fund structure our structure and committed capital enables our selected multistrategy managers to seek out the most opportunistic strategies and deploy capital based on risk and not necessarily be constrained by the fund’s structure the fund offers quarterly liquidity this means that advisors need to commit only those assets that can remain invested and that their clients will not need access to in the short term q what are the fees on the fund a the management fee is  and other expenses are  however fees and expenses are capped at  or  basis points the advisor at their option may also charge a maximum sales charge of  the underlying fund expenses are  we believe alpha is expensive and we are willing to pay for that however beta is cheap the structure allows us to bring traditional fund of hedge funds to a broader audience with a low fee structure about infinity capital partners llc based in atlanta georgia

definitions new fund launches investment conferences  hedge fund articles home hedge fund strategy  equity longshort an equity longshort strategy is an investing strategy used primarily by hedge funds that involves taking long positions in stocks that are expected to increase in value and short positions in stocks that are expected to decrease in value you may know that taking a long position in a stock simply means buying it if the stock increases in value you will make money on the other hand taking a short position in a stock means borrowing a stock you don’t own usually from your broker selling it then hoping it declines in value at which time you can buy it back at a lower price than you paid for it and return the borrowed shares hedge funds using equity longshort strategies simply do this on a grander scale at its most basic level an equity longshort strategy consists of buying an undervalued stock and shorting an overvalued stock ideally the long position will increase in value and the short position will decline in value if this happens and the positions are of equal size the hedge fund will benefit that said the strategy will work even if the long position declines in value provided that the long position outperforms the short position thus the goal of any equity longshort strategy is to minimize exposure to the market in general and profit from a change in the difference or spread between two stocks that may sound complicated so let’s look at a hypothetical example let’s say a hedge fund takes a  million long position in pfizer and a  million short position in wyeth both large pharmaceutical companies with these positions any event that causes all pharmaceutical stocks to fall will lead to a loss on the pfizer position and a profit on the wyeth position similarly an event that causes both stocks to rise will have little effect since the positions balance each other out so the market risk is minimal why then would a portfolio manager take such a position because he or she thinks pfizer will perform better than wyeth equity longshort strategies such as the one described which hold equal dollar amounts of long and short positions are called market neutral strategies but not all equity longshort strategies are market neutral some hedge fund managers will maintain a long bias as is the case with socalled “” strategies with these strategies hedge funds have  exposure to long positions and  exposure to short positions other structures are also used such as  long and  short few hedge funds have a longterm short bias since the equity markets tend to move up over time equity longshort managers can also be distinguished by the geographic market in which they invest the sector in which they invest financial health care or technology for example or their investment style value or quantitative for example buying and selling two related stocks—for example two stocks in the same region or industry—is called a “paired trade” model it may limit risk to a specific subset of the market instead of the market in general equity longshort strategies have been used by sophisticated investors such as institutions for years they became increasingly popular among individual investors as traditional strategies struggled in the most recent bear market highlighting the need for investors to consider expanding their portfolios into innovative financial solutions   equity longshort strategies are not without risks these strategies have all the generic hedge fund risks for example hedge funds are typically not as liquid as mutual funds meaning it is more difficult to sell shares the strategies they use could lead to significant losses and they can have high fees additionally equity longshort strategies have some unique risks the main one is that the portfolio manager must correctly predict the relative performance of two stocks which can be difficult another risk results from what is referred to in the industry as “beta mismatch” while this is more complicated that we can explain in detail here essentially it means that when the stock market declines sharply long positions could lose more than short positions in summary equity longshort strategies may help increase returns in difficult market environments but also involve some risk as a result investors considering these strategies may want to ensure that their hedge funds follow strict rules to evaluate market risks and find good investment opportunities get comprehensive and uptodate information on   hedge funds funds of funds and ctas in the barclay

staff  april   leave a commentdavid bonderman became a multibillionaire buying and fixing up companies and then created a family office to manage a portion of his personal fortune that family office has grown into wildcat capital management and it now manages  billion for mr bonderman and a small group of his friends and family now wildcat is backing a new startup business infinity q that provides exposure to bonderman’s wildcat family office investment strategies under the structure of a liquid alternative mutual funddiversified alphathe infinity q diversified alpha fund iqdnx is an absolute return strategy fund that launched on september   the fund seeks a combination of exposures to volatility longshort equity relative value and global macro strategies according to its prospectusits volatility strategy involves long and short exposure to a diversified basket of derivatives across the major asset classes stocks bonds commodities currencies and interest ratesits longshort equity strategy involves establishing long and short positions in stocks and stockrelated securities including equity optionsits relative value strategy involves simultaneously buying and shortselling highly correlated securitiesits global macro strategy involves long and short exposure across asset classes with investment decisions made on the basis of the advisor’s global

is not new see brad balter on the confluence of hedge funds and liquid alts it is uncommon – at least to date “families recognize that over time it’s sometimes valuable to turn the services they created into a business” said bill woodson head of the north america family office group at citigroup inc’s private bank as quoted by bloomberg and since family offices often have teams evaluating and investing in alternative investments it wouldn’t be unrealistic to see more of them port those skills over to a mutual fundfor mr bonderman and his money managers the move into liquid alts is a winwin proposition mr bonderman remains free to manage tpg capital while infinity q is run by wildcat employees the employees are able to make more money for themselves and for mr bonderman by offering retail investors exposure to the alternative strategies that have generated  annualized returns for the family office since august  if infinity q can maintain that performance then the move into
