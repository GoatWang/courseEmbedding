and invested in a smallcap index fund he would have been  percentage points ahead i don’t agree with warren buffett he doesn’t agree with himself regarding investing in index funds either which is why he hired  investments managers instead of handing his cash to vanguard about passive investing but i love warren buffett’s following quote “when a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics it is the reputation of the business that remains intact” retail stocks have been a graveyard for dozens of brilliant investors before does anyone remember ackman’s target or jc penney fiascos how about eddie lampert’s sears investment activist investors can’t make people visit certain stores or buy certain juices or smoothies the only thing they can effectively do is to force the management to shut down unprofitable locations and try to minimize costs unfortunately what matters at the end of the day is whether consumers like the product or not
