and i hate to be a failure i hate and regret the failure of my marriages i would gladly give all my millions for just one lasting marital success coinbox telephoneedit getty famously had a pay phone installed at sutton place helping to seal his reputation as a miser getty placed diallocks on all the regular telephones limiting their use to authorized staff and the coinbox telephone was installed for others in his autobiography he described his reasons now for months after sutton place was purchased great numbers of people came in and out of the house some were visiting businessmen others were artisans or workmen engaged in renovation and refurbishing still others were tradesmen making deliveries of merchandise suddenly the sutton place telephone bills began to soar the reason was obvious each of the regular telephones in the house has direct access to outside lines and thus to longdistance and even overseas operators all sorts of people were making the best of a rare opportunity they were picking up sutton place phones and placing calls to girlfriends in geneva or georgia and to aunts uncles and third cousins twiceremoved in caracas and cape town the costs of their friendly chats were of course charged to the sutton place bill when speaking in a televised interview with alan whicker in february  getty said that he thought guests would want to use a payphone after  months getty explained the inandout traffic flow at sutton subsided management and operation of the house settled into a reasonable routine with that the paytelephone was removed and the diallocks were taken off the telephones in the house grandsons kidnappingedit on july   in rome kidnappers abducted yearold john paul getty iii and over the telephone demanded  million for his safe return however the family suspected a ploy by the rebellious teenager to extract money from his miserly grandfather john paul getty jr asked his father for the money but was refused in november  an envelope containing a lock of hair and a human ear arrived at a daily newspaper the second demand had been delayed three weeks by an italian postal strike the demand threatened that paul would be further mutilated unless the victims paid  million this is paul’s ear if we don’t get some money within  days then the other ear will arrive in other words he will arrive in little bits the cover of as i see it gettys autobiography when the kidnappers finally reduced their demands to  million getty senior agreed to pay no more than  million—the maximum that would be tax deductible he lent his son the remaining  at  interest paul iii was found alive in a filling station of lauria in the province of potenza shortly after the ransom was paid after his release paul iii called his grandfather to thank him for paying the ransom but getty refused to come to the phone nine people were later arrested for the kidnapping but only two were convicted paul iii was permanently affected by the trauma and became a drug addict after a stroke brought on by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol in  paul iii was rendered speechless nearly blind and partially paralyzed for the rest of his life he died  years later on february   at the age of  getty defended his initial refusal to pay the ransom on two points first he argued that to submit to the kidnappers demands would immediately place his other fourteen grandchildren at the risk of copycat kidnappers he added the second reason for my refusal was much broaderbased i contend that acceding to the demands of criminals and terrorists merely guarantees the continuing increase and spread of lawlessness violence and such outrages as terrorbombings skyjackings and the slaughter of hostages that plague our presentday world getty  pg deathedit getty died  june  sutton

limiting their use to authorized staff and the coinbox telephone was installed for others in his autobiography he described his reasons now for months after sutton place was purchased great numbers of people came in and out of the house some were visiting businessmen others were artisans or workmen engaged in renovation and refurbishing still others were tradesmen making deliveries of merchandise suddenly the sutton place telephone bills began to soar the reason was obvious each of the regular telephones in the house has direct access to outside lines and thus to longdistance and even overseas operators all sorts of people were making the best of a rare opportunity they were picking up sutton place phones and placing calls to girlfriends in geneva or georgia and to aunts uncles and third cousins twiceremoved in caracas and cape town the costs of their friendly chats were of course charged to the sutton place bill when speaking in a televised interview with alan whicker in february

italian postal strike the demand threatened that paul would be further mutilated unless the victims paid  million this is paul’s ear if we don’t get some money within  days then the other ear will arrive in other words he will arrive in little bits the cover of as i see it gettys autobiography when the kidnappers finally reduced their demands to  million getty senior agreed to pay no more than  million—the maximum that would be tax deductible he lent his son the remaining  at  interest paul iii was found alive in a filling station of lauria in the province of potenza shortly after the ransom was paid after his release paul iii called his grandfather to thank him for paying the ransom but getty refused to come to the phone nine people were later arrested for the kidnapping but only two were convicted paul iii was permanently affected by the trauma and became a drug addict after a stroke brought on by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol in  paul iii was rendered speechless nearly blind
