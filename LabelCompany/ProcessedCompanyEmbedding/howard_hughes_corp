did not like the beds design he called in plant engineers to design a customized bed equipped with hot and cold running water built in six sections and operated by  electric motors with pushbutton adjustments the hospital bed was designed by hughes specifically to alleviate the pain caused by moving with severe burn injuries despite the fact that he never had the chance to use the bed that he designed hughes bed served as a prototype for the modern hospital bed hughes doctors considered his recovery almost miraculous hughes however believed that neither miracle nor modern medicine contributed to his recovery instead asserting the natural lifegiving properties of freshsqueezed orange juice were responsible many attribute his longterm dependence on opiates to his use of codeine

donald received a  loan from hughes it has long been speculatedby whom that nixons drive to learn what the democrats were planning in  was based in part on his belief that the democrats knew about a later bribe that his friend bebe rebozo had received from hughes after nixon took office in late  donald nixon was collecting intelligence for his brother in preparation for the upcoming presidential election one of donalds sources was john h meier a former business adviser of hughes who had also worked with democratic national committee chair larry obrien meier in collaboration with former vice president hubert humphrey and others wanted to feed misinformation to the nixon campaign meier told donald that he was sure the democrats would win the election because larry obrien had a great deal of information on richard nixons illicit dealings with howard hughes that had never been released obrien did not actually have any such information but meier wanted nixon to think he did donald told his brother that obrien was in possession of damaging hughes information that could destroy his campaign terry lenzner who was the chief investigator for the senate watergate committee speculates that it was nixons desire to know what obrien knew about nixons dealings with hughes that may have partially motivated the watergate breakin physical declineedit hughes was eccentric and suffered from a

naked continually watching movies when he finally emerged in the summer of  his hygiene was terrible he had not bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks this may have been due to allodynia which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain after the screening room incident hughes moved into a bungalow at the beverly hills hotel where he also rented rooms for his aides his wife and numerous girlfriends he would sit naked in his bedroom with a pink hotel napkin placed over his genitals watching movies this may have been because hughes found the touch of

treatment in one year hughes spent an estimated  million at the hotel hughes began purchasing all restaurant chains and four star hotels that had been founded within the state of texas this included

objects to insulate himself from germs he would also notice dust stains or other imperfections on peoples clothes and demand that they take care of them once one of the most visible men in america hughes ultimately vanished from public view although tabloids continued to follow rumors of his behavior and whereabouts he was reported to be terminally ill mentally unstable or even dead injuries from numerous aircraft crashes caused hughes to spend much of his later life in pain and he eventually became addicted to codeine which he injected intramuscularly hughes had his hair cut and nails trimmed only once a year likely due to the pain caused by the rsdcrps which was caused by the plane crashes he also stored his urine in bottles hughes had this  chrysler new yorker equipped with an

residence between  and  he bought several other hotelcasinos including the castaways new frontier the landmark hotel and casino and the sands he bought the small silver slipper casino for the sole purpose of moving its trademark neon silver slipper visible from hughes bedroom it had apparently kept him awake at night after hughes left the desert inn hotel employees discovered that his drapes had not been opened during the time he lived there and had rotted through an unusual incident marked an earlier hughes connection to las vegas during his  engagement at the last frontier hotel flamboyant entertainer liberace mistook howard hughes for his lighting director instructing him to instantly bring up a blue light should he start to play clair de lune hughes nodded in compliance—but the hotels entertainment director arrived and introduced hughes to liberace hughes wanted to change the image of las vegas to something more glamorous as hughes wrote in a memo to an aide i like to think of las vegas in terms of a welldressed man in a dinner jacket and a beautifully jeweled and furred female getting out of an expensive car hughes bought several local television stations including klastv hughes considerable business holdings were overseen by a small panel unofficially dubbed the mormon mafia because of the many latterday saints on the committee led by frank william gay in addition to supervising daytoday business operations and hughes health they also went to great pains to satisfy hughes every whim for example hughes once became fond of baskinrobbins banana nut ice cream so his aides sought to secure a bulk shipment for him only to discover that baskinrobbins had discontinued the flavor they put in a request for the smallest amount the company could provide for a special order  gallons  l and had it shipped from los angeles a few days after the order arrived hughes announced he was tired of banana nut and wanted only french vanilla ice cream the desert inn ended up distributing free banana nut ice cream to casino customers for a year in a  interview ex–howard hughes communicator robert maheu said there is a rumor that there is still some banana nut ice cream left in the freezer it is most likely true as an owner of several major las vegas businesses hughes wielded much political and economic influence in nevada and elsewhere during the s and early s he disapproved of underground nuclear testing at the nevada test site hughes was concerned about the risk from residual nuclear radiation and attempted to halt the tests when the tests finally went through despite hughes efforts the detonations were powerful enough that the entire hotel where he was staying trembled due to the shock waves in two separate lastditch maneuvers hughes instructed his representatives to offer milliondollar bribes to both presidents lyndon b johnson and richard nixon in  jean peters filed for divorce the two had not lived together for many years peters requested a lifetime alimony payment of  a year adjusted for inflation and waived all claims to hughes estate hughes offered her a settlement of over a million dollars but she declined it hughes did not insist on a confidentiality agreement from peters as a condition of the divorce aides reported that hughes never spoke ill of her she refused to discuss her life with hughes and declined several lucrative offers from publishers and biographers peters would state only that she had not seen hughes for several years before their divorce and had only dealt with him by phone hughes was living in the intercontinental hotel near lake managua in nicaragua seeking privacy and security when a magnitude  earthquake damaged managua in december  as a precaution hughes moved to

had spent a total of  million on his many properties in las vegas memoir hoaxedit in  author clifford irving caused a media sensation when he claimed he had cowritten an authorized autobiography of hughes hughes was so reclusive that he did not immediately publicly refute irvings statement leading many to believe the irving book was genuine however before the books publication hughes finally

flight from freeport grand bahama to houston after receiving a call his senior counsel frank p morse ordered his staff to get his body on a plane and return him to the united states it was common that foreign countries would hold a corpse as ransom so that an estate could not be settled morse ordered the pilots to announce hughes death once they entered us airspacefull citation needed his reclusiveness and possible drug use made him practically unrecognizable his hair beard fingernails and toenails were long—his tall  ft  in  cm frame now weighed barely  pounds  kg and the fbi had to

rice and jean peters in this will hughes left his entire estate to the hughes medical institute as he had no connection to family and was seriously ill this is contrary to the many wills that have surfaced after his death the original will that included payments to aides never surfaced it was apparently in a home surrounding the desert inn golf course belonging to the mother of an assistant he had no desire to leave any money to family aides or churches including william gay and frank morsefull citation needed hughes was not mormon and had no reason to leave his estate to that church frank p morse is still the attorney of record for hughes gay has devoted his life to the church of jesus christ of latterday saintsfull citation needed a further  million was endowed to a gasstation owner

the sands hotel dummar said the man told him that he was hughes dummar later claimed that days after hughes death a mysterious man appeared at his gas station leaving an envelope containing the will on his desk unsure if the will was genuine and unsure of what to do dummar left the will at the lds church office in  after a sevenmonth trial a nevada court rejected the mormon will as a forgery and

money for the rescue despite his physical injuries hughes was proud that his mind was still working as he lay in his hospital bed he decided that he did not like the beds design he called in plant engineers to design a customized bed equipped with hot and cold running water built in six sections and operated by  electric motors with pushbutton adjustments the hospital bed was designed by hughes specifically to alleviate the pain caused by moving with severe burn injuries despite the fact that he never had the chance to use the bed that he designed hughes bed served as a prototype for the modern hospital bed hughes doctors considered his recovery almost miraculous hughes however believed that neither miracle nor modern medicine contributed to his recovery instead asserting the natural

scandaledit shortly before the  presidential election richard nixon was alarmed when it was revealed that his brother donald received a  loan from hughes it has long been speculatedby whom that nixons drive to learn what the democrats were planning in  was based in part on his belief that the democrats knew about a later bribe that his friend bebe rebozo had received from hughes after nixon took office in late  donald nixon was collecting intelligence for his brother in preparation for the upcoming presidential election one of donalds sources was john h meier a former business adviser of hughes who had also worked with democratic national committee chair larry obrien meier in collaboration with former vice president hubert humphrey and others wanted to feed misinformation to the nixon campaign meier told donald that he was sure the democrats would win the election because larry obrien had a great deal of information on richard nixons illicit dealings with howard hughes that had never been released obrien did not actually have any such information but meier wanted nixon to think he did donald told his brother that obrien was in possession of damaging hughes information that could destroy his campaign terry lenzner who was the chief investigator for the senate watergate committee speculates that it was nixons desire to know what obrien knew about nixons dealings with hughes that may have partially motivated the watergate breakin physical declineedit hughes was eccentric and suffered from a severe obsessivecompulsive disorder close friends of hughes reported that

instructions not to look at him nor speak to him unless spoken to throughout this period hughes sat fixated in his chair often naked continually watching movies when he finally emerged in the summer of  his hygiene was terrible he had not bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks this may have been due to allodynia which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain after the screening room incident hughes moved into a bungalow at the beverly hills hotel where he also rented rooms for his aides his wife and numerous girlfriends he would sit naked in his bedroom with a pink hotel napkin placed over his genitals watching movies this may have been because hughes found the touch of clothing painful due to allodynia he may have watched movies to distract himself

on a continuous loop in his home according to his aides he watched it  times hughes insisted on using tissues to pick up objects to insulate himself from germs he would also notice dust stains or other imperfections on peoples clothes and demand that they take care of them once one of the most visible men in america hughes ultimately vanished from public view although tabloids continued to follow rumors of his behavior and whereabouts he was reported to be terminally ill mentally unstable or even dead injuries from numerous aircraft crashes caused hughes to spend much of his later life in pain and he eventually became addicted to codeine which he injected intramuscularly hughes had his hair cut and nails trimmed only once a year likely due to the pain caused by the rsdcrps which was

new frontier the landmark hotel and casino and the sands he bought the small silver slipper casino for the sole purpose of moving its trademark neon silver slipper visible from hughes bedroom it had apparently kept him awake at night after hughes left the desert inn hotel employees discovered that his drapes had not been opened during the time he lived there and had rotted through an unusual incident marked an earlier hughes connection to las vegas during his  engagement at the last frontier hotel flamboyant entertainer liberace mistook howard hughes for his lighting director instructing him to instantly bring up a blue light should he start to play clair de lune hughes nodded in compliance—but the hotels entertainment director arrived and introduced hughes to liberace hughes wanted to change the image of las vegas to something more glamorous as hughes wrote in a memo to an aide i like to think of las vegas in terms of a welldressed man in a dinner jacket and a beautifully jeweled and furred female getting out of an expensive car hughes bought several local television stations including klastv hughes considerable business holdings were overseen by a small panel unofficially dubbed the mormon mafia because of the many latterday saints on the committee led by frank william gay in addition to supervising daytoday business operations and hughes health they also went to great pains to satisfy hughes every whim for example hughes once became fond of baskinrobbins banana nut ice cream so his aides sought to secure a bulk shipment for him only to discover that baskinrobbins had discontinued the flavor they put in a request for the smallest amount the company could provide for a special order  gallons  l and had it shipped from los angeles a few days after the order arrived hughes announced he was tired of banana nut and wanted only french vanilla ice cream the desert inn ended up distributing free banana nut ice cream to casino customers for a year in a  interview ex–howard hughes communicator robert maheu said there is a rumor that there is still some banana nut ice cream left in the freezer it is most likely true as an owner of several major las vegas businesses hughes wielded much political and economic influence in nevada and elsewhere during the s and early s he disapproved of underground nuclear testing at the nevada test site hughes was concerned about the risk from residual nuclear radiation and attempted to halt the tests when the tests finally went through despite hughes efforts the detonations were powerful enough that the entire hotel where he was staying trembled due to the shock waves in two separate lastditch maneuvers hughes instructed his representatives to offer milliondollar bribes to both presidents lyndon b johnson and richard nixon in  jean peters filed for divorce the two had not lived together for many years peters requested a lifetime alimony payment of  a year adjusted for inflation and waived all claims to hughes estate hughes offered her a settlement of over a million dollars but she declined it hughes did not insist on a confidentiality agreement from peters as a condition of the divorce aides reported that hughes never spoke ill of her she refused to discuss her life with hughes and declined several lucrative offers from publishers and biographers peters would state only that she had not seen hughes for several years before their divorce and had only dealt with him by phone hughes was living in the intercontinental hotel near lake managua in nicaragua seeking privacy and security when a magnitude  earthquake damaged managua in december  as a precaution hughes moved to the nicaraguan national palace and stayed there as a guest of anastasio somoza debayle before leaving for florida

penthouse of the xanadu beach resort  marina for the last four years of his life hughes had spent a total of  million on his many properties in las vegas memoir hoaxedit in  author clifford irving caused a media sensation when he claimed he had cowritten an authorized autobiography of hughes hughes was so reclusive that he did not immediately publicly refute irvings statement leading many to believe the irving book was genuine however before the books publication hughes finally denounced irving in a teleconference and the entire project was eventually exposed as a hoax irving was later convicted of fraud and spent  months in prison in  the orson welles film f for fake included a section on the hughes biography hoax in  the hoax by clifford irving was published in the united kingdom

methodist hospital in houston texas other accounts indicate that he died on the flight from freeport grand bahama to houston after receiving a call his senior counsel frank p morse ordered his staff to get his body on a plane and return him to the united states it was common that foreign countries would hold a corpse as ransom so that an estate could not be settled morse ordered the pilots to

hughes who had also worked with democratic national committee chair larry obrien meier in collaboration with former vice president hubert humphrey and others wanted to feed misinformation to the nixon campaign meier told donald that he was sure the democrats would win the election because larry obrien had a great deal of information on richard nixons illicit dealings with howard hughes that had never been released obrien did not actually have any such information but meier wanted nixon to think he did donald told his brother that obrien was in possession of damaging hughes information that

his own aircraft company designed built and flew his own aircraft and broke several world air speed records  his most famous aircraft the hercules nicknamed the spruce goose which was as he discovered an underpowered wooden seaplane designed to carry  passengers that plane was completed in  but flew only once over a distance of one mile despite having eight pratt  whitney wasp major engines among the most powerful radial piston engines of the day throughout his life he shunned publicity eventually becoming a recluse but still controlling his vast business interests from sealedoff hotel suites

december  divorced trivia  ice station zebra  is reported to have been his favorite movie the  dvd release was packaged with a trailer for the aviator  before his death he lived as a recluse and albert r broccoli the producer of the james bond franchise used his reclusiveness from the public as a model for the character willard whyte in diamonds are forever  hughes was a fan of the james bond films and he kept a mm print of the film as a part of his private collection broccoli also gave him mm print films of all the earlier bondfilms nephew of actorscreenwriter rupert hughes the las vegas casinos he once owned were castaways desert inn frontier landmark sands and silver slipper all have since been demolished he bought las vegas television station klas channel  so that he could watch movies into the night if he fell asleep during a film he would call up the station and order that the scene he missed be replayed while he was staying in las vegas desert inn hotelcasino resort he bought the establishment in order to avoid being evicted his father was the inventor of the hughes rock eater a selfsharpening drill bit used for drilling oil wells that is still in use today hughes inherited several million dollars but earned the vast majority of his wealth from his own business ventures hughes aircraft and hughes helicopters alone were worth  billion when they were finally sold in the early s was a major stockholder in an airline that later became twa he once had an air purifier installed in a car with sealed windows the purifier cost more than the car and took up most of the trunk in his later years he insisted that his personal assistants be mormons members of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints reportedly this was because hughes did not want any of his personal assistants drunk on the job and mormons are forbidden to drink alcohol attended the prestigious rice university in the s before dropping out and moving to hollywood and studying at cal tech in public he would often speak with his hand covering his mouth for fear of being lipread after hughes died terry moore claimed they had secretly married on a yacht in international waters in  and never divorced these marriages were ruses hughes was known to employ in order to take advantage of young women despite the fact that moore married two other men after she married hughes his estate settled with her for an undisclosed amount in  authorized to be awarded a congressional gold medal  august   stat  award was  in recognition of the achievements of howard hughes in advancing the science of aviation and thus bringing great credit to his country throughout the world humble texas where he was born is pronounced umbull the h is silent romantically linked with katharine hepburn bette davis olivia de havilland ginger rogers ava gardner and faith domergue he went out of his way to discover attractive young starlets he continued this until he stopped producing films in the late s in the s robert mitchum was selected by hughes to appear in a series of films he was producing hughes considered mitchum a friend but as a paranoid recluse hardly met the actor mitchum was halfway put off and halfway amused by this crazy old man and clearly saw that he was a surrogate for hughes as the strapping actor romanced young starlets on screen he became obsessed with the communist threat in the early s having written a series of paranoid articles on the subject that he sent out to newspapers from seclusion it has variously been hypothesized that his crazed behavior in his later reclusive years was caused by brain damage resulting from a series of accidents ocd bipolar disorder or even paranoidschizophrenia when he produced films he became obsessed with busty actresses and famously invented a prototype of the pushup bra to make jane russell as busty as possible in the outlaw  most of the movies he produced are typlified by beautiful halfnaked women and nonsensical action sequences his reported appearance when he was found dead was extremely bizarre he was covered in uncut matted hair had extremely long toenails and the once strapping  billionaire weighed an incredibly low  pounds the aviator  the movie based on his life was released on the day after what would have been his th birthday houston has two major commercial airports william p hobby airport and houston intercontinental airport for a brief period hobby airport was renamed howard hughes airport houstonians objected to it being named after a living person so this change was shortlived and the name eventually reverted back to hobby airport in  intercontinental airport was renamed bush intercontinental after the stillliving president george bush whose son was governor of texas at the time had a strong aversion to black people for many years he had a private screening room at the samuel goldwyn studios in hollywood where he would watch movies by himself at night in  he found out that the cast of porgy and bess  an allblack musical being made on the lot was using the screening room each afternoon to watch the footage that had been shot the previous day horrified that blacks used the same room he didand that some may even have sat in the same seat he didhe shut down the screening room left the goldwyn lot and for the remainder of his life never returned to it hughes was also known as a rabid antisemite but specific examples of him acting on his feelings are scarce like many ultraconservative anticommunists of the postwwii era hughes believed that many jews were either communists or sympathetic to communism became obsessed with communism during the mccarthy red scare era his film the whip hand  was originally about a group of nazi scientists who smuggled the body of adolf hitler into the us and worked to revive hitler in order to try to take over the world again after it was finished hughes had it reshot at great expense to change the villains into nazi scientists who are now working for the communists and have taken over a small american town in order to test germ warfare experiments on its citizens before they unleash the deadly viruses in the us the film was a major flop on july   rosemary decamp and her husband were in their house in beverly hills california when an aircraft piloted by hughes crashed into the roof of the house next door and its wing was torn off and sliced through the roof of her house landing in the bedroom where she and her husband were the plane an experimental model hughes had developed called the xf had experienced propeller reversal on the right engine after taking off from the airport at nearby culver city it finally came to rest after crashing through the wall of the house of another of decamps neighbors and exploding hughes was rescued from the cockpit by marine sgt william lloyd durkin hughes was severely injured with a broken leg multiple cracked ribs on his left side a dislodged heart a fractured skull burns and abrasions over  of his body he was given a  chance to survive he paid for the damage to the houses in the neighborhood out of his own pocket and sent durkin a weekly paycheck until the day he died played by leonardo dicaprio in the aviator  victor holchak in hughes and harlow angels in hell  tommy lee jones in the amazing howard hughes  jason robards in melvin and howard  terry

portrayal the hangar that used to house his famous airplane the spruce goose has been used in subsequent years as a filming studio he was a staunch supporter of the republican party and an active anticommunist was stan lees inspiration for tony stark aka iron man like hughes stark inherited a business from his father as a tribute to hughes tony starks father was named howard stark restauranteur dave chasen reported that hughes ate the same dinner all the time a triple glass of tomato juice a salad a thin butterfly steak and coffee chasen also observed that like most hollywood

purifier installed in a car with sealed windows the purifier cost more than the car and took up most of the trunk in his later years he insisted that his personal assistants be mormons members of the

way to discover attractive young starlets he continued this until he stopped producing films in the late s in the s robert mitchum was selected by hughes to appear in a series of films he was producing hughes considered mitchum a friend but as a paranoid recluse hardly met the actor mitchum was halfway put off and halfway amused by this crazy old man and clearly saw that he was a surrogate for hughes as the strapping actor romanced young starlets on screen he became obsessed with the communist threat in the early s having written a series of paranoid articles on the subject that he sent out to newspapers from seclusion it has variously been hypothesized that his crazed behavior in his later reclusive years was caused by brain damage resulting from a series of accidents ocd bipolar disorder or even paranoidschizophrenia when he produced films he became obsessed with busty actresses and famously invented a prototype of the pushup bra to make jane russell as busty as possible in

covered in uncut matted hair had extremely long toenails and the once strapping  billionaire weighed an incredibly low  pounds the aviator  the movie based on his life was released on the day after what would have been his th birthday houston has two major commercial airports william p hobby airport and houston intercontinental airport for a brief period hobby airport was renamed howard hughes airport houstonians objected to it being named after a living person so this change was shortlived and the name eventually reverted back to hobby airport in  intercontinental airport was renamed bush

samuel goldwyn studios in hollywood where he would watch movies by himself at night in  he found out that the cast of porgy and bess  an allblack musical being made on the lot was using the screening room each afternoon to watch the footage that had been shot the previous day horrified that blacks used the same room he didand that some may even have sat in the same seat he didhe shut down the screening room left the goldwyn lot and for the remainder of his life never returned to it hughes was also known as a rabid antisemite but specific examples of him acting on his feelings are scarce like many ultraconservative anticommunists of the postwwii era hughes believed that many jews were either communists or sympathetic to communism became obsessed with communism during the mccarthy red scare era his film the whip hand  was originally about a group of nazi scientists who smuggled the body of adolf hitler into the us and worked to revive hitler in order to try to take over the world again after it was finished hughes had it reshot at great expense to change the villains into nazi scientists who are now working for the communists and have taken over a small american town in order to test germ warfare experiments on its citizens before they unleash the deadly viruses in the us the film was a major flop on july   rosemary decamp and her husband were in their house in beverly hills california when an aircraft piloted by hughes crashed into the roof of the house next door and its wing was torn off and sliced through the roof of her house landing in the bedroom where she and her husband were the plane an experimental model hughes had developed called the xf had experienced propeller reversal on the right engine after taking off from the airport at nearby culver city it

howard hughes corp continues to convert developments into a steady income stream the real estate developers portfolio keeps growing matthew dilallo tmfmd may   at am howard hughes nysehhc has spent the past few years developing real estate assets that it intends to operate that strategic shift will allow the company to generate a stable source of income to offset the lumpiness of master planned community land sales and other development projects its a shift that paid off during the first quarter by helping the company overcome declining property sales to post slightly higher earnings howard hughes results the raw numbers metric q  q  yearoveryear change noi from operating assets  million  million  core ffo  million  million  core ffo per share    data source howard hughes corp noi net operating income ffo funds from operations  image source getty images what happened with howard hughes this quarter  the stabilization continues net operating income from howard hughes operating assets continues to improve due to the stabilization of its portfolio furthermore the company placed a  leased office building in columbia maryland and a unit selfstorage facility in the woodlands texas into service during the quarter  land sales closed in the master planned community segment dropped  to  million caused by lower land sales in its summerlin community meanwhile the summit joint venture in summerlin is developing on schedule enabling the company to recognize  million of earnings during the quarter the strategic developments segment is progressing one of the largest projects is ward village in hawaii where the company has four condominium towers under construction units have been selling at a brisk pace with  more sold during the quarter as of midapril  of the units under construction were either closed or under contract howard hughes completed a  million bond issuance during the quarter and used the proceeds to redeem  million of higherinterest debt what management had to say  ceo david weinreb described the companys progress during the quarter our first quarter results were driven by further improvement in our operating assets segment as our portfolio matures and stabilizes we also continued to make progress in our strategic developments segment where we completed and delivered both one merriweather and our first selfstorage product in the woodlands delivering these assets marks the ongoing transformation of our strategic developments into a predominantly revenue generating portfolio as we set out to create longterm shareholder value the focus of howard hughes over the past few years has been to slowly transition from a real estate developmentfocused company to an operating company that transformation will enable it to generate a more predictable revenue stream so its quarterly results arent so reliant on property sales that transition clearly paid off during the first quarter as rising net operating income from these assets more than offset a decline in land sales within its master planned communities as well as a drop in condo unit sales in hawaii meanwhile that income should continue to rise thanks to the addition of two more assets to the operating portfolio during the quarter looking forward  howard hughes future will remain focused on three things managing its growing portfolio of operating assets extracting value from its master planned communities and driving significant growth from its strategic developments shortly after the quarter ended the company added two new projects to its development pipeline by securing a buildtosuit lease for a twobuilding campus in summerlin and an anchor tenant for a planned downtown office building in chicago the company expects to complete those projects in  and
