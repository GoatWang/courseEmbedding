director and future growth scott randall on a new product called smart posted by gabrielle guerrera on thu oct   tweet scott randallfounderrandall consulting g hi scott thank you for being a part of nonstop innovations what has randall consulting been working on lately s weve actually been working on a new product called smart system management and automatic recovery for tandem that will be released by the end of the year it automates system recovery and monitors and reports errors were currently looking for early adopters so we can move into beta   g thats great is this a unique solution or is it comparable to other solutions s there is a more expensive product that some of our clients are currently using but because the price tag is so high and the functionality is more than what most companies need we saw an opportunity to develop our own solution weve noticed that in general nonstop users want to learn from errors and recover from errors but there are features of the existing product that are unnecessary or unwanted for example in a single day there could be hundreds of individual error messages for users to deal with which can be overwhelming and also annoying so we are including a feature that will allow error messages to be grouped together making it easier for customers to analyze and deal with errors our goal is really to provide the features that customers need and want   g could you tell me a little bit about your other product the nonstop productivity toolbox s sure npt is our flagship product with over  integrated tools all developed internally and its main purpose is to increase productivity by automating tasks for example a customer was migrating from one footprint to anothersseries to bladesand needed to move their data one of the tools called repart short for repartitioning loads data in parallel and was really essential to their migration it took a task that would have taken weeks down to hours this is the only software that automates the process of loading data in parallel which is otherwise a cumbersome process   g i also saw that youre presenting on big data at the nonstop tbc s yes the session is called “big data and sqlmx update” it isnt a vendor theater so it is purely educational g excellent well i look forward to seeing you in san jose   abstract for big data and sqlmx which will be presented by scott at pm on monday november th at tbc big data means different things to different organizations for some it’s an avalanche of data for others it can be a hefty transaction load wide rows or almost any extreme data metric in either case big data must be analyzed to provide value this presents a number of challenges hadoop is a recently touted scalable solution for unstructured big data relying on parallelism and distribution of data for performance how different is sqlmx nonstop sqlmx is designed for structured data and the deep analytics required for business intelligence sqlmx was built on the nonstop foundation that defined parallelism scalability and availability and with features that allow equal distribution of data through hash keys and partitioning features combine highly available scalable nearly unlimited enterprise san storage capacity and no data is too big for sqlmx topics randall consulting  broad street suite  phone  email infonuwavetechcom hpe nonstop solutions

artists  randall scott randall scott randall scott is an internationally known wildlife artist who takes you on exciting adventures through his intriguing art prints and posters of the underwater world a native californian and accomplished diver randall grew up fascinated by jacques cousteau’s adventures and “sea hunt” randall’s passion for art was fuelled by his father who was himself a highly recognized western landscape artist and his mother a watercolor artist in addition to passing on their natural talents they shared with him many techniques helped him explore varied styles and introduced him to other skilled artists art like diving gave randall freedom and discovery of his own skills randall has successfully combined these two diverse pursuits in his art prints and posters after years of honing his artistic and diving skills he is considered one of today’s finest underwater and marine artist offering a truly authentic and sensitive account of the underwater world his ultimate goal with each new painting is to bring audiences under the water surface randall paints underwater scenes realistically “i want to give people an opportunity to see ocean life as it really is as if you would be going down with a mask for the first time” he searches his subjects through observation and underwater photography his travels have taken him all over the world from his native california  to australia the south pacific the caribbean sea and florida from his trips to truk scene of hellish world war ii fighting and palau in micronesia came the inspiration for a series of underwater world war ii era airplane wrecks that have become quite popular these airplanes include a p a japanese zero a p a b bomber a dauntless dive bomber a p a me and a fu corsair for a serious scuba diver diving these wrecks is more exciting than anything other than perhaps finding a wrecked spanish galleon randall’s art prints and posters are featured at both art and scuba shows and has been shown in many of the finest artistic wildlife and diving magazines all over the world randall also contributed to two books “wildlife painting step by step” and “wildlife the artist’s view”
