pextoc↑toppreviousnext↓bottomjust�st� exhibit  farnam street partners lp letterhead march   board of directors oi corporation po box   graham road college station texas  gentleman as a significant shareholder of oi corporation we believe oi corporations board of directors has failed at capital allocation and disappointingly given the companys most recent press release we do not believe this is likely to change anytime soon last week oi corporation filed an k indicating three of the five board members would be retiring one by december   one by may  and one by the  annual meeting at this point the majority of the board members have announced retirement from the board but still serve as board members we believe the retiring board members should be replaced as soon as possible we believe board members who have significant ownership positions in the company are the best board members for shareholders to quote warren buffett from his  letter to shareholders to find new directors we will look through our shareholders list for people who directly or in their family have had large berkshire holdings  in the millions of dollars  for a long time individuals making that cut should automatically meet two of our tests namely that they be interested in berkshire and shareholderoriented farnam street partners is the second largest shareholder oi corporation our initial d filing on december   expressed our opinion that the board of directors should authorize and implement a share repurchase program to address the companys overcapitalized balance sheet and create shareholder value during the period  through nine months of  oi corporation generated  million from operating activities during this period the company did not pay out any dividends or make any significant acquisitions and only made a minimal share repurchase of  in  it did make one investment of  in intelligent ion inc which was subsequently acquired and written down by  oi corporations september   balance sheet states cash and current investments totaled  million or approximately  of the market value of oi corporation at that time farnam street partners invests in companies that generate strong cash flows and oi corporation accomplishes this ultimately however companies have to reinvest the cash flows or return them to the shareholders oi corporation has failed at this during the  through september  period last week we were disappointed to learn the majority of the board the individuals making the capital allocation decisions for the shareholders have announced their retirements although they will continue charting the strategic course of oi corporation we believe this sends a clear message that the board is and will be in a state of future discontinuity given the stated retirement schedules of three out of its five members the outcome of this discontinuity will most likely mean that the use of the disproportionate cash position held by the company wont and cannot be prudently agreed upon until the new board is assembled we believe the new board should be put in place as soon as possible we believe shareholders of oi corporation will be better served by board members that have a significant ownership stake and have nominated ray cabillot and peter haeg to the board farnam street partners currently owns  shares or  of oi corporation sincerely farnam street
