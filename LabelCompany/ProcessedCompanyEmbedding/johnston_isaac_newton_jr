johnston on  february  tweetcomments  please log in to add your comment report abusetranscript of newtons  laws of motiona brief history of the study of motionpeople have been curious about how things move for as long as history has been recorded aristotle first proposed that all objects were naturally at a state of rest until acted upon by a force over  years ago my hero galileo galilei proposed that objects in motion are in an equally natural state what does this meanthe short version an object in its natural state of motion will remain in that state at a constant velocity until an outside force acts upon the objectnewtons first law of motionevery object continues in its state of rest or of uniform velocity in a straight line as long as no net force acts on itnewton and galileo recognized that there are numerous unseen forces at play here on earth newtons  laws of motionthis realization was the basis for sir isaacnewtons first law of motionthroughout your life you will hear many different ways to define forcein physics force refers to a push or pull upon an object resulting from the objects interaction with another object contact force consequence of physicalinteraction frictionactionatadistance force physcal contactis not required gravitynewtons second law of motionthe acceleration of an object is directlyproportional to the net force acting on it and is inversely proportional to theobjects mass testing the lawnot being deterred by this they measured the force of gravity by reducing the force of friction by rolling bearings down inclined planesfinding that regardless of weight the bearings would always reach the same height from where they originated conservation of energyhttpphetcoloradoedusimshtmlenergyskateparkbasicslatestenergyskateparkbasicsenhtmlnewtons third law of motionwhenever an object exerts a forceon a second object the second object exerts an equal force on the first object in the opposite directionwhat is forcewhat does this meansimply stated when you push against the wall you feel the wall pushing backwhen you pedal your bicycleall you do is turn the wheelswhen the wheels exert force on the ground the ground pushes backthis pushback is what makes the bicyclemove friction must be present fun physics videoyou can only feel the forces
