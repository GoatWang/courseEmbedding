companys competitive position and shareholder value dougs appointment demonstrates our commitment to a stronger more independent and experienced board that is focused on advancing the interests of all shareholders friedman continued on behalf of the entire board i want to thank mark milstein for agreeing to step aside and make room for doug crocker to immediately join the board we all appreciate his years of service and his lifelong commitment to associated estates i am delighted and honored to join associated estates at such an important time in the companys history said mr crocker today

planning committee of the board together with the other committee members has been tasked with overseeing this review of the companys strategy portfolio and business our board is committed to maximizing shareholder value and will undertake a thorough review of our opportunities to accomplish that objective commented jeff friedman while the board is not opposed to a potential sale of the company we are opposed to selling the company for less than its worth enlisting doug crocker an accomplished executive with extensive industry experience to lead our finance and planning committee and their efforts and engaging citi to provide additional analysis and advice will ensure our review is both impartial and exhaustive friedman continued as we begin our review with the help of our financial advisors our intention is to analyze the companys strategy assets and opportunities to optimize shareholder value we will continue to develop and refine our business plan with a singular focus on maximizing value for all associated estates shareholders and i am confident we will achieve our objective concluded mr crocker board approves corporate governance enhancements the associated estates board of directors has approved the following actions to further enhance the companys governance standards seeking shareholder approval at the  annual meeting of shareholders to eliminate the companys  share ownership limit the company has regularly waived this limit to allow institutional shareholders to acquire shares in excess of the limit but such waiver will no longer be needed if this proposed change is approved by shareholders redeeming the companys shareholder rights plan and eliminating the executive committee of the board which the company has used in the past to declare dividends in between regular meetings of the board of directors in taking these actions we want to send the clear message to our shareholders and the broader investor community that associated estates remains committed to the highest standards of corporate governance said james schoff chairman of the nominating and corporate governance committee todays additional governance enhancements reinforce that commitment at the same time the board is being responsive to feedback weve received from our shareholders proxy advisory firms and reit industry best practices the company will continue to review additional corporate governance enhancements including further changes to the composition of the board of directors as part of this commitment we look forward to bringing on to the board two additional highlyrespected independent directors in  to that end associated estates has retained ferguson partners to assist with this initiative mr schoff added these latest actions by the board follow the numerous enhancements the company has implemented in recent years to elevate its corporate governance policies and compensation practices including added a clawback provision to the equity based award plan added a double trigger changeincontrol feature to the equity based award plan eliminated the evergreen provision and the tax gross up provision in the ceos contract adopted robust minimum share ownership requirements for directors and section  officers modified the directors deferred compensation plan to facilitate payment of deferred compensation including cash and related earnings in shares upon distribution reduced the cash retainer portion and increased the equity based component of directors compensation and increased the percentage of independent directors to   of nonemployee directors each of whom is elected annually recent discussions with land and buildings the independent directors and management continue to seek to avoid the distraction and expense of a proxy contest with jonathan litt at land and buildings representatives of the company and the board have had several conversations and in person meetings with jonathan litt and scot sellers one of land and buildings director nominees with the goal of reaching a settlement that serves the best interests of all shareholders the company indicated its willingness to have two of land and buildings director nominees join the board and participate in the business review regrettably mr litt and mr sellers have refused to work collaboratively to reach any settlement unless they and their nominees are given control of the companys entire board land and buildings unwillingness to reach a settlement that would see two of its nominees join the board and participate in the business review demonstrates that land and buildings has no interest in working collaboratively with the board to advance the interests of all other shareholders commented mr schoff chairman of the nominating and corporate governance committee instead land and buildings appears to be predisposed to imposing its will on the company in seeking to take total control of the board of directors through threats or a proxy contest mr schoff added it was our preference to bring doug crocker alongside two of mr litts nominees onto the board to benefit all shareholders douglas crocker ii douglas crocker ii is
