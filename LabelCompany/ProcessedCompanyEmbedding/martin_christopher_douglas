challenges but we see greenshoots for the businesses coupled with the discipled management of liberty media the makes the riskreward to owning the shares at the current depressed share price compelling ad supported while we expect continued pressure on active users and listener hours in q app tracking data has shown strengthening usage in may and june over levels in april pandora has opportunity to increase ad rpms through a combination of increasing ad loads increasingly monetizing auto and ce the addition of programmatic in h video ads and increasing premium direct pricing   macquarie analysts commented we remain skeptical that verizon could pursue one or both of these assets but think it’s worth considering and could push things along between sirip we remain neutral on pandora as share movement is now largely driven by the whims of ma   piper jaffray companies analysts commented pandora shares remain under pressure as liberty and siriusxm continue to flipflop in their public stance on takeover prospects while we continue to believe that libertysiriusxm remains a potential buyer the price will likely depend on the success of pandoras new premium and plus offerings to that end we conducted a second survey of pandora users to reassess consumer demand for the products amid recent competitive actions by amazon and spotify our survey focused on the intent of current pandora users to subscribe to the enhanced pandora plus  per month plan and the fullfeatured ondemand pandora premium service  per month we found demand from current pandora listeners for the pandora premium remained largely unchanged at  however interest in pandora plus has diminished from  to  the survey continues to illustrates meaningful pentup demand for pandoras new offerings supporting our positive outlook on the shares   wells fargo  company analysts commented we analyze this data monthly to check for significant deviations from runrate uses to build our full quarter estimate for adsupported hours we remind investors that with the increased focus on driving subscriptions of pandora’s adfree plus product and the impending rollout of pandora’s full ondemand product pandora premium ad supported hours growth will over time become a less important driver of total company revenue growth based on our analysis we remain confident in our current q hrs forecast and
