financial measures may be useful in certain instances to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods management believes that organic net sales provide for a more complete understanding of underlying business trends of regional and segment performance by excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of acquisitions in addition within this release including the supplemental information attached hereto reference is made to adjusted diluted eps adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda is a metric used by management to evaluate segment performance and frequently used by the financial community which provides insight into an organization’s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies since interest taxes depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies adjusted ebitda also is one of the measures used for determining the company’s debt covenant adjusted ebitda excludes certain items that are unusual in nature or not comparable from period to period adjusted ebitda margin reflects adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales of the company organic adjusted ebitda excludes the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions the company’s management uses adjusted diluted eps as one means of analyzing the company’s current and future financial performance and identifying trends in its financial condition and results of operations management believes that adjusted diluted eps is a useful measure for providing further insight into our operating performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next an income tax adjustment is included in adjusted diluted eps to exclude the impact of the valuation allowance against deferred taxes and other taxrelated items in order to reflect a normalized ongoing effective tax rate of  the company’s management believes that adjusted free cash flow is useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the company’s ability to service and repay its debt and meet its working capital requirements adjusted free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for pretax income net income cash provided by used in operating activities or other statement of income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap or as a measure of profitability or liquidity in addition the calculation of adjusted free cash flow does not reflect cash used to service debt and therefore does not reflect funds available for investment or discretionary uses the company provides this information to investors to assist in comparisons of past present and future operating results and to assist in highlighting the results of ongoing operations while the company’s management believes that nongaap measurements are useful supplemental information such adjusted results are not intended to replace the company’s gaap financial results

wwwspectrumbrandscomnongaap measurementsmanagement believes that certain nongaap financial measures may be useful in certain instances to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods management believes that organic net sales provide for a more complete understanding of underlying business trends of regional and segment performance by excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of acquisitions in addition within this release including the supplemental information attached hereto reference is made to adjusted diluted eps adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda is a metric used by management to evaluate segment performance and frequently used by the financial community which provides insight into an organization’s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies since interest taxes depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies adjusted ebitda also is one of the measures used for determining the company’s debt covenant adjusted ebitda excludes certain items that are unusual in nature or not comparable from period to period adjusted ebitda margin reflects adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales of the company organic adjusted ebitda excludes the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions the company’s management uses adjusted diluted eps as one means of analyzing the company’s current and future financial performance and identifying trends in its financial condition and results of operations management believes that adjusted diluted eps is a useful measure for providing further insight into our operating performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next an income tax adjustment is included in adjusted diluted eps to exclude the impact of the valuation allowance against deferred taxes and other taxrelated items in order to reflect a normalized ongoing effective tax rate of  the
