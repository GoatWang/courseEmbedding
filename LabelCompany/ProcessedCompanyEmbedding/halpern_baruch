baruch halpern book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the birth of the west stems from the rejection of tradition all our evidence for this influence comes from the axial period  bce baruch halpern explores the impact of changing cosmologies and social relations on cultural change in that era especially from mesopotamia to israel and greece but extending across the mediterranean not least to egypt and italy in this volume he shows how an explosion of international commerce and exchange which can be understood as a renaissance led to the redefinition of selfhood in various cultures and to reformation the process inevitably precipitated an enlightenment this has happened over and over in human history and in academic or cultural fields

of georgia he was a leader of the archaeological digs at tel megiddo  as well as of an archaeological survey in southeastern cilicia turkey as an undergraduate at harvard in  he wrote a political analysis of the bible which subsequently influenced research into its authorship he is noted for his use of archaeological information to interpret the meaning of biblical texts for example the explanation of ehuds murder of king eglon and escape without detection from the upper room see judges  in halperns book the first historians the hebrew bible and history pp – he has said you cannot know the culture without knowing the material culture either so we need to combine text with whats in the ground and when our evidence is a little dirigible we also need ethnological help preferably

articulated in a  publication involves the differentiation of the state god yhwh from his former subordinates and colleagues collectively the baal or the baals this grew into alienation especially around and after the fall of israel ca  and the assyrian devastation of judah in  economically specialization and the operation of comparative advantage spread partly as a result of competing operative trade networks this led to partial industrialization and to relative urbanization intellectually the tradedriven renaissance in intellectual exchange provoked a reformation of which the
