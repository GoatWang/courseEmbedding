unincorporated organization with two or more members is generally classified as a partnership for federal tax purposes if its members carry on a trade business financial operation or venture and divide its profits however a joint undertaking merely to share expenses is not a partnership for example coownership of property maintained and rented or leased is not a partnership unless the coowners provide services to the tenants the rules you must use to determine whether an organization is classified as a partnership changed for organizations formed after  organizations formed after    an organization formed after  is classified as a partnership for federal tax purposes if it has two or more members and it is none of the following an organization formed under a federal or state law that refers to it as incorporated or as a corporation body corporate or body politic an organization formed under a state law that refers to it as a jointstock company or jointstock association an insurance company certain banks an organization wholly owned by a state local or foreign government an organization specifically required to be taxed as a corporation by the internal revenue code for example certain publicly traded partnerships certain foreign organizations identified in section b of the regulations a taxexempt organization a real estate investment trust an organization classified as a trust under section  of the regulations or otherwise subject to special treatment under the internal revenue code any other organization that elects to be classified as a corporation by filing form  for more information see the instructions for form  limited liability company   a limited liability company llc is an entity formed under state law by filing articles of organization as an llc unlike a partnership none of the members of an llc are personally liable for its debts an llc may be classified for federal income tax purposes as either a partnership a corporation or an entity disregarded as an entity separate from its owner by applying the rules in regulations section  see form  and section  of the regulations for more details a domestic llc with at least two members that doesnt file form  is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes organizations formed before    an organization formed before  and classified as a partnership under the old rules will generally continue to be classified as a partnership as long as the organization has at least two members and doesnt elect to be classified as a corporation by filing form  community property    spouses who own a qualified entity defined below can choose to classify the entity as a partnership for federal tax purposes by filing the appropriate partnership tax returns they can choose to classify the entity as a sole proprietorship by filing a schedule c form  listing one spouse as the sole proprietor a change in reporting position will be treated for federal tax purposes as a conversion of the entity   a qualified entity is a business entity that meets all the following requirements the business entity is wholly owned by spouses as community property under the laws of a state a foreign country or a possession of the united states no person other than one or both spouses would be considered an owner for federal tax purposes the business entity is not treated as a corporation   for more information about community property see publication  community property publication  discusses the community property laws of arizona california idaho louisiana nevada new mexico texas washington and wisconsin family partnership members of a family can be partners however family members or any other person will be recognized as partners only if one of the following requirements is met if capital is a material incomeproducing factor they acquired their capital interest in a bona fide transaction even if by gift or purchase from another family member actually own the partnership interest and actually control the interest if capital is not a material incomeproducing factor they joined together in good faith to conduct a business they agreed that contributions of each entitle them to a share in the profits and some capital or service has been or is provided by each partner capital is material   capital is a material incomeproducing factor if a substantial part of the gross income of the business comes from the use of capital capital is ordinarily an incomeproducing factor if the operation of the business requires substantial inventories or investments in plants machinery or equipment capital is not material   in general capital is not a material incomeproducing factor if the income of the business consists principally of fees commissions or other compensation for personal services performed by members or employees of the partnership capital interest   a capital interest in a partnership is an interest in its assets that is distributable to the owner of the interest in either of the following situations the owner withdraws from the partnership the partnership liquidates   the mere right to share in earnings and profits is not a capital interest in the partnership gift of capital interest   if a family member or any other person receives a gift of a capital interest in a partnership in which capital is a material incomeproducing factor the donees distributive share of partnership income is subject to both of the following restrictions it must be figured by reducing the partnership income by reasonable compensation for services the donor renders to the partnership the donees distributive share of partnership income attributable to donated capital must not be proportionately greater than the donors distributive share attributable to the donors capital purchase   for purposes of determining a partners distributive share an interest purchased by one family member from another family member is considered a gift from the seller the fair market value of the purchased interest is considered donated capital for this purpose members of a family include only spouses ancestors and lineal descendants or a trust for the primary benefit of those persons example a father sold  of his business to his son the resulting partnership had a profit of  capital is a material incomeproducing factor the father performed services worth  which is reasonable compensation and the son performed no services the  must be allocated to the father as compensation of the remaining  of profit due to capital at least  or  must be allocated to the father since he owns a  capital interest the sons share of partnership profit cannot be more than  business owned and operated by spouses   if spouses carry on a business together and share in the profits and losses they may be partners whether or not they have a formal partnership agreement if so they should report income or loss from the business on form  they should not report the income on a schedule c form  in the name of one spouse as a sole proprietor however the spouses can elect not to treat the joint venture as a partnership by making a qualified joint venture election qualified joint venture election   a qualified joint venture whose only members are spouses filing a joint return can elect not to be treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes a qualified joint venture conducts a trade or business where the only members of the joint venture are spouses filing jointly both spouses elect not to be treated as a partnership both spouses materially participate in the trade or business see passive activity limitations in the instructions for form  for a definition of material participation and the business is coowned by both spouses and is not held in the name of a state law entity such as a partnership or llc   under this election a qualified joint venture conducted by spouses who file a joint return is not treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes and therefore doesnt have a form  filing requirement all items of income gain deduction loss and credit are divided between the spouses based on their respective interests in the venture each spouse takes into account his or her respective share of these items as a sole proprietor each spouse would account for his or her respective share on the appropriate form such as schedule c form  for purposes of determining net earnings from selfemployment each spouses share of income or loss from a qualified joint venture is taken into account just as it is for federal income tax purposes that is based on their respective interests in the venture   if the spouses do not make the election to treat their respective interests in the joint venture as sole proprietorships each spouse should carry his or her share of the partnership income or loss from schedule k form  to their joint or separate forms  each spouse should include his or her respective share of selfemployment income on a separate schedule se form  selfemployment tax   this generally doesnt increase the total tax on the return but it does give each spouse credit for social security earnings on which retirement benefits are based however this may not be true if either spouse exceeds the social security tax limitation   for more information on qualified joint ventures go to irsgov enter “election for qualified joint ventures” in the search box and select the link reading “election for husband and wife unincorporated businesses” partnership agreement the partnership agreement includes the original agreement and any modifications the modifications must be agreed to by all partners or adopted in any other manner provided by the partnership agreement the agreement or modifications can be oral or written partners can modify the partnership agreement for a particular tax year after the close of the year but not later than the date for filing the partnership return

the short period which is the period from the beginning of the tax year through the date of termination the return is due the th day of the th month or for tax years beginning after  the th day of the rd month following the date of termination see partnership return form  later for information about filing form  conversion of partnership into limited liability company llc   the conversion of a partnership into an llc classified as a partnership for federal tax purposes doesnt terminate the partnership the conversion is not a sale exchange or liquidation of any partnership interest the partnerships tax year doesnt close and the llc can continue to use the partnerships taxpayer identification number   however the conversion may change some of the partners bases in their partnership interests if the partnership has recourse liabilities that become nonrecourse liabilities because the partners share recourse and nonrecourse liabilities differently their bases must be adjusted to reflect the new sharing ratios if a decrease in a partners share of liabilities exceeds the partners basis he or she must recognize gain on the excess for more information see effect of partnership liabilities under basis of partners interest  later   the same rules apply if an llc classified as a partnership is converted into a partnership irs efile electronic filing please click here for the

current years earnings a distribution of the current years or prior years earnings not needed for working capital a complete or partial liquidation of a partners interest a distribution to all partners in a complete liquidation of the partnership a partnership distribution is not taken into account in determining the partners distributive share of partnership income or loss if any gain or loss from the distribution is recognized by the partner it must be reported on his or her return for the tax year in which the distribution is received money or property withdrawn by a partner in anticipation of the current years earnings is treated as a distribution received on the last day of the partnerships tax year effect on partners basis   a partners adjusted basis in his or her partnership interest is decreased but not below zero by the money and adjusted basis of property distributed to the partner see adjusted basis under basis of partners interest  later effect on partnership   a partnership generally doesnt recognize any gain or loss because of distributions it makes to partners the partnership may be able to elect to adjust the basis of its undistributed property certain distributions treated as a sale or exchange   when a partnership distributes the following items the distribution may be treated as a sale or exchange of property rather than a distribution unrealized receivables or substantially appreciated inventory items distributed in exchange for any part of the partners interest in other partnership property including money other property including money distributed in exchange for any part of a partners interest in unrealized receivables or substantially appreciated inventory items   see payments for unrealized receivables and inventory items under disposition of partners interest  later   this treatment doesnt apply to the following distributions a distribution of property to the partner who contributed the property to the partnership payments made to a retiring partner or successor in interest of a deceased partner that are the partners distributive share of partnership income or guaranteed payments substantially appreciated inventory items   inventory items of the partnership are considered to have appreciated substantially in value if at the time of the distribution their total fair market value is more than  of the partnerships adjusted basis for the property however if a principal purpose for acquiring inventory property is to avoid ordinary income treatment by reducing the appreciation to less than  that property is excluded partners gain or loss a partner generally recognizes gain on a partnership distribution only to the extent any money and marketable securities treated as money included in the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the partners interest in the partnership any gain recognized is generally treated as capital gain from the sale of the partnership interest on the date of the distribution if partnership property other than marketable securities treated as money is distributed to a partner he or she generally doesnt recognize any gain until the sale or other disposition of the property for exceptions to these rules see distribution of partners debt and net precontribution gain  later also see payments for unrealized receivables and inventory items under disposition of partners interest  later example the adjusted basis of jos partnership interest is  she receives a distribution of  cash and land that has an adjusted basis of  and a fair market value of  because the cash received doesnt exceed the basis of her partnership interest jo doesnt recognize any gain on the distribution any gain on the land will be recognized when she sells or otherwise disposes of it the distribution decreases the adjusted basis of jos partnership interest to   −    marketable securities treated as money   generally a marketable security distributed to a partner is treated as money in determining whether gain is recognized on the distribution this treatment however doesnt generally apply if that partner contributed the security to the partnership or an investment partnership made the distribution to an eligible partner   the amount treated as money is the securitys fair market value when distributed reduced but not below zero by the excess if any of the partners distributive share of the gain that would be recognized had the partnership sold all its marketable securities at their fair market value immediately before the transaction resulting in the distribution over the partners distributive share of the gain that would be recognized had the partnership sold all such securities it still held after the distribution at the fair market value in    for more information including the definition of marketable securities see section c of the internal revenue code loss on distribution   a partner doesnt recognize loss on a partnership distribution unless all the following requirements are met the adjusted basis of the partners interest in the partnership exceeds the distribution the partners entire interest in the partnership is liquidated the distribution is in money unrealized receivables or inventory items   there are exceptions to these general rules see the following discussions also see liquidation at partners retirement or death under disposition of partners interest  later distribution of partners debt   if a partnership acquires a partners debt and extinguishes the debt by distributing it to the partner the partner will recognize capital gain or loss to the extent the fair market value of the debt differs from the basis of the debt determined under the rules discussed in partners basis for distributed property  later   the partner is treated as having satisfied the debt for its fair market value if the issue price adjusted for any premium or discount of the debt exceeds its fair market value when distributed the partner may have to include the excess amount in income as canceled debt   similarly a deduction may be available to a corporate partner if the fair market value of the debt at the time of distribution exceeds its adjusted issue price net precontribution gain   a partner generally must recognize gain on the distribution of property other than money if the partner contributed appreciated property to the partnership during the year period before the distribution   the gain recognized is the lesser of the following amounts the excess of the fair market value of the property received in the distribution over the adjusted basis of the partners interest in the partnership immediately before the distribution reduced but not below zero by any money received in the distribution the “net precontribution gain” of the partner this is the net gain the partner would recognize if all the property contributed by the partner within  years of the distribution and held by the partnership immediately before the distribution were distributed to another partner other than a partner who owns more than  of the partnership for information about the distribution of contributed property to another partner see contribution of property  under transactions between partnership and partners  later   the character of the gain is determined by reference to the character of the net precontribution gain this gain is in addition to any gain the partner must recognize if the money distributed is more than his or her basis in the partnership for these rules the term “money” includes marketable securities treated as money as discussed earlier under marketable securities treated as money effect on basis   the adjusted basis of the partners interest in the partnership is increased by any net precontribution gain recognized by the partner other than for purposes of determining the gain the increase is treated as occurring immediately before the distribution see basis of partners interest  later   the partnership must adjust its basis in any property the partner contributed within  years of the distribution to reflect any gain that partner recognizes under this rule exceptions   any part of a distribution that is property the partner previously contributed to the partnership is not taken into account in determining the amount of the excess distribution or the partners net precontribution gain for this purpose the partners previously contributed property doesnt include a contributed interest in an entity to the extent its value is due to property contributed to the entity after the interest was contributed to the partnership   recognition of gain under this rule also doesnt apply to a distribution of unrealized receivables or substantially appreciated inventory items if the distribution is treated as a sale or exchange as discussed earlier under certain distributions treated as a sale or exchange partners basis for distributed property unless there is a complete liquidation of a partners interest the basis of property other than money distributed to the partner by a partnership is its adjusted basis to the partnership immediately before the distribution however the basis of the property to the partner cannot be more than the adjusted basis of his or her interest in the partnership reduced by any money received in the same transaction example  the adjusted basis of emilys partnership interest is  she receives a distribution of property that has an adjusted basis of  to the partnership and  in cash her basis for the property is  example  the adjusted basis of steves partnership interest is  he receives a distribution of  cash and property that has an adjusted basis to the partnership of  his basis for the distributed property is limited to   −  the cash he receives complete liquidation of partners interest   the basis of property received in complete liquidation of a partners interest is the adjusted basis of the partners interest in the partnership reduced by any money distributed to the partner in the same transaction partners holding period   a partners holding period for property distributed to the partner includes the period the property was held by the partnership if the property was contributed to the partnership by a partner then the period it was held by that partner is also included basis divided among properties   if the basis of property received is the adjusted basis of the partners interest in the partnership reduced by money received in the same transaction it must be divided among the properties distributed to the partner for property distributed after august   allocate the basis using the following rules allocate the basis first to unrealized receivables and inventory items included in the distribution by assigning a basis to each item equal to the partnerships adjusted basis in the item immediately before the distribution if the total of these assigned bases exceeds the allocable basis decrease the assigned bases by the amount of the excess allocate any remaining basis to properties other than unrealized receivables and inventory items by assigning a basis to each property equal to the partnerships adjusted basis in the property immediately before the distribution if the allocable basis exceeds the total of these assigned bases increase the assigned bases by the amount of the excess if the total of these assigned bases exceeds the allocable basis decrease the assigned bases by the amount of the excess allocating a basis increase   allocate any basis increase required in rule  above first to properties with unrealized appreciation to the extent of the unrealized appreciation if the basis increase is less than the total unrealized appreciation allocate it among those properties in proportion to their respective amounts of unrealized appreciation allocate any remaining basis increase among all the properties in proportion to their respective fair market values example euns basis in her partnership interest is  in a distribution in liquidation of her entire interest she receives properties a and b neither of which is inventory or unrealized receivables property a has an adjusted basis to the partnership of  and a fair market value of  property b has an adjusted basis to the partnership of  and a fair market value of  to figure her basis in each property eun first assigns bases of  to property a and  to property b their adjusted bases to the partnership this leaves a  basis increase the  allocable basis minus the  total of the assigned bases she first allocates  to property a its unrealized appreciation the remaining  is allocated between the properties based on their fair market values   is allocated to property a and   is allocated to property b euns basis in property a is       and her basis in property b is     allocating a basis decrease   use the following rules to allocate any basis decrease required in rule  or rule  earlier allocate the basis decrease first to items with unrealized depreciation to the extent of the unrealized depreciation if the basis decrease is less than the total unrealized depreciation allocate it among those items in proportion to their respective amounts of unrealized depreciation allocate any remaining basis decrease among all the items in proportion to their respective assigned basis amounts as decreased in  example armandos basis in his partnership interest is  in a distribution in liquidation of his entire interest he receives properties c and d neither of which is inventory or unrealized receivables property c has an adjusted basis to the partnership of  and a fair market value of  property d has an adjusted basis to the partnership of  and a fair market value of  to figure his basis in each property armando first assigns bases of  to property c and  to property d their adjusted bases to the partnership this leaves a  basis decrease the  total of the assigned bases minus the  allocable basis he allocates the entire  to property d its unrealized depreciation armandos basis in property c is  and his basis in property d is   −  distributions before august     for property distributed before august   allocate the basis using the following rules allocate the basis first to unrealized receivables and inventory items included in the distribution to the extent of the partnerships adjusted basis in those items if the partnerships adjusted basis in those items exceeded the allocable basis allocate the basis among the items in proportion to their adjusted bases to the partnership allocate any remaining basis to other distributed properties in proportion to their adjusted bases to the partnership partners interest more than partnership basis   if the basis of a partners interest to be divided in a complete liquidation of the partners interest is more than the partnerships adjusted basis for the unrealized receivables and inventory items distributed and if no other property is distributed to which the partner can apply the remaining basis the partner has a capital loss to the extent of the remaining basis of the partnership interest special adjustment to basis   a partner who acquired any part of his or her partnership interest in a sale or exchange or upon the death of another partner may be able to choose a special basis adjustment for property distributed by the partnership to choose the special adjustment the partner must have received the distribution within  years after acquiring the partnership interest also the partnership must not have chosen the optional adjustment to basis when the partner acquired the partnership interest   if a partner chooses this special basis adjustment the partners basis for the property distributed is the same as it would have been if the partnership had chosen the optional adjustment to basis however this assigned basis is not reduced by any depletion or depreciation that would have been allowed or allowable if the partnership had previously chosen the optional adjustment   the choice must be made with the partners tax return for the year of the distribution if the distribution includes any property subject to depreciation depletion or amortization if the choice doesnt have to be made for the distribution year it must be made with the return for the first year in which the basis of the distributed property is pertinent in determining the partners income tax   a partner choosing this special basis adjustment must attach a statement to his or her tax return that the partner chooses under section d of the internal revenue code to adjust the basis of property received in a distribution the statement must show the computation of the special basis adjustment for the property distributed and list the properties to which the adjustment has been allocated example chin ho purchased a  interest in x partnership for  cash at the time of the purchase the partnership owned inventory having a basis to the partnership of  and a fair market value of  thus  of the  he paid was attributable to his share of inventory with a basis to the partnership of  within  years after acquiring his interest chin ho withdrew from the partnership and for his entire interest received cash of  inventory with a basis to the partnership of  and other property with a basis of  the value of the inventory received was  of the value of all partnership inventory it is immaterial whether the inventory he received was on hand when he acquired his interest since the partnership from which chin ho withdrew didnt make the optional adjustment to basis he chose to adjust the basis of the inventory received his share of the partnerships basis for the inventory is increased by   of the  difference between the  fair market value of the inventory and its  basis to the partnership at the time he acquired his interest the adjustment applies only for purposes of determining his new basis in the inventory and not for purposes of partnership gain or loss on disposition the total to be allocated among the properties chin ho received in the distribution is   basis of his interest −  cash received his basis in the inventory items is   partnership basis   special adjustment the remaining  is allocated to his new basis for the other property he received mandatory adjustment   a partner doesnt always have a choice of making this special adjustment to basis the special adjustment to basis must be made for a distribution of property whether or not within  years after the partnership interest was acquired if all the following conditions existed when the partner received the partnership interest the fair market value of all partnership property other than money was more than  of its adjusted basis to the partnership if there had been a liquidation of the partners interest immediately after it was acquired an allocation of the basis of that interest under the general rules discussed earlier under basis divided among properties  would have decreased the basis of property that couldnt be depreciated depleted or amortized and increased the basis of property that could be the optional basis adjustment if it had been chosen by the partnership would have changed the partners basis for the property actually distributed required statement   generally if a partner chooses a special basis adjustment and notifies the partnership or if the partnership makes a distribution for which the special basis adjustment is mandatory the partnership must provide a statement to the partner the statement must provide information necessary for the partner to figure the special basis adjustment marketable securities   a partners basis in marketable securities received in a partnership distribution as determined in the preceding discussions is increased by any gain recognized by treating the securities as money see marketable securities treated as money under partners gain or loss earlier the basis increase is allocated among the securities in proportion to their respective amounts of unrealized appreciation before the basis increase transactions between partnership and partners for certain transactions between a partner and his or her partnership the partner is treated as not being a member of the partnership these transactions include the following performing services for or transferring property to a partnership if there is a related allocation and distribution to a partner and the entire transaction when viewed together is properly characterized as occurring between the partnership and a partner not acting in the capacity of a partner transferring money or other property to a partnership if there is a related transfer of money or other property by the partnership to the contributing partner or another partner and the transfers together are properly characterized as a sale or exchange of property payments by accrual basis partnership to cash basis partner   a partnership that uses an accrual method of accounting cannot deduct any business expense owed to a cash basis partner until the amount is paid however this rule doesnt apply to guaranteed payments made to a partner which are generally deductible when accrued guaranteed payments guaranteed payments are those made by a partnership to a partner that are determined without regard to the partnerships income a partnership treats guaranteed payments for services or for the use of capital as if they were made to a person who is not a partner this treatment is for purposes of determining gross income and deductible business expenses only for other tax purposes guaranteed payments are treated as a partners distributive share of ordinary income guaranteed payments are not subject to income tax withholding the partnership generally deducts guaranteed payments on line  of form  as a business expense they are also listed on schedules k and k of the partnership return the individual partner reports guaranteed payments on schedule e form  as ordinary income along with his or her distributive share of the partnerships other ordinary income guaranteed payments made to partners for organizing the partnership or syndicating interests in the partnership are capital expenses generally organizational and syndication expenses are not deductible by the partnership however a partnership can elect to deduct a portion of its organizational expenses and amortize the remaining expenses see business startup and organizational costs in the instructions for form  organizational expenses if the election is not made and syndication expenses paid to partners must be reported on the partners schedule k as guaranteed payments minimum payment   if a partner is to receive a minimum payment from the partnership the guaranteed payment is the amount by which the minimum payment is more than the partners distributive share of the partnership income before taking into account the guaranteed payment example under a partnership agreement divya is to receive  of the partnership income but not less than  the partnership has net income of  divyas share without regard to the minimum guarantee is   ×  the guaranteed payment that can be deducted by the partnership is   −  divyas income from the partnership is  and the remaining  of partnership income will be reported by the other partners in proportion to their shares under the partnership agreement if the partnership net income had been  there would have been no guaranteed payment since her share without regard to the guarantee would have been greater than the guarantee selfemployed health insurance premiums   premiums for health insurance paid by a partnership on behalf of a partner for services as a partner are treated as guaranteed payments the partnership can deduct the payments as a business expense and the partner must include them in gross income however if the partnership accounts for insurance paid for a partner as a reduction in distributions to the partner the partnership cannot deduct the premiums   a partner who qualifies can deduct  of the health insurance premiums paid by the partnership on his or her behalf as an adjustment to income the partner cannot deduct the premiums for any calendar month or part of a month in which the partner is eligible to participate in any subsidized health plan maintained by any employer of the partner the partners spouse the partners dependents or any children under age  who are not dependents for more information on the selfemployed health insurance deduction see chapter  in publication  including payments in partners income   guaranteed payments are included in income in the partners tax year in which the partnerships tax year ends example  under the terms of a partnership agreement erica is entitled to a fixed annual payment of  without regard to the income of the partnership her distributive share of the partnership income is  the partnership has  of ordinary income after deducting the guaranteed payment she must include ordinary income of   guaranteed payment    ×  distributive share on her individual income tax return for her tax year in which the partnerships tax year ends example  lamont is a calendar year taxpayer who is a partner in a partnership the partnership uses a fiscal year that ended january   lamont received guaranteed payments from the partnership from february   until december   he must include these guaranteed payments in income for  and report them on his  income tax return payments resulting in loss   if guaranteed payments to a partner result in a partnership loss in which the partner shares the partner must report the full amount of the guaranteed payments as ordinary income the partner separately takes into account his or her distributive share of the partnership loss to the extent of the adjusted basis of the partners partnership interest sale or exchange of property special rules apply to a sale or exchange of property between a partnership and certain persons losses   losses will not be allowed from a sale or exchange of property other than an interest in the partnership directly or indirectly between a partnership and a person whose direct or indirect interest in the capital or profits of the partnership is more than    if the sale or exchange is between two partnerships in which the same persons directly or indirectly own more than  of the capital or profits interests in each partnership no deduction of a loss is allowed   the basis of each partners interest in the partnership is decreased but not below zero by the partners share of the disallowed loss   if the purchaser later sells the property only the gain realized that is greater than the loss not allowed will be taxable if any gain from the sale of the property is not recognized because of this rule the basis of each partners interest in the partnership is increased by the partners share of that gain gains   gains are treated as ordinary income in a sale or exchange of property directly or indirectly between a person and a partnership or between two partnerships if both of the following tests are met more than  of the capital or profits interest in the partnerships is directly or indirectly owned by the same persons the property in the hands of the transferee immediately after the transfer is not a capital asset property that is not a capital asset includes accounts receivable inventory stockintrade and depreciable or real property used in a trade or business more than  ownership   to determine if there is more than  ownership in partnership capital or profits the following rules apply an interest directly or indirectly owned by or for a corporation partnership estate or trust is considered to be owned proportionately by or for its shareholders partners or beneficiaries an individual is considered to own the interest directly or indirectly owned by or for the individuals family for this rule “family” includes only brothers sisters halfbrothers halfsisters spouses ancestors and lineal descendants if a person is considered to own an interest using rule  that person the “constructive owner” is treated as if actually owning that interest when rules  and  are applied however if a person is considered to own an interest using rule  that person is not treated as actually owning that interest in reapplying rule  to make another person the constructive owner example individuals a and b and trust t are equal partners in partnership abt as husband ah is the sole beneficiary of trust t trust ts partnership interest will be attributed to ah only for the purpose of further attributing the interest to a as a result a is a morethan partner this means that any deduction for losses on transactions between her and abt will not be allowed and gain from property that in the hands of the transferee is not a capital asset is treated as ordinary rather than capital gain more information   for more information on these special rules see sales and exchanges between related persons in chapter  of pub  contribution of property usually neither the partner nor the partnership recognizes a gain or loss when property is contributed to the partnership in exchange for a partnership interest this applies whether a partnership is being formed or is already operating the partnerships holding period for the property includes the partners holding period the contribution of limited partnership interests in one partnership for limited partnership interests in another partnership qualifies as a taxfree contribution of property to the second partnership if the transaction is made for business purposes the exchange is not subject to the rules explained later under disposition of partners interest  disguised sales   a contribution of money or other property to the partnership followed by a distribution of different property from the partnership to the partner is treated not as a contribution and distribution but as a sale of property if both of the following tests are met the distribution wouldnt have been made but for the contribution the partners right to the distribution doesnt depend on the success of partnership operations   all facts and circumstances are considered in determining if the contribution and distribution are more properly characterized as a sale however if the contribution and distribution occur within  years of each other the transfers are presumed to be a sale unless the facts clearly indicate that the transfers are not a sale if the contribution and distribution occur more than  years apart the transfers are presumed not to be a sale unless the facts clearly indicate that the transfers are a sale form  required   a partner must attach form  disclosure statement or other statement to his or her return if the partner contributes property to a partnership and within  years before or after the contribution the partnership transfers money or other consideration to the partner for exceptions to this requirement see section c of the regulations   a partnership must attach form  or other statement to its return if it distributes property to a partner and within  years before or after the distribution the partner transfers money or other consideration to the partnership   form  must include the following information a caption identifying the statement as a disclosure under section  of the internal revenue code a description of the transferred property or money including its value a description of any relevant facts in determining if the transfers are properly viewed as a disguised sale see section b of the regulations for a description of the facts and circumstances considered in determining if the transfers are a disguised sale contribution to partnership treated as investment company   gain is recognized when property is contributed in exchange for an interest in the partnership to a partnership that would be treated as an investment company if it were incorporated   a partnership is generally treated as an investment company if over  of the value of its assets is held for investment and consists of certain readily marketable items these items include money stocks and other equity interests in a corporation and interests in regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts for more information see section e of the internal revenue code and the related regulations whether a partnership is treated as an investment company under this test is ordinarily determined immediately after the transfer of property   this rule applies to limited partnerships and general partnerships regardless of whether they are privately formed or publicly syndicated contribution to foreign partnership   a domestic partnership that contributed property after august   to a foreign partnership in exchange for a partnership interest may have to file form  if either of the following apply immediately after the contribution the partnership owned directly or indirectly at least a  interest in the foreign partnership the fair market value of the property contributed to the foreign partnership when added to other contributions of property made to the partnership during the preceding month period is greater than    the partnership may also have to file form  even if no contributions are made during the tax year if it owns a  or more interest in a foreign partnership at any time during the year see the form instructions for more information basis of contributed property   if a partner contributes property to a partnership the partnerships basis for determining depreciation depletion gain or loss for the property is the same as the partners adjusted basis for the property when it was contributed increased by any gain recognized by the partner at the time of contribution allocations to account for builtin gain or loss   the fair market value of property at the time it is contributed may be different from the partners adjusted basis the partnership must allocate among the partners any income deduction gain or loss on the property in a manner that will account for the difference this rule also applies to contributions of accounts payable and other accrued but unpaid items of a cash basis partner   the partnership can use different allocation methods for different items of contributed property a single reasonable method must be consistently applied to each item and the overall method or combination of methods must be reasonable see section  of the regulations for allocation methods generally considered reasonable   if the partnership sells contributed property and recognizes gain or loss builtin gain or loss is allocated to the contributing partner if contributed property is subject to depreciation or other cost recovery the allocation of deductions for these items takes into account builtin gain or loss on the property however the total depreciation depletion gain or loss allocated to partners cannot be more than the depreciation or depletion allowable to the partnership or the gain or loss realized by the partnership example areta and sofia formed an equal partnership areta contributed  in cash to the partnership and sofia contributed depreciable property with a fair market value of  and an adjusted basis of  the partnerships basis for depreciation is limited to the adjusted basis of the property in sofias hands  in effect areta purchased an undivided onehalf interest in the depreciable property with her contribution of  assuming that the depreciation rate is  a year under the general depreciation system gds she would have been entitled to a depreciation deduction of  per year based on her interest in the partnership if the adjusted basis of the property equaled its fair market value when contributed to simplify this example the depreciation deductions are determined without regard to any firstyear depreciation conventions however since the partnership is allowed only  per year of depreciation  of  no more than  can be allocated between the partners the entire  must be allocated to areta distribution of contributed property to another partner   if a partner contributes property to a partnership and the partnership distributes the property to another partner within  years of the contribution the contributing partner must recognize gain or loss on the distribution   the recognized gain or loss is the amount the contributing partner would have recognized if the property had been sold for its fair market value when it was distributed this amount is the difference between the propertys basis and its fair market value at the time of contribution the character of the gain or loss will be the same as the character of the gain or loss that would have resulted if the partnership had sold the property to the distributee partner appropriate adjustments must be made to the adjusted basis of the contributing partners partnership interest and to the adjusted basis of the property distributed to reflect the recognized gain or loss disposition of certain contributed property   the following rules determine the character of the partnerships gain or loss on a disposition of certain types of contributed property unrealized receivables if the property was an unrealized receivable in the hands of the contributing partner any gain or loss on its disposition by the partnership is ordinary income or loss unrealized receivables are defined later under payments for unrealized receivables and inventory items when reading the definition substitute “partner” for “partnership” inventory items if the property was an inventory item in the hands of the contributing partner any gain or loss on its disposition by the partnership within  years after the contribution is ordinary income or loss inventory items are defined later under payments for unrealized receivables and inventory items  capital loss property if the property was a capital asset in the contributing partners hands any loss on its disposition by the partnership within  years after the contribution is a capital loss the capital loss is limited to the amount by which the partners adjusted basis for the property exceeded the propertys fair market value immediately before the contribution substituted basis property if the disposition of any of the property listed in   or  is a nonrecognition transaction these rules apply when the recipient of the property disposes of any substituted basis property other than certain corporate stock resulting from the transaction contribution of services a partner can acquire an interest in partnership capital or profits as compensation for services performed or to be performed capital interest   a capital interest is an interest that would give the holder a share of the proceeds if the partnerships assets were sold at fair market value and the proceeds were distributed in a complete liquidation of the partnership this determination generally is made at the time of receipt of the partnership interest the fair market value of such an interest received by a partner as compensation for services must generally be included in the partners gross income in the first tax year in which the partner can transfer the interest or the interest is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture the capital interest transferred as compensation for services is subject to the rules for restricted property discussed in publication  under employee compensation   the fair market value of an interest in partnership capital transferred to a partner as payment for services to the partnership is a guaranteed payment discussed earlier under guaranteed payments  profits interest   a profits interest is a partnership interest other than a capital interest if a person receives a profits interest for providing services to or for the benefit of a partnership in a partner capacity or in anticipation of being a partner the receipt of such an interest is not a taxable event for the partner or the partnership however this doesnt apply in the following situations the profits interest relates to a substantially certain and predictable stream of income from partnership assets such as income from highquality debt securities or a highquality net lease within  years of receipt the partner disposes of the profits interest the profits interest is a limited partnership interest in a publicly traded partnership   a profits interest transferred as compensation for services is not subject to the rules for restricted property that apply to capital interests basis of partners interest the basis of a partnership interest is the money plus the adjusted basis of any property the partner contributed if the partner must recognize gain as a result of the contribution this gain is included in the basis of his or her interest any increase in a partners individual liabilities because of an assumption of partnership liabilities is considered a contribution of money to the partnership by the partner interest acquired by gift etc   if a partner acquires an interest in a partnership by gift inheritance or under any circumstance other than by a contribution of money or property to the partnership the partners basis must be determined using the basis rules described in publication  adjusted basis there is a worksheet for adjusting the basis of a partners interest in the partnership in the partners instructions for schedule k form  the basis of an interest in a partnership is increased or decreased by certain items increases   a partners basis is increased by the following items the partners additional contributions to the partnership including an increased share of or assumption of partnership liabilities the partners distributive share of taxable and nontaxable partnership income the partners distributive share of the excess of the deductions for depletion over the basis of the depletable property unless the property is oil or gas wells whose basis has been allocated to partners decreases   the partners basis is decreased but never below zero by the following items the money including a decreased share of partnership liabilities or an assumption of the partners individual liabilities by the partnership and adjusted basis of property distributed to the partner by the partnership the partners distributive share of the partnership losses including capital losses the partners distributive share of nondeductible partnership expenses that are not capital expenditures this includes the partners share of any section  expenses even if the partner cannot deduct the entire amount on his or her individual income tax return the partners deduction for depletion for any partnership oil and gas wells up to the proportionate share of the adjusted basis of the wells allocated to the partner partners liabilities assumed by partnership   if contributed property is subject to a debt or if a partners liabilities are assumed by the partnership the basis of that partners interest is reduced but not below zero by the liability assumed by the other partners this partner must reduce his or her basis because the assumption of the liability is treated as a distribution of money to that partner the other partners assumption of the liability is treated as a contribution by them of money to the partnership see effect of partnership liabilities  later example  ivan acquired a  interest in a partnership by contributing property that had an adjusted basis to him of  and a  mortgage the partnership assumed payment of the mortgage the basis of ivans interest is adjusted basis of contributed property  minus part of mortgage assumed by other partners  ×   basis of ivans partnership interest  example  if in example  the contributed property had a  mortgage the basis of ivans partnership interest would be zero the  difference between the mortgage assumed by the other partners   ×  and his basis of  would be treated as capital gain from the sale or exchange of a partnership interest however this gain wouldnt increase the basis of his partnership interest book value of partners interest   the adjusted basis of a partners interest is determined without considering any amount shown in the partnership books as a capital equity or similar account example enzo contributes to his partnership property that has an adjusted basis of  and a fair market value of  his partner contributes  cash while each partner has increased his capital account by  which will be reflected in the partnership books the adjusted basis of enzos interest is only  and the adjusted basis of his partners interest is  when determined   the adjusted basis of a partners partnership interest is ordinarily determined at the end of the partnerships tax year however if there has been a sale or exchange of all or part of the partners interest or a liquidation of his or her entire interest in a partnership the adjusted basis is determined on the date of sale exchange or liquidation alternative rule for figuring adjusted basis   in certain cases the adjusted basis of a partnership interest can be figured by using the partners share of the adjusted basis of partnership property that would be distributed if the partnership terminated   this alternative rule can be used in either of the following situations the circumstances are such that the partner cannot practicably apply the general basis rules it is in the opinion of the irs reasonable to conclude that the result produced will not vary substantially from the result under the general basis rules   adjustments may be necessary in figuring the adjusted basis of a partnership interest under the alternative rule for example adjustments would be required to include in the partners share of the adjusted basis of partnership property any significant discrepancies that resulted from contributed property transfers of partnership interests or distributions of property to the partners effect of partnership liabilities a partners basis in a partnership interest includes the partners share of a partnership liability only if and to the extent that the liability creates or increases the partnerships basis in any of its assets gives rise to a current deduction to the partnership or is a nondeductible noncapital expense of the partnership the term “assets” in  includes capitalized items allocable to future periods such as organization expenses a partners share of accrued but unpaid expenses or accounts payable of a cash basis partnership are not included in the adjusted basis of the partners interest in the partnership partners basis increased   if a partners share of partnership liabilities increases or a partners individual liabilities increase because he or she assumes partnership liabilities this increase is treated as a contribution of money by the partner to the partnership partners basis decreased   if a partners share of partnership liabilities decreases or a partners individual liabilities decrease because the partnership assumes his or her individual liabilities this decrease is treated as a distribution of money to the partner by the partnership assumption of liability   generally a partner or related person is considered to assume a partnership liability only to the extent that he or she is personally liable for it the creditor knows that the liability was assumed by the partner or related person the creditor can demand payment from the partner or related person and no other partner or person related to another partner will bear the economic risk of loss on that liability immediately after the assumption related person   related persons for these purposes includes all the following an individual and his or her spouse ancestors and lineal descendants an individual and a corporation if the individual directly or indirectly owns  or more in value of the outstanding stock of the corporation two corporations that are members of the same controlled group a grantor and a fiduciary of any trust fiduciaries of two separate trusts if the same person is a grantor of both trusts a fiduciary and a beneficiary of the same trust a fiduciary and a beneficiary of two separate trusts if the same person is a grantor of both trusts a fiduciary of a trust and a corporation if the trust or the grantor of the trust directly or indirectly owns  or more in value of the outstanding stock of the corporation a person and a taxexempt educational or charitable organization controlled directly or indirectly by the person or by members of the persons family a corporation and a partnership if the same persons own  or more in value of the outstanding stock of the corporation and  or more of the capital or profits interest in the partnership two s corporations or an s corporation and a c corporation if the same persons own  or more in value of the outstanding stock of each corporation an executor and a beneficiary of an estate a partnership and a person owning directly or indirectly  or more of the capital or profits interest in the partnership two partnerships if the same persons directly or indirectly own  or more of the capital or profits interests property subject to a liability   if property contributed to a partnership by a partner or distributed by the partnership to a partner is subject to a liability the transferee is treated as having assumed the liability to the extent it doesnt exceed the fair market value of the property partners share of recourse liabilities   a partnership liability is a recourse liability to the extent that any partner or a related person defined earlier under related person has an economic risk of loss for that liability a partners share of a recourse liability equals his or her economic risk of loss for that liability a partner has an economic risk of loss if that partner or a related person would be obligated whether by agreement or law to make a net payment to the creditor or a contribution to the partnership with respect to the liability if the partnership were constructively liquidated a partner who is the creditor for a liability that would otherwise be a nonrecourse liability of the partnership has an economic risk of loss in that liability constructive liquidation   generally in a constructive liquidation the following events are treated as occurring at the same time all partnership liabilities become payable in full all of the partnerships assets have a value of zero except for property contributed to secure a liability all property is disposed of by the partnership in a fully taxable transaction for no consideration except relief from liabilities for which the creditors right to reimbursement is limited solely to one or more assets of the partnership all items of income gain loss or deduction are allocated to the partners the partnership liquidates example juan and teresa form a cash basis general partnership with cash contributions of  each under the partnership agreement they share all partnership profits and losses equally the partnership borrows  and purchases depreciable business equipment this debt is included in the partners basis in the partnership because incurring it creates an additional  of basis in the partnerships depreciable property if neither partner has an economic risk of loss in the liability it is a nonrecourse liability each partners basis would include his or her share of the liability  if teresa is required to pay the creditor if the partnership defaults she has an economic risk of loss in the liability her basis in the partnership would be     while juans basis would be  limited partner   a limited partner generally has no obligation to contribute additional capital to the partnership and therefore doesnt have an economic risk of loss in partnership recourse liabilities thus absent some other factor such as the guarantee of a partnership liability by the limited partner or the limited partner making the loan to the partnership a limited partner generally doesnt have a share of partnership recourse liabilities partners share of nonrecourse liabilities   a partnership liability is a nonrecourse liability if no partner or related person has an economic risk of loss for that liability a partners share of nonrecourse liabilities is generally proportionate to his or her share of partnership profits however this rule may not apply if the partnership has taken deductions attributable to nonrecourse liabilities or the partnership holds property that was contributed by a partner more information   for more information on the effect of partnership liabilities including rules for limited partners and examples see sections  through  of the regulations disposition of partners interest the following discussions explain the treatment of gain or loss from the disposition of an interest in a partnership abandoned or worthless partnership interest   a loss incurred from the abandonment or worthlessness of a partnership interest is an ordinary loss only if both of the following tests are met the transaction is not a sale or exchange the partner has not received an actual or deemed distribution from the partnership if the partner receives even a de minimis actual or deemed distribution the entire loss generally is a capital loss however see payments for unrealized receivables and inventory items  later   for information on how to report an abandonment loss see the instructions for form  see revenue ruling  for more information on determining if a loss incurred on the abandonment or worthlessness of a partnership interest is a capital or an ordinary loss partnership election to adjust basis of partnership property   generally a partnerships basis in its assets is not affected by a transfer of an interest in the partnership whether by sale or exchange or because of the death of a partner however the partnership can elect to make an optional adjustment to basis in the year of transfer sale exchange or other transfer the sale or exchange of a partners interest in a partnership usually results in capital gain or loss however see payments for unrealized receivables and inventory items  later for certain exceptions gain or loss is the difference between the amount realized and the adjusted basis of the partners interest in the partnership if the selling partner is relieved of any partnership liabilities that partner must include the liability relief as part of the amount realized for his or her interest example  kumar became a limited partner in the abc partnership by contributing  in cash on the formation of the partnership the adjusted basis of his partnership interest at the end of the current year is  which includes his  share of partnership liabilities the partnership has no unrealized receivables or inventory items kumar sells his interest in the partnership for  in cash he had been paid his share of the partnership income for the tax year kumar realizes  from the sale of his partnership interest  cash payment   liability relief he reports   realized −  basis as a capital gain example  the facts are the same as in example  except that kumar withdraws from the partnership when the adjusted basis of his interest in the partnership is zero he is considered to have received a distribution of  his relief of liability he reports a capital gain of  exchange of partnership interests   an exchange of partnership interests generally doesnt qualify as a nontaxable exchange of likekind property this applies regardless of whether they are general or limited partnership interests or interests in the same or different partnerships however under certain circumstances such an exchange may be treated as a taxfree contribution of property to a partnership see contribution of property under transactions between partnership and partners earlier   an interest in a partnership that has a valid election in effect under section a of the internal revenue code to be excluded from the partnership rules of the code is treated as an interest in each of the partnership assets and not as a partnership interest see exclusion from partnership rules  earlier installment reporting for sale of partnership interest   a partner who sells a partnership interest at a gain may be able to report the sale on the installment method for requirements and other information on installment sales see publication    part of the gain from the installment sale may be allocable to unrealized receivables or inventory items see payments for unrealized receivables and inventory items  later the gain allocable to unrealized receivables and inventory items must be reported in the year of sale the gain allocable to the other assets can be reported under the installment method payments for unrealized receivables and inventory items if a partner receives money or property in exchange for any part of a partnership interest the amount due to his or her share of the partnerships unrealized receivables or inventory items results in ordinary income or loss this amount is treated as if it were received for the sale or exchange of property that is not a capital asset this treatment applies to the unrealized receivables part of payments to a retiring partner or successor in interest of a deceased partner only if that part is not treated as paid in exchange for partnership property see liquidation at partners retirement or death  later unrealized receivables   unrealized receivables include any rights to payment not already included in income for the following items goods delivered or to be delivered to the extent the payment would be treated as received for property other than a capital asset services rendered or to be rendered   these rights must have arisen under a contract or agreement that existed at the time of sale or distribution even though the partnership may not be able to enforce payment until a later date for example unrealized receivables include accounts receivable of a cash method partnership and rights to payment for work or goods begun but incomplete at the time of the sale or distribution of the partners share   the basis for any unrealized receivables includes all costs or expenses for the receivables that were paid or accrued but not previously taken into account under the partnerships method of accounting other items treated as unrealized receivables   unrealized receivables include potential gain that would be ordinary income if the following partnership property were sold at its fair market value on the date of the payment mining property for which exploration expenses were deducted stock in a domestic international sales corporation disc certain farm land for which expenses for soil and water conservation or land clearing were deducted franchises trademarks or trade names oil gas or geothermal property for which intangible drilling and development costs were deducted stock of certain controlled foreign corporations market discount bonds and shortterm obligations property subject to recapture of depreciation under sections  and  of the internal revenue code depreciation recapture is discussed in chapter  of publication  determining gain or loss   the income or loss realized by a partner upon the sale or exchange of its interest in unrealized receivables and inventory items discussed below is the amount that would have been allocated to the partner if the partnership had sold all of its property for cash at fair market value in a fully taxable transaction immediately prior to the partners transfer of interest in the partnership any gain or loss recognized that is attributable to the unrealized receivables and inventory items will be ordinary gain or loss example you are a partner in abc partnership the adjusted basis of your partnership interest at the end of the current year is zero your share of potential ordinary income from partnership depreciable property is  the partnership has no other unrealized receivables or inventory items you sell your interest in the partnership for  in cash and you report the entire amount as a gain since your adjusted basis in the partnership is zero you report as ordinary income your  share of potential ordinary income from the partnerships depreciable property the remaining  gain is a capital gain inventory items   inventory items are not limited to stockintrade of the partnership they also include the following property property that would properly be included in the partnerships inventory if on hand at the end of the tax year or that is held primarily for sale to customers in the normal course of business property that if sold or exchanged by the partnership wouldnt be a capital asset or section  property real or depreciable business property held more than one year for example accounts receivable acquired for services or from the sale of inventory and unrealized receivables are inventory items property held by the partnership that would be considered inventory if held by the partner selling the partnership interest or receiving the distribution notification required of partner   if a partner exchanges a partnership interest attributable to unrealized receivables or inventory for money or property he or she must notify the partnership in writing this must be done within  days of the transaction or if earlier by january  of the calendar year following the calendar year of the exchange a partner may be subject to a  penalty for each failure to notify the partnership about such a transaction unless the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect information return required of partnership   when a partnership is notified of an exchange of partnership interests involving unrealized receivables or inventory items the partnership must file form  report of a sale or exchange of certain partnership interests form  is filed with form  for the tax year that includes the last day of the calendar year in which the exchange took place if notified of an exchange after filing form  the partnership must file form  separately within  days of the notification   on form  the partnership provides its telephone number and states the date of the exchange and the names addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of the partnership filing the return and the transferee and transferor in the exchange the partnership must provide a copy of form  or a written statement with the same information to each transferee and transferor by the later of january  following the end of the calendar year or  days after it receives notice of the exchange   the partnership may be subject to a penalty for each failure to timely file form  and a penalty for each failure to furnish a copy of form  to a transferor or transferee unless the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect if the failure is intentional a higher penalty may be imposed see internal revenue code sections   and  for details statement required of partner   if a partner sells or exchanges any part of an interest in a partnership having unrealized receivables or inventory he or she must file a statement with his or her tax return for the year in which the sale or exchange occurs the statement must contain the following information the date of the sale or exchange the amount of any gain or loss attributable to the unrealized receivables or inventory the amount of any gain or loss attributable to capital gain or loss on the sale of the partnership interest partners disposition of distributed unrealized receivables or inventory items   in general any gain or loss on a sale or exchange of unrealized receivables or inventory items a partner received in a distribution is an ordinary gain or loss for this purpose inventory items do not include real or depreciable business property even if they are not held more than  year example oscar a distributee partner received his share of accounts receivable when his law firm dissolved the partnership used the cash method of accounting so the receivables had a basis of zero if oscar later collects the receivables or sells them the amount he receives will be ordinary income exception for inventory items held more than  years   if a distributee partner sells inventory items held for more than  years after the distribution the type of gain or loss depends on how they are being used on the date sold the gain or loss is capital gain or loss if the property is a capital asset in the partners hands at the time sold example marucia receives through dissolution of her partnership inventory that has a basis of  within  years she sells the inventory for  the  gain is taxed as ordinary income if she had held the inventory for more than  years her gain would have been capital gain provided the inventory was a capital asset in her hands at the time of sale substituted basis property   if a distributee partner disposes of unrealized receivables or inventory items in a nonrecognition transaction ordinary gain or loss treatment applies to a later disposition of any substituted basis property resulting from the transaction liquidation at partners retirement or death payments made by the partnership to a retiring partner or successor in interest of a deceased partner in return for the partners entire interest in the partnership may have to be allocated between payments in liquidation of the partners interest in partnership property and other payments the partnerships payments include an assumption of the partners share of partnership liabilities treated as a distribution of money for income tax purposes a retiring partner or successor in interest of a deceased partner is treated as a partner until his or her interest in the partnership has been completely liquidated liquidating payments   payments made in liquidation of the interest of a retiring or deceased partner in exchange for his or her interest in partnership property are considered a distribution not a distributive share or guaranteed payment that could give rise to a deduction or its equivalent for the partnership unrealized receivables and goodwill   payments made for the retiring or deceased partners share of the partnerships unrealized receivables or goodwill are not treated as made in exchange for partnership property if both of the following tests are met capital is not a material incomeproducing factor for the partnership whether capital is a material incomeproducing factor is explained in the discussion under family partnership near the beginning of this publication the retiring or deceased partner was a general partner in the partnership however this rule doesnt apply to payments for goodwill to the extent that the partnership agreement provides for a reasonable payment to a retiring partner for goodwill   unrealized receivables includes to the extent not previously includible in income under the method of accounting used by the partnership any rights contractual or otherwise to payment for  goods delivered or to be delivered to the extent the proceeds therefrom would be treated as amounts received from the sale or exchange of property other than a capital asset or  services rendered or to be rendered partners valuation   generally the partners valuation of a partners interest in partnership property in an armslength agreement will be treated as correct if the valuation reflects only the partners net interest in the property total assets less liabilities it must be adjusted so that both the value of and the basis for the partners interest include the partners share of partnership liabilities gain or loss on distribution   upon the receipt of the distribution the retiring partner or successor in interest of a deceased partner will recognize gain only to the extent that any money and marketable securities treated as money distributed is more than the partners adjusted basis in the partnership the partner will recognize a loss only if the distribution is in money unrealized receivables and inventory items no loss is recognized if any other property is received see partners gain or loss under partnership distributions earlier other payments   payments made by the partnership to a retiring partner or successor in interest of a deceased partner that are not made in exchange for an interest in partnership property are treated as distributive shares of partnership income or guaranteed payments this rule applies regardless of the time over which the payments are to be made it applies to payments made for the partners share of unrealized receivables and goodwill not treated as a distribution   if the amount is based on partnership income the payment is taxable as a distributive share of partnership income the payment retains the same character when reported by the recipient that it would have had if reported by the partnership   if the amount is not based on partnership income it is treated as a guaranteed payment the recipient reports guaranteed payments as ordinary income for additional information on guaranteed payments see transactions between partnership and partners  earlier   these payments are included in income by the recipient for his or her tax year that includes the end of the partnership tax year for which the payments are a distributive share or in which the partnership is entitled to deduct them as guaranteed payments   former partners who continue to make guaranteed periodic payments to satisfy the partnerships liability to a retired partner after the partnership is terminated can deduct the payments as a business expense in the year paid tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of  tefra tefra tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of  is the common acronym used for a set of consolidated examination processing and judicial procedures which determine the tax treatment of partnership items at the partnership level for partnerships and limited liability companies llcs that file as partnerships tefra created the unified partnership audit and litigation procedures of internal revenue code sections  through  tefra partnership procedures partnership item   any item more appropriately determinable at the partnership level if an item is determined to be a partnership item all tefra rules and procedures apply prior to the enactment of tefra no consolidated proceeding existed for the tax treatment of partnership items at the entity level as a result examination processing and judicial proceedings for partnerships were conducted at the partner level which required that each partner dealt separately with the irs and the courts tefra procedures were designed to streamline examinations of partnerships by requiring that partnership issues be handled in a single unified partnershiplevel proceeding instead of multiple proceedings at the partner level tefra also created the tax matters partner or “tmp” which is the main contact between the irs the partnership and its partners during an examination of a partnership it is important to note that partners other than the tmp are also entitled to participate during the examination process and appellate conferences for the purposes of these instructions the consolidated audit proceedings of internal revenue code sections  through  will be referred to as “tefra proceedings” in addition partnerships and llcs that are subject to the consolidated audit proceedings of internal revenue code sections  through  will be referred to as
