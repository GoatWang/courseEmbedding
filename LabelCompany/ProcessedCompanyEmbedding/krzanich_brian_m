semiconductorsthe company that became a household name through its “intel inside” stickers on personal computers is still the king of pc chips but that is a shrinking business and intel is a laggard in making chips for hot products like smartphones and tabletsthat has put intel in a bind as semiconductor competitors long under the thumb of the silicon valley giant have gained traction through relationships with mobile device leaders like apple and samsungbut mr krzanich pronounced kreznick a yearold company veteran who started with intel as an engineer when he was  says he is cleareyed

story he even has a broader picture of intel’s future like imagining moving beyond today’s popular mobile devices and into other gadgets in people’s homes and even into socalled wearable computing devices “if you’re just talking phones you’re shooting behind the duck” he addedlast year almost twothirds of intel’s  billion in revenue came from making chips for pcs a market mr krzanich acknowledges is “not growing let’s be honest”last month researchers at the information technology firm idc said pc demand declined more than  percent annually in the first quarter as buyers turned to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets in the same period idc said worldwide tablet shipments were up  percent while smartphone shipments were up  percent the bulk of intel’s remaining revenue

that you can’t take your eye off the ball” said doug freedman an analyst with rbc capital markets mr krzanich he noted “is very much about the results he comes from a world of schedules and manufacturing”but mr freedman also said “there’s a part of the investment community that would have preferred an outsider” to shake up the company this was never likely at intel he noted where employment shorter than a decade marks one as a newcomer intel said it considered both inside and outside candidatesmr krzanich was one of several internal candidates who made their final pitches to intel’s board last weekend ms james was also vying for the job and mr krzanich said the two had privately discussed working together no matter who became chief executive advertisement continue reading

his entire strategy in the interview mr krzanich said he saw no reason to reduce intel’s spending on cuttingedge chip technology and manufacturing “i fought for this job for a reason” he said “the assets that made us great in pcs and servers are even stronger in the mobile and cloud world”in part mr krzanich says he believes he is carrying through on a plan that’s already under wayon monday for example intel will introduce a new version of its lowpower atom chip designed for communications products where its market is negligibleif successful mr krzanich will create an intel markedly different from the pastunder andrew s grove the executive who coined the unofficial company slogan “only the paranoid survive” and led intel to dominance in providing chips for pcs and servers the company honed a business known for a few close relationships with partners like microsoft and then pc manufacturers like hewlettpackard and dell those relationships and the fortunes of those companies have declined in recent yearstoday intel faces competition from qualcomm and nvidia in the manufacturing of chips for mobile devices hp is showing off servers that use parts from five or more

materially also if during this call we use any nongaap financial measures or references well post the appropriate gaap financial reconciliation to our website intccom so with that let me hand it over to brian brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director thanks mark our top line results for the quarter came in right in line with outlook and profitability this quarter exceeded our expectations yearoveryear growth this quarter was  overall as we transform intel into a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected devices we continue to focus on growth in line with this transformation as evidenced by results in the data center iot and programmable solutions business this quarter id like to take a few minutes to walk through these results and their implications ill start with the client computing group where we saw a  decline in revenue year over year this quarter while operating margin was up  these results were a little better than we expected as the pc supply chain reduced inventories at a slightly slower rate while the in and enthusiast product lines continued to grow we also started shipping our seventh generation core microprocessor formerly known as kaby lake and our latest lte modem known as  next the data center where revenue grew  year over year cloud services providers grew  comm service providers grew  and enterprise was down  we achieved some critical milestones in the quarter that give us confidence in our growing momentum as we enter the second half of the year in the data center were seeing an ongoing preference for performance up and down the pricing stack average selling prices increased year over year in every microprocessor product segment from atom and xeon d socs at the low end up through xeon and xeon phi at the high end we continued to gain share in network infrastructure throughout the entire segment as intel architecture becomes the solution of choice for the transformation of the network to sdn nfv and g the significant share gains at the low end of the network infrastructure segment resulted in an overall  decline in data center cpu average selling prices progress in the data center extended beyond our cpu product lines our latest xeon phi accelerator formerly known as knights landing continued to ramp after shipping the first limited production units in december of last year xeon phi revenue grew x in the first six months of this year versus all of  gaining share in the supercomputing and machine learning segments omnipath our highperformance computing fabric was launched earlier this year and has already achieved  market segment share of the gig fabric market in junes top  supercomputing list omnipath was deployed in half of the new gig systems pointing to the performance that this technology brings to the market this quarter we also shipped our first silicon photonics products for revenue the industrys only fully integrated solution we expect dcgs adjacent product lines including omnipath silicon photonics and ethernet to collectively grow more than  for the full year and this quarter make up  of dcgs revenue the internet of things business was up  over last year coming in below our expectations we saw growth in the industrial and video verticals offset by an inventory burn after a very strong first quarter we continue to see tremendous potential in this business a great example was demonstrated earlier this month when we announced our autonomous driving collaboration with bmw and mobileye marking a significant step for the auto industry as we work together to establish an industry standard open platform for autonomous driving in addition we are bringing indian computing technology to power the next generation of bmws highly autonomous and fully autonomous products from the door locks to the data center our memory business was down  over last year and fell short of our expectations as a result of a more competitive pricing environment while we acknowledge the cyclical and competitive nature of this business we remain confident in our longterm growth prospects as a result of the new technologies we are bringing to this market fab  in dalian china started its initial d nand wafers late in the second quarter but ahead of schedule we also remain on track to ship d xpoint ssds branded optane by the end of the year and look forward to delivering this exciting new breakthrough in memory to the industry the programmable solutions group formerly known as altera delivered great results psg grew  over alteras results last year on strength in comms infrastructure and the channel psg is on track to ship nanometer stratix  samples this year and im very pleased with both the integration of this business and their strong execution our security business was up  as the restructuring the team completed last year and their focused execution continues to deliver results and finally our restructuring initiative that we began last quarter is solidly on track this program is changing where and how we invest in everything from research and development to sales and marketing in april we announced some important changes to our roadmaps in areas like socs and perceptual computing these changes are accelerating our transformation to a company that powers the cloud and the billions of smart connected computing devices while increasing the profitability in our client business in total we expect this initiative will drive net run rate opex savings of  billion by mid looking ahead im very excited about the growing momentum heading into the second half of the year while we remain cautious about the pc segment and continue to expect a decline in the high single digits this year were expecting our businesses outside of ccg to collectively deliver doubledigit growth in the third quarter we are seeing clear signs that our strategy is working laying a solid foundation for growth built on the data center and the internet of things business reinforced by the combination of memory and fpgas and bound together by connectivity with that let me turn it over to stacy stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks brian in the second quarter we met our financial commitments and made good progress towards our restructuring goals our forecast reflects growing momentum as we enter the back half of  revenue for the second quarter was  billion in line with expectations and up  year over year gross margin for the quarter of  was approximately a point higher than our expectations primarily driven by lower platform unit costs spending on rd and mga was  billion in line with our expectations we are on track to the restructuring announced on the last earnings call with a reduction of about  employees in the second quarter operating income of  billion was down  from a year ago the effective tax rate for the quarter was  earnings per share at  was down  from a year ago the client computing group had revenue of  billion down  year over year client computing group operating profit was  billion up  from a year ago this improvement is driven by lower overall spending and margin improvements in our mobile products and higher asps in the pc segment the worldwide pc supply chain inventory levels came down a bit in the second quarter and as we enter the second half they are at healthy levels data center revenue was  billion up  year over year the data center group had operating profit of  billion down  year over year primarily driven by increased costs as we ramp nanometer data center products as we enter the second half we expect the enterprise segment of the business to stabilize and the cloud segment growth rate to accelerate in addition we expect increasing asps as we ramp our broadwellbased server products our internet of things segment achieved revenue of  million with yearoveryear growth of  our security business had revenue of  million up  year over year our memory business had revenue of  million down  year over year this segment had an operating loss of  million as a result of continued pricing pressures higher startup costs as we ramp d nand in our china factory and increased d xpoint spending the programmable solutions group had revenue of  million up  year over year when compared to alteras results from a year ago operating profit was negative  million this includes about  million in noncash charges for inventory adjustments excluding these charges would result in about  million in positive operating profit total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly  billion up  billion from the first quarter our total debt is  billion our net cash balance total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longerterm investments is negative  billion we are projecting to improve this net cash balance over the second half of the year we are generating healthy levels of free cash flow which enable us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders this is demonstrated our q results as we generated  billion of cash from operations in the second quarter purchased  billion in capital assets and repurchased approximately  million of stock in the second quarter we also paid  billion in dividends and as of yesterdays close of market our dividend yield was about  as we look forward to the third quarter of  we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of  billion this forecast is at the high end of the average seasonal increase for the third quarter we are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be  turning to the full year  we expect revenue growth in the midsingle digits we continue to expect the overall pc market to be down in the high single digits and we expect to achieve low doubledigit growth in our data center business gross margin for the full year of  is expected to be  consistent with our prior outlook you can see our strategy playing out in our first half results and our expectations for the second half we expect aboveseasonal growth in the back half of the year led by strong growth in the data center internet of things and memory businesses and for the year we expect that growth in those businesses will offset the pc market decline and with the addition of the programmable solutions group will result in midsingledigit revenue growth additionally we are executing to our restructuring program which allows us to increase investments in strategically important areas generate financial returns for our owners and build the foundation for future financial growth with that let me turn it back over to mark mark h henninger  vice presidentfinance  directorir okay thank you brian and stacy moving on now to the qa as is our normal practice we would ask each participant to ask one question and one followup if you have one operator please go ahead and introduce our first questioner questionandanswer session operator our first question comes from the line of chris danely of citigroup your line is now open christopher b danely  citigroup global markets inc broker hey thanks guys just a question on the server expectations for the second half whats giving you the confidence that things are going to bounce back so nicely brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director sure ill start and then stacy can add this is brian chris i think its really a mix of a couple of things one we saw in the second quarter and we project out into the second half a bit of stabilization of the enterprise side of the market the enterprise side was down only about  which is a bit more stable than it has been second thing is we are ramping our broadwell e server in the second half of the year and so we expect strong demand and we typically see an asp uplift as people by up in the stack with these new server systems coming out and we have customer signals that just indicate that theres a second half seasonal buying pattern kicking in a bit as well so those three things are the second half keys and if you take a look at a broader view of this or just overall our view of the data center and really the cloud continues to be that the cloud is going to continue to expand its going to be driven by the many many machines that connect to the cloud that drive orders of magnitude more data than what the average human creates today and thats getting to the cloud so theres the short versus the longerterm point of view i dont know stacy if theres anything you want to add stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president perfect christopher b danely  citigroup global markets inc broker and for my followup you mentioned you started shipping the  was that material to q or will it be material to the second half and any comments on profitability there stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president im not going to talk specifically about the  because our policy is to let our customers announce any design wins that they want to announce when they want to announce them in terms of the overall impact on financials when i look at the second half youll note that we have an aboveseasonal growth rate in there the biggest driver of that is what brian just talked about in the data center so thats the biggest driver we were below the average annual growth rate in the first half we expect to be above that low double digits in back half driven by the three things he talked about in particular the cloud buying patterns that weve identified with some of those large customers and then behind that we see an improvement in revenue in memory and an improvement in revenue in iot and so those are the big drivers as we go into the back half christopher b danely  citigroup global markets inc broker thanks guys operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of john pitzer of credit suisse your line is now open john william pitzer  credit suisse securities usa llc broker good afternoon guys thanks for letting me ask a question stacy you did a nice job relative to the full year guidance giving us your expectation for pc demand for the year im just curious as you look into the third quarter the guide is the high end of normal seasonality as you talked about how would you characterize your view of the pc business going into q and to the extent that its still a subdued view is this really confidence in data center or what other parts of the business would drive aboveseasonal – or high end of seasonal sorry brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director hey john how about if i start on just the view of the pc especially into the third quarter and then stacy can get into where is the aboveseasonal numbers coming from and all i think if you look at the second half we already said that q ended up being a little bit better than what we had anticipated and we had built the year at the high single digits and if you take a look at q it ended up coming at the midsingledigit decline weve tried to be relatively cautious as we look out into the rest of this year and built the year and the forecast around that high singledigit number set for decline of the pc we are carrying momentum out of q so theres still data that needs to be collected on how it looks but right now weve maintained our cautious view of high single digits stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president so just to translate that into seasonality against the backdrop of what brian just said which is high singledigit decline in the pc business were expecting that segment to play out more or less seasonally john we tend to do a little bit better than that because of mix and asp but from a unit standpoint should be fairly seasonal and then the driver is what i just talked about the data center growth rate as we move into the back half should be significantly higher than what we saw in the first half based on stabilization in enterprise what we see with the cloud customers and then some asp uplift as we ramp broadwell server – nanometer broadwell servers into the product mix john william pitzer  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thats helpful guys and then maybe for my followup just looking at the memory businesses as you guys characterized tough quarter in the june quarter if you annualize the operating loss its a fairly large number im just curious have startup costs there peaked or do we have another couple of quarters of startup costs going up in memory and i guess more importantly as dalian ramps and you think about xpoint how should we think about your profitability goals longer term and what the fallthrough on that business looks like as revenue does start to accelerate stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president so theres a shortterm and a longterm component to this so in the short term as i think about the second half in rough math id expect a consistent loss in the second half to what we saw in the first half i think startup costs will be slightly higher well see the first production costs play through on d xpoint which as you know from watching us over the years those first production costs tend to be fairly high in any factory when youre starting it up offset by the underlying existing nand business i think its a bit better as we go into the back half so thats the shortterm answer to your longerterm question and ill turn this over to brian to talk about the technology but i think the combination of d nand and the cost structure were going to achieve and then the disruptive nature of d xpoint we should have a very good value proposition and a very good overall profit position for the business brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director yeah john i would just echo what stacy said were just now starting to ramp our d nand so as we go through this back half of this year and into next year its really starting to ramp up we think large cost advantages and good performance position there and then as we said d xpoint ssds start to ship at the end of this year d xpoint dimms next year and so these investments that were making this year which weve talked about are really playing forward those two technologies so were still very bullish on the longterm prospects the units and the gigabytes continue to grow our cost structure gets better and better as we go through the back half and into next year and then d xpoint as we said will really in our minds change the whole memory storage architecture john william pitzer  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of joe moore of morgan stanley your line is now open joseph l moore  morgan stanley  co llc great thank you so much i wonder if you could talk about first the data center the growth – your midsingledigit growth for about three consecutive quarters and i know you had higher expectations for that a few quarters ago can you talk about – is that entirely an enterprise phenomenon or is that a timing issue around cloud just how should we think about the last few quarters of dcg stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah id say – so overall relative to the expectations we had at the beginning of the year lets say its primarily enterprise driven and then theres some – what we commonly use as lumpiness quarter on quarter so to how you ask the question we actually werent surprised by the q results in fact they came in right in line actually just a hair above what our internal forecast was we have i think pretty good insight into the large cloud customers and so we had some good insight into the buying patterns as those customers went from q to q and now as we look at the back half we see several purchasing cycles kicking in for some of the large guys so we expect that the cloud piece will accelerate as we get into the back half joseph l moore  morgan stanley  co llc great thats helpful thank you and then with regards to the balance sheet i noticed both days sales outstanding and days of inventory bumped up a little bit and i hadnt expected that can you just talk about what drove that stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah those are two different things ill just start with the easy one days sales outstanding im not seeing anything unusual there its just the amount of net billing at the end of the quarter the average day paid and all of that still looks really healthy so im not seeing anything unusual there on the inventory side as i talked to you last quarter we ended q higher than where i wanted to be our yields got better in q frankly they got a lot better in q as well and we undershipped a little bit in q relative the units that we were expecting so we took some actions in the second quarter to start bringing inventory levels down what you see inside of inventory was – it was flattish right in line with what we expected q to q there was a remixing so you see some more expensive server parts and some skylake parts going up and then you see some of the oldergeneration cpus going down and as we get into the back half we would expect inventory to click down and be down pretty meaningfully by the time we get to q joseph l moore  morgan stanley  co llc great thanks so much mark h henninger  vice presidentfinance  directorir thanks joe operator thank you our next question comes from the line of harlan sur of jpmorgan your line is now open harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc good afternoon and thanks for taking my question pc gaming has been a bright spot for the team with growth in the doubledigits yearoveryear range for the past number of quarters your desktop asps were up again in q maybe due to the strength here it seems like the graphics guys are rolling out some new products there appears to be a good pipeline of new games for the second half so i guess the question is did the pc gaming segment continue to drive doubledigits growth for the team in q and how do you see that trending into the second half brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director sure if you take a look at it there were threeish maybe fourish major segments of the pc that did better and continue to do better than the rest of the segment and just overall laptops mobile pcs continue to do better they did better in the second quarter in devices specifically are doing very well and continue to grow in double digits and then as you said we often call the enthusiast gaming you see our k skus in there and then you saw us also announce the x sku which is our new core system that has been selling much much better than what even we anticipated and so yes gaming and enthusiast continues to grow at a doubledigit rate harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc great thanks for the insights there and then on the deceleration in the iot business in june you talked about an inventory burn sorry if i missed this but what vertical was that focused on and does the team expect reacceleration on a yearoveryear basis as you move into the second half of the year and if so what verticals are going to be driving the growth stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president let me take the revenue question and ill let brian take what we see in the verticals part it was not one vertical if you just look at it i think our customers got out a little ahead of their skis in the first quarter if you remember i think we had a  or  yearonyear growth rate in q there was a little more inventory out there than we anticipated and that took some of the – that was a bit of headwind as we started q to your question on the back half we do expect a reacceleration so i had said at the investor meeting that we expect doubledigit growth in excess of what we had achieved last year we still expect that we had a strong q an inventory burn in q and we expect a strong q and q brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director and from which verticals the verticals that have been the strongest growing for us especially in recent has been industrial and in the security video type applications those have been the two real growers we have a lot of ill call it longerterm growth vectors retail is a longerterm growth vector and then you saw as we mentioned on the call the automotive adas section in the announcement with bmw there are several other programs in that space as well harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of stacy rasgon of bernstein research your line is now open stacy aaron rasgon  sanford c bernstein  co llc hi guys thanks for taking my question i just wanted to verify on the dcg i guess growth target into the back half it sounds like you need enterprise to keep getting better into the second half as well as for i guess the cloud and comm side of dcg to significantly reaccelerate to get there cloud was up  year over year and its good but thats a significant deceleration can you give us a feeling for what you need for enterprise into the back half and what drove the deceleration in the highgrowth parts of this business into q stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president so id say – id characterize enterprise in the back half consistent with what we saw in q if it stabilizes at that rate that gives us the ability to grow to the levels that were projecting and then for the cloud yes youre right its what i said earlier we had actually forecasted a pause in purchasing based on what we knew of the customer – the big cloud players ordering patterns and based on the signals were seeing from them we do expect a reacceleration in the back to something more consistent with what were seeing through the last couple years stacy aaron rasgon  sanford c bernstein  co llc so what gives you confidence that enterprise will continue to stabilize and that what we saw in q is not a onequarter blip given its been down pretty meaningfully for the last few years pretty consistently stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president its what we saw in q stacy aaron rasgon  sanford c bernstein  co llc in q i mean stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes we saw it down slightly and again its just what we see of the big enterprise customers signals to us in terms of what they want to purchase mark h henninger  vice presidentfinance  directorir thanks stacy operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of ross seymore with deutsche bank your line is now open ross c seymore  deutsche bank securities inc hi guys thanks for letting me ask a question given that dynamic in the cloud and the enterprise side within dcg do you still expect a crossover in the percentage of revenues that those two generate the back half of this year or is it pulled forward a little bit – or pushed out given the dynamics that youve described so far stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president sorry crossover from what to what ross ross c seymore  deutsche bank securities inc when you said – i believe at your last analyst meeting you talked about the cloud revenue the percentage of dcg would be somewhere in the mid and that would cross over the enterprisegenerated revenue in that and that was therefore viewed as a point of acceleration for the entire group im wondering given the slower growth year to date in that business if that crossover is going to be achieved in the time you expected stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president ill be honest i havent looked at the data from that lens but what i said – let me just take you back to the answer that i gave – i think it was to joes question earlier that if you look to the expectations we had at the beginning of the year the enterprise is a bit weaker than we thought overall for the year and i think cloud will be in line with what we thought so my guess is thats still true which quarter it happens may be a jump ball but my guess is its still true but id like the opportunity to actually go look at the data and i can give you a crisper answer next time we talk ross c seymore  deutsche bank securities inc okay i guess as my followup question sticking with dcg then is on the gross margin side it sounds like youre expecting some pretty significant growth not only on the unit side of the equation in dcg but also on the asp side and then you also talked about some of the asp benefits that might happen in ccg at least in the pc portion of it if i put that all together im a little surprised that either mix or asps neither of those are mentioned in your gross margin reconciliation for it to go to  in the third quarter can you talk a little bit about how those dynamics fit into your gross margin stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure so first let me start with your question on data center theres a lot in there so i do expect an operating margin improvement in the data center as we work through this year i think we were around mid in the second quarter and our historical range has been closer to  as i expect it that picks up some as we move into the back half the big driver there is costs and so the early production on the broadwell server is fairly expensive costs come down as we get into the back half and as you said we do expect some asp uplift in the back half overall for the company what were seeing so ill just q as the anchor point were seeing some good news in q associated with higher volumes and then the big offset there is were seeing nanometer startup costs going up pretty significantly in the back half so that may be the piece that youre missing in the equation in q that continues into q by the way we see a little bit more startup costs if you do your algebra youre probably coming up with a gross margin for q thats about  so think of that as some good things happen but we have again an increase in startup costs and we have some of the dalian costs with the first production of d xpoint that also kick in a bit more in q ross c seymore  deutsche bank securities inc great thank you stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president youre welcome mark h henninger  vice presidentfinance  directorir thanks ross operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris caso of clsa your line is now open christopher caso  clsa americas llc yes thank you just a clarification on some of your earlier comments on inventory in pc you talked about the customers taking down the inventory a little bit less than you had expected in q can you clarify why they chose to do that and i guess with the inventory levels right now where do they stand relative to where youd expect them to be into the third quarter stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president so overall we continue to see inventory levels as being very healthy i think that the pc the worldwide pc supply chain has moved towards a stance of being fairly lean and fairly cautious and we see that continuing you would typically see an inventory burn in the second quarter it was a little bit less of an inventory burn then what we expected i think it goes back to brians comments that he made at the beginning of the call that from their perspective the pc market was a little better in q so i think they probably just brought down inventory levels a little bit less christopher caso  clsa americas llc okay as a followon to that maybe you can clarify what you consider to be normal pc seasonality in the third quarter because i think thats been changing over the past several years last year the build into the third quarter was a little stronger obviously there were some product launches there how do you characterize the build this year relative to what weve seen last year and the year before stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president so i would say for the company you would expect to see the seasonality of revenue seasonality for us thats in the high single digits as we go from q to q our guide is a little higher than that for the reasons that weve been talking about the pc market is probably in line with that maybe just a pinch higher in terms of the overall pc tam christopher caso  clsa americas llc great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of matt ramsay of canaccord genuity your line is now open matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc yes thank you very much good afternoon and thanks for taking my question i guess its a followon to the dcg question that ross had brought up in terms of margin the dcg business is obviously going to diversify itself some going forward with some of the new products that youre introducing and the networking business taking off the operating margin percentage is down fairly sharply year over year and i would expect that to ramp back up some as revenue reaccelerates but maybe stacy you could talk about what the longterm margin structure looks like from an operating margin perspective in dcg as the business diversifies some thanks stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure so well talk about that in more depth at the investor meeting but ill give you some offthecuff comments here first to just put it in perspective the operating margin percent decline that we saw in q had nothing to do with the new products or the new products werent driving it it was the nanometer costs of broadwell server and when we get into the back half were going to see an asp impact associated with that because we think that the performance of that product enables customers to get a better value proposition by buying a richer mix so thats why im pretty confident when we get in the back half we see the margins snapping back towards that  that weve articulated as our longterm goal well talk more about the mix of products and whatnot at the investor meeting but the one thing id point you to is remember something like networking which is an atombased server product thats going in while it does have a lower asp than the average within dcg it has an asp thats actually been going up and has a very different cost structure then a xeon does so i wouldnt just immediately assume that because its a lower priced segment of the market that its a marginhindered segment of the market because thats not the case matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc great thank you thats really helpful and then i guess to follow up on that sticking on margin maybe you could talk a little bit about how adding the third chip on nanometer may affect margins going into  in the pc business to offset some of the nanometer ramp costs you had talked about i think its a little bit of a different dynamic than weve seen with the business traditionally with a ticktock approach so any broader comments you can give there about margins would be really helpful i appreciate it thanks stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president let me take the margin side and then ill let brian come in over the top to talk a little bit about the roadmap and how we think about that from the customers perspective so first off we havent forecast  margins so well give you the first glimpse of that when we get to the investor meeting and then well put a formal stake in the ground when we get to next january but i would say that theres nothing that im seeing in the overall roadmap that for me is a significant headwind as we go in  so well give you a lot more insight on that in a few months but im not seeing anything that has me worried as we go into  brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director i guess what i would talk about is kaby lake so one of the things weve learned on  nanometers is how to make meaningful performance improvements both in the silicon and then with the silicon combined with the architecture so we said we already started shipping kaby lake to our customers and oems were seeing meaningful performance across all of the various skus of kaby lake relative to skylake kaby lake is built off a skylake core and as a result the die size doesnt significantly grow so you dont see – theres no driver in the silicon itself to shift the margin structure of this product were able to get the performance and feature enhancements with relatively small silicon increases but good improvement on the raw silicon technology itself so theres not an intrinsic driver that should say die size got twice as big so margins are cut theres nothing like that stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president and it comes in on a process technology thats mature with healthy yields and a healthy cost structure so from that perspective you get a nice performance boost at a good cost structure matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc thank you very much mark h henninger  vice presidentfinance  directorir thanks matt operator thank you our next question comes from the line of romit shah of nomura securities your line is now open romit j shah  nomura securities international inc yes thanks brian i know that you remain cautious overall in the pc market but when you look at some of the thirdparty data it definitely seems like north america was better asia latin america a little mixed im wondering has your view at least on a regional basis changed at all brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director so my regional view would say that certain of the – so north america and western europe has been stronger for us for some period of time and it continues to be the stronger segment for us as you said south america – latin america continues to be weak we see weakness in asia but it did get a little bit better than in the past and that combined with north america were the two drivers that made q perform better than what we had modeled in our high single digits and as i said im being relatively cautious in this and making sure that we put an estimate out there that we are very comfortable with and thats why we have gone with – stuck with our high singledigit view of the year romit j shah  nomura securities international inc the other thing thats been reported is that commercial models have seen some momentum windows  has been a catalyst your view on commercial enterprise has that improved at all over the last  days brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director yes and were hearing that same thing from our customers and as we go out and talk to cios were hearing the same thing those cycles though can sometimes take – youll hear of them and they sometimes can take some time to really kick in so again weve built that into the cautiousness of the second half and making sure that we know what were going into the second half with but we are hearing similar things around the enterprise conversion its comfort with windows  ability to make that transition and wanting to do it on new hardware romit j shah  nomura securities international inc great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of cj muse of evercore isi your line is now open cj muse  evercore group llc good afternoon thank you for taking my question i guess first question on xpoint you talked about stronger growth expectations looking out over the next couple years im just curious if you could share what conversations youve had with customers what use cases youve uncovered and any thoughts in terms of sizing the market brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director so we havent really tried to – we have pretty widespread guesstimates and models right now on sizing the market because were still really learning weve actually started to ship some sample units to customers already to let them try out and start to learn those are to the big call it service providers is mostly who were sending those to youre going to see it enter as ssds youll see those ssds both enterpriseclass ssds and also commercial consumer type ssds we demonstrated in several live demonstrations anywhere from x to x x x x improvement in performance depending on the workload through those ssds so youre going to see those be the first implications when i think about where the big volume will come from i think it will come in that dimm form factor youre going to see it in cloud applications everything from machine learning big data anyplace where you have memoryintensive and where you can do inmemory applications the d xpoint is going to be nicely configured for that it allows you to bring large amounts of storagelike data into a memorylike performance and thats the real key here i also believe youll see it in consumer devices youll see laptops and devices like that gaming machines we think it will have gaming applications where you can preload in a cachelike environment the next level of your game and so it loads almost instantly as you transition within the game so theres going to be a variety of those and actually the more we go and start to play with it start to give it out to customers the more types of applications and workloads were finding that it can be used for cj muse  evercore group llc thats very helpful and i guess as a quick followup stacy can you provide an update on your targeted capital structure here and at what point with net leverage – net cash we should start to see more aggressive buybacks stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure as i communicated i think at the investor meeting or in the last six months our goal is to get back to net cash zero at one point i predicted that that would happen in the back half of this year the combination of business levels being lower from what we thought at the beginning of the year as well as some pretty significant restructuring charges will push that out so that will happen sometime in  although i do think well make good progress towards net cash zero as we move into the back half today our net debt level is right around  billion so well take a big chunk out of that as we move into the back half in terms of then – now that said were still generating excess free cash flow you can see that even in the first half even inclusive of the restructuring charges we did and so you can see we did i think  billion of buybacks in the first half and we have a dividend yield that as of yesterday was about  so i think you see us executing to the priorities that we had articulated mark h henninger  vice presidentfinance  directorir thanks cj and operator i think we have time for two more questions operator thank you our next question comes from the line of vivek arya of bank of america your line is now open vivek arya  bank of america merrill lynch thanks for taking my question for my first one brian im curious there are expectations of intel becoming successful with your g modems in the back half and im curious hows the longerterm visibility around sustaining growth in the business and just the timing as to when you can bring those products from foundry to your own fabs brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director sure so lets just talk about modems really to stay on a leadingedge modem you need to have a yearly cadence of modem technology and so we have just that a yearly cadence laid out we had the  last year we have the  this year we have a series of modems out weve got them built out and planned for the next several years we havent publicly stated when well bring it inside but clearly we plan to well do that when the right point of intercepting the roadmap and getting the right performance off the nanometer is required right now im more concerned about getting the leadingedge momentum going for us with the  and then the followon in  and really showing that we are a worldclass modem company vivek arya  bank of america merrill lynch all right and as my followup staying on the dcg team are you still comfortable this can be a doubledigit growth business over the longer term and i guess as part of that what role does competition play into it with all the recent noise around softbank buying arm and presumably putting more resources into it i understand there are no nearterm implications but just longer term how do you think about growth and competition in dcg thank you brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director sure so let me try and talk about why i am so confident in growth we can talk about competition and then well see if that does not answer your question when i think of the cloud the cloud that we have today is really built on the backs of people its your facebook data its your salesforce data its your twitter data its all data that is really across the devices that we pretty much handle day to day the current estimates are if you look out into  that average person will generate about  gigabytes a day of data off those devices and those are going to be all your posts and pictures and all that kind of information if you take a look at the average autonomous car in  the estimates right now are it will throw off about  gigabytes a minute of data if you take a look at the average autonomous drone doing some kind of scan looking for somebody lost in the forest or scanning a mine its going to throw off about  gigabytes a minute if you take something like our replay technology that is filming in virtual reality a basketball game or a football game its throwing off  gigabytes a minute right now and as we continue to refine the accuracy of that that number will likely just grow so its that growth in data and the need to both process it at the edge and then through the data center and into the cloud to be able to store it to be able to apply machine learning to all of those applications those all tell me that the cloud is going to continue to grow its going to be lumpy these guys dont build out their data centers in a linear fashion they build out a big chunk of overcapacity so that they can go and then sell that and have expansion space and they dont build for a while and so i know people worry about is it slowing down but these trends in data that tell me no its not slowing down over the long term and what youre really going to see is just the buying patterns and the buildouts of the various structures that are going up as far as competition theres always going to be competition in this market i expect it thats okay we think of ourselves as competition in fact we are built on a model that says we have to build a continuous improvement of our products such that we are replacing ourselves with a better costperperformance model over time and so we know that just even if there was no competition the competition is weve got to build a product thats better and drives replacement as well as growth and so i look at the competition as its welcome it keeps us better its always been out there there will always be somebody out there but really what we have to do is build products that are so competitive that people want to replace our products with our new product that then is one of the best models to use for making sure you stay ahead vivek arya  bank of america merrill lynch great thank you mark h henninger  vice presidentfinance  directorir thanks vivek operator can you please go ahead and introduce our first questioner – or last questioner excuse me operator thank you our last question comes from the line of david wong of wells fargo your line is now open david m wong  wells fargo securities llc thanks very much just following up from the earlier round can you give us some feel for your attitude to total amount of debt you have a goal of net cash neutrality but you have an upper limit on the total amount of debt youre willing to carry might you choose at some point to repatriate overseas cash to bring down debt or pay dividends and stock purchases stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president wow so there certainly is a limit to the amount of overall debt that i feel comfortable with but its not something that weve articulated externally and it will vary by the size of the company and the cash flow to my philosophy just generally im not a believer in taking on debt to do stock buybacks you really have not seen us do that obviously its a board decision but im just sharing with you my view of it i wouldnt take on debt in order to do buybacks or to do a special dividend or anything like that david m wong  wells fargo securities llc great thanks very much stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president youre welcome mark h henninger  vice presidentfinance  directorir david did you have a followup it sounds like youre all set david all right thank you all for joining us today operator please go ahead and

nicole and welcome everyone to intels first quarter  earnings conference call by now you should have received a copy of our earnings release cfo commentary and the announcement of our restructuring program if youve not received all three documents theyre available on our investor website intccom im joined today by brian krzanich our ceo and stacy smith our chief financial officer in a moment well hear brief remarks from both of them followed by the qa before we begin let me remind everyone that todays discussion contains forwardlooking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially and a brief reminder that this quarter we provided both gaap and nongaap financial measures following the acquisition of altera now our programmable solutions group today we will be speaking to the nongaap financial measures the cfo commentary and earnings release available on intccom include the full gaap and nongaap reconciliations with that out of the way let me turn it over to brian brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director thanks mark our results in q were in the lower half of the range we set in january and reflect an extra work week in the quarter revenue increased yearoveryear driven by an expanding business portfolio that now includes the programmable solutions group formerly known as altera strength in our data center internet of things and programmable solutions businesses partially offset weakerthanexpected pc revenues in our client business ill take a minute to review our q results before talking about the restructuring program were announcing today ccg revenue grew  yearoveryear we saw ongoing declines in the pc tam particularly in china and other emerging markets which also led to greaterthananticipated reductions in worldwide pc supply chain inventory declines in the pc segment were offset by a richer core mix and the th work week the data center business posted another good quarter growing  over last year on strong cloud and comms service provider demand partially offset by ongoing softness in the enterprise the internet of things group grew a remarkable  yearoveryear due largely to the performance of the video and retail verticals in the memory business strong unit growth was offset by pricing declines leading to revenue that was  lower yearoveryear and in our security business revenue grew  as this team continues to tighten its focus and execution and finally the psg group formerly known as altera got off to a great start it delivered a revenue of  million and after adjusting for  million in acquisitionrelated accounting charges the business achieved midsingledigit growth in less than a quarter after the deal closed we are shipping our first fpga xeon copackaged parts to customers in sample form these results tell the story of intels ongoing strategic transformation which is progressing well and will accelerate in  we are evolving from a pc company to a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected and computing devices the data center and internet of things businesses are now intels primary growth engines and combined with memory and fpgas form and fuel a virtuous cycle of growth last year we achieved record revenue in the data center internet of things and memory businesses they delivered a combined  billion in revenue growth and made up  of our total revenue and contributed the majority of our operating profit today we announced a series of actions that will build on the strength of those franchises and accelerate our strategic transformation through this initiative we will intensify our investments in the products and technologies that fuel the growth in the data center iot memory and fpga businesses and we expect it will result in an even more profitable client business these changes will reduce our global employment by about  positions by mid well do this through site consolidation voluntary and involuntary separations project reevaluation and an intensified focus on efficiency across a variety of programs these are not changes we take lightly we will be saying goodbye to colleagues who have played an important role in intels success yet acting now gives us flexibility flexibility to continue to invest in those client segments that are growing including in gaming and home gateway among others even more importantly acting now enables us to increase our investments in areas that are critical to our future success this restructuring program will allow us to expand our investments in the data center the internet of things memory and connectivity even as we reduce our spending run rate by roughly  billion by mid this is a comprehensive initiative its designed to create longterm value by accelerating the fundamental longterm change already happening at the company today we will emerge as a more collaborative productive team with broader reach and sharper execution and we expect it to result in the highest revenue per employee in the companys history last but certainly not least we have one additional announcement today im happy to share that stacy smith will be taking on a broader new role within intel and reporting to me leading sales manufacturing and operations stacy has been a great business partner and a worldclass cfo and im looking forward to continuing the partnership as he brings his leadership his depth of knowledge and his breadth into these critically important areas for intels future we expect this transition to occur over the next few months following a formal cfo search that will assess internal and external candidates stacy will remain in his cfo role throughout the search and transition process congratulations stacy and with that let me turn the call over to you stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you very much brian and i really appreciate the kind words revenue for the first quarter was  billion up  yearoveryear the quarter showed yearonyear growth and was in the low end of the range of our prior outlook within this we are seeing growth in the data center internet of things security and programmable solutions groups all of which helped offset a weak pc market first quarter gross margin of  was approximately a point higher than our expectations driven by lower nm costs rd and mga was  billion down over  million from our guidance operating income of  billion was up  from a year ago the effective tax rate for the quarter was  about seven points lower than our prior outlook earnings per share of  was up  from a year ago the client computing group had revenue of  billion a  increase yearoveryear this was below our expectations due to a weakerthanexpected pc market operating profit for the client computing group was  billion up  from a year ago this improvement is driven by lower nm unit costs on notebooks lower overall total spending and margin improvements in our mobile products data center group had revenue of  billion delivering  growth on a yearoveryear basis relative to our expectations we saw a weaker enterprise business offset by strength in the cloud segment the data center group had operating profit of  billion up  yearoveryear as we ramp are nm server products our internet of things segment achieved revenue of  million with yearoveryear growth of  we saw strength in both the retail and video display segments of our business internet of things operating profit was  million up over  relative to last year our security business had revenue of  million up  yearoveryear our memory business had revenue of  million up  yearoveryear the segment had an operating loss of  million as a result of challenging pricing increased d xpoint spending and startup costs as we ramp d nand in our china factory the programmable solutions group had revenue of  million when adjusted for the approximately  million of deferred revenue and compared to alteras results from a year ago the business achieved midsingledigit revenue growth operating profit was a negative  million this included over  million in noncash charges for deferred revenue and inventory adjustments plus certain acquisitionrelated charges excluding these charges would result in low doubledigit operating margin growth for this business we generated  billion of cash from operations in the first quarter we purchased  billion in capital assets paid  billion in dividends and repurchased approximately  million of stock in the first quarter total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly  billion down  billion from the prior quarter as a result of closing the altera acquisition our total debt is approximately  billion consistent with our prior commentary on the financing plan for the altera acquisition as we look forward to the second quarter of  we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at  billion after adjusting for the extra work week in the first quarter this forecast is in the low end of the average seasonal increase for the second quarter we are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be  plus or minus a couple of points this decrease in comparison to the first quarter is driven by lower platform volumes turning to the full year  we expect revenue growth in the midsingle digits from  down from the prior guidance we are forecasting robust growth rates in the data center internet of things nonvolatile memory solutions and programmable solutions groups which we expect to offset the decline in the client computing group we now expect the pc markets to decline in the high single digits in  versus our prior forecast of midsingledigit decline our projection of the pc market remains more cautions than thirdparty estimates we are forecasting the midpoint of the full year gross margin to be  a onepoint decrease from the prior outlook driven by lower platform volumes our execution of our strategy is driving growth we are building on our strong position in client and are investing for growth in the data center internet of things markets and disruptive differentiated memory technology the trends over the last two years demonstrate that we are well into this transformational journey from  to  the pc tam declined  yet intels revenue grew  and our operating profit grew  over this horizon but as brian mentioned we want to accelerate that execution in order to do that were going to go through a significant restructuring over the next several months the goal is to come out of this more agile more efficient with more investment on our key growth initiatives and more profitable when completed by mid these actions will result in a person workforce reduction and a  billion reduction to our spending run rate relative to fullyear  we are now revising our spending guidance down by over  million to  billion we expect to realize over half of the total workforce reduction by the end of this year in the second quarter of this year we are taking a  billion restructuring charge on the gaap pl as an estimate for the related actions these actions are significant and we dont embark on this lightly but we are confident that they will build on the strong position we have across markets and accelerate the transformation of the company that is already underway i would like to end on a brief personal note by saying thank you to brian for the upcoming new leadership opportunity intel changes the world with amazing technology and i am proud of what we have accomplished and im excited about the opportunity thats in front of us with that let me turn it back over to mark mark h henninger  vice presidentfinance  directorir all right thank you brian and stacy moving on now to the qa as is our normal practice we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one followup if you have one nicole please go ahead and introduce our first questioner questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of ross seymore of deutsche bank your line is now open ross c seymore  deutsche bank securities inc hi guys thanks for letting me ask a question i guess first and foremost bk if you can go into a little bit more about what led to the restructuring announcement not only the one today but there have been significant changes in senior management over the last three months so if you could just talk us through some of whats changed strategically in the company thats led to such a large amount of turnover so recently brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director sure if you take a look at it so lets step back for a second and just talk about why are we doing the restructuring now and then we can talk about some of the specifics beyond that so weve talked about this transformation that were moving from a clientcentric – intels been typically known as the pc company to a company that is focused more and more on a much broader set of products and really focused around the cloud and the cloud and all the connected devices that connect to that cloud and the connectivity that brings those devices to the cloud and that includes the pc but its much more than that and so what this effort around the restructuring is is to say its time now to try and – weve made enough progress you take a look at it  of our revenue  of our margin comes from areas other than the pc right now its time to make this transition and push the company over all the way to that strategy and that strategic direction so thats why we wanted to do it now lets talk then about the leadership changes there have really only been three leadership changes if we just take the last couple of quarters we had doug davis hes simply retiring those are personal reasons it has nothing to do with his leadership or direction of the company its iot weve talked about iot as one of our growth segments that grew  this quarter  performance in the group is strong and hes staying until we find a successor roughly the end of the year we think something like that kirk chose to leave for some outside opportunities and the one with stacy stacy and i have been working for several months actually several quarters on what does he do next how do we grow his both exposure to other parts of the company but also let the rest of the company see his leadership style and so what we wanted to do is as soon as wed made the decision to go ahead and start a search and start looking for a cfo replacement we wanted to be completely transparent be very open about that and let everyone know its just going to be an orderly transition we are just going to start the search see if stacys solid in the cfo seat in the meantime but this gives him a chance to see other parts of the company if you take a look at the group manufacturing operations which is everything from purchasing to building construction and all and sales its roughly half the company and people and so its a really good opportunity to see how the real operations of the company work ross c seymore  deutsche bank securities inc good thanks for all those details i guess my followup would be the fullyear guidance of midsingledigit growth when i put that together with the high singledigit decline now that you have in the pc business im having a little hard time seeing how if you take the seasonality of pcs out of the equation in large part what would be the lever that would get you there in the back half of the year considering that a ramp to well into the  billion range in revenue seems to be a prerequisite are there some moving parts you could describe to us that get you comfortable with that number stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure let me walk you through how were viewing the year and first let me just put it at the highest level what were projecting for the year is overall growth and we think well see growth in the data center growth in iot growth in memory thats offsetting some and of course we have added in altera now into our product family and so you take that and thats offsetting some of the weakness that were seeing in the pc market specific to the pc market as we said in our prepared remarks we are now expecting that the pc market is down in the high single digits and when we started the year we were in the midsingledigits decline the linearity so first you have to understand the first half is impacted by the fact that as our customers view of the market came down and if you recall we had a more cautious view of the market than they did when we started the year that they were bringing down inventory levels that impacted us in q and i think youll see the same impact as we forecast a roughly seasonal second quarter that well continue to see those customers burning off inventory we think that doesnt repeat in the back half so thats a little bit of a tailwind id also say you want to be careful of – we guided to midsingle digits thats a range if youre mathematically trying to drive to a specific number there you may be driving more back end than what were really anticipating so just a caution there that thats a range thats meant to be directional of how we see the business all of that said i just want to say i think brian and i are very comfortable with the back end and whats implied in our guide based on everything that we know ross c seymore  deutsche bank securities inc great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of blayne curtis of barclays your line is now open blayne curtis  barclays capital inc yes thanks for taking my question i really just wanted to follow up on the restructuring is it more an effort to make the client more profitable or are you really trying to drive revenue and resigning maybe more employees than youre letting go brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director so it is absolutely a situation where we are restructuring to be able to allow ourselves to invest at a faster rate in those growth areas if you take a look at it  to  in the areas of memory with our nand technology iot data center even before this action we were investing more in  than in  in those areas this will allow us to – even with the cuts even with the dollar figures that stacy has read out on the savings its allowing us to invest even more in those segments and i always want to make sure its not just about cutting costs necessarily in the client area we think that we can become more focused there are areas in the client space that are growing ins are growing at doubledigit rates yearoveryear our gaming pcs are growing at doubledigit rates yearoveryear settop boxes are growing and were gaining share in the settop box space so we are doing very well in segments that are growing in the client space and the pc space and we are going to continue to double down focus on those so its really a narrowing down and allowing us as a result also to invest more in those growth areas thats really what were doing here with this restructuring stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president and blayne just to make sure if you look at the cfo commentary just to give – kind of make sure the financial answer is clear there that the  billion in run rate savings is a net number so i just want to be clear on that thats what we expect to achieve and that is encompassing the fact like brian said that well be increasing investments in a lot of different areas brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director correct blayne curtis  barclays capital inc thanks and then i know mobile is within client but i was wondering if thats a segment that you expect to contribute to growth this year and if you could just talk about your confidence in reaching the cost savings for the year brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director sure absolutely on schedule for hitting our committed  million and just like last year well shoot to do better than that mobile is absolutely continuing to grow for us as a segment and we are continuing to increase our profitability if you look underneath the numbers here youll see that the profitability within the mobile space continues to improve for us this year over last year stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes you can really see it blayne in the ccg operating profit thats up over  which is on roughly flat revenues revenues that were up a little bit and when you parse out the big contributions there theres some asp good news but the really big chunks are the improvement in the margin on our mobile products and decreases in investments that we talked to you about in the past that were all included in that mobile profitability so you will see this play out in the ccg profitability over the course this year and you can see it in q blayne curtis  barclays capital inc great thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of harlan sur of jpmorgan your line is now open harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc good afternoon thanks for taking my question im trying to see if you can be just a bit more specific on your full year view does the team anticipate doubledigit growth this year in pcg and if i look at it fundamentally i mean cloud and hyperscale capex looks to be up this year there seems to be a big upgrade cycle in networking with the move to gigabit you guys are rolling out nm broadwell can you guys just be a bit more specific on expectations for dcg growth brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director sure you did a great job explaining exactly why we believe that the data center will continue in doubledigit growth this year and if you take a look at the numbers that stacy has talked about they incorporate doubledigit growth and its for exactly those reasons we believe we have great products that we are introducing with the broadwell lineup we have got – we started shipping our first xeon plus fpga samples to customers which was part of our additional gaining more footprint and more performance in certain segments of the data center were shipping an omnipath fabric now later this year we will have silicon photonics weve got d xpoint starting to be sampled and will start to ramp later this year so were very confident on our data center roadmap and we are still absolutely forecasting doubledigit growth in that space harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc great thanks for the insights there and then in the memory solutions group i mean thats a business that grew  last year i think it was up yearoveryear every single quarter last year obviously it was down in q you guys mentioned aggressive price declines can you just talk about some of the trends that youre seeing there are the sharp declines more focused on capacity or performance optimized ssds and then you also mentioned your view on a strong growth outlook for the full year so what drives the acceleration from the q decline brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director sure so let me start and then we can just talk about – remember the majority of our memory space is built into ssds that are going into the data center so you call those really those higher end performance class systems what we are seeing if you take a look at the units units grew quite nicely yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter for the memory group you are right we are seeing aggressive pricing in this space the memory segment the nand segment especially tends to go on these cycles where theres overcapacity in the industry and aggressive pricing and then it shifts back to more normal pricing and then tight pricing which is always very positive so this is just a normal cycle we think weve done a very good job of structuring the business that we ride through these with a high degree of confidence if i look forward we believe the d nand technology that were just beginning to ramp in our factories today and were building out the dalian factory for later this year startup gives us a real cost advantage in this space and will allow us to even be more profitable in even these kinds of environments so we are still confident that this business will continue to grow we will ride through this capacity situation within the industry and our d nand technology will position us very nicely as we move out of this and start up our dalian factory in china harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc great thank you stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president and the operating margin harlan youre looking at that harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc yes stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president part of it is the competitive pricing environment that brian is talking about but theres a big piece of that that is associated with the investments that we are making in d xpoint and the startup costs associated with the factory in china and it just points to yes its cyclically a tough time in what we consider a very good business and were investing in technology that we think give us a very strong position as we go forward harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc i understand thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of stacy rasgon of bernstein research your line is now open stacy aaron rasgon  bernstein research hi guys thanks for taking my questions my first one on dcg in the quarter so up  year over year but that was with the extra week can you tell us what it might have been year over year without the extra week and why did pricing fall again this quarter stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes so like we said when we started the quarter that extra week was that week between christmas and new years when you look at where that th week fell its a relatively light week it certainly had some impact so i dont want to say none but its a little hard to figure it out on any given business it certainly had some impact on dcg though in terms of the pricing its pretty simple in that it was the growth rate that we saw in the networking segment so what you would see if – the constant mix we would have seen asp up in the data center but the networking segment grew  year on year which is exactly consistent with our strategy and so what you see there is strong unit growth offset by a little bit of a mix down stacy aaron rasgon  bernstein research got it thank you for my followup i just wanted to touch on channel inventories so you had your notebook and desktop volumes i guess down kind of low single digits year over year i think its fair to say the pc builds in the industry were down quite a bit more than that i mean you suggest that you drained out – i guess that the channel drained on inventory what happened with your own inventory in the channel and how do you see that changing for the rest of the year stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president you said own inventory in the channel stacy aaron rasgon  bernstein research the stuff youre shipping into the channel because it seems like your performance yearoveryear was quite a bit better than what the industry was i mean maybe its some share gains maybe its the extra week however you just said the extra week didnt amount for very much so can you explain the differential between your yearoveryear unit shipment performance in pcs and what the market seems to be doing stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president so i would point to two things relative to the overall – like what we saw from our customers one is yes we had a th week thats going to make our compares different from a idc and a gartner for sure but then the second thing is when you look at the results of our customer base they would see a weaker quarter and i think thats because they were catching up to our view of the market and bringing inventory levels down so we were impacted by two things ill put it like that we were impacted by a tam that wasnt terribly strong and the fact that our customers were bringing their inventory levels down some mark h henninger  vice presidentfinance  directorir thanks stacy operator thank you our next question comes from the line of romit shah of nomura your line is now open romit j shah  nomura securities international inc yes thanks very much stacy youre below your run rate on capex in q and i know you reiterated for the year but curious if youre giving yourself flexibility in case the second half doesnt prove out to be as strong as you guys are anticipating stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president no whats going on there is that when you look at the two items that really dominated our capex this year its  nm capacity so its getting that first production capability in place and its the ramp of the memory factory in china and those are both backend loaded so that causes the linearity to be off a little bit romit j shah  nomura securities international inc okay thanks and then just staying on the theme of capex with the restructuring you guys are talking about site consolidation and im wondering if longerterm there will be an impact to the capital expenditures required to support the business and by extension free cash flow stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president id say the same answer when you look at those two items that are the majority of what were spending the capex on nm and memory neither one of those is impacted by the restructuring and so we havent let our foot off the gas one bit on those two things romit j shah  nomura securities international inc okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of cj muse of evercore isi your line is now open cj muse  evercore isi yes good afternoon thank you for taking my question i guess i had a followup on dcg thank you for the commentary around the pricing around network im curious how we should think about the mix shift through as we go through  and here curious in terms of presumably slowing enterprise and an uptick in hyperscale and what that means to asps and then as you layer in ongoing growth in networking how we should think about platform versus asps moving through the year brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director sure a bit of a complex question so let me try and give you a lot of data that i hope will answer various parts of that question so first the simple answer if you take a look at our forecast we continue to forecast asps increasing through this year so thats absolutely built into our forecast and weve modeled in things like you described the weaker enterprise computing and the difference between the pricing segments and i always remind people that – lets just start at the very top when you take a look at the data center its not one product its a family of products that really span from xeon phis that sell for several thousand dollars to networking processors that are a few hundred dollars at times but within each one of those families so whether you have networking or cloud or hyperscale or enterprise computing our asps are increasing and thats mostly due to bringing in better products people buying up the ladder in product and resulting in a higher asp on average for any one of those segments so you will see slight shifts in the overall data center asp we have a boomer quarter like this like stacy talked about networking is a little bit higher or something like that but if you take a look inside any one of those segments asps are increasing and our forecast for the overall segment for the year is an increasing asp its driven by people buying up the stock and thats because were bringing more performance for a better price to those customers cj muse  evercore isi thats very helpful and i guess as a quick followup you outlined the cost savings but it doesnt appear as though theres really anything on the cogs side so curious if you see cost savings on that front as well stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president certainly we are equally focused on efficiencies in the factory space theres a little bit baked into the  gross margin i think youll see a bit more of it kick in in  and just realize the labor cost in the factories is a relatively small component the real opportunity for us is some of the other things around capital efficiency and how fast we convert over processes and things like that and that takes a little while to play through cj muse  evercore isi thats very helpful thank you mark h henninger  vice presidentfinance  directorir thanks cj operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of john pitzer from credit suisse your line is now open john william pitzer  credit suisse securities usa llc broker good afternoon guys thanks for letting me ask the question i guess my first one i wanted to get a little bit more into profitability within the data center group revenue was down about  million sequentially operating profit was down  million sequentially i know there are lots of moving parts you had the extra week of opex that might not have been fully covered by revenue and stacy you talked about in your opening comments the nm ramp starting to hit there but with this new narrative of declining asps because of mix im wondering if you could tell me how we should be thinking about operating profits in the business going forward i think it was about  in the march quarter down pretty significantly in the december quarter is this change in mix also having an impact on operating profits stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president so john you nailed it in terms of whats going on with operating profit in q its just the early cost of the ramp of the nm server product thats whats causing that to behave a little differently from revenue and back to brians point i would say no theres nothing in the mix that per se would cause me to have a different view of the overall profit potential of this business so taking networking as the example it does have a lower asp than the xeon product line does it also has a very different cost structure than the xeon product line does so it doesnt cause us to be in a different space from an overall operating profit percent john william pitzer  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thats helpful and then maybe for my followup to brian you guys gave us your view for the pc market this year im just curious in lieu of the restructuring how youre thinking about the pc market longer term and specifically theres lots going on in the market that you probably cant control but theres always been this view at intel that the best use of cash is to invest in the business and to innovate and innovation drives growth how do you balance that innovation desire with the realities of pc market and how do you think about the structural unit growth of pcs going forward and do we want to risk at some point that pcs just dont provide the scale that youve talked about in the past to invest in other businesses like dcg and iot brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director sure so again john thats a bit of a twosided question so let me start with the back half and then well move into the first half so first is no im not worried that pc will shrink to a point where the scale will get large enough to fund either the factories or the other innovations the fact that we talked about the restructuring actually makes us more profitable in the pc thats allowing us to invest even more in those growth areas remember also those growth areas are growing and so they are replacing some of the volume in the factories as they grow now lets talk about the pc you asked how do we take a look at the pc long term and how do we make sure were making the right investments which to me thats the key thats what we really tried to do with this restructuring is take a look at the areas that are growing that we believe we can bring innovation to that will make a difference to the end user youre going to see more investments in ins youre going to see more investments in thinandlight devices youre going to see us push even harder on highend gaming systems which are growing at a very fast rate and they tend to buy up the stack to the very very top and then were continuing to gain share in segments like settop boxes which are becoming more and more pclike in their capabilities if you think about it from a hardware standpoint so there are absolutely segments well continue to invest and continue to innovate in there are some very innovative systems in design right now that bring new functionality and new thinness and lightness to the market for the second half of this year and well do that what were going to do is make sure were not doing – that were doing this as most efficiently and not doing it spread out across all pcs and all form factors and thats what weve really tried to do with this effort right now john william pitzer  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thats helpful thanks guys mark h henninger  vice presidentfinance  directorir thanks john operator thank you our next question comes from the line of amit daryanani of rbc capital markets your line is now open amit daryanani  rbc capital markets llc thanks a lot i think just to start could you just talk about from a restructuring cost perspective how much of that is going to be cash versus noncash and would all the cash outlays happen in the back half of this year stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president you were a bit faint i think you asked on the restructuring how much of that is cash versus noncash and how does that play out over the year amit daryanani  rbc capital markets llc yes stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes now youre loud and clear thanks so i would say the restructuring charge is a mix of cash and noncash but its probably – its more heavily weighted towards cash costs and it will be relatively frontend loaded on the year but some of it will extend over the course of the year and some of it frankly will extend into the first half of next year amit daryanani  rbc capital markets llc perfect and i guess if i could just follow up asps in the clients were up  just talk about how much of that was potentially cpe improvements on notebook and desktop pricing versus the lower mobility that may have had a better part to play there stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president and if you look at the cfo commentary we actually gave you desktop and notebook what youll see is that notebook was pretty flat from an asp standpoint year on year desktop was up  so that is one of the adders to profitability and then the big difference is what happened in phones and tablets on a yearonyear basis i think i termed it in the cfo commentary up significantly as we weaned ourselves out of some of those contra revenue programs that we talked to you about so that actually had a fairly significant impact on the overall asp for ccg amit daryanani  rbc capital markets llc perfect thank you stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of vivek arya of bank of america your line is now open vivek arya  bank of america merrill lynch thank you for taking my question brian on the data center group there are a lot of headlines from ibm from the different arm server vendors and even from some of your cloud customers like google who want to try new architectures and i understand there is no nearterm impact but longerterm how do you assess the competitive landscape and especially how do you think it plays out in the compute market where you are a very large incumbent versus the comms market where youre not the incumbent brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director sure good question vivek first ill just tell you that having been raised by andy grove always paranoid about the competition always driving and we know that we live or die by the performance of our products we believe if you take a look at our roadmaps we have a strong competitive leadership that should allow us to continue to have the position in the market that we currently have i think also you have to take a look at some of our strategy that is becoming much much broader than just the cpu what we are trying to do is really provide topofrack to bottomofrack solutions that bring that work together and bring performance across the whole rack and that starts with rack scale architecture itself which is a very unique architecture that will allow people to build racks in a much denser and lower cost way to silicon photonics for within rack communication then weve got a d xpoint and then you have our whole cpu architecture from networking storage up through server so we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide that whole rack viewpoint and have everything work together and come together to bring really performance that is just unbelievable and thats whats key to really keeping our position is to own that is to understand that whole rack from top to bottom and that really is our strategy when you take a look at it in the other areas like you said networking and storage and the telco area those are areas that were gaining share and we are as they move to softwaredefined infrastructure and basically virtualized infrastructure it plays right into the intel architecture and really what we do best which is general purpose computing and that same architecture from top of rack to bottom of rack plays out in those areas as well like in the telco area so we believe our strategy absolutely will maintain our position in that but were always paranoid and were always realizing we get there by performance of those products vivek arya  bank of america merrill lynch got it thanks for those details as a followup i know you probably have answered different pieces of this question but perhaps if stacy you could help us quantify what intels target operating margins are this year or maybe even longer term because when i look at a lot of fabless semiconductor companies they can get towards  –  operating margins and when i look at a foundry like tsmc its able to get close to  operating margin so given those bookends where should intel be after all these restructuring actions are taken stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president let me give you some elements of it and then i would expect well have a much more indepth conversation on that at the next investor meeting but i will give you some insight into how brian and i are thinking of this first and foremost we believe there is growth potential here so just from a top line overall company standpoint we think that theres significant opportunity to grow and i think weve executed well in terms of growing over the last couple few years even as the pc tam declined and thats very consistent with our strategy is invest in the data center and memory and iot and things like g where we think theres opportunity and focus our investments on the client that we talked about in terms of the overall model and the financial model for the company ive given you this range of  to  gross margin as being most of the data points landing between those goalposts if you look at it over the last five years weve very consistently been in the very high end of that gross margin range so a bit more like between  and  last year we were at  this year we believe were at  so that just continues i dont see anything on the horizon that changes that in the near term and then with these actions that were taking when we get to full realization and i want to stress we do believe that this will give us an opportunity to reinvest in the business and actually accelerate growth but if you just look at the cost side of it its two to three points of spending as a percent of revenue when we get to mid and full realization that takes our spending as a percent of revenue even just based on your estimate of  revenues of two to three points it takes it back down into the low  from a spending as a percent of revenue and you can do the math from there and see what we think we can achieve next year in terms of overall operating margin vivek arya  bank of america merrill lynch okay thank you very much stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president youre welcome operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of chris danely of citigroup your line is now open christopher b danely  citigroup global markets inc broker hey thanks guys just a quick followup on the last question on restructuring so should we assume that total expenses will drop roughly  million a quarter from q  to the second quarter of  and then if you guys could break that out between how much of the savings would be on cogs versus opex stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president so no im not going to give that level of granularity of forecasting by quarter in  but ill say and i want to be clear that the  billion is all opex so thats an opex savings number that we think we get to by mid and so just to recap some of the financial data that weve provided you we get to that level by mid thats  billion in savings that is a net number so thats including some reinvestment that we plan to make we think that thats  positions that get eliminated which is a very difficult thing for us to go through but thats whats in these numbers we think well achieve half of those employment reductions by the end of this year and overall for  weve brought down our opex by  million that is again due to this restructuring program and weve added in a line that youll see on the gaap pl of  billion in restructuring charges to achieve that so beyond that im not going to go into any more granular data i think that should be plenty and now we want to go have the conversation with the employees and help them understand what this program means christopher b danely  citigroup global markets inc broker yes very fair response and as for my followup in terms of the growth opportunities that you guys are really pushing for iot dcg et cetera i guess if you look at the margin profile of the memory and basically cell phone processors its substantially below your current margins so i guess my question is why would you want to pursue two markets like that where the margin profile is so much lower than yours brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director sure so lets dissect those for memory one we believe that if you take a look at our typical margins theyre better than cell phone margins on typical quarters but also its integral to the data center so it really actually is this virtual cycle that especially as we move to d nand and then to d xpoint as weve talked about d xpoint and how that really rearchitects how memory and storage is played out in the server rack and in the data center overall its a chance to really very uniquely shift that whole infrastructure so we believe thats actually critical to our strategy in the data center and well bring a product with good margins now lets talk about iot if you take a look at it first its growing quite well and if you take a look at the iot right now it grew  this quarter and it has pclike margins so this is not cell phone chips they dont tend to be cell phone chips if you take a look at the segments were really going after which are things like automotive or what ill call autonomous vehicles industrial and retail they tend to be systems that have a fair amount of compute at the edge they tend to have machine learning capabilities and they tend to have a high degree of comms and more and more will move into g so that link also between those products in iot and g and the g infrastructure we believe also plays into the data center and the whole data center strategy and will be critical that you can provide endtoend solutions so if youre somebody out trying to build whatever that autonomous vehicle is you need to be able to provide the g backend but also the g out on the device whether its a car or a drone or a robot or whatever it is out there autonomously moving about stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president and chris let me just on the margin point i would take you back to points that brian and i had made at the investor meeting and at other places which is remember and iot is the perfect example of this those businesses lever ip that we create broadly for the company and so our cost of entry in something like iot actually is relatively low because we have the atom core we have the graphics were investing in the connectivity were investing in the wireless win for other businesses and thats where we really get leverage in this model and thats one of the reasons that the iot profit margins have been as high as they have been christopher b danely  citigroup global markets inc broker got it thanks guys mark h henninger  vice presidentfinance  directorir thanks chris and operator i think we have time for two more questions operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ambrish srivastava of bmo your line is now open ambrish srivastava  bmo capital markets united states hi thank you very much actually i wanted to continue on iot brian a couple of years ago you had laid out a  cagr target for this then i think a year later you had brought it down to midteens and yes it grew very strong this quarter but last full year it was a  grower so the question is whats the right way to think about the growth profile for this business and what happened in the past was it a oneyear off event or kind of just help us understand the drivers and why it should reaccelerate and why the first quarter is not an anomaly and then i had a quick followup brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director sure i would tell you that id reiterate what i said which is its a midteen type of growth rate and you got to take a look at this over the long haul the iot space is like similar to the embedded space a little to some extent and to the fpga space where you have especially where were trying to go where youre trying to go into products that require that higher level of compute the machine learning and those capabilities you have a design time a designin time to win the design and then you have a ramp for that product and so those tend to take a little while autonomous driving vehicles are a good example if youre out winning designs today youre winning  car designs those are what are being won today so as you bring your products to market thats what youre winning so im still believing that over the longterm this will be a midteens growth itll have for the most part pclike margins and weve tried to pick the segments that play to our strengths and that also use the connectivity that we believe were uniquely qualified to bring ambrish srivastava  bmo capital markets united states okay thank you and then my quick followup stacy what explains such a big swing in the tax rate for the quarter for the reported quarter and then for the rest of the year thank you stacy j smith  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure for the reported quarter the big driver of the tax rate was a discrete item associated with one of the divestitures that we drilled out of our security business and we got a onetime tax benefit associated with that and its just coming back to the strategy you can see the performance of the security business both in terms of the revenue growth and their profit growth i think the team there is doing a really good job of focusing in on a few key areas where we think we have competitive advantage and then driving them hard and weve divested a few smaller businesses and then we happened to get a tax benefit on one of them as we look at the year so part of it is just what happened in q and then the other part is we would expect to have a higher proportion of our profits in lower tax jurisdictions as we work our way through the year it will bring down the tax rate a little bit ambrish srivastava  bmo capital markets united states okay thank you mark h henninger  vice presidentfinance  directorir thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of david wong of wells fargo your line is now open david m wong  wells fargo securities llc thanks very much a clarification of the commentary you gave earlier on your restructuring will there be any product lines or types of products that youll be pulling out of in the future with all the cuts that youre making brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director yes im sure that as we go through this and we finish the project evaluations there will be some products that will exit from those as theyre defined murthy who we brought into the company is doing a complete review of all of our products and hes going to report back to me in the near future and give me a proposal for what those look like so we dont have any that are set out today but at the end im sure there are going to be a few that are part of that david m wong  wells fargo securities llc okay and related to that does the restructuring affect your longerterm expectations for technology transitions and in particular are you still hoping to get back to a twoyear ticktock cadence brian m krzanich  chief executive officer  director so no it does not have any effect on our technology cadence it has not touched that at all and stacy talked about even our capex and how the capex that were spending this year which has not moved is mostly for either the d nand ramp or  nm as far as moores law we are always constantly striving to get back to two years were giving you a timing thats for  nm thats more like  years we havent talked about  nm partly its still in definition and alignment so were not sure but i can truly tell you we are constantly working to get back to two years and they have tried to lay out all right if you look at the history of moores law there have been anywhere from  months to three years in the length of cycles over the time more importantly what i always remind people is the leadership you have over the competition which is always whats important all of these are getting harder and they get hard for everybody and so you want to make sure also that your leadership gap what youre able to do relative to the competition remains constant as well both of those are as important as the other david m wong  wells fargo securities llc great thanks very much mark h henninger

jobs oval office    pm est the president  youve never seen so much paper on a president’s desk  laughter  thats because were negotiating lots of deals for our country which will be tremendous   and i just want to introduce brian krzanich whos the ceo of intel a great great company  and brian called a few weeks ago and said we want to do a very big announcement having to do with our country but also having to do mostly with arizona and the jobs and the great technology that will be produced so this is brian  and brian why dont you say a few words and maybe also talk about the product youre going to be making  it’s amazing mr krzanich  yes  thank you mr president for this  it’s an honor to be here today representing intel and to be able to announce our  billion investment in our newest most advanced factory  fab  in chandler arizona  we’ll be completing that factory to make the most advanced nanometer semiconductor chips on the planet intel is very proud of the fact that the majority of our manufacturing is here in the us and the majority of our research and development is here in the us while over  percent of what we sell is sold outside of the us  and were consistently one of the top five exporters in the country and one of the top two research and development spenders in the united states  and weve been able to do that even while the regulatory and tax policies have disadvantaged us in the past relative to the competition we have across the world   and fab  is an investment in intel but also the us’s future in innovation and leadership in the semiconductor industry  fab  will employ approximately  direct highpaying highwage hightech jobs at its peak and over  people in the arizona area in support of the factory  and this factory will produce as i said the most powerful computer chips on the planet powering the best computers the best data centers autonomous cars  all of these devices are the most powerful computing devices on the planet and at intel we have a simple saying that says while other people predict the future we build the future  and this factory is a great example of that i want to thank the president for this opportunity to be here today the president  thank you brian  and you have something over there  show a little bit about the new product mr krzanich  this is an example of the wafer that will be built in fab   this is one of our newest nanometer silicon wafers  sevennanometers will be built in fab   and this is the future of computing the president  thats great thanks  do you have any questions for brian  i know you have none for me so how about  laughter     q    are you going to bring back jobs  the other business you have outside the country do you plan on bringing them back here mr krzanich  this is actually expansion  this is about growth  so this position is actually about growth and new jobs in the us  the president  great thing for arizona  unbelievable company and product and were very happy  and i can tell you the people of arizona are very happy  it’s a lot of jobs  probably the investment  what are you saying your total investment will be what mr krzanich  total investment in just this factory is  billion  but if you take arizona we already have two other factories in arizona  so we have several tens of billions of dollars of investments in factories in arizona  were the numberone private employer in arizona q    and how long have you been planning this investment mr krzanich  weve been working on this factory for several years  we held off actually doing this investment until now q    was there something that president trump did or said that made you want to announce this here and now mr krzanich  it’s really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the us  the president  thank you all   end   pm est brian krzanich  wikipedia brian krzanich from wikipedia the

intel’s nextgen ceo must get inside nextgen devices video asus rog zephyrus gx review while the pc isn’t disappearing anytime soon it may as well be the deranged grandmother locked away within intel’s attic whose faint screams are ignored in the rooms below indeed intel’s newly minted chief executive brian krzanich speaking to analysts and investors in his q  earnings call didn’t even mention notebooks let alone the desktop in his prepared remarks and the only mention he made of the personal computer was a mea culpa “we were slow to respond to the ultramobile pc trend” he said admitting that part of intel’s job was to scan for trends and react to them intelintel chief executive brian krzanichkrzanich has an excuse he’s been on the job for just two months taking over for intel’s prior chief executive paul otellini as analyst patrick moorhead of moor insights noted intel was bailed out once again by its success in the data center market where revenue was up  percent sequentially and flat yearoveryear in intel’s secondquarter earnings which it reported on wednesday but sales within the pc client group plunged  percent compared to the same period a year ago representative of the continuing slide in the pc market but krzanich made clear several things minimizing power not maximizing performance is now the point of almost everything intel does ”ultramobile” is now synonymous with pc desktops and notebooks exist but they won’t be the priority and tablets will make up a small but increasing portion of intel’s business using its atom processor those with the best fabs win intel will ramp its nextgeneration nm manufacturing technology this fall a fundamental approach to increasing performance lowering power consumption and extending battery life defect densities with intel’s current nm process are at record lows intel’s atom processor is now on an equal footing with intel’s core chips with the pc “atom will be an equal player in technological leadership within the product space” krzanich said intelmanufacturing will continue to be a key to intel’s success intel’s call with analysts was also notable for what it downplayed performance over the years i’ve covered chipmakers in silicon valley every conversation at least touched upon performance the frame rates gpus achieved in leadingedge games how well a particular dsp performed a particular operation or the number of mips generated by an embedded cpu instead krzanich applied the performance argument really only where intel faces a disadvantage in the tablet market competing with the lowercost arm processors intel executives have said previously that the upcoming silvermont or bay trail atom chips outperform arm’s cortexa in both performance and battery life a recent dispute appears to give arm an edge over intel’s current clover trail chip however ”so bay trail really first and foremost we believe gives solid performance solid battery life relative to the competition in price points and markets that we’re simply not in in a big way today” krzanich said intel executives reiterated two key points over and over cost and power krzanich didn’t paint intel’s nextgeneration core chip haswell as a tool for healthcare or engineering instead it will help power what krzanich said were  nextgeneration “twoinone” convertible tablet designs and samsung will include intel’s nextgeneration “bay trail” chip and lte baseband solution inside samsung’s upcoming galaxy tab  tablet intelintel’s atom processorintel chief financial officer stacy smith staked out some pretty aggressive price points during intel’s firstquarter call in april touchenabled ultrabooks will sell for  and  during the holidays he said with  “bay trail” windows and arm tablets making up the low end on wednesday krzanich went even further stating that clamshells and touchenabled convertibles could be priced under  and even under  in some cases intelbased tablets should cost about  and as low as  whether those ultracheap tablets will be powered by the older clover trail tablets or the newer bay trail tablets wasn’t clear the fact that intel’s atom processors can be used both with windows and android makes them even more attractive to customers krzanich claimed i’ve wondered before whether intel’s atom and core processors would collide at the low end and whether or not the company would be able to set up a clear delineation between the two if intel can really hit both price points with its two chip families it appears that won’t be a problem and krzanich said as much during thursday’s call “let me say our view right now on bay trail is that we don’t believe it will be cannibalistic in nature” krzanich said “we believe what it really does it allows us to get into these markets that we’re not in in a big way today” the underlying message is that intel believes that is has essentially won the pc market relegating rival amd to the values segment within desktops and notebooks to its credit however amd has captured all of the major consoles and has shown a willingness to design semicustom chips for key partners nevertheless intel is far more worried about the threat arm poses in the tablet and ultraportable market where cost and power are the key metrics to date buyers have been suspicious of heavily discounted tablets and notebooks precisely because the performance has ranged from disappointing to awful intel clearly believes the atom can change that perception if it can intel will also change the game to comment on this article and other pcworld

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
