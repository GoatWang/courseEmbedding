people  real reviews  real results great company to work with  our initial phone call to find out more information was very informative provider name locked gave us a few granite supply companies to go look at granite  he explained the various grades of granite and was able to give us some rough estimates over the phone  we went to look at the different granite slabs and found one that we liked and put it on hold for provider name locked  the granite supplier was very familiar with provider name locked and their great service this was good to know that we were hiring the right company for our granite install   provider name locked came out on time to give us a firm estimate we were impressed with provider name locked s professionalism and honesty we hired provider name locked based on this and all the great reviews posted here on angies list   all of the next scheduled appointments with provider name locked crew from template making to installation were ontime no waiting around wondering when they would show up  during the installation  provider name locked called a few hours into the job to check to see how everything was going  then he showed up personally to talk to make sure he was meeting our expectations  i also used provider name locked plumber to install the sink plumbingfaucet  once the countertops were installed  provider name locked did another follow up to ensure we were satisfied with the countertops  it is easy to tell that provider name locked is dedicated to great customer service and wants to make sure the job is done right  we would hire them again for any future granite needs  duane h the process was very smooth  they came out and measured in order to create a template i went to the showroom so that i could pick exactly what i wanted and then they came out and installed it in a timely manner   the installers were very professional and courteous  i was very happy with the entire process  jan h i dealt with provider name locked before making the decision to have the work done by onyx and she could not have been more helpful and patient answering my many questions  i went and met her in person to view samples get final questions answered and i decided then to have them do the job after getting many other estimates  there was no sales pressure at all which i really appreciated  provider name locked set up appointments for the measuring and then the installation  both crews were timely and extremely friendly  the job was done on time with only  added to the original estimate after exact measurements were taken which is reasonable  i would say that the new countertops are absolutely perfect and look magnificent  i would strongly recommend onyx to anyone  excellent company  thanks  emily g join angies list to view

back with proper care your new jonathans™ wild cherry spoon will last a lifetime i recommend that you scrub them with a scotchbrite® pad using soap and water occasionally oil them when you want them to look their best – natural coconut oil is my favorite i do not recommend using a dishwasher for any wood as the drying cycle dehydrates wood too rapidly which can cause it to crack and cleaning agents may age the surface of the wood other than that people say my spoons survive their dishwasher’s just fine the color of my spoons will deepen with use and with age their beauty goes beyond skin deep becoming the cherished utensils that we always reach for – embodying the internal beauty of usefulness happy cooking  johnathan  add to cart frequently asked questions q what is xtrema made of a
