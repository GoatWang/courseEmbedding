off how you’ll be able to control your hue lights from notification center in ios  triblio a startup that says it’s bringing “science to the art of content marketing” is announcing that it has raised  million in seed funding content marketing startups ie the ones that help companies produce blog posts videos and other content that can indirectly promote their brand have announced some big rounds this year — newscred raised  million percolate raised  million and contently raised  million and if recent product launches are any indication there’s an appetite for more data around this content too triblio’s ceo andre yee was previously vice president of product development at oracleacquired eloqua and he told me that triblio is different in a couple of ways for one thing he noted that many of these content marketing companies are trying to sell their tools to outfits that market to consumers while triblio is more focused on businesses that sell their products to other businesses second he said that unlike the competition he’s less focused on “the process of production” and more on “the science of content” “what is my buyer interested in right now” yee added “what conclusions can i draw about their propensity to engage with me what’s the next piece of content that needs to be served up to them in order to engage them we provide the intelligence to make that happen” he said that there are three main pieces to the triblio platform first it looks at users visiting your website or engaging with your company on social media and assigns them a certain persona for example a company trying to reach customer service managers can create a that persona in triblio and identify the common characteristics of customer service managers — then triblio will determine what stories are popular among those kinds of people and recommend content that’s likely to be relevant to them second there’s “a content development kit” with things like a content calendar and workflow management so triblio isn’t ignoring the production process entirely third triblio tracks the effectiveness of content on your website and on social media the company just left private beta and it says its customers include deltek parature vocus and neustar as for the funding it was led by longworth venture partners and kepha partners kepha’s eric hjerpe and longworth’s jim savage are joining triblio’s

for free phones this increases the effectiveness of the discount promo as well as the promotion’s efficiency since discounts are not needlessly given away slideout and popup methods mattertriblio’s technology gives marketers control to choose the best slideout or popup method to achieve results for example blog traffic visitors should see ctas before exiting the page because blog pages are an entry and exit page if visitors are at your product page however they are engaged the best tactic would be to slide out a relevant cta after the visitor has been on the page for more than a few
