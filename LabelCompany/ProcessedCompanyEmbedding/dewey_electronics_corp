contact us directly  deweydeweyelectronicscom research  development if the problem involves diesel fuel and clean efficient power in a challengingmobile environment we want to be involved dewey provides research and development engineering prototyping testing and evaluation specifically relating to compact diesel power generation we sometimes describe it creating systems that can be fielded quickly  the rd is focused on integration with a lower case r and upper case d we can provide practical expertise in dealing with constrained parameter systems for military applications such as meeting extreme requirements for fuel consumption space claim or altitude our practical focus includes engineers with years of experience in our manufacturing facility as well as experience getting complete electromechanical systems successfully fielded our prototype team has had multiple careers building production systems and prototyping military hardware we are neither fuel cell scientists nor power conversion gurus what we are very good at is integrating bestinclass technology from our partners to produce an optimized overall system with the highest probability of successful operation we can be critical team members on the development of technologies involving power generation or we can bring all this experience to trouble shooting an existing system or resolving a design problem while still achieving the minimum possible sized system here are some examples of projects we have done fuel cell and reformer systems for the m abrams tank customer funded we are not fuel cell or reformer scientists what we are providing are the controls for operating a complex dirty diesel reformer combined with managing and converting the power output of an kw fuel cell here we are providing extensive experience on how to build and miniaturize military grade controls power conversion power management and overall system architecture partners on the other aspects of the project are altex synergy and the funding agency is the tardec download control system for fuel reformer case study   kw dc to dc power conversion for fuel cells customer funded as part of the fuel cell effort we worked with outside partners to develop a high efficiency compact power conversion system that is capable of managing the loads on the fuel cell stack during startup full load and shutdown output is  volts dc novel voltage regulation in field wound alternators internally funded we developed a novel system for voltage and current regulation in field wound alternators this was incorporated into our successfully optimized hybrid dc generators that improved energy storage for batteries and provided endpoint dcac power conversion leading edge diesel engine based battery charging internally funded this was an effort to prove out and develop highly fuel efficient and rapid battery charging of lead acid agm and lithium type batteries using manportable diesel engines by integrating engine alternator current and voltage control we have been able to demonstrate excellent round trip efficiencies with battery charging while reaching theoretical limits for minimum engine operating time and fuel consumption we have developed a deep understanding of battery charging combined with significant knowledge of generator design this has enabled us to deliver unmatched system efficiencies when designing dc generators and integrating energy storage battery systems  proofofconcept system for tactical idle reduction of m long haultractor trailer customer funded dewey designed tested and delivered to the army two proofofconcept systems capable of generating kw of v ac kw of v dc and  ton of cooling and heating at  degrees f to  degrees f we designed the system and prototyped a diesel generator capable of both ac and dc power and partnered with ametek to design and deliver a rugged environment single part ecu for mounting on the back of the  cab   other projects sound mitigation research on hz aircooled diesel engines customer funded part of a larger contract this effort focused on mapping sound levels from various components of the kw aircooled open frame diesel generator we were able to demonstrate reductions in sound from  dba to  dba this was accomplished by developing resonant air chambers for combustion air intake internal sound barriers and a soft fabric enclosure that covered less than  of the open area of the generator   compact permanent magnet high frequency alternator design internally funded we have worked closely with outside resources to design new permanent magnet alternators which we built and integrated with high frequency power electronics the alternator was designed to operate at speed ranges of    rpm generating voltages in the    volt range and with rated output of  watts high frequency power conversion systems for dc output customer funded we have developed the ac  dc power electronics needed to provide mil spec grade power output from high speed permanent magnet alternators in the kw  kw range more recently we have provided ground up design and integration of prototype kw dc  dc power converters for fuel cell applications the hardware provides mil spec  volt power and carefully managed loading for a kw fuel cell with a voltage range of    aircooled two stroke spark ignited  and  hp ultra light diesel engines customer and internally funded we searched out and demonstrated novel diesel engine technology for the creation of lightweight synchronous electrical power generation this effort involved a novel small diesel engine design with a focus on attempting to transition the technology to a higher trl for synchronous ac power generation this project failed however we learned a great deal and solved a large number of smaller issues around engine design and optimized performance within military operating environments we know more than we want to admit about novel small diesel engine technology engine evaluation
