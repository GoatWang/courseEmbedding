scene in the great plains if pickens plan is adopted the pickens plan is an energy policy proposal announced july   by american businessman t boone pickens pickens wants to reduce american dependence on imported oil by investing approximately us trillion in new wind turbine farms for power generation which he believes would allow the natural gas currently used for power generation to be shifted to fuel cng trucks and other heavy vehicles pickens stated that his plan could reduce by  billion  the amount the country spends annually on foreign oil contents  proposal  timetable  wind power status

pickens motives and methods  support campaign  major endorsements  see also  references  external links proposaledit the main proposals of the plan are private industry would fund and install thousands of wind turbines in the great plains which pickens refers to as the potential wind corridor of the united states due to favorable wind resources and geographic location pickens estimates that these turbines could generate enough power to provide  percent or more of the countrys electricity supply government would pay for electric power transmission lines to connect the turbine farms to the power grid they would provide energy to the midwest south and western regions of the country with wind energy providing a large portion of the nations electricity the natural gas that is currently used to fuel power plants would be used instead as a fuel for thousands of vehicles to increase efficiency the plan puts an emphasis on natural gasburning fleets of trucks and buses thus the demand for petroleum products made from imported oil would be reduced timetableedit pickens thinks his plan that would provide  of electricity from wind power and the conversion for vehicles from gasoline to gas could be accomplished in less than  years with the right leadership however according to chuck mcgowin senior project manager at the electric power research institute a nonprofit organization funded by the electric power industry the time table is too tight dave hamilton director for global warming and energy projects at the sierra club agrees that is extremely aggressive  but its in the right direction its a good thing we have an oilman saying we cant drill our way out of this problem former us vice president al gore who has spent recent years informing people about global warming opines that all electricity generation should be completely fossilfuel free in the next  years wind power status and potentialedit further information wind power in the united states wind power had been experiencing exponential growth in the united states for several years when pickens announced his plan wind power in texas grew very rapidly  from  to  in another large state california wind generation increased by  in the same period the cost of wind power generation has decreased by about  over the last  years because of technological advances and is now costcompetitive with other energy sources windgenerated electricity can be produced at  to  cents per kwh a yardstick used to determine locations with high potential wind energy production is referred to as wind power density wpd it is a calculation relating to the effective force of the wind at a particular location frequently expressed in terms of the elevation above ground level over a period of time it takes into account wind velocity and mass color coded maps are frequently prepared for a particular area described for example as mean annual power density at  meters the results of the above calculation are entered into an index developed by the national renewable energy laboratory and referred to as nrel class the larger the wpd calculation the higher it is rated by class the pickens plan calls for increasing the installed wind power capacity by at least a factor of ten from its  level by citation needed this would tap only a small fraction of total us wind power potential which is estimated to be as much as  times more than the year electricity demand in the united states installed us wind power year nameplate capacity mw                     a bar graph displaying us installed wind power from  to  map of available wind power for the united states at m color codes indicate wind power density class note the shortage of transmission lines through much of the great plains wind corridor technical issuesedit power generation and transmission linesedit further information high voltage direct current and super grid high voltage transmission lines pickens says that his plan could generate enough wind power to provide  percent of the countrys electricity the institute for energy research ier an organization that is funded by the oil industry disagrees the ier claims that pickens plan relies on government subsidies and that producing large amounts of wind power is not a viable option instead the ier advocates less government for more abundant and affordable energy pickens acknowledges that natural gas would still be required for peak electricity demand and additional infrastructure would be needed to distribute the wind energy across the country new transmission lines worth  billion to  billion would be needed to carry the power from the windmills to the cities pickens testified before the senate homeland security and government affairs committee and said the government should begin building transmission lines for windgenerated power in the same way that president eisenhower did by declaring an emergency to build the interstate highway system in the s and s as an alternative pickens proposed that the government should provide the right of way on private land and extend tax credits so the private sector can build the lines kenneth medlock iii an energy fellow at the james a baker iii institute for public policy and a critic of pickens plan said a lot of what hes trying to do is add value to a stranded asset despite the recession denver oil man philip anschutz is moving forward with the construction of a wind farm in southern wyoming and a mile  km transmission line to phoenix las vegas and southern california intermittencyedit main articles intermittent power source and wind intermittency one of the challenges with using wind to replace natural gas is the intermittent nature of wind energy since the same wind conditions are not always present according to a  study by archer  jacobson published in the journal of applied meteorology and climatology interconnecting ten or more widely separated wind farms allows  to  of the total energy produced – of nominal capacity to be used as reliable baseload electric power as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height to dispatch power when the wind isnt blowing backup power plants would be needed according to paul fremont an electricutility analyst at the investment bank jefferies  co natural gas plants can quickly be brought online to supply peaking capacity during periods of low wind or peak demand according to art holland a director at pace global energy services the us will need to replace  mw of gas plant capacity over the next  years due to plant retirements this translates to twice as much wind capacity due to the difference in capacity factorscitation needed instead of dispatching additional power generation energy could be conserved on demand the smart power grid an intelligent power distribution network currently being researched and developed can reduce power consumption at the client side during peak hours and thereby lessen our dependence on gas for load following storing electricity is currently significantly more expensive than using dispatchable generation but it can be donecitation needed wind energy can be stored by pumping water uphill when the wind is blowing and then releasing it through turbine generators when the electricity is needed tvas raccoon mountain pumpedstorage plant near chattanooga tn is just one example of many such installations that already exist in the us another option is to uprate the peak generating capacity of existing hydroelectric dams by adding more generator units this allows a hydroelectric plant to buffer the variable output of wind farms on the grid by accumulating river water during periods of strong winds and releasing extra water when winds are calm and power demand is high a dam that impounds a large reservoir can store and release large amounts of water by adjusting the reservoir level within a few meterscitation needed compressedair energy storage is another energy storage mechanism when there is excess electrical energy production air is compressed and stored in a limestone cavern then when the energy is needed again the compressed air generates electricity by blowing through a turbine vanadium redox batteries are being used to store energy and level loads from wind generation projects the excess energy is stored chemically in different ionic forms of vanadium in a dilute sulphuric acid electrolyte the reaction can be reversed which allows the battery to be charged discharged and recharged making the transitionedit cng powered bus pickens plan proposes that the natural gas that is currently used to fuel power plants be used instead as a fuel for class  and  semis ken medlock a research fellow at the baker institute for public policy at rice university says that the us will continue to use natural gas for electric power generation natural gas burns cleaner than coal making it an increasingly popular fuel for power plantscitation needed gas plants also produce fewer greenhouse gas emissionscitation needed the technology needed for compressed natural gas cng vehicles such as city buses fork lifts and passenger cars with cng drivetrains is available now honda sells the civic gx with a mile  km range in addition it is possible to convert vehicles to run on cng in addition to leaving the conventional fuel injection intact allowing the driver to switch back and forth at will kits are available for the doityourselfer one can buy a cng compressor called phill that hooks up to the city natural gas line making it possible to refuel a cng car at home on the other hand the ier believes that natural gas vehicles are a niche product patricia monahan believes its going to be a big price tag to switch to cng vehicles monahan considers cng an excellent fuel for running small fleets of vehicles which log heavy mileage per vehicle such as buses and garbage trucks vehicles which use large amounts of fuel realize savings more quickly from the lower price of cng relative to dieselcitation needed in november  pickens changed his position stating that he wants heavy trucks not cars running on natural gas rich kolodziej president of ngvamerica says the very limited distribution network for natural gas is currently available in only  out of  gas stations would better serve commercial fleets and longhaul trucks policy issuesedit renewable portfolio standardsedit twentyfour states plus the district of columbia have renewable portfolio standards in place to set targets for renewable energy in those states four more states have set nonbinding energy targets economic issuesedit fundingedit the energy policy act of  created the clean renewable energy bond creb program effectively offering interestfree debt to eligible renewable projects in october  the creb program was extended to march   since july  pickens’ dallasbased investment firm bp capital has lost as much as  billion as a result of the falling stock market and credit crunch pickens may have lost around  million of his personal funds cost of wind vs natural gasedit according to jerry taylor senior fellow at the cato institute using wind to generate most of the nations electricity would undoubtedly result in higher retail electric rates because wind power is twice as expensive as natural gasfired generation and probably more if you take out the subsidies however the american wind energy association points out that the cost of wind power has dropped by more than  in the last  years and expects the cost to continue to decline as the industry matures in contrast the cost of natural gas is expected to rise moreover the effects on the environment and public health for natural gas are estimated to cost some  to  cents per kwh similar costs from wind are marginal peak gasedit parts of this article those related to this section need to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information january  main article peak gas us gas production since  source us eia the use of natural gas is a key component to pickens proposal there are concerns however that gas production has already reached its maximum production rate a point known as peak gascitation needed us gas production peaked in  at about  trillion cubic feet declined until  and has been slowly increasing over the last  years see figure on left according to peak theory the rate of production enters a terminal decline after the peak peak gas has already been confirmed by exxons ceo lee raymond in  he said to reuters that gas production has peaked in north america the reuters article continues to say while the number of us rigs drilling for natural gas has climbed about  percent over the last year and prices are at record highs producers have been struggling to raise output john decicco a senior fellow at environmental defense is critical of the plan because it assumes that gas would remain cheap despite growing demand and increasing reliance on imports as evidenced by proposals for lng terminals however implementing pickens plan does not require an increase in the supply of natural gas it calls for a shift in its use rather than an increase natural gas production has been slightly and consistently increasing in the united states for more than two decades proven recoverable us gas reserves have slightly but consistently risen since  and are about the same as in  estimates of technically recoverable reserves in the united states vary as they are generated by geological inferences but the us energy information administration  estimate is  trillion cubic feet enough to provide domestic production at  rates for nearly  years other optionsedit nuclear power vs wind poweredit main articles nuclear power nuclear power debate and radioactive waste pickens plan will require the construction of large scale wind farms to generate electricity critical of the plan the national center for public policy research a self described conservative think tank asserts that nuclear power plants would be a better alternative than the wind farms they say that nuclear power is also environmentally sound and creates very little waste that nuclear power is also far cheaper than wind power and that to build the wind farms would take many square miles of land electricity vs natural gas for powering vehiclesedit allelectric tesla roadster to some this plan seems to ignore one of the most fruitful pathscitation needed to cut into america’s foreign oil addiction plugin hybrids and fully electric vehicles wind generated electricity could directly fuel america’s evermore electrified transport sector some hybrid owners argue the part that using compressed natural gas as a transportation fuel does not make sense especially when the new wave of electric and hybridelectric vehicles that are expected to hit the market in the coming years the us government is already promoting the adoption of phevs and evs the  billion bailout bill signed by president bush in  includes tax credits up to  for us buyers of electric vehicles and plugin hybrids pickens does not believe that all electric vehicles are viable especially truckscitation needed in his plan natural gas primarily replaces diesel fuel pickens frequently makes the statement that the battery wont move an eighteen wheeler

current design is capable of pulling a pound cargo container at speeds up to  mph and has a range of between  and  miles william tahil of meridian international research acknowledges that hybrid or completely electric longhaul semitrucks are technically possible but poses the question if there is enough lithium carbonate production currently to support the production of the needed batteries gores global warming vs pickens planedit the plans of t boone pickens and al gore have some similarities  each lessens the dependence on fossil fuels  but differ in their eventual goals pickens specifically wants to see energy security by increasing the use of domestic energy sources including fossil fuels while gore wants to eliminate the burning of fossil fuels altogether to stop global warming pickens claims to have a plan that could accomplish this with existing technology while gore advocates new research to reduce costscitation needed a study by the european renewable energy council states that the burning of fossil fuels for energy could be eliminated globally by  using existing technology and earlier for western nations dependence on foreign fuelsedit pickens estimates that his plan would cut oil imports by  percentcitation needed patricia monahan deputy director of the clean vehicles program at the union of concerned scientists thinks differently she questions the wisdom of trying to replace large amounts of imported oil with another fossil fuel especially considering that the united states already has to import  percent of the natural gas it uses the us has been steadily increasing its imports of natural gas since  see figure to the left mainly from canada according to jerry taylor senior fellow at the cato institute is that foreign oil is not bad it is good the us is now importing about  of its oil needs annually because it is cheaper than other forms of energycitation needed taylor says that if compressed natural gas is the best option for transportation fuel then the markets will see it and over time cng could outperform gasoline as a cheaper transportation fuel questions over pickens motives and methodsedit many critics of the pickens plan highlight ways that pickens could potentially benefit personally from the plan for instance pickens owns the water rights to a huge ancient aquifer in the texas panhandle and overall owns more water than anyone else in the us increasing water demands and drought may make cities in the great plains willing to purchase water at high prices implementing pickens plan would give him rights to build electric transmission lines and by getting a wider right of way it would allow pickens to build water pipelines a similar strategy was attempted in texas where pickens is building a wind farm that will bring electricity to dallas texas the proposed pipeline would have followed the same mile  km corridor as the electric transmission lines from the wind farms which was to be seized for utility use from private owners through eminent domain many texas landowners and legislators denounced the plan particularly the fact that it allowed eminent domain to be exercised by an agency consisting only of t boone pickenss employees in september  the water pipeline was suspended t boone pickens continues to purchase water rights in the great plains and has plans to build more smaller wind farms t boone pickens would be in an excellent position to benefit financially if the plan is implemented his hedge fund bp capital is highly invested in wind and natural gas enterprises he is the majority stockholder of clean energy the largest supplier of natural gas for vehicles in the united states in rebuttal to many critics opposition pickens insists his interest is more in the countrys future than his personal wealth possibly as a move against such accusationscitation needed pickens has donated over  million to philanthropic causes in the last few years he has often been on the chronicle of philanthropys list of top us philanthropists still there are some who are uneasy about a man who made millions in the oil business advocating clean energy when it comes to the pickens plan the burr under my saddle is pickens himself i mean isnt an oil guy selling air and gas a little like donald trump pitching poverty its downright uncomfortable — jay mcdonald real concerns over natural gas being used for both home heat and vehicle fuel are that they may create shortages every year in the winter months when demand for home heating natural gas skyrockets since many american home owners already use natural gas to heat their homes a huge increase in demand for natural gas as a vehicle fuel combined with the existing huge home heating demand based on harsh winter temperatures could drive up natural gas prices ever year this could be especially economically devastating to family budgets during the holiday months when people normally allocate more of their money for holiday shopping having to pay more for vehicle fuel and home heat at the same time because both would be the same product could have a major economic impact on the nation every year another concern is that the reasoning behind the big immediate push for a natural gas future is to lock out possible development and implementation of more viable renewable energy sources if people can be convinced that natural gas is the best possible future and a large expenditure can be made now for a massive natural gas infrastructure to use natural gas for vehicle fuel it will be much more difficult to abandon natural gas as a vehicle fuel and move on to newer less expensive renewable energy sources as they become more viable to use if renewable fuel sources are allowed to develop before the country can be convinced to move to natural gas the window of opportunity to addict the country to natural gas may close and the people associated with the natural gas industry would lose a lot of money now and in the foreseeable future interestingly enough the pickens plan which manywho believe is designed to make pickens himself much more wealthy is a nonprofit organization support campaignedit pickens announced that he would spend  million on a multimedia effort to promote his proposal through both old media such as newspapers and television and new media including youtube facebook myspace twitter and the creation of a new social network on the pickens plan website as part of this effort pickens has appeared on many american news programs and talk shows such as the newshour with jim lehrer good morning america the tonight show with jay leno larry king live fox news and the daily show with jon stewart pickens is aided by his spokesperson jay rosser and political ad firm joe slade white  co to raise political support pickens planned to organize supporters by congressional districts he also met with the main party candidates for the  united states presidential election to discuss his plan he met with john mccain on august   and with barack obama on august   in october  pickens announced that the one millionth person had signed up to support his plan and that two us senators  us congressmen and nine governors had pledged to enact an energy plan that reduces our foreign oil dependence by at least  within ten years a year later another  people had signed up to support the plan major endorsementsedit carl pope executive director of the sierra club has expressed support for the pickens plan and stated “to put it plainly t boone pickens is out to save america” former clinton white house chief of staff and current president of the center for american progress john podesta supports the plan barack obama has stated he supports many elements of

adopted the pickens plan is an energy policy proposal announced july   by american businessman t boone pickens pickens wants to reduce american dependence on imported oil by investing approximately us trillion in new wind turbine farms for power generation which he believes would allow the natural gas currently used for power generation to be shifted to fuel cng trucks and other heavy vehicles

plains which pickens refers to as the potential wind corridor of the united states due to favorable wind resources and geographic location pickens estimates that these turbines could generate enough power to provide  percent or more of the countrys electricity supply government would pay for electric power transmission lines to connect the turbine farms to the power grid they would provide energy to the midwest south and western regions of the country with wind energy providing a large portion of the nations electricity the natural gas that is currently used to fuel power plants would be used instead as a fuel for thousands of vehicles to increase efficiency the plan puts an emphasis on natural gasburning fleets of trucks and buses thus the demand for petroleum products made from imported oil would be reduced timetableedit pickens thinks his plan that would provide  of electricity from wind power and the conversion for vehicles from gasoline to gas could be accomplished in less than  years with the right leadership however according to chuck mcgowin senior project manager at the electric power research institute a nonprofit organization funded by the electric power industry the time table is too tight dave hamilton director for global warming and energy projects at the sierra club agrees that is extremely aggressive  but its in the right direction its a good thing we have an oilman saying we cant drill our way out of this problem former us vice president al gore who has spent recent years informing people about global warming opines that all electricity generation should be completely fossilfuel free in the next  years wind power status and potentialedit further information wind power in the united states wind power had been experiencing exponential growth in the united states for several years when pickens announced his plan wind power in texas grew very rapidly  from  to  in another large state california wind generation increased by  in the same period the cost of wind power generation has decreased by about  over the last  years because of technological advances and is now costcompetitive with other energy sources windgenerated electricity can be produced at  to  cents per kwh a yardstick used to determine locations with high potential wind energy production is referred to as wind power density wpd it is a calculation relating to the effective force of the wind at a particular location frequently expressed in terms of the elevation above ground level over a period of time it takes into account wind velocity and mass color coded maps are frequently prepared for a particular area described for example as mean annual power density at  meters the results of the above calculation are entered into an index developed by the national renewable energy laboratory and referred to as nrel class the larger the wpd calculation the higher it is rated by class the pickens plan calls for increasing the installed wind power capacity by at least a factor of ten from its  level by citation needed this would tap only a small fraction of total us wind power potential which is estimated to be as much as  times more than the year electricity demand in the united states installed us wind power year nameplate capacity mw                     a bar graph displaying us installed wind power from  to  map of available wind power for the united states at m color codes indicate wind power density class note the shortage of transmission lines through much of the great plains wind corridor technical issuesedit power generation and transmission linesedit further information high voltage direct current and super grid high voltage transmission lines pickens says that his plan could generate enough wind power to provide  percent of the countrys electricity the institute for energy research ier an organization that is funded by the oil industry disagrees the ier claims that pickens plan relies on government subsidies and that producing large amounts of wind power is not a viable option instead the ier advocates less government for more abundant and affordable energy pickens acknowledges that natural gas would still be required for peak electricity demand and additional infrastructure would be needed to distribute the wind energy across the country new transmission lines worth  billion to  billion would be needed to carry the power from the windmills to the cities pickens testified before the senate homeland security and government affairs committee and said the government should begin building transmission lines for windgenerated power in the same way that president eisenhower did by declaring an emergency to build the interstate highway system in the s and s as an alternative pickens proposed that the government should provide the right of way on private land and extend tax credits so the private sector can build the lines kenneth medlock iii an energy fellow at the james a baker iii institute for public policy and a critic of pickens plan said a lot of what hes trying to do is add value to a stranded asset despite the recession denver oil man philip anschutz is moving forward with the construction of a wind farm in southern wyoming and a mile  km transmission line to phoenix las vegas and southern california intermittencyedit main articles intermittent power source and wind intermittency one of the challenges with using wind to replace natural gas is the intermittent nature of wind energy since the same wind conditions are not always present according to a  study by archer  jacobson published in the journal of applied meteorology and climatology interconnecting ten or more widely separated wind farms allows  to  of the total energy produced – of nominal capacity to be used as reliable baseload electric power as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height to dispatch power when the wind isnt blowing backup power plants would be needed according to paul fremont an electricutility analyst at the investment bank jefferies  co natural gas plants can quickly be brought online to supply peaking capacity during periods of low wind or peak demand according to art holland a director at pace global energy services the us will need to replace  mw of gas plant capacity over the next  years due to plant retirements this translates to twice as much wind capacity due to the difference in capacity factorscitation needed instead of dispatching additional power generation energy could be conserved on demand the smart power grid an intelligent power distribution network currently being researched and developed can reduce power consumption at the client side during peak hours and thereby lessen our dependence on gas for load following storing electricity is currently significantly more expensive than using dispatchable generation but it can be donecitation needed wind energy can be stored by pumping water uphill when the wind is blowing and then releasing it through turbine generators when the electricity is needed tvas raccoon mountain pumpedstorage plant near chattanooga tn is just one example of many such installations that already exist in the us another option is to uprate the peak generating capacity of existing hydroelectric dams by adding more generator units this allows a hydroelectric plant to buffer the variable output of wind farms on the grid by accumulating river water during periods of strong winds and releasing extra water when winds are calm and power demand is high a dam that impounds a large reservoir can store and release large amounts of water by adjusting the reservoir level within a few meterscitation needed compressedair energy storage is another energy storage mechanism when there is excess electrical energy production air is compressed and stored in a limestone cavern then when the energy is needed again the compressed air generates electricity by blowing through a turbine vanadium redox batteries are being used to store energy and level loads from wind generation projects the excess energy is stored chemically in different ionic forms of vanadium in a dilute sulphuric acid electrolyte the reaction can be reversed which allows the battery to be charged discharged and recharged making the transitionedit cng powered bus pickens plan proposes that the natural gas that is currently used to fuel power plants be used instead as a fuel for class  and  semis ken medlock a research fellow at the baker institute for public policy at rice university says that the us will continue to use natural gas for electric power generation natural gas burns cleaner than coal making it an increasingly popular fuel for power plantscitation needed gas plants also produce fewer greenhouse gas emissionscitation needed the technology needed for compressed natural gas cng vehicles such as city buses fork lifts and passenger cars with cng drivetrains is available now honda sells the civic gx with a mile  km range in addition it is possible to convert vehicles to run on cng in addition to leaving the conventional fuel injection intact allowing the driver to switch back and forth at will kits are available for the doityourselfer one can buy a cng compressor called phill that hooks up to the city natural gas line making it possible to refuel a cng car at home on the other hand the ier believes that natural gas vehicles are a niche product patricia monahan believes its going to be a big price tag to switch to cng vehicles monahan considers cng an excellent fuel for running small fleets of vehicles which log heavy mileage per vehicle such as buses and garbage trucks vehicles which use large amounts of fuel realize savings more quickly from the lower price of cng relative to dieselcitation needed in november  pickens changed his position stating that he wants heavy trucks not cars running on natural gas rich kolodziej president of ngvamerica says the very limited distribution network for natural gas is currently available in only  out of  gas stations would better serve commercial fleets and longhaul trucks policy issuesedit renewable portfolio standardsedit twentyfour states plus the district of columbia have renewable portfolio standards in place to set targets for renewable energy in those states four more states have set nonbinding energy targets economic issuesedit fundingedit the energy policy act of  created the clean renewable energy bond creb program effectively offering interestfree debt to eligible renewable projects in october  the creb program was extended to march   since july  pickens’ dallasbased investment firm bp capital has lost as much as  billion as a result of the falling stock market and credit crunch pickens may have lost around  million of his personal funds cost of wind vs natural gasedit according to jerry taylor senior fellow at the cato institute using wind to generate most of the nations electricity would undoubtedly result in higher retail electric rates because wind power is twice as expensive as natural gasfired generation and probably more if you take out the subsidies however the american wind energy association points out that the cost of wind power has dropped by more than  in the last  years and expects the cost to continue to decline as the industry matures in contrast the cost of natural gas is expected to rise moreover the effects on the environment and public health for natural gas are estimated to cost some  to  cents per kwh similar costs from wind are marginal peak gasedit parts of this article those related to this section need to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information january  main article peak gas us gas production since  source us eia the use of natural gas is a key component to pickens proposal there are concerns however that gas production has already reached its maximum production rate a point known as peak gascitation needed us gas production peaked in  at about  trillion cubic feet declined until  and has been slowly increasing over the last  years see figure on left according to peak theory the rate of production enters a terminal decline after the peak peak gas has already been confirmed by exxons ceo lee raymond in  he said to reuters that gas production has peaked in north america the reuters article continues to say while the number of us rigs drilling for natural gas has climbed about  percent over the last year and prices are at record highs producers have been struggling to raise output john decicco a senior fellow at environmental defense is critical of the plan because it assumes that gas would remain cheap despite growing demand and increasing reliance on imports as evidenced by proposals for lng terminals however implementing pickens plan does not require an increase in the supply of natural gas it calls for a shift in its use rather than an increase natural gas production has been slightly and consistently increasing in the united states for more than two decades proven recoverable us gas reserves have slightly but consistently risen since  and are about the same as in  estimates of technically recoverable reserves in the united states vary as they are generated by geological inferences but the us energy information administration  estimate is  trillion cubic feet enough to provide domestic production at  rates for nearly  years other optionsedit nuclear power vs wind poweredit main articles nuclear power nuclear power debate and radioactive waste pickens plan will require the construction of large scale wind farms to generate electricity critical of the plan the national center for public policy research a self described conservative think tank asserts that nuclear power plants would be a better alternative than the wind farms they say that nuclear power is also environmentally sound and creates very little waste that nuclear power is also far cheaper than wind power and that to build the wind farms would take many square miles of land electricity vs natural gas for powering vehiclesedit allelectric tesla roadster to some this plan seems to ignore one of the most fruitful pathscitation needed to cut into america’s foreign oil addiction plugin hybrids and fully electric vehicles wind generated electricity could

technically possible but poses the question if there is enough lithium carbonate production currently to support the production of the needed batteries gores global warming vs pickens planedit the plans of t boone pickens and al gore have some similarities  each lessens the dependence on fossil fuels  but differ in their eventual goals pickens specifically wants to see energy security by increasing the use of domestic energy sources including fossil fuels while gore wants to eliminate the burning of fossil fuels altogether to stop global warming pickens claims to have a plan that could accomplish this with existing technology while gore advocates new research to reduce costscitation needed a study by the european renewable energy council states that the burning of fossil fuels for energy could be eliminated globally by  using existing technology and earlier for western nations dependence on foreign fuelsedit pickens estimates that his plan would cut oil imports by  percentcitation needed patricia monahan deputy director of the clean vehicles program at the union of concerned scientists thinks differently she questions the wisdom of trying to replace large amounts of imported oil with another fossil fuel especially considering that the united states already has to import  percent of the natural gas it uses the us has been steadily increasing its imports of natural gas since  see figure to the left mainly from canada according to jerry taylor senior fellow at the cato institute is that foreign oil is not bad it is good the us is now importing about  of its oil needs annually because it is cheaper than other forms of energycitation needed taylor says that if compressed natural gas is the best option for transportation fuel then the markets will see it and over time cng could outperform gasoline as a cheaper transportation fuel questions over pickens motives and methodsedit many critics of the pickens plan highlight ways that pickens could potentially benefit personally from the plan for instance pickens owns the water rights to a huge ancient aquifer in the texas panhandle and overall owns more water than anyone else in the us increasing water demands and drought may make cities in the great plains willing to purchase water at high prices implementing pickens plan would give him rights to build electric transmission lines and by getting a wider right of way it would allow pickens to build water pipelines a similar strategy was attempted in texas where pickens is building a wind farm that will bring electricity to dallas texas the proposed pipeline would have followed the same mile  km corridor as the electric transmission lines from the wind farms which was to be seized for utility use from private owners through eminent domain many texas landowners and legislators denounced the plan particularly the fact that it allowed eminent domain to be exercised by an agency consisting only of t boone pickenss employees in september  the water pipeline was suspended t boone pickens continues to purchase water rights in the great plains and has plans to build more smaller wind farms t boone pickens would be in an excellent position to benefit financially if the plan is implemented his hedge fund bp capital is highly invested in wind and natural gas enterprises he is the majority stockholder of clean energy the largest supplier of natural gas for vehicles in the united states in rebuttal to many critics opposition pickens insists his interest is more in the countrys future than his personal wealth possibly as a move against such accusationscitation needed pickens has donated over  million to philanthropic causes in the last few years he has often been on the chronicle of philanthropys list of top us philanthropists still there are some who are uneasy about a man who made millions in the oil business advocating clean energy when it comes to the pickens plan the burr under my saddle is pickens himself i mean isnt an oil guy selling air and gas a little like donald trump pitching poverty its downright uncomfortable — jay mcdonald real concerns over natural gas being used for both home heat and vehicle fuel are that they may create shortages every year in the winter months when demand for home heating natural gas skyrockets since many american home owners already use natural gas to heat their homes a huge increase in demand for natural gas as a vehicle fuel combined with the existing huge home heating demand based on harsh winter temperatures could drive up natural gas prices ever year this could be especially economically devastating to family budgets during the holiday months when people normally allocate more of their money for holiday shopping having to pay more for vehicle fuel and home heat at the same time because both would be the same product could have a major economic impact on the nation every year another concern is that the reasoning behind the big immediate push for a natural gas future is to lock out possible development and implementation of more viable renewable energy sources if people can be convinced that natural gas is the best possible future and a large expenditure can be made now for a massive natural gas infrastructure to use natural gas for vehicle fuel it will be much more difficult to abandon natural gas as a vehicle fuel and move on to newer less expensive renewable energy sources as they become more viable to use if renewable fuel sources are allowed to develop before the country can be convinced to move to natural gas the window of opportunity to addict the country to natural gas may close and the people associated with the natural gas industry would lose a lot of money now and in the foreseeable future interestingly enough the pickens plan which manywho believe is designed to make pickens himself much more wealthy is a nonprofit organization support campaignedit pickens announced that he would spend  million on a multimedia effort to promote his proposal through both old media such as newspapers and television and new media including youtube facebook myspace twitter and the creation of a new social network on the pickens plan website as part of this effort pickens has appeared on many american news programs and talk shows such as the newshour with jim lehrer good morning america the tonight show with jay leno larry king live fox news and the daily show with jon stewart pickens is aided by his spokesperson jay rosser and political ad firm joe slade white  co to raise political support pickens planned to organize supporters by congressional districts he also met with the main party candidates for the  united states presidential election to discuss his plan he met with john mccain on august   and with barack obama on august   in october  pickens announced that the one millionth person had signed up to support his plan and that two us senators  us congressmen and nine governors had pledged to enact an energy plan that reduces our foreign oil dependence by at least  within ten years a year later another  people had signed up to support the plan major endorsementsedit carl pope executive director of the sierra club has expressed support for the pickens plan and stated “to put it plainly t boone pickens is out to save america” former clinton white house chief of staff and current president of the center for american progress john podesta supports the plan barack obama has stated he supports many elements of the plan the american lung

turbines generate electricity behind a pumpjack in muenster texas this could be a common scene in the great plains if pickens plan is adopted the pickens plan is an energy policy proposal announced july   by american businessman t boone pickens pickens wants to reduce american dependence on imported oil by investing approximately us trillion in new wind turbine farms for power generation which he believes would allow the natural gas currently used for power generation to be shifted to fuel cng trucks and other heavy vehicles pickens stated that his plan could reduce by  billion  the amount

links proposaledit the main proposals of the plan are private industry would fund and install thousands of wind turbines in the great plains which pickens refers to as the potential wind corridor of the united states due to favorable wind resources and geographic location pickens estimates that these turbines could generate enough power to provide  percent or more of the countrys electricity supply government would pay for electric power transmission lines to connect the turbine farms to the power grid they would provide energy to the midwest south and western regions of the country with wind energy providing a large portion of the nations electricity the natural gas that is currently used to fuel power plants would be used instead as a fuel for thousands of vehicles to increase efficiency the plan puts an emphasis on natural gasburning fleets of trucks and buses thus the demand for petroleum products made from imported oil would be reduced timetableedit pickens thinks his plan that would provide  of electricity from wind power and the conversion for vehicles from gasoline to gas could be accomplished in less than  years with the right leadership however according to chuck mcgowin senior project manager at the electric power research institute a nonprofit organization funded by the electric power industry the time table is too tight dave hamilton director for global warming and energy projects at the sierra club agrees that is extremely aggressive  but its in the right direction its a good thing we have an oilman saying we cant drill our way out of this problem former us vice president al gore who has spent recent years informing people about global warming opines that all electricity generation should be completely fossilfuel free in the next  years wind power status and potentialedit further information wind power in the united states wind power had been experiencing exponential growth in the united states for several years when pickens announced his plan wind power in texas grew very rapidly  from  to  in another large state california wind generation increased by  in the same period the cost of wind power generation has decreased by about  over the last  years because of technological advances and is now costcompetitive with other energy sources windgenerated electricity can be produced at  to  cents per kwh a yardstick used to determine locations with high potential wind energy production is referred to as wind power density wpd it is a calculation relating to the effective force of the wind at a particular location frequently expressed in terms of the elevation above ground level over a period of time it takes into account wind velocity and mass color coded maps are frequently prepared for a particular area described for example as mean annual power density at  meters the results of the above calculation are entered into an index developed by the national renewable energy laboratory and referred to as nrel class the larger the wpd calculation the higher it is rated by class the pickens plan calls for increasing the installed wind power capacity by at least a factor of ten from its  level by citation needed this would tap only a small fraction of total us wind power potential which is estimated to be as much as  times more than the year electricity demand in the united states installed us wind power year nameplate capacity mw                     a bar graph displaying us installed wind power from  to  map of available wind power for the united states at m color codes indicate wind power density class note the shortage of transmission lines through much of the great plains wind corridor technical issuesedit power generation and transmission linesedit further information high voltage direct current and super grid high voltage transmission lines pickens says that his plan could generate enough wind power to provide  percent of the countrys electricity the institute for energy research ier an organization that is funded by the oil industry disagrees the ier claims that pickens plan relies on government subsidies and that producing large amounts of wind power is not a viable option instead the ier advocates less government for more abundant and affordable energy pickens acknowledges that natural gas would still be required for peak electricity demand and additional infrastructure would be needed to distribute the wind energy across the country new transmission lines worth  billion to  billion would be needed to carry the power from the windmills to the cities pickens testified before the senate homeland security and government affairs committee and said the government should begin building transmission lines for windgenerated power in the same way that president eisenhower did by declaring an emergency to build the interstate highway system in the s and s as an alternative pickens proposed that the government should provide the right of way on private land and extend tax credits so the private sector can build the lines kenneth medlock iii an energy fellow at the james a baker iii institute for public policy and a critic of pickens plan said a lot of what hes trying to do is add value to a stranded asset despite the recession denver oil man philip anschutz is moving forward with the construction of a wind farm in southern wyoming and a mile  km transmission line to phoenix las vegas and southern california intermittencyedit main articles intermittent power source and wind intermittency one of the challenges with using wind to replace natural gas is the intermittent nature of wind energy since the same wind conditions are not always present according to a  study by archer  jacobson published in the journal of applied meteorology and climatology interconnecting ten or more widely separated wind farms allows  to  of the total energy produced – of nominal capacity to be used as reliable baseload electric power as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height to dispatch power when the wind isnt blowing backup power plants would be needed according to paul fremont an electricutility analyst at the investment bank jefferies  co natural gas plants can quickly be brought online to supply peaking capacity during periods of low wind or peak demand according to art holland a director at pace global energy services the us will need to replace  mw of gas plant capacity over the next  years due to plant retirements this translates to twice as much wind capacity due to the difference in capacity factorscitation needed instead of dispatching additional power generation energy could be conserved on demand the smart power grid an intelligent power distribution network currently being researched and developed can reduce power consumption at the client side during peak hours and thereby lessen our dependence on gas for load following storing electricity is currently significantly more expensive than using dispatchable generation but it can be donecitation needed wind energy can be stored by pumping water uphill when the wind is blowing and then releasing it through turbine generators when the electricity is needed tvas raccoon mountain pumpedstorage plant near chattanooga tn is just one example of many such installations that already exist in the us another option is to uprate the peak generating capacity of existing hydroelectric dams by adding more generator units this allows a hydroelectric plant to buffer the variable output of wind farms on the grid by accumulating river water during periods of strong winds and releasing extra water when winds are calm and power demand is high a dam that impounds a large reservoir can store and release large amounts of water by adjusting the reservoir level within a few meterscitation needed compressedair energy storage is another energy storage mechanism when there is excess electrical energy production air is compressed and stored in a limestone cavern then when the energy is needed again the compressed air generates electricity by blowing through a turbine vanadium redox batteries are being used to store energy and level loads from wind generation projects the excess energy is stored chemically in different ionic forms of vanadium in a dilute sulphuric acid electrolyte the reaction can be reversed which allows the battery to be charged discharged and recharged making the transitionedit cng powered bus pickens plan proposes that the natural gas that is currently used to fuel power plants be used instead as a fuel for class  and  semis ken medlock a research fellow at the baker institute for public policy at rice university says that the us will continue to use natural gas for electric power generation natural gas burns cleaner than coal making it an increasingly popular fuel for power plantscitation needed gas plants also produce fewer greenhouse gas emissionscitation needed the technology needed for compressed natural gas cng vehicles such as city buses fork lifts and passenger cars with cng drivetrains is available now honda sells the civic gx with a mile  km range in addition it is possible to convert vehicles to run on cng in addition to leaving the conventional fuel injection intact allowing the driver to switch back and forth at will kits are available for the doityourselfer one can buy a cng compressor called phill that hooks up to the city natural gas line making it possible to refuel a cng car at home on the other hand the ier believes that natural gas vehicles are a niche product patricia monahan believes its going to be a big price tag to switch to cng vehicles monahan considers cng an excellent fuel for running small fleets of vehicles which log heavy mileage per vehicle such as buses and garbage trucks vehicles which use large amounts of fuel realize savings more quickly from the lower price of cng relative to dieselcitation needed in november  pickens changed his position stating that he wants heavy trucks not cars running on natural gas rich kolodziej president of ngvamerica says the very limited distribution network for natural gas is currently available in only  out of  gas stations would better serve commercial fleets and longhaul trucks policy issuesedit renewable portfolio standardsedit twentyfour states plus the district of columbia have renewable portfolio standards in place to set targets for renewable energy in those states four more states have set nonbinding energy targets economic issuesedit fundingedit the energy policy act of  created the clean renewable energy bond creb program effectively offering interestfree debt to eligible renewable projects in october  the creb program was extended to march   since july  pickens’ dallasbased investment firm bp capital has lost as much as  billion as a result of the falling stock market and credit crunch pickens may have lost around  million of his personal funds cost of wind vs natural gasedit according to jerry taylor senior fellow at the cato institute using wind to generate most of the nations electricity would undoubtedly result in higher retail electric rates because wind power is twice as expensive as natural gasfired generation and probably more if you take out the subsidies however the american wind energy association points out that the cost of wind power has dropped by more than  in the last  years and expects the cost to continue to decline as the industry matures in contrast the cost of natural gas is expected to rise moreover the effects on the environment and public health for natural gas are estimated to cost some  to  cents per kwh similar costs from wind are marginal peak gasedit parts of this article those related to this section need to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information january  main article peak gas us gas production since  source us eia the use of natural gas is a key component to pickens proposal there are concerns however that gas production has already reached its maximum production rate a point known as peak gascitation needed us gas production peaked in  at about  trillion cubic feet declined until  and has been slowly increasing over the last  years see figure on left according to peak theory the rate of production enters a terminal decline after the peak peak gas has already been confirmed by exxons ceo lee raymond in  he said to reuters that gas production has peaked in north america the reuters article continues to say while the number of us rigs drilling for natural gas has climbed about  percent over the last year and prices are at record highs producers have been struggling to raise output john decicco a senior fellow at environmental defense is critical of the plan because it assumes that gas would remain cheap despite growing demand and increasing reliance on imports as evidenced by proposals for lng terminals however implementing pickens plan does not require an increase in the supply of natural gas it calls for a shift in its use rather than an increase natural gas production has been slightly and consistently increasing in the united states for more than two decades proven recoverable us gas reserves have slightly but consistently risen since  and are about the same as in  estimates of technically recoverable reserves in the united states vary as they are generated by geological inferences but the us energy information administration  estimate is  trillion cubic feet enough to provide domestic production at  rates for nearly  years other optionsedit nuclear power vs wind poweredit main articles nuclear power nuclear power debate and radioactive waste pickens plan will require the construction of large scale wind farms to generate electricity critical of the plan the national center for public policy research a self described conservative think tank asserts that nuclear power plants would be a better alternative than the wind farms they say that nuclear power is also environmentally sound and creates very little waste that nuclear power is also far cheaper than wind power and that to build the wind farms would take many square miles of land electricity vs natural gas for powering vehiclesedit allelectric tesla roadster to some this plan seems to ignore one of the most fruitful pathscitation needed to cut into america’s foreign oil addiction plugin hybrids and fully electric vehicles wind generated electricity could directly fuel america’s

poses the question if there is enough lithium carbonate production currently to support the production of the needed batteries gores global warming vs pickens planedit the plans of t boone pickens and al gore have some similarities  each lessens the dependence on fossil fuels  but differ in their eventual goals pickens specifically wants to see energy security by increasing the use of domestic energy sources including fossil fuels while gore wants to eliminate the burning of fossil fuels altogether to stop global warming pickens claims to have a plan that could accomplish this with existing technology while gore advocates new research to reduce costscitation needed a study by the european renewable energy council states that the burning of fossil fuels for energy could be eliminated globally by  using existing technology and earlier for western nations dependence on foreign fuelsedit pickens estimates that his plan would cut oil imports by  percentcitation needed patricia monahan deputy director of the clean vehicles program at the union of concerned scientists thinks differently she questions the wisdom of trying to replace large amounts of imported oil with another fossil fuel especially considering that the united states already has to import  percent of the natural gas it uses the us has been steadily increasing its imports of natural gas since  see figure to the left mainly from canada according to jerry taylor senior fellow at the cato institute is that foreign oil is not bad it is good the us is now importing about  of its oil needs annually because it is cheaper than other forms of energycitation needed taylor says that if compressed natural gas is the best option for transportation fuel then the markets will see it and over time cng could outperform gasoline as a cheaper transportation fuel questions over pickens motives and methodsedit many critics of the pickens plan highlight ways that pickens could potentially benefit personally from the plan for instance pickens owns the water rights to a huge ancient aquifer in the texas panhandle and overall owns more water than anyone else in the us increasing water demands and drought may make cities in the great plains willing to purchase water at high prices implementing pickens plan would give him rights to build electric transmission lines and by getting a wider right of way it would allow pickens to build water pipelines a similar strategy was attempted in texas where pickens is building a wind farm that will bring electricity to dallas texas the proposed pipeline would have followed the same mile  km corridor as the electric transmission lines from the wind farms which was to be seized for utility use from private owners through eminent domain many texas landowners and legislators denounced the plan particularly the fact that it allowed eminent domain to be exercised by an agency consisting only of t boone pickenss employees in september  the water pipeline was suspended t boone pickens continues to purchase water rights in the great plains and has plans to build more smaller wind farms t boone pickens would be in an excellent position to benefit financially if the plan is implemented his hedge fund bp capital is highly invested in wind and natural gas enterprises he is the majority stockholder of clean energy the largest supplier of natural gas for vehicles in the united states in rebuttal to many critics opposition pickens insists his interest is more in the countrys future than his personal wealth possibly as a move against such accusationscitation needed pickens has donated over  million to philanthropic causes in the last few years he has often been on the chronicle of philanthropys list of top us philanthropists still there are some who are uneasy about a man who made millions in the oil business advocating clean energy when it comes to the pickens plan the burr under my saddle is pickens himself i mean isnt an oil guy selling air and gas a little like donald trump pitching poverty its downright uncomfortable — jay mcdonald real concerns over natural gas being used for both home heat and vehicle fuel are that they may create shortages every year in the winter months when demand for home heating natural gas skyrockets since many american home owners already use natural gas to heat their homes a huge increase in demand for natural gas as a vehicle fuel combined with the existing huge home heating demand based on harsh winter temperatures could drive up natural gas prices ever year this could be especially economically devastating to family budgets during the holiday months when people normally allocate more of their money for holiday shopping having to pay more for vehicle fuel and home heat at the same time because both would be the same product could have a major economic impact on the nation every year another concern is that the reasoning behind the big immediate push for a natural gas future is to lock out possible development and implementation of more viable renewable energy sources if people can be convinced that natural gas is the best possible future and a large expenditure can be made now for a massive natural gas infrastructure to use natural gas for vehicle fuel it will be much more difficult to abandon natural gas as a vehicle fuel and move on to newer less expensive renewable energy sources as they become more viable to use if renewable fuel sources are allowed to develop before the country can be convinced to move to natural gas the window of opportunity to addict the country to natural gas may close and the people associated with the natural gas industry would lose a lot of money now and in the foreseeable future interestingly enough the pickens plan which manywho believe is designed to make pickens himself much more wealthy is a nonprofit organization support campaignedit pickens announced that he would spend  million on a multimedia effort to promote his proposal through both old media such as newspapers and television and new media including youtube facebook myspace twitter and the creation of a new social network on the pickens plan website as part of this effort pickens has appeared on many american news programs and talk shows such as the newshour with jim lehrer good morning america the tonight show with jay leno larry king live fox news and the daily show with jon stewart pickens is aided by his spokesperson jay rosser and political ad firm joe slade white  co to raise political support pickens planned to organize supporters by congressional districts he also met with the main party candidates for the  united states presidential election to discuss his plan he met with john mccain on august   and with barack obama on august   in october  pickens announced that the one millionth person had signed up to support his plan and that two us senators  us congressmen and nine governors had pledged to enact an energy plan that reduces our foreign oil dependence by at least  within ten years a year later another  people had signed up to support the plan major endorsementsedit carl pope executive director of the sierra club has expressed support for the pickens plan and stated “to put it plainly t boone pickens is out to save america” former clinton white house chief of staff and current president of the center for american progress john podesta supports the plan barack obama has stated he supports many elements of the plan the american lung association endorses the pickens plan former republican

muenster texas this could be a common scene in the great plains if pickens plan is adopted the pickens plan is an energy policy proposal announced july   by american businessman t boone pickens pickens wants to reduce american dependence on imported oil by investing approximately us trillion in new wind turbine farms for power generation which he believes would allow the natural gas currently used for power generation to be shifted to fuel cng trucks and other heavy vehicles pickens stated that his plan could reduce by  billion  the amount the country spends annually on foreign

pickens plan  dependence on foreign fuels  questions over pickens motives and methods  support campaign  major endorsements  see also  references  external links proposaledit the main proposals of the plan are private industry would fund and install thousands of wind turbines in the great plains which pickens refers to as the potential wind corridor of the united states due to favorable wind resources and geographic location pickens estimates that these turbines could generate enough power to provide  percent or more of the countrys electricity supply government would pay for electric power transmission lines to connect the turbine farms to the power grid they would provide energy to the midwest south and western regions of the country with wind energy providing a large portion of the nations electricity the natural gas that is currently used to fuel power plants would be used instead as a fuel for thousands of vehicles to increase efficiency the plan puts an emphasis on natural gasburning fleets of trucks and buses thus the demand for petroleum products made from imported oil would be reduced timetableedit pickens thinks his plan that would provide  of electricity from wind power and the conversion for vehicles from gasoline to gas could be accomplished in less than  years with the right leadership however according to chuck mcgowin senior project manager at the electric power research institute a nonprofit organization funded by the electric power industry the time table is too tight dave hamilton director for global warming and energy projects at the sierra club agrees that is extremely aggressive  but its in the right direction its a good thing we have an oilman saying we cant drill our way out of this problem former us vice president al gore who has spent recent years informing people about global warming opines that all electricity generation should be completely fossilfuel free in the next  years wind power status and potentialedit further information wind power in the united states wind power had been experiencing exponential growth in the united states for several years when pickens announced his plan wind power in texas grew very rapidly  from  to  in another large state california wind generation increased by  in the same period the cost of wind power generation has decreased by about  over the last  years because of technological advances and is now costcompetitive with other energy sources windgenerated electricity can be produced at  to  cents per kwh a yardstick used to determine locations with high potential wind energy production is referred to as wind power density wpd it is a calculation relating to the effective force of the wind at a particular location frequently expressed in terms of the elevation above ground level over a period of time it takes into account wind velocity and mass color coded maps are frequently prepared for a particular area described for example as mean annual power density at  meters the results of the above calculation are entered into an index developed by the national renewable energy laboratory and referred to as nrel class the larger the wpd calculation the higher it is rated by class the pickens plan calls for increasing the installed wind power capacity by at least a factor of ten from its  level by citation needed this would tap only a small fraction of total us wind power potential which is estimated to be as much as  times more than the year electricity demand in the united states installed us wind power year nameplate capacity mw                     a bar graph displaying us installed wind power from  to  map of available wind power for the united states at m color codes indicate wind power density class note the shortage of transmission lines through much of the great plains wind corridor technical issuesedit power generation and transmission linesedit further information high voltage direct current and super grid high voltage transmission lines pickens says that his plan could generate enough wind power to provide  percent of the countrys electricity the institute for energy research ier an organization that is funded by the oil industry disagrees the ier claims that pickens plan relies on government subsidies and that producing large amounts of wind power is not a viable option instead the ier advocates less government for more abundant and affordable energy pickens acknowledges that natural gas would still be required for peak electricity demand and additional infrastructure would be needed to distribute the wind energy across the country new transmission lines worth  billion to  billion would be needed to carry the power from the windmills to the cities pickens testified before the senate homeland security and government affairs committee and said the government should begin building transmission lines for windgenerated power in the same way that president eisenhower did by declaring an emergency to build the interstate highway system in the s and s as an alternative pickens proposed that the government should provide the right of way on private land and extend tax credits so the private sector can build the lines kenneth medlock iii an energy fellow at the james a baker iii institute for public policy and a critic of pickens plan said a lot of what hes trying to do is add value to a stranded asset despite the recession denver oil man philip anschutz is moving forward with the construction of a wind farm in southern wyoming and a mile  km transmission line to phoenix las vegas and southern california intermittencyedit main articles intermittent power source and wind intermittency one of the challenges with using wind to replace natural gas is the intermittent nature of wind energy since the same wind conditions are not always present according to a  study by archer  jacobson published in the journal of applied meteorology and climatology interconnecting ten or more widely separated wind farms allows  to  of the total energy produced – of nominal capacity to be used as reliable baseload electric power as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height to dispatch power when the wind isnt blowing backup power plants would be needed according to paul fremont an electricutility analyst at the investment bank jefferies  co natural gas plants can quickly be brought online to supply peaking capacity during periods of low wind or peak demand according to art holland a director at pace global energy services the us will need to replace  mw of gas plant capacity over the next  years due to plant retirements this translates to twice as much wind capacity due to the difference in capacity factorscitation needed instead of dispatching additional power generation energy could be conserved on demand the smart power grid an intelligent power distribution network currently being researched and developed can reduce power consumption at the client side during peak hours and thereby lessen our dependence on gas for load following storing electricity is currently significantly more expensive than using dispatchable generation but it can be donecitation needed wind energy can be stored by pumping water uphill when the wind is blowing and then releasing it through turbine generators when the electricity is needed tvas raccoon mountain pumpedstorage plant near chattanooga tn is just one example of many such installations that already exist in the us another option is to uprate the peak generating capacity of existing hydroelectric dams by adding more generator units this allows a hydroelectric plant to buffer the variable output of wind farms on the grid by accumulating river water during periods of strong winds and releasing extra water when winds are calm and power demand is high a dam that impounds a large reservoir can store and release large amounts of water by adjusting the reservoir level within a few meterscitation needed compressedair energy storage is another energy storage mechanism when there is excess electrical energy production air is compressed and stored in a limestone cavern then when the energy is needed again the compressed air generates electricity by blowing through a turbine vanadium redox batteries are being used to store energy and level loads from wind generation projects the excess energy is stored chemically in different ionic forms of vanadium in a dilute sulphuric acid electrolyte the reaction can be reversed which allows the battery to be charged discharged and recharged making the transitionedit cng powered bus pickens plan proposes that the natural gas that is currently used to fuel power plants be used instead as a fuel for class  and  semis ken medlock a research fellow at the baker institute for public policy at rice university says that the us will continue to use natural gas for electric power generation natural gas burns cleaner than coal making it an increasingly popular fuel for power plantscitation needed gas plants also produce fewer greenhouse gas emissionscitation needed the technology needed for compressed natural gas cng vehicles such as city buses fork lifts and passenger cars with cng drivetrains is available now honda sells the civic gx with a mile  km range in addition it is possible to convert vehicles to run on cng in addition to leaving the conventional fuel injection intact allowing the driver to switch back and forth at will kits are available for the doityourselfer one can buy a cng compressor called phill that hooks up to the city natural gas line making it possible to refuel a cng car at home on the other hand the ier believes that natural gas vehicles are a niche product patricia monahan believes its going to be a big price tag to switch to cng vehicles monahan considers cng an excellent fuel for running small fleets of vehicles which log heavy mileage per vehicle such as buses and garbage trucks vehicles which use large amounts of fuel realize savings more quickly from the lower price of cng relative to dieselcitation needed in november  pickens changed his position stating that he wants heavy trucks not cars running on natural gas rich kolodziej president of ngvamerica says the very limited distribution network for natural gas is currently available in only  out of  gas stations would better serve commercial fleets and longhaul trucks policy issuesedit renewable portfolio standardsedit twentyfour states plus the district of columbia have renewable portfolio standards in place to set targets for renewable energy in those states four more states have set nonbinding energy targets economic issuesedit fundingedit the energy policy act of  created the clean renewable energy bond creb program effectively offering interestfree debt to eligible renewable projects in october  the creb program was extended to march   since july  pickens’ dallasbased investment firm bp capital has lost as much as  billion as a result of the falling stock market and credit crunch pickens may have lost around  million of his personal funds cost of wind vs natural gasedit according to jerry taylor senior fellow at the cato institute using wind to generate most of the nations electricity would undoubtedly result in higher retail electric rates because wind power is twice as expensive as natural gasfired generation and probably more if you take out the subsidies however the american wind energy association points out that the cost of wind power has dropped by more than  in the last  years and expects the cost to continue to decline as the industry matures in contrast the cost of natural gas is expected to rise moreover the effects on the environment and public health for natural gas are estimated to cost some  to  cents per kwh similar costs from wind are marginal peak gasedit parts of this article those related to this section need to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information january  main article peak gas us gas production since  source us eia the use of natural gas is a key component to pickens proposal there are concerns however that gas production has already reached its maximum production rate a point known as peak gascitation needed us gas production peaked in  at about  trillion cubic feet declined until  and has been slowly increasing over the last  years see figure on left according to peak theory the rate of production enters a terminal decline after the peak peak gas has already been confirmed by exxons ceo lee raymond in  he said to reuters that gas production has peaked in north america the reuters article continues to say while the number of us rigs drilling for natural gas has climbed about  percent over the last year and prices are at record highs producers have been struggling to raise output john decicco a senior fellow at environmental defense is critical of the plan because it assumes that gas would remain cheap despite growing demand and increasing reliance on imports as evidenced by proposals for lng terminals however implementing pickens plan does not require an increase in the supply of natural gas it calls for a shift in its use rather than an increase natural gas production has been slightly and consistently increasing in the united states for more than two decades proven recoverable us gas reserves have slightly but consistently risen since  and are about the same as in  estimates of technically recoverable reserves in the united states vary as they are generated by geological inferences but the us energy information administration  estimate is  trillion cubic feet enough to provide domestic production at  rates for nearly  years other optionsedit nuclear power vs wind poweredit main articles nuclear power nuclear power debate and radioactive waste pickens plan will require the construction of large scale wind farms to generate electricity critical of the plan the national center for public policy research a self described conservative think tank asserts that nuclear power plants would be a better alternative than the wind farms they say that nuclear power is also environmentally sound and creates very little waste that nuclear power is also far cheaper than wind power and that to build the wind farms would take many square miles of land electricity vs natural gas for powering vehiclesedit allelectric tesla roadster to some this plan seems to ignore one of the most fruitful pathscitation needed to cut into america’s foreign oil addiction plugin hybrids and fully electric vehicles wind generated electricity could directly fuel america’s evermore electrified transport sector some hybrid owners argue the part that using

international research acknowledges that hybrid or completely electric longhaul semitrucks are technically possible but poses the question if there is enough lithium carbonate production currently to support the production of the needed batteries gores global warming vs pickens planedit the plans of t boone pickens and al gore have some similarities  each lessens the dependence on fossil fuels  but differ in their eventual goals pickens specifically wants to see energy security by increasing the use of domestic energy sources including fossil fuels while gore wants to eliminate the burning of fossil fuels altogether to stop global warming pickens claims to have a plan that could accomplish this with existing technology while gore advocates new research to reduce costscitation needed a study by the european renewable energy council states that the burning of fossil fuels for energy could be eliminated globally by  using existing technology and earlier for western nations dependence on foreign fuelsedit pickens estimates that his plan would cut oil imports by  percentcitation needed patricia monahan deputy director of the clean vehicles program at the union of concerned scientists thinks differently she questions the wisdom of trying to replace large amounts of imported oil with another fossil fuel especially considering that the united states already has to import  percent of the natural gas it uses the us has been steadily increasing its imports of natural gas since  see figure to the left mainly from canada according to jerry taylor senior fellow at the cato institute is that foreign oil is not bad it is good the us is now importing about  of its oil needs annually because it is cheaper than other forms of energycitation needed taylor says that if compressed natural gas is the best option for transportation fuel then the markets will see it and over time cng could outperform gasoline as a cheaper transportation fuel questions over pickens motives and methodsedit many critics of the pickens plan highlight ways that pickens could potentially benefit personally from the plan for instance pickens owns the water rights to a huge ancient aquifer in the texas panhandle and overall owns more water than anyone else in the us increasing water demands and drought may make cities in the great plains willing to purchase water at high prices implementing pickens plan would give him rights to build electric transmission lines and by getting a wider right of way it would allow pickens to build water pipelines a similar strategy was attempted in texas where pickens is building a wind farm that will bring electricity to dallas texas the proposed pipeline would have followed the same mile  km corridor as the electric transmission lines from the wind farms which was to be seized for utility use from private owners through eminent domain many texas landowners and legislators denounced the plan particularly the fact that it allowed eminent domain to be exercised by an agency consisting only of t boone pickenss employees in september  the water pipeline was suspended t boone pickens continues to purchase water rights in the great plains and has plans to build more smaller wind farms t boone pickens would be in an excellent position to benefit financially if the plan is implemented his hedge fund bp capital is highly invested in wind and natural gas enterprises he is the majority stockholder of clean energy the largest supplier of natural gas for vehicles in the united states in rebuttal to many critics opposition pickens insists his interest is more in the countrys future than his personal wealth possibly as a move against such accusationscitation needed pickens has donated over  million to philanthropic causes in the last few years he has often been on the chronicle of philanthropys list of top us philanthropists still there are some who are uneasy about a man who made millions in the oil business advocating clean energy when it comes to the pickens plan the burr under my saddle is pickens himself i mean isnt an oil guy selling air and gas a little like donald trump pitching poverty its downright uncomfortable — jay mcdonald real concerns over natural gas being used for both home heat and vehicle fuel are that they may create shortages every year in the winter months when demand for home heating natural gas skyrockets since many american home owners already use natural gas to heat their homes a huge increase in demand for natural gas as a vehicle fuel combined with the existing huge home heating demand based on harsh winter temperatures could drive up natural gas prices ever year this could be especially economically devastating to family budgets during the holiday months when people normally allocate more of their money for holiday shopping having to pay more for vehicle fuel and home heat at the same time because both would be the same product could have a major economic impact on the nation every year another concern is that the reasoning behind the big immediate push for a natural gas future is to lock out possible development and implementation of more viable renewable energy sources if people can be convinced that natural gas is the best possible future and a large expenditure can be made now for a massive natural gas infrastructure to use natural gas for vehicle fuel it will be much more difficult to abandon natural gas as a vehicle fuel and move on to newer less expensive renewable energy sources as they become more viable to use if renewable fuel sources are allowed to develop before the country can be convinced to move to natural gas the window of opportunity to addict the country to natural gas may close and the people associated with the natural gas industry would lose a lot of money now and in the foreseeable future interestingly enough the pickens plan which manywho believe is designed to make pickens himself much more wealthy is a nonprofit organization support campaignedit pickens announced that he would spend  million on a multimedia effort to promote his proposal through both old media such as newspapers and television and new media including youtube facebook myspace twitter and the creation of a new social network on the pickens plan website as part of this effort pickens has appeared on many american news programs and talk shows such as the newshour with jim lehrer good morning america the tonight show with jay leno larry king live fox news and the daily show with jon stewart pickens is aided by his spokesperson jay rosser and political ad firm joe slade white  co to raise political support pickens planned to organize supporters by congressional districts he also met with the main party candidates for the  united states presidential election to discuss his plan he met with john mccain on august   and with barack obama on august   in october  pickens announced that the one millionth person had signed up to support his plan and that two us senators  us congressmen and nine governors had pledged to enact an energy plan that reduces our foreign oil dependence by at least  within ten years a year later another  people had signed up to support the plan major endorsementsedit carl pope executive director of the sierra club has expressed support for the pickens plan and stated “to put it plainly t boone pickens is out to save america” former clinton white house chief of staff and current president of the center for american progress john podesta supports the plan barack obama has stated he supports many elements of the plan the american lung association endorses the pickens plan former republican governor of south carolina mark sanford supports the pickens plan see

adopted the pickens plan is an energy policy proposal announced july   by american businessman t boone pickens pickens wants to reduce american dependence on imported oil by investing approximately us trillion in new wind turbine farms for power generation which he believes would allow the natural gas currently used for power generation to be shifted to fuel cng trucks and other heavy vehicles

plains which pickens refers to as the potential wind corridor of the united states due to favorable wind resources and geographic location pickens estimates that these turbines could generate enough power to provide  percent or more of the countrys electricity supply government would pay for electric power transmission lines to connect the turbine farms to the power grid they would provide energy to the midwest south and western regions of the country with wind energy providing a large portion of the nations electricity the natural gas that is currently used to fuel power plants would be used instead as a fuel for thousands of vehicles to increase efficiency the plan puts an emphasis on natural gasburning fleets of trucks and buses thus the demand for petroleum products made from imported oil would be reduced timetableedit pickens thinks his plan that would provide  of electricity from wind power and the conversion for vehicles from gasoline to gas could be accomplished in less than  years with the right leadership however according to chuck mcgowin senior project manager at the electric power research institute a nonprofit organization funded by the electric power industry the time table is too tight dave hamilton director for global warming and energy projects at the sierra club agrees that is extremely aggressive  but its in the right direction its a good thing we have an oilman saying we cant drill our way out of this problem former us vice president al gore who has spent recent years informing people about global warming opines that all electricity generation should be completely fossilfuel free in the next  years wind power status and potentialedit further information wind power in the united states wind power had been experiencing exponential growth in the united states for several years when pickens announced his plan wind power in texas grew very rapidly  from  to  in another large state california wind generation increased by  in the same period the cost of wind power generation has decreased by about  over the last  years because of technological advances and is now costcompetitive with other energy sources windgenerated electricity can be produced at  to  cents per kwh a yardstick used to determine locations with high potential wind energy production is referred to as wind power density wpd it is a calculation relating to the effective force of the wind at a particular location frequently expressed in terms of the elevation above ground level over a period of time it takes into account wind velocity and mass color coded maps are frequently prepared for a particular area described for example as mean annual power density at  meters the results of the above calculation are entered into an index developed by the national renewable energy laboratory and referred to as nrel class the larger the wpd calculation the higher it is rated by class the pickens plan calls for increasing the installed wind power capacity by at least a factor of ten from its  level by citation needed this would tap only a small fraction of total us wind power potential which is estimated to be as much as  times more than the year electricity demand in the united states installed us wind power year nameplate capacity mw                     a bar graph displaying us installed wind power from  to  map of available wind power for the united states at m color codes indicate wind power density class note the shortage of transmission lines through much of the great plains wind corridor technical issuesedit power generation and transmission linesedit further information high voltage direct current and super grid high voltage transmission lines pickens says that his plan could generate enough wind power to provide  percent of the countrys electricity the institute for energy research ier an organization that is funded by the oil industry disagrees the ier claims that pickens plan relies on government subsidies and that producing large amounts of wind power is not a viable option instead the ier advocates less government for more abundant and affordable energy pickens acknowledges that natural gas would still be required for peak electricity demand and additional infrastructure would be needed to distribute the wind energy across the country new transmission lines worth  billion to  billion would be needed to carry the power from the windmills to the cities pickens testified before the senate homeland security and government affairs committee and said the government should begin building transmission lines for windgenerated power in the same way that president eisenhower did by declaring an emergency to build the interstate highway system in the s and s as an alternative pickens proposed that the government should provide the right of way on private land and extend tax credits so the private sector can build the lines kenneth medlock iii an energy fellow at the james a baker iii institute for public policy and a critic of pickens plan said a lot of what hes trying to do is add value to a stranded asset despite the recession denver oil man philip anschutz is moving forward with the construction of a wind farm in southern wyoming and a mile  km transmission line to phoenix las vegas and southern california intermittencyedit main articles intermittent power source and wind intermittency one of the challenges with using wind to replace natural gas is the intermittent nature of wind energy since the same wind conditions are not always present according to a  study by archer  jacobson published in the journal of applied meteorology and climatology interconnecting ten or more widely separated wind farms allows  to  of the total energy produced – of nominal capacity to be used as reliable baseload electric power as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height to dispatch power when the wind isnt blowing backup power plants would be needed according to paul fremont an electricutility analyst at the investment bank jefferies  co natural gas plants can quickly be brought online to supply peaking capacity during periods of low wind or peak demand according to art holland a director at pace global energy services the us will need to replace  mw of gas plant capacity over the next  years due to plant retirements this translates to twice as much wind capacity due to the difference in capacity factorscitation needed instead of dispatching additional power generation energy could be conserved on demand the smart power grid an intelligent power distribution network currently being researched and developed can reduce power consumption at the client side during peak hours and thereby lessen our dependence on gas for load following storing electricity is currently significantly more expensive than using dispatchable generation but it can be donecitation needed wind energy can be stored by pumping water uphill when the wind is blowing and then releasing it through turbine generators when the electricity is needed tvas raccoon mountain pumpedstorage plant near chattanooga tn is just one example of many such installations that already exist in the us another option is to uprate the peak generating capacity of existing hydroelectric dams by adding more generator units this allows a hydroelectric plant to buffer the variable output of wind farms on the grid by accumulating river water during periods of strong winds and releasing extra water when winds are calm and power demand is high a dam that impounds a large reservoir can store and release large amounts of water by adjusting the reservoir level within a few meterscitation needed compressedair energy storage is another energy storage mechanism when there is excess electrical energy production air is compressed and stored in a limestone cavern then when the energy is needed again the compressed air generates electricity by blowing through a turbine vanadium redox batteries are being used to store energy and level loads from wind generation projects the excess energy is stored chemically in different ionic forms of vanadium in a dilute sulphuric acid electrolyte the reaction can be reversed which allows the battery to be charged discharged and recharged making the transitionedit cng powered bus pickens plan proposes that the natural gas that is currently used to fuel power plants be used instead as a fuel for class  and  semis ken medlock a research fellow at the baker institute for public policy at rice university says that the us will continue to use natural gas for electric power generation natural gas burns cleaner than coal making it an increasingly popular fuel for power plantscitation needed gas plants also produce fewer greenhouse gas emissionscitation needed the technology needed for compressed natural gas cng vehicles such as city buses fork lifts and passenger cars with cng drivetrains is available now honda sells the civic gx with a mile  km range in addition it is possible to convert vehicles to run on cng in addition to leaving the conventional fuel injection intact allowing the driver to switch back and forth at will kits are available for the doityourselfer one can buy a cng compressor called phill that hooks up to the city natural gas line making it possible to refuel a cng car at home on the other hand the ier believes that natural gas vehicles are a niche product patricia monahan believes its going to be a big price tag to switch to cng vehicles monahan considers cng an excellent fuel for running small fleets of vehicles which log heavy mileage per vehicle such as buses and garbage trucks vehicles which use large amounts of fuel realize savings more quickly from the lower price of cng relative to dieselcitation needed in november  pickens changed his position stating that he wants heavy trucks not cars running on natural gas rich kolodziej president of ngvamerica says the very limited distribution network for natural gas is currently available in only  out of  gas stations would better serve commercial fleets and longhaul trucks policy issuesedit renewable portfolio standardsedit twentyfour states plus the district of columbia have renewable portfolio standards in place to set targets for renewable energy in those states four more states have set nonbinding energy targets economic issuesedit fundingedit the energy policy act of  created the clean renewable energy bond creb program effectively offering interestfree debt to eligible renewable projects in october  the creb program was extended to march   since july  pickens’ dallasbased investment firm bp capital has lost as much as  billion as a result of the falling stock market and credit crunch pickens may have lost around  million of his personal funds cost of wind vs natural gasedit according to jerry taylor senior fellow at the cato institute using wind to generate most of the nations electricity would undoubtedly result in higher retail electric rates because wind power is twice as expensive as natural gasfired generation and probably more if you take out the subsidies however the american wind energy association points out that the cost of wind power has dropped by more than  in the last  years and expects the cost to continue to decline as the industry matures in contrast the cost of natural gas is expected to rise moreover the effects on the environment and public health for natural gas are estimated to cost some  to  cents per kwh similar costs from wind are marginal peak gasedit parts of this article those related to this section need to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information january  main article peak gas us gas production since  source us eia the use of natural gas is a key component to pickens proposal there are concerns however that gas production has already reached its maximum production rate a point known as peak gascitation needed us gas production peaked in  at about  trillion cubic feet declined until  and has been slowly increasing over the last  years see figure on left according to peak theory the rate of production enters a terminal decline after the peak peak gas has already been confirmed by exxons ceo lee raymond in  he said to reuters that gas production has peaked in north america the reuters article continues to say while the number of us rigs drilling for natural gas has climbed about  percent over the last year and prices are at record highs producers have been struggling to raise output john decicco a senior fellow at environmental defense is critical of the plan because it assumes that gas would remain cheap despite growing demand and increasing reliance on imports as evidenced by proposals for lng terminals however implementing pickens plan does not require an increase in the supply of natural gas it calls for a shift in its use rather than an increase natural gas production has been slightly and consistently increasing in the united states for more than two decades proven recoverable us gas reserves have slightly but consistently risen since  and are about the same as in  estimates of technically recoverable reserves in the united states vary as they are generated by geological inferences but the us energy information administration  estimate is  trillion cubic feet enough to provide domestic production at  rates for nearly  years other optionsedit nuclear power vs wind poweredit main articles nuclear power nuclear power debate and radioactive waste pickens plan will require the construction of large scale wind farms to generate electricity critical of the plan the national center for public policy research a self described conservative think tank asserts that nuclear power plants would be a better alternative than the wind farms they say that nuclear power is also environmentally sound and creates very little waste that nuclear power is also far cheaper than wind power and that to build the wind farms would take many square miles of land electricity vs natural gas for powering vehiclesedit allelectric tesla roadster

technically possible but poses the question if there is enough lithium carbonate production currently to support the production of the needed batteries gores global warming vs pickens planedit the plans of t boone pickens and al gore have some similarities  each lessens the dependence on fossil fuels  but differ in their eventual goals pickens specifically wants to see energy security by increasing the use of domestic energy sources including fossil fuels while gore wants to eliminate the burning of fossil fuels altogether to stop global warming pickens claims to have a plan that could accomplish this with existing technology while gore advocates new research to reduce costscitation needed a study by the european renewable energy council states that the burning of fossil fuels for energy could be eliminated globally by  using existing technology and earlier for western nations dependence on foreign fuelsedit pickens estimates that his plan would cut oil imports by  percentcitation needed patricia monahan deputy director of the clean vehicles program at the union of concerned scientists thinks differently she questions the wisdom of trying to replace large amounts of imported oil with another fossil fuel especially considering that the united states already has to import  percent of the natural gas it uses the us has been steadily increasing its imports of natural gas since  see figure to the left mainly from canada according to jerry taylor senior fellow at the cato institute is that foreign oil is not bad it is good the us is now importing about  of its oil needs annually because it is cheaper than other forms of energycitation needed taylor says that if compressed natural gas is the best option for transportation fuel then the markets will see it and over time cng could outperform gasoline as a cheaper transportation fuel questions over pickens motives and methodsedit many critics of the pickens plan highlight ways that pickens could potentially benefit personally from the plan for instance pickens owns the water rights to a huge ancient aquifer in the texas panhandle and overall owns more water than anyone else in the us increasing water demands and drought may make cities in the great plains willing to purchase water at high prices implementing pickens plan would give him rights to build electric transmission lines and by getting a wider right of way it would allow pickens to build water pipelines a similar strategy was attempted in texas where pickens is building a wind farm that will bring electricity to dallas texas the proposed pipeline would have followed the same mile  km corridor as the electric transmission lines from the wind farms which was to be seized for utility use from private owners through eminent domain many texas landowners and legislators denounced the plan particularly the fact that it allowed eminent domain to be exercised by an agency consisting only of t boone pickenss employees in september  the water pipeline was suspended t boone pickens continues to purchase water rights in the great plains and has plans to build more smaller wind farms t boone pickens would be in an excellent position to benefit financially if the plan is implemented his hedge fund bp capital is highly invested in wind and natural gas enterprises he is the majority stockholder of clean energy the largest supplier of natural gas for vehicles in the united states in rebuttal to many critics opposition pickens insists his interest is more in the countrys future than his personal wealth possibly as a move against such accusationscitation needed pickens has donated over  million to philanthropic causes in the last few years he has often been on the chronicle of philanthropys list of top us philanthropists still there are some who are uneasy about a man who made millions in the oil business advocating clean energy when it comes to the pickens plan the burr under my saddle is pickens himself i mean isnt an oil guy selling air and gas a little like donald trump pitching poverty its downright uncomfortable — jay mcdonald real concerns over natural gas being used for both home heat and vehicle fuel are that they may create shortages every year in the winter months when demand for home heating natural gas skyrockets since many american home owners already use natural gas to heat their homes a huge increase in demand for natural gas as a vehicle fuel combined with the existing huge home heating demand based on harsh winter temperatures could drive up natural gas prices ever year this could be especially economically devastating to family budgets during the holiday months when people normally allocate more of their money for holiday shopping having to pay more for vehicle fuel and home heat at the same time because both would be the same product could have a major economic impact on the nation every year another concern is that the reasoning behind the big immediate push for a natural gas future is to lock out possible development and implementation of more viable renewable energy sources if people can be convinced that natural gas is the best possible future and a large expenditure can be made now for a massive natural gas infrastructure to use natural gas for vehicle fuel it will be much more difficult to abandon natural gas as a vehicle fuel and move on to newer less expensive renewable energy sources as they become more viable to use if renewable fuel sources are allowed to develop before the country can be convinced to move to natural gas the window of opportunity to addict the country to natural gas may close and the people associated with the natural gas industry would lose a lot of money now and in the foreseeable future interestingly enough the pickens plan which manywho believe is designed to make pickens himself much more wealthy is a nonprofit organization support campaignedit pickens announced that he would spend  million on a multimedia effort to promote his proposal through both old media such as newspapers and television and new media including youtube facebook myspace twitter and the creation of a new social network on the pickens plan website as part of this effort pickens has appeared on many american news programs and talk shows such as the newshour with jim lehrer good morning america the tonight show with jay leno larry king live fox news and the daily show with jon stewart pickens is aided by his spokesperson jay rosser and political ad firm joe slade white  co to raise political support pickens planned to organize supporters by congressional districts he also met with the main party candidates for the  united states presidential election to discuss his plan he met with john mccain on august   and with barack obama on august   in october  pickens announced that the one millionth person had signed up to support his plan and that two us senators  us congressmen and nine governors had pledged to enact an energy plan that reduces our foreign oil dependence by at least  within ten years a year later another  people had signed up to support the plan major endorsementsedit carl pope executive director of the sierra club has expressed support for the pickens plan and stated “to put it plainly t boone pickens is out to save america” former clinton white house chief of staff and current president of the center for american progress john podesta supports the plan barack obama has stated he supports many elements of the plan the american lung

turbines generate electricity behind a pumpjack in muenster texas this could be a common scene in the great plains if pickens plan is adopted the pickens plan is an energy policy proposal announced july   by american businessman t boone pickens pickens wants to reduce american dependence on imported oil by investing approximately us trillion in new wind turbine farms for power generation which he believes would allow the natural gas currently used for power generation to be shifted to fuel cng trucks and other heavy vehicles pickens stated that his plan could reduce by  billion  the amount

links proposaledit the main proposals of the plan are private industry would fund and install thousands of wind turbines in the great plains which pickens refers to as the potential wind corridor of the united states due to favorable wind resources and geographic location pickens estimates that these turbines could generate enough power to provide  percent or more of the countrys electricity supply government would pay for electric power transmission lines to connect the turbine farms to the power grid they would provide energy to the midwest south and western regions of the country with wind energy providing a large portion of the nations electricity the natural gas that is currently used to fuel power plants would be used instead as a fuel for thousands of vehicles to increase efficiency the plan puts an emphasis on natural gasburning fleets of trucks and buses thus the demand for petroleum products made from imported oil would be reduced timetableedit pickens thinks his plan that would provide  of electricity from wind power and the conversion for vehicles from gasoline to gas could be accomplished in less than  years with the right leadership however according to chuck mcgowin senior project manager at the electric power research institute a nonprofit organization funded by the electric power industry the time table is too tight dave hamilton director for global warming and energy projects at the sierra club agrees that is extremely aggressive  but its in the right direction its a good thing we have an oilman saying we cant drill our way out of this problem former us vice president al gore who has spent recent years informing people about global warming opines that all electricity generation should be completely fossilfuel free in the next  years wind power status and potentialedit further information wind power in the united states wind power had been experiencing exponential growth in the united states for several years when pickens announced his plan wind power in texas grew very rapidly  from  to  in another large state california wind generation increased by  in the same period the cost of wind power generation has decreased by about  over the last  years because of technological advances and is now costcompetitive with other energy sources windgenerated electricity can be produced at  to  cents per kwh a yardstick used to determine locations with high potential wind energy production is referred to as wind power density wpd it is a calculation relating to the effective force of the wind at a particular location frequently expressed in terms of the elevation above ground level over a period of time it takes into account wind velocity and mass color coded maps are frequently prepared for a particular area described for example as mean annual power density at  meters the results of the above calculation are entered into an index developed by the national renewable energy laboratory and referred to as nrel class the larger the wpd calculation the higher it is rated by class the pickens plan calls for increasing the installed wind power capacity by at least a factor of ten from its  level by citation needed this would tap only a small fraction of total us wind power potential which is estimated to be as much as  times more than the year electricity demand in the united states installed us wind power year nameplate capacity mw                     a bar graph displaying us installed wind power from  to  map of available wind power for the united states at m color codes indicate wind power density class note the shortage of transmission lines through much of the great plains wind corridor technical issuesedit power generation and transmission linesedit further information high voltage direct current and super grid high voltage transmission lines pickens says that his plan could generate enough wind power to provide  percent of the countrys electricity the institute for energy research ier an organization that is funded by the oil industry disagrees the ier claims that pickens plan relies on government subsidies and that producing large amounts of wind power is not a viable option instead the ier advocates less government for more abundant and affordable energy pickens acknowledges that natural gas would still be required for peak electricity demand and additional infrastructure would be needed to distribute the wind energy across the country new transmission lines worth  billion to  billion would be needed to carry the power from the windmills to the cities pickens testified before the senate homeland security and government affairs committee and said the government should begin building transmission lines for windgenerated power in the same way that president eisenhower did by declaring an emergency to build the interstate highway system in the s and s as an alternative pickens proposed that the government should provide the right of way on private land and extend tax credits so the private sector can build the lines kenneth medlock iii an energy fellow at the james a baker iii institute for public policy and a critic of pickens plan said a lot of what hes trying to do is add value to a stranded asset despite the recession denver oil man philip anschutz is moving forward with the construction of a wind farm in southern wyoming and a mile  km transmission line to phoenix las vegas and southern california intermittencyedit main articles intermittent power source and wind intermittency one of the challenges with using wind to replace natural gas is the intermittent nature of wind energy since the same wind conditions are not always present according to a  study by archer  jacobson published in the journal of applied meteorology and climatology interconnecting ten or more widely separated wind farms allows  to  of the total energy produced – of nominal capacity to be used as reliable baseload electric power as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height to dispatch power when the wind isnt blowing backup power plants would be needed according to paul fremont an electricutility analyst at the investment bank jefferies  co natural gas plants can quickly be brought online to supply peaking capacity during periods of low wind or peak demand according to art holland a director at pace global energy services the us will need to replace  mw of gas plant capacity over the next  years due to plant retirements this translates to twice as much wind capacity due to the difference in capacity factorscitation needed instead of dispatching additional power generation energy could be conserved on demand the smart power grid an intelligent power distribution network currently being researched and developed can reduce power consumption at the client side during peak hours and thereby lessen our dependence on gas for load following storing electricity is currently significantly more expensive than using dispatchable generation but it can be donecitation needed wind energy can be stored by pumping water uphill when the wind is blowing and then releasing it through turbine generators when the electricity is needed tvas raccoon mountain pumpedstorage plant near chattanooga tn is just one example of many such installations that already exist in the us another option is to uprate the peak generating capacity of existing hydroelectric dams by adding more generator units this allows a hydroelectric plant to buffer the variable output of wind farms on the grid by accumulating river water during periods of strong winds and releasing extra water when winds are calm and power demand is high a dam that impounds a large reservoir can store and release large amounts of water by adjusting the reservoir level within a few meterscitation needed compressedair energy storage is another energy storage mechanism when there is excess electrical energy production air is compressed and stored in a limestone cavern then when the energy is needed again the compressed air generates electricity by blowing through a turbine vanadium redox batteries are being used to store energy and level loads from wind generation projects the excess energy is stored chemically in different ionic forms of vanadium in a dilute sulphuric acid electrolyte the reaction can be reversed which allows the battery to be charged discharged and recharged making the transitionedit cng powered bus pickens plan proposes that the natural gas that is currently used to fuel power plants be used instead as a fuel for class  and  semis ken medlock a research fellow at the baker institute for public policy at rice university says that the us will continue to use natural gas for electric power generation natural gas burns cleaner than coal making it an increasingly popular fuel for power plantscitation needed gas plants also produce fewer greenhouse gas emissionscitation needed the technology needed for compressed natural gas cng vehicles such as city buses fork lifts and passenger cars with cng drivetrains is available now honda sells the civic gx with a mile  km range in addition it is possible to convert vehicles to run on cng in addition to leaving the conventional fuel injection intact allowing the driver to switch back and forth at will kits are available for the doityourselfer one can buy a cng compressor called phill that hooks up to the city natural gas line making it possible to refuel a cng car at home on the other hand the ier believes that natural gas vehicles are a niche product patricia monahan believes its going to be a big price tag to switch to cng vehicles monahan considers cng an excellent fuel for running small fleets of vehicles which log heavy mileage per vehicle such as buses and garbage trucks vehicles which use large amounts of fuel realize savings more quickly from the lower price of cng relative to dieselcitation needed in november  pickens changed his position stating that he wants heavy trucks not cars running on natural gas rich kolodziej president of ngvamerica says the very limited distribution network for natural gas is currently available in only  out of  gas stations would better serve commercial fleets and longhaul trucks policy issuesedit renewable portfolio standardsedit twentyfour states plus the district of columbia have renewable portfolio standards in place to set targets for renewable energy in those states four more states have set nonbinding energy targets economic issuesedit fundingedit the energy policy act of  created the clean renewable energy bond creb program effectively offering interestfree debt to eligible renewable projects in october  the creb program was extended to march   since july  pickens’ dallasbased investment firm bp capital has lost as much as  billion as a result of the falling stock market and credit crunch pickens may have lost around  million of his personal funds cost of wind vs natural gasedit according to jerry taylor senior fellow at the cato institute using wind to generate most of the nations electricity would undoubtedly result in higher retail electric rates because wind power is twice as expensive as natural gasfired generation and probably more if you take out the subsidies however the american wind energy association points out that the cost of wind power has dropped by more than  in the last  years and expects the cost to continue to decline as the industry matures in contrast the cost of natural gas is expected to rise moreover the effects on the environment and public health for natural gas are estimated to cost some  to  cents per kwh similar costs from wind are marginal peak gasedit parts of this article those related to this section need to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information january  main article peak gas us gas production since  source us eia the use of natural gas is a key component to pickens proposal there are concerns however that gas production has already reached its maximum production rate a point known as peak gascitation needed us gas production peaked in  at about  trillion cubic feet declined until  and has been slowly increasing over the last  years see figure on left according to peak theory the rate of production enters a terminal decline after the peak peak gas has already been confirmed by exxons ceo lee raymond in  he said to reuters that gas production has peaked in north america the reuters article continues to say while the number of us rigs drilling for natural gas has climbed about  percent over the last year and prices are at record highs producers have been struggling to raise output john decicco a senior fellow at environmental defense is critical of the plan because it assumes that gas would remain cheap despite growing demand and increasing reliance on imports as evidenced by proposals for lng terminals however implementing pickens plan does not require an increase in the supply of natural gas it calls for a shift in its use rather than an increase natural gas production has been slightly and consistently increasing in the united states for more than two decades proven recoverable us gas reserves have slightly but consistently risen since  and are about the same as in  estimates of technically recoverable reserves in the united states vary as they are generated by geological inferences but the us energy information administration  estimate is  trillion cubic feet enough to provide domestic production at  rates for nearly  years other optionsedit nuclear power vs wind poweredit main articles nuclear power nuclear power debate and radioactive waste pickens plan will require the construction of large scale wind farms to generate electricity critical of the plan the national center for public policy research a self described conservative think tank asserts that nuclear power plants would be a better alternative than the wind farms they say that nuclear power is also environmentally sound and creates very little waste that nuclear power is also far cheaper than wind power and that to build the wind farms would take many square miles of land electricity vs natural gas for powering vehiclesedit allelectric tesla roadster to some this plan seems to

poses the question if there is enough lithium carbonate production currently to support the production of the needed batteries gores global warming vs pickens planedit the plans of t boone pickens and al gore have some similarities  each lessens the dependence on fossil fuels  but differ in their eventual goals pickens specifically wants to see energy security by increasing the use of domestic energy sources including fossil fuels while gore wants to eliminate the burning of fossil fuels altogether to stop global warming pickens claims to have a plan that could accomplish this with existing technology while gore advocates new research to reduce costscitation needed a study by the european renewable energy council states that the burning of fossil fuels for energy could be eliminated globally by  using existing technology and earlier for western nations dependence on foreign fuelsedit pickens estimates that his plan would cut oil imports by  percentcitation needed patricia monahan deputy director of the clean vehicles program at the union of concerned scientists thinks differently she questions the wisdom of trying to replace large amounts of imported oil with another fossil fuel especially considering that the united states already has to import  percent of the natural gas it uses the us has been steadily increasing its imports of natural gas since  see figure to the left mainly from canada according to jerry taylor senior fellow at the cato institute is that foreign oil is not bad it is good the us is now importing about  of its oil needs annually because it is cheaper than other forms of energycitation needed taylor says that if compressed natural gas is the best option for transportation fuel then the markets will see it and over time cng could outperform gasoline as a cheaper transportation fuel questions over pickens motives and methodsedit many critics of the pickens plan highlight ways that pickens could potentially benefit personally from the plan for instance pickens owns the water rights to a huge ancient aquifer in the texas panhandle and overall owns more water than anyone else in the us increasing water demands and drought may make cities in the great plains willing to purchase water at high prices implementing pickens plan would give him rights to build electric transmission lines and by getting a wider right of way it would allow pickens to build water pipelines a similar strategy was attempted in texas where pickens is building a wind farm that will bring electricity to dallas texas the proposed pipeline would have followed the same mile  km corridor as the electric transmission lines from the wind farms which was to be seized for utility use from private owners through eminent domain many texas landowners and legislators denounced the plan particularly the fact that it allowed eminent domain to be exercised by an agency consisting only of t boone pickenss employees in september  the water pipeline was suspended t boone pickens continues to purchase water rights in the great plains and has plans to build more smaller wind farms t boone pickens would be in an excellent position to benefit financially if the plan is implemented his hedge fund bp capital is highly invested in wind and natural gas enterprises he is the majority stockholder of clean energy the largest supplier of natural gas for vehicles in the united states in rebuttal to many critics opposition pickens insists his interest is more in the countrys future than his personal wealth possibly as a move against such accusationscitation needed pickens has donated over  million to philanthropic causes in the last few years he has often been on the chronicle of philanthropys list of top us philanthropists still there are some who are uneasy about a man who made millions in the oil business advocating clean energy when it comes to the pickens plan the burr under my saddle is pickens himself i mean isnt an oil guy selling air and gas a little like donald trump pitching poverty its downright uncomfortable — jay mcdonald real concerns over natural gas being used for both home heat and vehicle fuel are that they may create shortages every year in the winter months when demand for home heating natural gas skyrockets since many american home owners already use natural gas to heat their homes a huge increase in demand for natural gas as a vehicle fuel combined with the existing huge home heating demand based on harsh winter temperatures could drive up natural gas prices ever year this could be especially economically devastating to family budgets during the holiday months when people normally allocate more of their money for holiday shopping having to pay more for vehicle fuel and home heat at the same time because both would be the same product could have a major economic impact on the nation every year another concern is that the reasoning behind the big immediate push for a natural gas future is to lock out possible development and implementation of more viable renewable energy sources if people can be convinced that natural gas is the best possible future and a large expenditure can be made now for a massive natural gas infrastructure to use natural gas for vehicle fuel it will be much more difficult to abandon natural gas as a vehicle fuel and move on to newer less expensive renewable energy sources as they become more viable to use if renewable fuel sources are allowed to develop before the country can be convinced to move to natural gas the window of opportunity to addict the country to natural gas may close and the people associated with the natural gas industry would lose a lot of money now and in the foreseeable future interestingly enough the pickens plan which manywho believe is designed to make pickens himself much more wealthy is a nonprofit organization support campaignedit pickens announced that he would spend  million on a multimedia effort to promote his proposal through both old media such as newspapers and television and new media including youtube facebook myspace twitter and the creation of a new social network on the pickens plan website as part of this effort pickens has appeared on many american news programs and talk shows such as the newshour with jim lehrer good morning america the tonight show with jay leno larry king live fox news and the daily show with jon stewart pickens is aided by his spokesperson jay rosser and political ad firm joe slade white  co to raise political support pickens planned to organize supporters by congressional districts he also met with the main party candidates for the  united states presidential election to discuss his plan he met with john mccain on august   and with barack obama on august   in october  pickens announced that the one millionth person had signed up to support his plan and that two us senators  us congressmen and nine governors had pledged to enact an energy plan that reduces our foreign oil dependence by at least  within ten years a year later another  people had signed up to support the plan major endorsementsedit carl pope executive director of the sierra club has expressed support for the pickens plan and stated “to put it plainly t boone pickens is out to save america” former clinton white house chief of staff and current president of the

enterprise products epd smallcap detective long only growth growth at reasonable price mediumterm horizonsummaryt boone pickens is betting big on enterprise products partners lpthe pipeline company is a picks and shovels play on america’s energy boomsurging us oil production could send shares highert boone pickens is one of the best energy investors on earth and right now he’s quietly accumulating a position in one littleknown pipeline company  enterprise products partners lp nyseepdthe oilman made a fortune in the energy patch first as a wildcatter through the s then as a corporate raider in the s and most recently as a trader through his hedge fund bp capital for this reason i always watch where he’s putting new cash to work and right now he’s making some big bets on pipelinesin recent quarters the billionaire has increased his positions in names like kinder morgan inc nysekmi williams partners lp nysewpz and energy transfer partners lp nyseetp he’s also backing up the truck on a new position a  share stake in midstream giant enterprise products partners investors might be wise to follow suit the partnership is a play on the country’s second oil boom new technologies have unlocked vast quantities of oil and natural gas even at today’s low energy prices the us energy information administration projects american oil output will average  million barrels per day in  almost double the daily output from a decade ago the west texas permian basin leads this revolution the geology of the field resembles a layered cake with fields of oil soaked rock stacked on top of one another back of the envelope numbers show the region could contain some  billion barrels of oil equivalent a figure that could get bigger as players further explore the fieldnumbers like those have set off something akin to a modern day gold rush drillers have coughed up as much as  an acre just to get in on the play nearly  rigs now operate in the region accounting for one out of every two in production across the country infrastructure remains the biggest challenge oil producers don’t have enough pipelines terminals and processing facilities to accommodate the boom output could exceed current takeaway capacity as early as the end of this year enterprise has positioned itself right smack in the middle of this activity the partnership owns hundreds of infrastructure assets across the south and midwest these facilities ship store and process the energy which keeps the country humming and like a bridge owner collecting tolls on each passing car enterprise earns extra fee income with more barrels flowing through its networkmanagement though won’t stop there the company has plowed billions back into operations to take advantage of the boom in  executives announced a new mile pipeline to move crude from the company’s midland texas terminal to its sealy storage facility west of houston with demand for the route surging enterprise has already booked most of the pipeline’s capacity to longterm contracts last month enterprise released plans to add  million cubic feet per day of capacity to its natural gas processing plant near orla texas in addition to oil the shale revolution has also unlocked vast amounts of natural gas liquids ngls  hydrocarbons like ethane propane butane isobutane and pentane these plants earn lucrative profits by buying raw ngls cheaply from drillers and selling the processed products to customers on wednesday the company announced the start of a new ethylene seaport terminal in the houston region firms like conocophillips nysecop exxon mobil corporation nysexom and dow chemical co nysedow have all expanded their chemical businesses in the area the completion of a new export terminal will lock in a steady flow of supplies the projects provide “a perfect example of enterprise’s business philosophy of leveraging its integrated midstream network to link supplies and markets” chief executive jim teague explained in a press release “by providing direct access to our extensive natural gas and ngl pipeline infrastructure enterprise gives delaware basin producers connectivity to a full slate of services and end users along the gulf coast including petrochemical operators who are building new facilities and export customers with a strong appetite for us production”most of these profits should get passed onto ownerssince  enterprise has boosted its payout by more than onefifth today the partnership pays a quarterly distribution of  per unit which comes out to an annual yield of  source enterprise investor presentation that trend will likely continue analysts project earnings per unit will grow at a highsingle digit clip over the next five years according to numbers compiled by reuters we will likely see the distribution increase in line with profits give or take a few percentage pointsof course no thesis is foolproofenterprise’s cash flows resemble bond coupons which is why shares often compete directly with fixedincome securities for this reason higher interest rates could clip unit prices lower spot rates for oil would also rattle investors leaving steadyeddy pipeline operators as collateral damage that said im not too worried enterprise earns most of its revenue from fees which depend far more on the volume of crude flowing through the oil patch than the price a big dip in spot rates could lower growth expectations but likely wouldn’t result in a distribution cut bottom line t boone pickens sees a big opportunity in america’s energy revolution he’s not betting though on the guys getting their hands dirty in the oil fields instead the real money will go to the people supplying the energy boom especially pipeline operators like enterprise income investors should give this partnership a

to the oklahoma state university cowboys football team beginning in  lewis field was the oldest football stadium in the big  conference – even though it didnt get an actual stadium until  over the next eight decades the structure was largely neglected until the cowboys enjoyed their  victory over the ou sooners were not picking sides but we agreed it was time for an update in the following  houston bowl season the spark from the previous seasons victory caught fire and fundraising began for major renovations to lewis field dubbed the next level the project became the flagship effort of

 out of  starsautobiography of t boone pickensbyjl populiston january  this autobiography of t boone pickens drew my interest partly because of the recent publicity of mr pickens with his energy planthis book is very readable and entertaining mr pickens comes across as a common country boy rather than an extremely wealthy oilmanfinancierpart of his success appears to be rooted in his using new ideas and procedures that are now commonly known and usedi have read a few other books that touched on the business roundtable mr pickens has a scathing view of that organizationhe explains that the energy crisis of  was manipulated by withholding supply rather than an actual shortagethe author also elaborates on some of the corporate takeovers he was involved in that offers an insider view that shares not only the part he and his company played but also the affected ceos as well as the outside counsel and investment bankershe also shares some of his business philosophysome of the quotes that i enjoyed the most were theselooking back it seems as though i have spent my whole life raising money for a deal one thing that you learn fast you may not find money but youre sure to meet some interesting peoplea ceo shouldnt leave until quitting time just like everybody else if he makes the biggest bucks he ought to put in the longest hoursthe biggest hurdle in american corporations is the ceos ego nowadays we talk about restructuring and downsizing companies but what we really need is a way to downsize the egosthis may be a  year old book but it was an enjoyable read and pickens shares some common sense and wisdom throughout the book that applies to today read more top critical reviewsee all  critical reviews›  people found this helpful  out of  starsa different view of corporate americabyj jensenon july  a quick enjoyable read boone provides the reader with insight regarding the motivations of corporate executives  self preservation t boone consistently highlights one theme  creating shareholder value  as the justification for his actions throughout the s the book provided an altogether different slant than that portrayed by the media and by corporate america the reader should be prepared however as t boone is self praising and absorbed throughout the majority of this book in fact one should consider this book to be the otherside of the corporate raider storyoverall boone is a read which provides a glimse into the personality which exemplifies the corporate raider upon finishing the book i was taken two things  the names of some partners ivan boesky michael milken and so forth  the continued bloatedness of big business regardless of the industry in america  apparently things have not changed much in the last  years since boone was originally written read
