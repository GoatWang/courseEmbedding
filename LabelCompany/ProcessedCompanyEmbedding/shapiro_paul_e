anytime day or night currently carriers fedex ups and the us postal service bear huge costs for local deliveries the socalled lastmile cost perhaps as much as  billion annually most of this cost would disappear if packages could be delivered to adms rather than to residences at the core of eships concept is a sophisticated information system that links all the adms over the internet this case focuses on eships attempt to formulate a business model to facilitate entering the us market the dilemma centers on the role that eship should play in the value chain and with whom it should partner
