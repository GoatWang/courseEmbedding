ignyta seems to be on track with entrectinib  ignyta inc nasdaqrxdx  seeking alphasign in  join nowgoÂ»ignyta seems to be on track with entrectinibnov  about ignyta inc rxdx shark traders longshort equity momentum shortterm horizon bondssharktraderscomsummaryrxdx just announced that it sold  million worth of common stocks to eli lilly and company phase  of entrectinib showed positive results and phase  has been initiated in september  rxdx rd expenses increased in q  compared to the same quarter last year which indicates the money is being used in a productive way cantor fitzgerald started covering rxdx and issued a buy rating after its q  earnings report was published company overview ignyta inc nasdaqrxdx is a biotechnology company involved in developing precision drugs for cancer patients ignyta inc mainly targets patients with tumors and try to design drugs based on a strategy called rxdx rxdx strategy is known as the integrated therapeutic and diagnostic system that tries to guess a potential solution for curing the tumors by pairing each of the solutions with biomarkerbased companion diagnostics hence the product candidates of ignyta inc would help a very narrow pool of patients who have a higher probability of getting cured currently ignyta inc has several product candidates in the pipeline including rxdx now known as entrectinib after seeking alpha contributor steven breazzano did a great job profiling the company in february  there have been several major developments over the last  months we believe investors would benefit from an updated analysis of the recent key developments ignyta inc has several internal discovery stage programs known as spark programs and a handful of other product candidates in the pipeline however we will only discuss about its most promising product candidate the entrectinib rxdx and recent financial developments entrectinib phase  clinical trial began followers of ignyta inc may already know that entrectinib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of trka trkb and trkc as well as ros and alk figure  ignyta inc stock spiked over  percent after releasing phase  clinical trial data of entrectinib on june   ignyta inc released the phase  clinical trial data of entrectinib and announced that they have found the recommended phase  dose within days of releasing the clinical trial data of the phase  ignyta inc stock price spiked to  per share representing a  percent increase in september  ignyta inc participated in the  european cancer congress ecc  in vienna austria and discussed about the interim results from phase  during the ecc  ignyta inc said that their alka and startrk studies had a total  patients who received solid tumor doses in a varied range during these two clinical trials ignyta inc found that patients tolerated the entrectinib doses very well however some of the adverse side effects caused due to the treatment included fatigue dysgeusia paresthesia nausea and myalgia they said there were only three serious adverse events nonetheless once the dose was modified all these events became reversible and ignyta inc was able to resolve the issues out of the  participants in the phase  only  participants met the phase  eligibility criteria later only  patients remained on the treatment plan with durable responses of up to  treatment cycles the studies concluded that entrectinib can have an objective tumor response in the central nervous system current financial situationfigure  ignyta incs total expenses compared to its cash and equivalents since ignyta inc currently does not market any products it does not have any top line hence investors have to keep an eye on the burn rate of the company by the end of q  ignite inc had a cash and equivalents of  million and total expenses of around  million earlier this month ignyta inc announced that it has obtained an exclusive license for the taladegib oncology development program from eli lilly for  million cash payment and an additional  million common stocks concurrently eli lilly entered into a stock purchase agreement with ignyta inc and bought an additional  million common shares of ignyta inc at  per share it means they have effectively invested  million in the company at the current burn rate ignyta inc would be able to continue its operation for at least two more quarters based on its current level of liquidity however if we include the availableforsale securities it would have  million on the books against only  million in longterm debt in the third quarter of  out of the  million expense  million went into its research and development compared to only  million in q  this represents a  percent increase it is always good to know that the bulk of the initial funding is being spent on rd the general and administrative expenses were only  million conclusionearlier this week cantor fitzgerald started coverage for ignyta inc and issued a buy rating after its q  eps came out at  a solid  higher than thomson reuters consensus estimate of  although getting fda approval for the entrectinib is still a matter of the distant future the phase  study showed promising results with the stock purchase agreement with eli lilly ignyta inc has secured its liquidity situation in the short term and with promising results from phase  it would be much easier to raise additional funds if needed in september  the startrk phase  clinical trial of entrectinib was initiated in this trial  leading cancer centers in the us europe and asia would allow their patients to participate we can only hope the results come bearing good news we believe the overall good financial standing of the company along with the latest developments around its lead product candidate entrectinib indicates that ignyta inc is on course to become a leading precision oncology biotechnology company secondary investors should carefully follow and study this company as we believe the stock price has huge upside potential in

clinical trials can be cumbersome and timeconsuming furthermore even if that referral is successful by entering a trial the patient risks losing the personal care of the physician he or she has come to know and trust at ignyta weâre working to streamline the referral and evaluation process cutting the time from first contact to trial enrollment to reduce the burden on both patient and provider our unique rxdx ability and our heritage in molecular diagnostics allow us to more efficiently confirm results of local molecular patient screening for trial enrollment ignytaâs central diagnostics lab also handles testing for clinical sites to help pinpoint difficulttofind eligible patients who would otherwise miss gaining access to our investigationalÂ therapies working with community oncologists we can ensure the patient is cared for and that the doctorpatient relationship is preserved throughout the clinical trial process both patients and providers have concerns about trialsfor some patients with cancers that have been resistant to treatment clinical trials for therapies in development are not just an interesting option â they may be their only hope this fact motivates ignyta to keep both patient and provider concerns topofmind when structuring and conducting trials knowing that both patients and providers are acutely concerned about the availability of trials ignyta is continually building an evergrowing network of study sites to bring trials closer to patients across the us and around the globe accessibility is one thing enrollment is another the trials testing and enrollment process can be challenging for both the patient and the provider our exclusive rxdx capability along with inhouse molecular diagnostic dx testing keeps the entire process under

pharosâ¢ignyta clinical trialsscientific presentationsinvestorsinvestors overviewpress releasesevents  presentationssec filingscorporate governancestock informationemail alerts ntrk fusions admin t neurotrophic tyrosine kinase  â ntrk fusionsthe neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinases are a family of genes ntrk ntrk and ntrk that encode the proteins trka trkb and trkc respectively they function as receptors that span the cell membrane sensing extracellular signals like the binding of neurotrophin molecules and transferring the signal to the cellâs intracellular environment through kinase activity trk receptors are particularly essential to neuronal development  the aberrant expression of rearranged ntrk genes encoding trk fusion proteins has been detected in a wide range of cancers eg salivary gland cancer colon cancer lung cancer thyroid cancer breast cancer and suggests that signaling by these receptors may be important in the regulation of tumor cell proliferation differentiation andor apoptosis in the subset of patients whose tumors harbor such gene fusions see table  it is thought that an ntrk fusion that joins the kinase portion of the gene to various nterminal partners as described below results in their constitutive activation in a ligandindependent manner ntrkone of the first receptor kinases found to be involved in a fusion event that led to the development of cancer was neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase type  ntrk which encodes the protein trka this gene was originally identified as a fusion oncogene in colon carcinoma trka is a  kda glycoprotein comprised of an extracellular nterminal ligandbinding domain a transmembrane domain and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain upon binding to its ligand nerve growth factor ngf trka dimerizes and undergoes autophosphorylation of its intracellular domain this results in subsequent activation of intracellular signaling molecules including ras phosphatidylinositolkinase pik and mitogenactivated protein kinase mapk thus stimulating cellular proliferation differentiation and survival abnormal expression of the trka protein was recently identified in tumor and liver metastases of a patient with colorectal cancer who was refractory to standard therapy molecular characterization unveiled a novel fusion between the lmnaÂ and ntrk genes within chromosome  resulting in the formation of a fusion oncogene lmnaântrk with transforming potential the patient was treated with a trk inhibitor entrectinib and achieved a partial response which was maintained for approximately  months march  â july  this was the first clinical evidence of efficacy for therapeutic inhibition of trka using a trk inhibitor in a solid tumor in lung cancer patients one study identified ntrk rearrangements in  of  patients with lung adenocarcinoma  and this study also identified  additional gene fusion partners for ntrk mprip and cd both of which resulted in constitutive activation of the resulting fusion kinase and were also oncogenic table   as in colorectal cancer there is also evidence for therapeutic inhibition of lung tumors with ntrk rearrangements during phase i trials one patient with metastatic lung cancer harboring an ntrk rearrangement displayed a partial response to entrectinib including a complete response for all brain metastases ntrk fusion events are now being more widely screened for and increasingly recognized across multiple cancer types a recent survey of northeastern us patients with pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma n for example identified a single patient  with diffuse follicular papillary thyroid cancer ptc harboring a fusion between the gene translocated promoter region tpr and ntrk another recent study identified the previously described lmnaâ ntrk and a fusion between tropomyosin  tpmântrk fusion genes in a total of  of  patients  from a korean colon cancer population using nextgeneration rna sequencing this study found that tumors harboring these ntrk gene rearrangements did not have somatic mutations in other oncogenes like kras nras or pikca and both fusion proteins were shown to be oncogenic as their expression in niht cells resulted in transformation and tumor formation in immunocompromised mice in a sampling of  spitzoid skin neoplasms which included  spitz naevi  atypical spitz tumors and  spitzoid melanomas ntrk rearrangements were detected in a total of  of the samples  patients with   and  patients respectively harboring rearrangements in the respective tumor types ntrktrkb which is encoded by the ntrk gene was identified in  to be a functional receptor for brainderived neurotrophic factor bdnf and neurotrophin  nt but unlike trka it does not bind to ngf when expressed in cell lines trkb has been shown to regulate cellular effects for both bdnf and nt although nt is the weaker of the  known ligands like trka ligand binding to trkb causes dimerization and autophosphorylation of its catalytic domain resulting in the activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways including the rasmapk phospholipasec gamma plcg and pik pathways which mediate its cellular effects some of the implicated roles for altered trkb signaling in cancer include its role in suppressing anoikis or apoptosis in response to loss of cell matrix interaction thereby promoting a more invasive phenotype and a potential role of the bdnftrkbsignaling axis in overcoming resistance to other cancer therapies such as epidermal growth factor receptor egfr inhibitors as previously observed in colon cancer cells like ntrk gene fusion events involving ntrk are also becoming increasingly recognized in various cancers two novel ntrk rearrangements were identified in a study conducted by the international cancer genome consortium and pedbrain tumor project which examined  pilocytic astrocytomas the most common form of childhood brain tumor in both cases expression of the aberrant fusion kinase resulted in ligandindependent dimerization and constitutive activation of the kinase data from the cancer genome atlas has also recorded novel fusions involving ntrk in lung adenocarcinoma squamous cell head and neck cancer and lowgrade glioma table  ntrktrkc encoded by ntrk is the primary receptor for nt and like trkb and trka it mediates the effects of its ligand on neuronal growth and differentiation during development in  a fusion between the ntrk gene and an etstype transcription factor etv also called tel was reported in congenital fibrosarcoma cfs this fusion transcript encoded a protein with a helixloophelix hlh domain believed to be involved in dimerization fused to the protein tyrosine kinase domain of trkc the resultant fusion protein was subsequently shown to result in dysregulation of downstream signaling pathways  in  a fusion between etv and the ntrk gene was also found to be expressed in human secretory breast cancers sbc a rare but clinically distinct subtype of breast cancer transcripts for this fusion were detected in  of  sbc cases  in a recent survey of northeastern us patients with pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma ptc n a total of  patients  with varying ptc phenotypes were found to harbor an ntrk fusion most commonly with the etv gene n of  cases  unknown fusion partner interestingly the high incidence  overall of ntrk and ntrk rearrangements in the pediatric ptc population in this study overall  was notably higher than that reported by the cancer genome atlas tcga for adult ptc as well as that observed in sporadic and radiationinduced ptcs the startrk trial is enrolling patients with ntrk ros and alk fusions more information is available at wwwstartrktrialscom table  examples of knownÂ ntrk gene fusionsÂ in cancer
