faulkner natural gas can lead us to energy independence new technology will continue to boost our production capacity by chris faulkner updated  pm thursday november   the environmental protection agencys new carbon emissions standards have caused an uproar in the coal industry these rules limit the amount of carbon new coalfired power plants can produce industryfriendly lawmakers have been quick to voice their outrage congressmen john shimkus and rodney davis say they will kill the future of coal senate minority leader mitch mcconnell called them a war on coal but the real threat to coals dominance isnt excessive federal regulation its natural gas and texas is playing a major role in the national gas renaissance with natural gas the united states has found an expansive homegrown energy source thats cleaner than coal and increasingly costeffective the modern natural gas boom has given the united states a chance to achieve genuine energy independence and seriously cut down on carbon emissions texas is the leading producer of natural gas in the united states accounting for  percent of total national production and here in houston the growing supply of lowcost gas has fueled massive economic gains dow chemical just announced a billiondollar expansion plan expected to create thousands of new positions and the port of houston has benefited from  billion in new regional investments in the petrochemical industry meanwhile those looking to protect coal from new epa regulations are defending an energy source that is already falling into disfavor in the united states and other developed nations currently coal helps provide  percent of the electricity produced in the united states historically it has always been the lowestcost fuel option for power plants but burning coal has long presented serious public health and environmental concerns  from the first recognition of the dangers of soot toxic ash and sulfur emissions during the heyday of the coal industry in britain in the th century to the sulfurous great smog that killed thousands of londoners in  to the environmental devastation wrought by acid rain and mercury emissions first identified in the s at the same time coalfired power plants are the single biggest source of co emissions in the united states fortunately we dont have to continue treating coal as a necessary evil thanks to the recent surge in domestic natural gas production policymakers now have a historic opportunity to end americas dependence on coal once and for all over the last decade energy entrepreneurs have made major advances in two wellestablished resource development technologies  horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing or fracking these techniques have enabled a surge in domestic natural gas production particularly in underground shale formations that had previously been too difficult to develop between  and  alone american gas production jumped  percent the alfred p sloan foundation predicts natural gas production will continue to climb for the next three decades in august the energy information administration announced that in  the united states registered the single largest yearly increase in proved natural gas reserves in over thirty years this expansion in supply has precipitated a drop in price between  and  the per unit cost dropped an astonishing  percent and from an environmental standpoint natural gas is clearly superior to coal as the epa has noted compared to the average air emissions from coalfired generation natural gas produces half as much carbon dioxide less than a third as much nitrogen oxides and one percent as much sulfur oxides as the power plant given its economic and environmental advantages natural gas has already seriously undercut coal as the goto source for electricity generation a new study from duke university found that the abundance of cheap gas has rendered nine percent of the nations coal plants uneconomic if the epa follows through on these stricter emissions rules natural gas plants are expected to outcompete about  percent of all coal plants and the abundance of cheap gas has enabled the united states to emerge as a global leader in energy production  something that was unthinkable just a few years ago the united states soon will surpass russia as the worlds leading oil and gas producer this development marks the beginning of a new era in global energy politics one in which the united states will no longer be dependent on middle eastern oil the epas new coal regulations merely codify what should already be obvious now that natural gas is abundant the economic environmental and political case for coalbased energy has gone up in smoke chris faulkner is president and chief executive officer of breitling

political debate turned to energy the discussion was all about shortage and scarcity a reality that haunted the united states ever since the global oil crises of the s that conversation is over story continued below and now the unconventional energy revolution—newly accessible supplies of shale gas and oil—is creating a new discourse on energy that is changing politics and policies all of this represents what energy secretary ernest moniz calls a “new mentality” about america’s energy position with a new political language to match exactly  years ago in november  president richard nixon went on television to promise the american people energy “ independence” within  years just three weeks earlier on oct   arab petroleum exporters had instituted an oil embargo to punish the west and in particular the united states for its support of israel during the yom kippur war americans were shocked by the embargo—and by the quadrupling of oil prices that followed six years later the iranian revolution toppled the shah one of america’s closest allies in the middle east further disrupting the global oil supply all this was completely at odds with the pervasive american assumption of abundance that had been shaped by decades and decades of ample supply as late as world war ii six out of every seven barrels of oil used by the allies had been exported from the continental united states in  most americans did not even know that the united states imported any oil given that many assumed that the price increases caused by the embargo had to be the result of manipulation it was just hard to accept that global markets could become so vulnerable to disruptions that could send prices spiraling up the shortage theory certainly seemed to be borne out by what happened in the decades after  when nixon made his energy independence speech the united states was importing  percent of its oil by  it was importing  percent over the same period us oil production fell by more than a third natural gas output also declined by  it looked as though the united states was going to become a huge importer not only of oil but also of natural gas in the form of more costly liquefied natural gas lng nixon’s promise of energy independence became a standard pledge of every succeeding president but with imports rising it seemed an ever more distant hope—indeed even fodder for latenight comedians—not the stuff of political reality then came shale gas and tight oil although the technological breakthroughs enabling this production boom occurred from  to  the results did not show up in the numbers until  but it’s now clear that a revolution has occurred us crude oil production is up  percent since  thanks to that increase as well as more efficient automobiles petroleum imports have fallen from their high of  percent in  to  percent today—exactly what they were in  and as domestic production increases and gasoline mileage improves imports will continue to go down north dakota the center of the nowfamous bakken formation shale has overtaken alaska and california to become the secondlargest oilproducing state in the country outpaced only by texas us natural gas production has increased by nearly a third since  and shale gas has gone from  percent of output in  to  percent today open in new window optics see tristan spinskis aerial photos of north dakotas fracking boom from above now “energy independence” is back in vogue not as a joke but as a serious topic of political discussion it’s not likely that the united states will actually become energy independent in the foreseeable future but it will certainly become energy alotlessdependent the surge in production and the fall in imports would in themselves call for recasting the political discourse but the economic impact of this revolution is broader even than those numbers suggest a recent study by ihs the energy consulting firm where i work estimates that  million jobs were supported by this energy boom in  and we project that to rise to  million jobs by  it meant an additional  billion in federal and state revenues in  and owing to lower energy costs an increase of  in average household disposable income across the united states with us natural gas prices a third of those in europe it is also making the united states a much more competitive place for industry helping to power what president obama has called a “renaissance in american manufacturing”—many tens of billions of dollars of new investment going into manufacturing facilities and the increase in domestic oil production has reduced the annual us trade deficit at current prices by about  billion once upon a time in north dakota how oil is scrambling politics in the roughrider state the wild wild north cities and towns in north dakota’s northwestern “oil patch” are working to keep order among the tens of thousands of young men who have flocked there for jobs since  the city of williston for instance has passed ordinances requiring liquor license holders to be “legal and bona fide” north dakota residents banning the sale of alcohol after  am prohibiting rvs in residential areas and limiting “adult cabaret and sexually oriented businesses” to the town’s heavy industrial district sharing the spoils in  north dakota lawmakers used their entire day legislative session for the first time ever to decide how to spend the state’s  billion surplus majority republicans—even those from the oilrich northwest—called for fiscal restraint while democrats pushed to give more money to local governments for roads hospitals and other services under strain from population growth the legislature passed a record  billion twoyear budget— percent higher than the last one—including  billion “to address the needs associated with the rapid economic expansion related to the oil boom” in western north dakota red state rising thanks to an influx of jobseekers that has bumped up the state’s population to  north dakota—the only state without voter registration—had nearly  additional eligible voters in the  election voter turnout was up by only  from  but all  counties voted more republican in the presidential contest with a slightly larger shift toward the gop among the nine counties at the heart of the bakken formation already the most conservative part of the state still north dakotans also elected moderate democrat heidi heitkamp to the us senate albeit by just  percentage point margaret slattery is associate editor at politico magazine thanks to dana harsell and aaron ley of the university of north dakota rob port of sayanythingblog and state sen mac schneider photo of truckers breaking for food in new town nd by alec sothmagnum these economic opportunities have captured the attention of such governors as republican john kasich of ohio and democrat john hickenlooper of colorado in addition to promising sound state regulation of drilling they have emphasized what this means in terms of jobs industrial development revenues both for the state and for farmers struggling to hang on to their land and revitalization of decaying rural areas that are losing the next generation as kasich put it development of the state’s utica shale will help parents get their grown children “out of their attic and actually get a job” it’s been a long time since anyone in american politics—at least outside of places like texas and oklahoma—talked about oil and gas in terms of jobs here at home then there is the geopolitical impact the increase in us oil production since just  is greater than the entire output of nigeria one of the major opec producers and more than iran’s entire exports prior to the sanctions that have sliced its export level roughly in half since  indeed without the increase in us oil production it’s very hard to see how the oil sanctions on iran could have worked obama’s own words are another way to measure the stark change in the politics of energy that has occurred on his watch in his first two state of the union addresses the president mentioned the words “natural gas” just once but in his  address he talked about the need for an “alloftheabove” energy strategy and gave more time to oil and gas than to the promise of developing alternative sources like wind and solar he has frequently cited the job creation resulting from shale in a major climate speech this past june he declared “we should strengthen our position as the top natural gas producer because in the medium term at least it not only can provide safe cheap power but it can also help reduce our carbon emissions” the great american boom a politico magazine special report washington might look like a disaster zone but luckily the world is not waiting for america’s political system to reboot in many ways the united states is enjoying an unlikely boom our special report spotlights several of these technocharged transformations and their surprising political consequences from reviving cities and busting suburbs to a new age of digital haves and havenots and the return of the united states as the world’s top oil and gas producer for the first time in years it’s a time to expect the unexpected perhaps the most striking example of how obama’s language has changed came last year in his debate with republican challenger mitt romney when he said something that certainly would not have been heard in a debate in  “on energy governor romney and i we both agree that we’ve got to boost american energy production and oil and natural gas production are higher than they’ve been in years” of course not everybody agrees there was previously support in the environmental community for natural gas as a lowercarbon alternative to coal now as natural gas supplies are growing the environmental movement is split some continue to support the growth in shale gas properly regulated as a way to push coal out of electric generation they point to the increased use of gas as one of the most important reasons for the dramatic decline in us carbon emissions—back to the level of —despite the us economy growing by more than  percent in the years since other environmentalists are mobilized in opposition to hydraulic fracturing—better known as “fracking” a word few would have even known a decade ago but which is now part of the political vocabulary they worry about the possibility of local pollution related to extracting the shale gas and about the growing abundance of a lowcost lowcarbon fossil fuel that competes with highercost wind and solar power they also want to take the regulation of drilling out of the hands of the states which have controlled it for more than a century and move it under the purview of the environmental protection agency which they believe would be much more restrictive read more the great american boom  ways the fracking boom changes politics by hal harvey the great american boom chu unplugged by blake hounshell the great american boom last one standing by ian bremmer but even as we’re still arguing over fracking and the environmental impact of natural gas the debate about imports—the one that consumed us for decades and decades—is largely over today we are arguing about exports the natural gas market in the united states is oversupplied and in surplus it is now constrained by lack of demand not lack of supply one new market is exports facilities that were started half a decade or more ago to receive lng from abroad are now being reconfigured to export it setting off what has been a fierce debate over whether the united states should become a major natural gas exporter for the first time the next debate will be on an even more sensitive subject whether the united states should export crude oil with a few minor exceptions crude oil exports are prohibited a relic of s oil crisisera legislation yet the rapid growth in domestic production along with differences in the quality of various grades of oil and differences in refining capacity suggests that in some instances it would make much more economic sense to export crude oil from some ports and import it at others over most of the past  years the idea that the united states could even be talking about such an issue would have seemed improbable even ridiculous but that will very likely be part of the political debate in  and a hot part—a clear demonstration of just how much the way america talks and thinks about energy is changing what would richard nixon say now daniel yergin is vice chairman of the global

commission of texas the pennsylvania public utility commission the new york public service commission and the new jersey board of public utilities  independence energy alliance is a subsidiary of energy plus it costs  for their website plus a  monthly service charge an associate emphasis is on encouraging others to become asssociates while inviting consumers to make the switch to green energy for free they offer consumers an opportunity to save money on their energy bill a  annual rebate representing a percentage of that calender years energy bill surge protection unemployment insurance and payment of that months energy bill if service is interrupted associates earn commissions on all active consumer accounts plus bonuses and residuals they also promote the best compensation package in the mlm business however theirs is identical to linx i was brought in by linda doucette whos father paid for my website on the condition that i bring a certain number of customers in a specific period of time i told linda i was skeptical for one reason the free termination option did not protect me from a higher electric bill nothing prevented my energy bill from increasing then i can terminate but i still owe for a higher bill she stated no that would be fraud  so i agreed to join in i even attended their october   seminar in hoboken i remember the date because its the same day i passed the drivers test and got my drivers license i switched my energy just to be sure i was not going to sell or promote a fruadulent contract i approached churches business organizations pba pta etc and apartment complex building managers the goal is toget associates under you who bring accounts hence it made sense to attract people in positions of trust who had acces to more than hundreds of people at once i served  years in orison and its hard to find gainful employment becoming an iea associate sounded like an attractive deal i could run my business via email and be a stay at home dad and care for my son my first energy bill was more than  higher the iea energy rate was higher than my usual jcpl rate i called jcpl and told them to terminate the green energy supplier then i called iea and told them i no longer wanted to be an associate the woman explained to me they iea does not promote a lesser energy bill  i went to my website and read to them the information they gave me to promote nothing with the information they provide informs the consumer they must pay the service charge they only stated that green energy will by provided through your current energy provider generally jcpl charges a  servicedelivery fee she stated thats why we give  cash back to cover the service charge the service charge is  a year plus what i owe to iea for the green energy no matter how theytry to explain it away the energy bill increases by the service charge and the higher iea energy rate she even had the audacity to tell me your bill was only  higher this month  now termination is free but it takes a month my second energy bill was more than  higher  after termination  mlm business train you to start with the warm market  family and friends i would not have agreed to switch but that linda doucette told me it would be a crime for this to occur im an exoffendrr and do not have a steady reliable income i just had a son it made sense to lower already surmouting bills my mother in law trusted me after i told her what i was told she knew why i didnt want to do it in the first place i told all the organizations and people i contacted that i will do my energy bill first and let them see the savings themselves my first associate would have been a manager of a  unit apartment building a seniors complex people who love to brag about how frugal they are  and its nothing but a scam i told iea they are not getting paid the law cannot be expected to enforce a deceptive contract you cannot deceive people about whats really entailed and seek to bail yourself out with fine print fineprint only means you knew i was going to find out how you robbed me and nothing else i have emailed linda doucette  who hasnt contacted me since i told her about my higher electric bill she lied to me i didnt lose anything as her dad paid for the site but if this was not a scam it would have been a good source of income   this report was posted on

saturday november   it sounds like the real ripoff was the base company for your area jcpl with deregulation and open competition it sound like their strategy is to apply this rediculus service fee to discourage cutomers from leaving that is not going to last long before the government steps in and tells them to stop that practice if they dont get sued first independence alliance or any other competitive company cannot control what the current electric company a consumer is with charges for servicing outside electric providers this type of action shuts down the whole intent of deregulation rather than be the pawn of jcpl and put something like this out there you would have been better served filing a complaint with some kind of consumer protection agency to stop this practice by jcpl respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  update employee consumer misunderstanding between energy supply and energy deliver author ieacommunications  united states of america submitted monday march   posted monday march   this post is the result of a misunderstanding by the consumer on the difference between energy supply and energy delivery  independence energy tried to work with this consumer to educate him on his areas of concern when a customer decides to switch from the utility to a retail energy supplier the supplier of the energy will change however the delivery method will remain the same  in this instance although the customers source of energy switched to independence energy the delivery was still through the local utility jcpl as this relates to billing retail energy suppliers like independence energy  only charge for the supply of the energy not the delivery  interestingly at the time of the above post independence energys rate per kilowatt hour was  versus jcpls price to compare of   independence energy does not however propose to always offer the lowest rate at all times  the independence energy rate is variable and therefore subject to change  we do aspire to price lower than the utility but this is not a guaranteethis fact is explained to the customer at the time of their energy provider switch and is also included in the contractual agreement the only way to compare the cost of energy is to look at the rate per kilowatt hour  to only look at the bill from one month to the next is quite deceiving as the electricity usage will vary one cannot simply have a lowerhigher bill from one month to the next and assume that they are paying lessmore for their energy  this is especially true for the author of this post  in looking at this customers electric usage both before and during his time with independence energy it is apparent that his varied greatly     the  delivery charge that the author of this post is concerned with was not a charge from independence energy  furthermore his switch to an independent energy source in no way brought about this  delivery charge  this charge came from his local utility jcpl and would have been charged regardless of the customer exercising their choice to go with a retail energy supplier   we do as addressed in this post offer  and  cash back on electric usage every year to our customers  this is not to cover any kind of charge on the consumers end and the author of this post was never told that by marketing materials or employees of independence energy  this is simply an added benefit that we like to give our customers for choosing independence energy as their energy source  our customers receive  cash back when they choose our green plus product with  renewable energy exceeding state minimum renewable requirements and  cash back when they go completely green with our true green  renewable product  additional benefits that we offer our customers are unemployment protection and free surge protection  a power surge is a sudden increase in power and can occur at any moment for a number of reasons a power surge can severely damage home appliances and electronics we guarantee up to

protection provides payment of all independence energy charges on the energy bill up to  per month for up to three months at independence energy we find that our customers are very happy and generally do not experience these kinds of situations  we apologize for any misunderstanding that this customer experienced  we pride ourselves on being an honest open and ethical company  there are no hidden fees independence energy is proud to offer consumers in nj pa ny il ct and tx the power to choose affordable renewable energy options to fit their financial and environmental needs we encourage anyone

information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  general comment questions regarding this complaint author jdomp  united states of america submitted sunday january   posted sunday january   my name is joe p and i am very interested in joining independence energy alliance  i read your article and have some questions of my own before i venture down this road  who charged the  fee you mentioned  and if charged by your local utility wouldnt that be illegal on their part  was the rate ie was charging less than the rate your local provider was charging  were you maybe on a budget plan with your local provider so your monthly bill was steady all year and through ie you were on a normal usage plan so other months could have been much cheaper  would you be willing to email me a copy of your  bills and  previous so i could make a compairson i have been to  meetings  numerous conference calls and read the entire rulesregulations booklet  i even took it to a lawyer to double check the legality  the company seems legit  the payplan is great and obviously the product sells itself  however if customers arent saving money or at least paying the same price with the added benefits i would agree with your article  thats why id like to do a little research if this is just an isolated event or if something else went into the bill discrepancy

i believe these new and exciting products combined with additional strategic business combinations currently under consideration will help accelerate the growth of redhawk medical i invented the disintegrator to address two huge problems which currently plague the medical industry  needle sticks and hazardous waste disposal the u s centers for disease control and prevention estimates that more than a halfmillion accidental sticks occur annually with many of those injuries going unreported in addition to potential threats to medical professionals sharps often end up in recycling centers where workers who come into contact with the used needles can be hurt or worse contract lifethreatening disease legislators have passed laws to make it illegal to throw needles and sharps into the trash but they didnt mandate a system to safely dispose of them because needles are considered hazardous medical waste used needles must be placed in punctureproof containers and taken to special dropoff sites many times patients have to travel a longdistance to safely dispose the needles but some of these patients are elderly or too ill to travel these long distances although they can pay to participate in a disposal program through the mail wherein used needles are shipped in safe containers to disposal sites these programs can be expensive because of the growing problem of needle sticks and hazardous waste disposal that continues to plague the medical industry i created the disintegrator using proprietary technology that creates an electric arc the unit safely converts a used needle into a safe powder residue in a matter of a few seconds the powder residue is then no longer considered a hazardous material and can be safely disposed with the normal household waste   thomas j

yes original review deborah r california i dont drink energy drinks often mostly because they dont typically taste great and i drink coffee already however i was impressed with guru i couldnt put my finger on the flavor at first but reading the ingredients it was the green tea that leaves a mild aftertaste kind of like matcha the nose is citrusy and refreshing that said although i stayed perky after drinking it i would say its safe for people who only drink caffeine moderately to drink it too and if youre dead tired it might not make much of a difference it only has caffeine from the tea so not at all the crack type of artificial energy drink like a monster or red bull which i think taste gross and are horrible for you would you purchase again  yes original review mark w california this brand really holds up to the competition it has great flavor and balance plus its better for you then any other energy drink i would definitely recommend this product would you purchase again  yes

even think it needed it but it was still yummy would you purchase again  yes original review la c california im not big on mainstream energy drinks so im happy that theres a more natural organic

and thought it was a step above the usual red bull or monster drinks upon reading the list of ingredients i was pleased to see that they were all natural i was surprised to see echinacea listed as an ingredient which i felt was a nice alternative to unpleasant tasting vitamin supplements my store did not carry the sugar free variety so i had to settle for the  grams of sugar that came with the regular version it was very sweet but the actual taste was good and i liked the level of carbonation i didnt get the jitters nor did i have the crash and burn that i would have expected with this type of drink i did not drink it all at once but rather had it throughout the second half of the day which is usually when i start feeling tired if i can find the sugar free version i will definitely try it i do have to limit my caffeine intake but for those occasions when i absolutely must have an extra boost a cold sparkly guru sounds like a great alternative to an iced coffee or tea would you

muracles  on lazy and rainy sunday afternoon i did not have much hope to achieve anything but with guru i completed tasks and chores i was procrastinating about for weeks the only thing to be aware of

an additional bonus after drinking it is was able to push through my day and didnt have a crash later on i would recommend this product to anyone and i will be buying it in the future would you purchase again  yes original review jack d california this product tastes great i absolutely loved it and felt very energetic about  minutes after drinking it it tastes great when chilled although i would think it probably tastes good at room temperature as well if i ever feel the need for some energy i would definitely purchase this product recommended would you purchase again  yes original review victoria h california i personally am a connoisseur of energy drinks i rely on caffeine for most of my projects at school and for late night coding sessions as well as marathon gaming although energy drinks can be considered a crutch its a lifestyle decision that many many people embrace rather than attempt to avoid i am one of these people that said guru energy is fairly cheap usdcan if you buy it here off amazon it comes in the redbull standard  floz cans and is shipped in a surprisingly lightweight and compact case compare this to monster rockstar or any other brand with standard  floz cans the taste like gurus website describes is very indescribable it is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation the caffeine buzz is more natural it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out which is arguably awesome too in its own respect then big crash sort of feeling this is because the caffeine in guru is derived from mg of guaranine guarana herb rather than synthetically separated then added there is no mention about how much of the mg of guaranine is real caffeine but since red bull checks in at mg  oz it seems that guru is in pretty good shape i think a particular good feature of guru is that it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup i appreciate a good quality soda particularly microbrew colas and they often exclusively contain cane sugar so in summary this energy drink is fairly cheap good buzz all natural and great for coding gaming or studying would you purchase again  yes original review sangeeta m california nice drink for a pickmeup  refreshing and pleasant tasting ideal replacement for a soda  the carbonation without all the sugar was perfectly satisfying zero guilt would you purchase again  no original review ashley b california the biggest question is does it work the answer to your question is yes i was busy all day long and had the best energy ive had in awhile it feels a lot better than using redbull im very sensitive to caffeine so drinking it gives me a lot of energy i have no question about that but this energy felt like ive slept the whole night without waking up and best bed ever so pretty much i felt really good the taste isnt the best but it not a lot you drink so if you hate it a lot then just chug it its a little herbaly but not bad just different would you purchase again  yes original review christine f california i love it its sweet kind of tastes like this other energy drink brand ive tried before it tastes very good and not nasty or smell like alcohol like others do sure would rebuy again totally recommend this brand would you purchase again  yes original review cindy w california im a big fan of energy drinks so i consider myself somewhat of an expert and i must say this perticular energy drinkguru was quite surprising so if you get a chance to try one like i did please doyou wont be sorry trynatural would you purchase again  yes original review angela a california the taste was good i dont feel like it gave me more energy but it tasted good it was a good size as well would recommend and buy again for sure would you purchase

original review tim f california i drink a lot of coffee and a lot of energy drinks this was was pretty good it wasnt my favorite but i enjoyed it the flavor reminded me if two things at first it sort

sugar content then dont get the lite because the normal one is pretty good too the can packs a decent punch and the organic components of the product make me feel like im not wiring myself up on some synthetic creation that tastes like plastic the product isnt priced the most competitively but maybe that is because i purchased it at bristol farms i wouldnt be surprised if whole foods had it for a bit less i enjoyed my guru chilled but i totally see how it could be fine on the go at room temperature overall im happy with my guru experience would you purchase again  yes original review eliazar r

energy drink i have tried still not my favorite flavor but not bad i love that it is organic and does not have all of the artificial ingredients many other energy drinks have would you purchase again  yes original review valerie f california i dont usually buy traditional energy drinks because i prefer clean ingredients this guru energy drink is very clean its organic too and has very low calories i actually liked the taste a lot better than i thought i would but you can definitely taste the stevia its a little bitter but the lemon juice and added sugar help to balance that out i did not notice a huge lift in energy but it did perk me up at work id probably purchase this in the future to drink after lunchearly afternoon at work would you purchase again  yes original review courtney s california i really enjoyed the sustained healthy energy this drink provided other energy drinks contain scary amounts of caffeine and vitamin b like it could give you irregular heart rhythms scary which causes an energy crash this one takes a more natural approach the result is a productive pep that does not make you feel or seem like youre on crack and it doesnt cause a sudden drop in energy either the energizing ingredients are green tea extract guarana seed and ginseng there is also echinacea which is great for the immune system at first i found the stevia to be overwhelming but the berry flavor presumably from the luo han guo fruit kept me sipping i have a suspicion i would like the nonlite version a bit more but this drink is great for those who are used to the powerful sweetness of stevia would you purchase again  yes original review laura w california this seems to be a rarity of an energy drink that does not have awful additives in it it has no color and has a light refreshing texture and slightly sweet taste without being too much it has natural organic ingredients that provide energy rather than artificial ones and no sugar alcohols erythritol etc which usually cause me problems i therefore felt a nice natural energy boost without any discomfort loved it would you purchase again  yes original review alison e california it was easy to drink and i really like that the ingredients are organic the flavor is good with a slight vitamin aftertaste it has comparable amounts of caffeine to other brands of energy drinks with nonnatural ingredients overall it tasted good and i would buy it again would you purchase again  yes original review sheila t kansas while i occasionally consume energy drinks i often worry about the ingredients in conventional varieties which are often made up of chemicals that i can hardly pronounce and rarely recognize i wonder about the safety and potential effects on my health from those products and im also not particularly fond of the often strongly artificial taste as such i was really interested in learning about and trying out guru organic energy which is made up of organic ingredients and naturally occurring caffeine given that i avoid calories in drinks i chose the lite version to try and i was pleasantly surprised the flavor was different and although i wouldnt say it was delicious it was refreshing and not as aversive as other energy drinks ive tried i didnt feel a huge kick of energy but caffeine rarely has a tremendous effect on me and i did feel alert if not energetic overall i think the guru organic energy drink is a preferable choice for those looking for energy beverages over the typical energy drink laden with artificial ingredients although im not a regular connoisseur of energy drinks the next time i want one i will choose guru organic trynatural would you purchase again  yes original review ashley z california surprisingly good i wasnt expecting this drink to be lightly carbonatedit was a nice surprise flavor was good and it definitely gave noticeable energy i tried it before a workout in place of my preworkout drink i wouldnt replace my preworkout supplement it gave me a less focused energy but i would drink it if i needed a little pick me up throughout the day would you purchase again  yes original review phyllis c california i love the fruity fizzy taste and the amazing list of organic and natural ingredients best of all it doesnt give me the jitters like coffee would i could concentrate and get a lot of work done as im trying

the original guru and what i liked about this drink was that it didnt taste like a energy drink it was light and it didnt have that strong caffeine aftertaste the price is reasonable for bein g a usda verified drino which i think is very important i have already told my friends who lik energy drinks and they sell this product at my local bristol farms which is great thanks for the drink would you purchase again  yes original review tirza v california great taste and good energy level i did not feel jittery or have a crash afterwards like i have experienced with other products so glad theres no

unlike most stevia sweetened drinks the taste is well balanced with no bitter aftertaste theres a nice lemony flavor and the carbonation is onpoint i dont usually drink energy drinks but this one is an exception to the rule its organic low calorie nongmo and contains ingredients that i can actually trust another big bonus i noticed is that i did not experience a crash afterwards i read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturallyoccurring caffeine from green tea and guarana i dont know why you would drink any other energy drink than this definitely loading up on these again soon would you purchase again  yes original review rebecca h california this product is packed with good natural ingredients unlike most energy drinks out there and still packs the same amount of caffeine the flavor of this drink is somewhat like a gummy bear although just slightly watered down from the flavors of other energy drinks which i didnt mind i have tried other natural energy drinks in the past which did not agree with me however i did not have the same issues with this drink i really enjoyed it if there is one thing i could say about it is there wasnt any selection at the store i went to they had one flavor of the drink in one size the drink was also about a dollar more than comparable energy drinks i would be most likely to buy this product if they offered a multipack with a small discount would you purchase again  yes original review debbie z california good taste and no jittery feeling i will definitely recommend this drink to my friends only problem is that it should be

good tasting product the thing that stood out to me was that it tasted somewhat like redbull but with a more pleasing aftertaste it reminded me of cane sugar soda but much healthier there are g of

like the taste didnt feel jittery it gave me the energy i needed to stay awake for my trip that i drove all night and half the day would you purchase again  yes original review rebecca w california i am not a huge energy drink fan due to the usual caffeinated cough syrup taste and often shakey feeling afterwards however with guru i was actually pleasantly surprised it tasted much better than other

will definitely buy this again in the future would you purchase again  yes original review alex m california the guru energy drink is a great tasting alternative to other energy drinks im primarily a red bull fan but i got to try the guru energy drink it tastes a bit better than red bull but the crashes are way weaker the price is cheaper than red bull there are basically no downsides when compared to other energy drinks all in all  would buy again would you purchase again  yes original review flora r california this has to be the best energy drink that i have ever tasted it is a light crisp tangy citrus flavor that doesnt have a large aftertaste and gives me enough energy in the morning on my slow days would you purchase again  yes original review sophia h california i dont usually drink energy drinks or coffee because they make my heart race and i get shaky but with half a can of this drink i didnt feel overcaffeinated i liked that it is low in calories and organic but that also limits where i can buy it in the future i dont usually shop at sprouts or whole foods so this would only be something i would get when i rarely make it into those stores would you purchase again  yes original review laura c california the taste like gurus website describes is very indescribable it is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation the caffeine buzz is more natural it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out which is arguably awesome too in its own respect then big crash sort of feeling this is because the caffeine in guru is derived from mg of guaranine guarana herb rather than synthetically separated then added there is no mention about how much of the mg of guaranine is real caffeine but since red bull checks in at mg  oz it seems that guru is in pretty good shape would you purchase again  yes original review mary c california i tried the lite version and it has a nice fruity taste it tastes much better than other energy drinks on the market the price in the market is comparable to other brands would you purchase again  yes original review keyvan a california the drink tastes very good but the package is too smallneeds to be much bigger and fatterlike the size of a monster drink but a bit bigger would you purchase again  yes original review claudia c california guru energy drink has a good taste is

drinks every now and again i break down and purchase one as an alternative to my usual coffee but im not a big energy drink person i think of them as having a rather off taste and an unpleasant effect on my heartbeat this one surprisingly seemed to have neither of those it was fresh tasting if you can believe it and i found myself actually enjoying the flavor instead of merely tolerating it the one detractor is that it did not seem to supply quite the same kick as a normal energy drink the energy it did supply however came without heart palpitations or other unfortunate side effects and for that i am quite grateful i may not buy it often but next time i reach for an energy drink ill definitely reach for guru and i will not hesitate to suggest it to friends would you purchase again  yes
