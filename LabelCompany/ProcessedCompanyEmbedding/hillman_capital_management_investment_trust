administrator to the extent that the cost of administering the fund exceeds the  of average daily net assets paid by the fund to the administrator under its consolidated fee arrangement  the agreement continues in effect until january   and may not be terminated prior to that date   example this example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds  the example assumes that you invest  in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods  the example also assumes that your investment has a  return each year and the fund’s operating expenses remain the same  although your actual costs may be higher or lower based on these assumptions your costs would be    year  years  years  years       portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or “turns over” its portfolio  a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when the fund shares are held in a taxable account  these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the fund’s performance  during the most recent fiscal year the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio   principal investment strategies  in seeking to achieve its objective the fund invests primarily in common stocks of us companies which hillman capital management inc the “advisor” believes have qualitative and quantitative competitive advantages as described below and have temporarily fallen out of favor for reasons that are considered nonrecurring or shortterm whose value is not currently well known or whose value is not fully recognized by the public        in selecting investments for the fund the advisor first looks at qualitative measures of a company  qualitative measures of a company include   · dominance in a particular industry or niche market · management style and adaptability · strength of pricing and purchasing power · barriers to industry competition · strength of brand or franchise with commensurate brand loyalty and · quality of products and services   if certain companies meet most or all of the qualitative measures the advisor then seeks to identify which of those companies possess certain positive quantitative measures and which of those companies the advisor feels show superior prospects for growth  the advisor may make investments without regard to market capitalization  these companies may in the view of the advisor exhibit positive changes such as a promising new product new distribution strategy new manufacturing technology new management team or new management philosophy  these companies may also be responsible for technological breakthroughs andor unique solutions to market needs  the quantitative measures of a company include   · pricetobook ratio · present value of discounted projected cash flows · balance sheet strength · pricetosales ratio and · pricetoearnings ratio   the advisor allocates a target percentage of total portfolio value to each security it purchases  from time to time the fund may also focus the fund’s assets in securities of one or more particular sectors of the economy and may at times invest more than  of the fund’s net assets in a particular sector such as the financial healthcare retail and technology sectors  the advisor may sell a portfolio holding if the advisor believes that the price of the security is overvalued or to rebalance the security to the advisor’s targeted percentage of total portfolio value for that security   the advisor may also sell or “write” call and put options for the fund  besides generating additional income through the receipt of premiums the advisor will seek to sell options that obligate the fund to purchase or sell the underlying stock at a price believed to be attractive based on the qualitative and quantitative factors described above  for example call options may be written on a security held by the fund in order to collect the premium and establish a sale price for the security that the advisor believes to be attractive  put options may be written on a security in order to collect the premium and acquire the security at a price the advisor believes to be attractive  the fund will mostly engage in option transactions where with respect to a call option the fund holds the underlying security or with respect to a put option the fund holds cash and other liquid assets in an amount necessary to satisfy        the fund’s obligations if the option is exercised to the extent that the fund sells options the fund will comply with the applicable requirements of the investment company act of  including but not limited to section  thereof and relevant interpretive positions of the staff of the securities and exchange commission regarding the use of such instruments   principal risks of investing in the fund  an investment in the fund is subject to investment risks including the possible loss of some or all of the principal amount invested  there can be no assurance that the fund will be successful in meeting its investment objective  generally the fund will be subject to the following additional risks   ·   market risk  market risk refers to the possibility that the value of equity securities held by the fund may decline due to daily fluctuations in the securities markets   ·   management style risk  since different types of securities eg largecap midcap growth value etc tend to shift into and out of favor with stock market investors depending on market and economic conditions the performance of the fund may be better or worse than the performance of stock funds that focus on other types of stocks or have a broader investment style   ·   investment advisor risk  the advisor’s ability to choose suitable investments has a significant impact on the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objectives   ·   operating risk  the administrator and advisor have entered into an operating plan that facilitates the administrator’s assumption of the fund’s regular operating expenses under the fund accounting and administration agreement  the operating plan obligates the advisor to pay certain expenses of the fund in order to help limit its annual operating expenses  if the advisor however does not have sufficient revenue to support those expenses the advisor may be compelled to either resign or become insolvent  in addition if the fund incurs expenses in excess of those that the administrator has agreed to pay and the advisor is not able or willing to pay the excess costs those excess costs will increase the fund’s expenses   ·   nondiversified status risk  the fund is considered a nondiversified fund and therefore can invest a greater portion of its assets in securities of a single issuer or a limited number of issuers than a diversified fund which may make the fund more susceptible than a diversified fund to a single adverse economic or political occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers   ·   sector focus risk  the fund may at times be more heavily invested in certain sectors which may cause the value of its shares to be especially sensitive to factors and economic risks that specifically affect those sectors and may cause the fund’s share price to fluctuate more widely than the shares of a mutual fund that invests in a broader range of industries   ·   smallcap and midcap companies risk  investing in the securities of smallcap and midcap companies generally involves greater risk than investing in larger more established companies  this greater risk is in part attributable to the fact that the securities of these companies usually have more limited marketability and therefore may be more volatile and less liquid than securities of larger more established companies or the market averages in general   ·   risks from writing options  writing option contracts can result in losses that exceed the fund’s initial investment and may lead to additional turnover and higher tax liability  the risk involved in writing a call option is that an increase in the market value of the underlying security may result in the fund selling the security at a lower price than its current market value  writing call options also limits the opportunity to profit from an increase in the market value of the underlying security  the risk involved in writing a put option is that a decrease in the market value of the underlying security may result in the fund purchasing the security at a higher price than its current market value        performance information  the bar chart and table shown below provide an indication of the risks of investing in the fund by showing changes in the fund’s performance from year to year and by showing how the fund’s average annual total returns compare to those of a broadbased securities market index  the fund’s past performance before and after taxes is not necessarily an indication of how the fund will perform in the future  updated information on the fund’s results can be obtained by visiting wwwncfundscom calendar year returns       quarterly returns during this time period highest return for a quarter   quarter ended june   lowest return for a quarter  quarter ended december   average annual total returns period ended december   past  year past  years past  years before taxes after taxes on distributions after taxes on distributions and sale of shares          sp  total return index reflects no deductions for fees and expenses       aftertax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes  actual aftertax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown and are not applicable to investors who hold fund shares through taxdeferred arrangements such as an individual retirement account ira or k plan        management  hillman capital management inc is the investment advisor for the fund  mark a hillman is the fund’s portfolio

to accept purchase and redemption orders on its behalf  investors who wish to purchase or redeem fund shares through a brokerdealer should contact the brokerdealer directly   tax information  the fund’s distributions will generally be taxed to you as ordinary income or capital gains unless you are investing through a tax deferred arrangement such as a k plan or an individual retirement account  distributions on investments made through tax deferred vehicles such as k plans or iras may be taxed later upon withdrawal of assets from those accounts   financial intermediary compensation  if you purchase shares of the fund through a brokerdealer or other financial intermediary such as a bank the fund may pay the intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services  these payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the brokerdealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the fund over another investment  ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information        the fund   investment objective   the hillman focused advantage fund “focused advantage fund” seeks longterm capital appreciation  the focused advantage fund is a nondiversified series of the hillman capital management investment trust “trust”  the fund’s investment objective may be changed without shareholder approval     principal risks of investing in the fund   an investment in the fund is subject to investment risks including the possible loss of some or all of the principal amount invested  there can be no assurance that the fund will be successful in meeting its investment objective  generally the fund will be subject to the following additional risks   ·   market risk  market risk refers to the possibility that the value of equity securities held by the fund may decline due to daily fluctuations in the securities markets  stock prices change daily as a result of many factors including developments affecting the condition of both individual companies and the market in general  the price of a stock may even be affected by factors unrelated to the value or condition of its issuer such as changes in interest rates national and international economic andor political conditions and general equity market conditions  in a declining stock market prices for all companies including those in the fund’s portfolio may decline regardless of their longterm prospects  the fund’s performance per share will change daily in response to such factors   ·   management style risk  different types of securities tend to shift into and out of favor with stock market investors depending on market and economic conditions  the returns from the types of stocks purchased by the fund largecap midcap growth value etc may at times be better or worse than the returns from other types of stocks  each type of stock tends to go through cycles of performing better or worse than the stock market in general  the performance of the fund may thus be better or worse than the performance of stock funds that focus on other types of stocks or that have a broader investment style   ·   investment advisor risk  the advisor’s ability to choose suitable investments has a significant impact on the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objectives   ·   operating risk  the administrator and advisor have entered into an operating plan that facilitates the administrator’s assumption of the fund’s regular operating expenses under the fund accounting and administration agreement  the operating plan obligates the advisor to pay certain expenses of the fund in order to help limit its annual operating expenses  if the advisor however does not have sufficient revenue to support those expenses the advisor may be compelled to either resign or become insolvent  in addition if the fund incurs expenses in excess of those that the administrator has agreed to pay and the advisor is not able or willing to pay the excess costs those excess costs will increase the fund’s expenses   ·   smallcap and midcap companies risk  investing in the securities of smallcap and midcap companies generally involves greater risk than investing in larger more established companies  this greater risk is in part attributable to the fact that the securities of these companies usually have more limited marketability and therefore may be more volatile and less liquid than securities of larger more established companies or the market averages in general  because these companies normally have fewer shares outstanding than larger companies it may be more difficult to buy or sell significant amounts of such shares without an unfavorable impact on prevailing prices  another risk factor is that these companies often have limited product lines markets or financial resources and may lack management depth  these companies are typically subject to greater changes in earnings and business            prospects than are larger more established companies  in addition these companies may not be wellknown to the investing public may not be followed by the financial press or industry analysts and may not have institutional ownership  these factors affect the advisor’s access to information about the companies and the stability of the markets for the companies’ securities  these companies may be more vulnerable than larger companies to adverse business or economic developments the risk exists that the companies will not succeed and the prices of the companies’ shares could dramatically decline in value   ·   nondiversified status risk  the focused advantage fund is considered a nondiversified fund and therefore can invest a greater portion of its assets in securities of a single issuer or a limited number of issuers than a diversified fund  the focused advantage fund may be more susceptible than a diversified fund to a single adverse economic or political occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers and may experience increased volatility due to its investment in those securities  as a result changes in the market value of a single issuer could cause greater fluctuation in share price than would occur in a more diversified fund   ·   sector focus risk  another area of risk involves the potential focus of the focused advantage fund’s assets in securities of particular sectors  these sectors include the financial sector healthcare sector retail sector and technology sector  because the focused advantage fund’s investments may from time to time be more heavily invested in particular sectors the value of its shares may be especially sensitive to factors and economic risks that specifically affect those sectors  as a result the focused advantage fund’s share price may fluctuate more widely than the value of shares of a mutual fund that invests in a broader range of industries  additionally some of the sectors in which the focused advantage fund may invest could be subject to greater government regulation than other sectors and therefore changes in regulatory policies for those sectors may have a material effect on the value of securities issued by companies in those sectors  the specific risks for each of the sectors in which the focused advantage fund may focus its investments include additional risks as described below   ·   financial sector companies in this sector are subject to risks including extensive governmental regulation decreased profits resulting from changes in interest rates and loan losses which usually increase in economic downturns severe price competition and increased interindustry consolidation and competition all of which may adversely affect the value of those holdings   ·   healthcare sector  companies in this sector are subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims dependence on patent protection and expiration of patents competitive forces that make it difficult to raise prices long and costly regulatory processes and product obsolescence all of which may adversely affect the value of those holdings        ·   retail sector companies in this sector may be adversely affected by negative changes in the domestic and international economies interest rates competition consumer confidence disposable household income and consumer spending  these companies are also subject to severe competition and changes in demographics and consumer tastes which may have an adverse effect on the performance of these companies   ·   technology sector the performance of companies in this sector may be adversely affected due to the intense competition both domestically and internationally limited product lines markets financial resources or personnel rapid product obsolescence and frequent new product introduction dramatic and unpredictable changes in growth rates and dependence on patent and intellectual property rights   risks from writing options  writing option contracts can result in losses that exceed the fund’s initial investment and may lead to additional turnover and higher tax liability  the risk involved in writing a call option is that there could be an increase in the market value of the security  if this occurred the option could be exercised and the underlying security would then be sold by the fund at a lower price than its current market value  similarly while writing call options can reduce the risk of owning stocks such a strategy limits the opportunity of the fund to profit from an increase in the market value of stocks in exchange for upfront cash at the time of selling the call option  the risk involved in writing a put option is that there could be a decrease in the market value of the underlying security  if this occurred the option could be exercised and the underlying security would then be sold to the fund at a higher price than its current market value   there is no assurance that a liquid market will exist when the fund seeks to close out an option position  where a position in a written option is used as a hedge against price movements in a related position the price of the option may move more or less than the price of the related position  when the fund writes options the fund will comply with the applicable requirements of the investment company act of  and the guidance of noaction letters issued by the securities and exchange commission including investment company act release no  apr       other investment policies and risks   as a temporary defensive measure in response to adverse market economic political or other conditions or to meet liquidity redemption and shortterm investing needs the fund may from time to time determine that market conditions warrant investing in investmentgrade bonds us government securities repurchase agreements money market instruments and to the extent permitted by applicable law and the fund’s investment restrictions shares of other investment companies  under such circumstances the advisor may invest up to  of the fund’s assets in these investments  since investment companies investing in other investment companies pay management fees and other expenses relating to those investment companies shareholders of the fund would indirectly pay both the fund’s expenses and the expenses relating to those other investment companies with respect to the fund’s assets invested in such investment companies  to the extent the fund is invested for temporary defensive purposes it will not be pursuing and may not achieve its investment objective   an investment in the fund should not be considered a complete investment program  whether the fund is an appropriate investment for an investor will depend largely on hisher financial resources and individual investment goals and objectives  investors who engage in shortterm trading andor other speculative strategies and styles will not find the fund to be an appropriate investment vehicle if they want to invest in the fund for a short period of time          disclosure of portfolio holdings   the fund may from time to time make available

of brokers and dealers but may place portfolio transactions with brokers and dealers that promote or sell the fund’s shares so long as such transactions are done in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the trustees that are designed to ensure that the selection is based on the quality of execution and not on sales efforts   when placing portfolio transactions with a broker or dealer the advisor may aggregate securities to be sold or purchased for the fund with those to be sold or purchased for other advisory accounts managed by the advisor  in aggregating such securities the advisor will average the transaction as to price and will allocate available investments in a manner that the advisor believes to be fair and reasonable to the fund and such other advisory accounts  an aggregated order will generally be allocated on a pro rata basis among all participating accounts based on the relative dollar values of the participating accounts or using any other method deemed to be fair and reasonable to the fund and the participating accounts with any exceptions to such methods involving the trust being reported by the advisor to the trustees          the distributor   capital investment group inc “distributor” is the principal underwriter and distributor of the fund’s shares and serves as the fund’s exclusive agent for the distribution of the fund’s shares  the distributor may sell the fund’s shares to or through qualified securities dealers or others   distribution plans  the fund has adopted a distribution plan in accordance with rule b under the investment company act of  “distribution plan”  the distribution plan provides that the fund will compensate the distributor with assets attributable to the fund for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of fund shares or the servicing of those shares including to compensate entities for providing distribution and shareholder servicing with respect to those shares this compensation is commonly referred to as “b fees”  pursuant to the distribution plan the fund may annually pay the distributor up to  of its average daily net assets  because the b fees are paid out of

fund’s net asset value  the price at which you purchase or redeem shares is based on the next calculation of net asset value after an order is received subject to the order being accepted by the fund in good form  an order is considered to be in good form if it includes all necessary information and documentation related to a purchase or redemption request and if applicable payment in full of the purchase amount  the fund’s net asset value per share is calculated by dividing the value of the fund’s total assets less liabilities including fund expenses which are accrued daily by the total number of outstanding shares of that fund  the net asset value per share of the fund is normally determined at the time regular trading closes on the new york stock exchange currently  pm eastern time monday through friday except when the new york stock exchange closes earlier  the fund does not calculate net asset value on business holidays when the new york stock exchange is closed   the pricing and valuation of portfolio securities is determined in good faith in accordance with procedures established by and under the direction of the board of trustees  in determining the value of the fund’s total assets portfolio securities are generally valued at their market value by quotations from the primary market in which they are traded  instruments with maturities of  days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates market value  the fund normally uses third party pricing services to obtain market quotations  securities and assets for which representative market quotations are not readily available or which cannot be accurately valued using the fund’s normal pricing procedures are valued in good faith by either a valuation committee or the advisor in accordance with procedures established by and under the supervision of the board of trustees  fair value pricing may be used for example in situations where i a portfolio security is so thinly traded that there have been no transactions for that security over an extended period of time ii the exchange on which the portfolio security is principally traded closes early or iii trading of the portfolio security is halted during the day and does not resume prior to the fund’s net asset value calculation   pursuant to policies adopted by the board of trustees the advisor consults with the fund’s administrator on a regular basis regarding the need for fair value pricing  the advisor is responsible for notifying the board of trustees or the trust’s fair value committee when it believes that fair value pricing is required for a particular security  the fund’s policies regarding fair value pricing are intended to result in a calculation of the fund’s net asset value that fairly reflects portfolio security values as of the time of pricing  a portfolio security’s “fair value” price may differ from the price next available using the fund’s normal pricing procedures  if such fair value price differs from the price that would have been determined using the fund’s normal pricing procedures a shareholder may receive more or less proceeds or shares from redemptions or purchases of fund shares respectively than a shareholder would        have otherwise received if the security were priced using the fund’s normal pricing procedures  the performance of the fund may also be affected if a portfolio security’s fair value price were to differ from the security’s price using the fund’s normal pricing procedures  the fund may also not be able to receive the portfolio security’s fair value if the fund should sell the security  to the extent the fund invests in other openend investment companies that are registered under the investment company act of  the fund’s net asset value calculations are based upon the net asset value reported by such registered openend investment companies and the prospectuses for these companies explain the circumstances under which they will use fair value pricing

instructions on how to purchase or redeem shares of the fund          frequent purchases and redemptions   frequent purchases and redemptions “frequent trading” of shares of the fund may present a number of risks to other shareholders of the fund  these risks may include among other things dilution in the value of shares of the fund held by longterm shareholders interference with the efficient management by the advisor of the fund’s portfolio holdings and increased brokerage and administration costs  due to the potential of a thin market for the fund’s portfolio securities as well as overall adverse market economic political or other conditions affecting the sale price of portfolio securities the fund could face untimely losses as a result of having to sell portfolio securities prematurely to meet redemptions  current shareholders of the fund may face unfavorable impacts as portfolio securities concentrated in certain sectors may be more volatile than investments across broader ranges of industries  sectorspecific market or economic developments may make it more difficult to sell a significant amount of shares at favorable prices to meet redemptions  frequent trading may also increase portfolio turnover which may result in increased capital gains taxes for shareholders of the fund  these capital gains could include shortterm capital gains taxed at ordinary income tax rates   the trustees have adopted a policy that is intended to identify and discourage frequent trading by shareholders of the fund  under the fund’s policy the advisor has the discretion to refuse further purchase andor exchange orders from an investor if the advisor believes the investor has a pattern of frequent trading that the advisor considers not to be in the best interests of the other shareholders  to assist the advisor in identifying possible frequent trading patterns the fund’s transfer agent provides a daily record of the fund’s shareholder trades to the advisor  the fund’s transfer agent also assists the advisor in monitoring and testing shareholder purchase and redemption orders for possible incidents of frequent trading  under the fund’s policy regarding frequent trading the fund intends to limit investments from investor accounts that purchase and redeem shares over a period of less than ten days in which i the redemption amount is within ten percent of the previous purchase amounts ii the redemption amount is greater than  and iii two or more such redemptions occur during a  calendar day period  in the event such a purchase and redemption pattern occurs an investor account and any other account with the same taxpayer identification number will be precluded from investing in that fund including investments that are part of an exchange transaction for at least  calendar days after the redemption transaction   this policy is intended to apply uniformly except that the fund may not be able to identify or determine that a specific purchase andor redemption is part of a pattern of frequent trading or that a specific investor is engaged in frequent trading particularly with respect to transactions made through accounts such as omnibus accounts or accounts opened through thirdparty financial intermediaries such as brokerdealers and banks “intermediary accounts”  therefore this policy is not applied to omnibus accounts or intermediary accounts  omnibus account arrangements permit multiple investors        to aggregate their respective share ownership positions and to purchase redeem and exchange shares of the fund without the identity of the particular shareholders being known to the fund  like omnibus accounts intermediary accounts normally permit investors to purchase redeem and exchange shares of the fund without the identity of the underlying shareholder being known to the fund  accordingly the ability of the fund to monitor and detect frequent trading through omnibus accounts and intermediary accounts would be very limited and there would be no guarantee that the fund could identify shareholders who might be engaging in frequent trading through such accounts or curtail such trading  the policy will also not apply if the advisor determines that a purchase and redemption pattern is not a frequent trading pattern intended to respond to shortterm fluctuations in the securities markets such as inadvertent errors that result in frequent purchases and redemptions  inadvertent errors shall include purchases andor redemptions made unintentionally or by mistake eg where an investor unintentionally or mistakenly invests in the fund and redeems immediately after recognizing the error  the investor shall have the burden of proving to the sole satisfaction of the advisor that a frequent purchase and redemption pattern was a result of an inadvertent error  in such a case the advisor may choose to allow further purchase andor exchange orders for such investor account   intermediaries may apply frequent trading policies that differ from those described in this prospectus  in you invest with the fund through an intermediary please read that firm’s program materials carefully to learn of any rules or fees that may apply   although the fund has have taken steps to discourage frequent trading of the fund’s shares there is no guarantee that such trading will not occur        other important information   dividends distributions and taxes   the following information is meant as a general summary for us taxpayers  additional tax information appears in the statement of additional information  shareholders should rely on their own tax advisors for advice about the particular federal state and local tax consequences of investing in the fund   the fund will distribute most of its income and realized gains to shareholders every year  dividends paid by the fund derived from net investment income if any will generally be paid monthly or quarterly and capital gains distributions if any will be made at least annually  shareholders may elect to take dividends from net investment income or capital gains distributions if any in cash or reinvest them in additional fund shares  although the fund will not be taxed on amounts it distributes shareholders will generally be taxed on distributions regardless of whether distributions are paid by the fund in cash or are reinvested in additional fund shares  such distributions may be taxed as ordinary income or capital gains which may be taxable at different rates depending on the length of time the fund held its assets  distributions may be subject to state and local taxes as well as federal taxes   in general a shareholder who sells or redeems shares will realize a capital gain or loss which will be longterm or shortterm depending upon the shareholder’s holding period for the fund shares  an exchange of shares may be treated as a sale and any gain may be subject to tax   as with all mutual funds the fund may be required to withhold us federal income tax at the fourth lowest rate for taxpayers filing as unmarried individuals presently  for all taxable distributions payable to shareholders who fail to provide the fund with their correct taxpayer identification numbers or to make required certifications or who have been notified by the irs that they are subject to backup withholding  backup withholding is not an additional tax rather it is a way in which the irs ensures it will collect taxes otherwise due  any amounts withheld may be credited against a shareholder’s us federal income tax liability   shareholders should consult with their own tax advisors to ensure that distributions and sale of fund shares are treated appropriately on their income tax returns     benchmark
