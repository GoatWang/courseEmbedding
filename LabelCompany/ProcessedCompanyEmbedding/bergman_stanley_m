morning everyone and thank you for joining us today we are pleased to report record first quarter financial results we believe the markets we serve are generally healthy and growing and that our global dental animal health and medical groups all continue to gain market share and that the trajectory will continue we remain quite comfortable with our strategies with respect to gaining market share on the bottom line we delivered strong yearoveryear diluted eps growth for the quarter and are affirming guidance for  diluted eps given our customer focus and our diverse business model we believe we are well positioned for longterm growth while some markets will grow faster than others at a particular point in time we believe we serve attractive end markets with solid opportunities for growth in the years to come as we continue to advance our valueadded solutions to help our customers operate better practices more efficient practices and at the same time provide quality in care our focus remains firmly on continued financial execution and in connection value creation for our shareholders in a moment ill provide some additional comments on our recent business performance and accomplishments but first let me turn to steve who will review our financial results for the quarter thank you steven paladino  henry schein inc okay thank you stan and good morning to all as we begin id like to point out that there were no restructuring costs in the first quarter of  however our prior year first quarter results included restructuring costs of  million pretax or approximately  per diluted share i will be discussing our results on an asreported or gaap basis as well as on a nongaap basis which excludes the prior year restructuring costs we believe the nongaap financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics used by management in operating our business these nongaap financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding gaap measures you can see exhibit b on this mornings earnings release for a reconciliation of gaap to nongaap financial data so turning to our results our net sales for the quarter ended april   were  billion reflecting a  increase compared with the first quarter of  this consisted of  growth in local currencies and a  decline related to foreign currency exchange in local currencies internally generated sales increased  and acquisition growth was  you could also see the details of our sales growth that are contained in exhibit a of our earnings news release issued today if you look at our operating margin for the first quarter of  it was  and it expanded by  basis points compared with the first quarter of  id like to provide some additional details with respect to our operating margin expansion for the quarter first it relates to the inclusion of restructuring costs in last years first quarter of  the restructuring costs in the prior year favorably impacted our operating margin comparison by  basis points and the second item relates to acquisitions completed during the past  months and related expenses as well as switches between agency and direct sales which combined to negatively impact the expansion by  basis points so if you were to exclude the net impact of these two items our operating margin expanded by  basis points for the quarter our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was  and that compares to  in the first quarter of  as we mentioned during our q earnings conference call we have implemented asu  which is a new accounting standard that requires excess tax benefits related to share appreciation of stock grants to be recognized as a reduction in income tax expense in the period in which the awards vest as a result our effective tax rate was favorably impacted in the first quarter as this is when most of our stockbased awards vest at henry schein this standard will primarily impact q each year and will have varying effects on our tax rate based on the share price and number of shares that vest we previously provided guidance for q  stating that that benefit would result in an effective tax rate in the range of  to  however the actual benefit was more favorable and our effective tax rate for the quarter was  as a result we are revising our fiscal year effective tax rate guidance from somewhere in the  range down to the  range our net income attributable to henry schein was  million or  per diluted share and that represents increases of  and  respectively and thats compared to the first quarter of  gaap results the net income attributable to henry schein inc and diluted eps for the first quarter of  increased  and  respectively when compared to the first quarter of  nongaap results which excludes the restructuring costs in the prior year ill note that foreign exchange negatively impacted our diluted eps for the quarter by approximately  per share were also reaffirming our guidance on a full year basis but expect q diluted eps growth to be in the midsingle digit range with growth accelerating in the second half of the year ill now provide some detail on our sales results for the quarter our dental sales for the first quarter of  increased  to  billion internally generated sales in local currencies were up  acquisitions contributed an additional  and there was a  decrease related to foreign exchange in north america our internal sales growth in local currencies was  and included  growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and a  decline in dental equipment sales and service revenue for the past few quarters our north american consumable merchandise growth rate was impacted by the decision to stop selling precious metals in last years second quarter this decision negatively impacted our north american dental consumable merchandise sales growth in q by approximately  basis points this impact has now annualized and will not affect our dental merchandise growth rate going forward without this impact we estimate that the  growth rate to be approximately  i think its also important to note that consumable merchandise sales growth is somewhat favorably impacted by an easier comparable versus q of last year this is because the december  holiday week was included in q  that week is generally a slower week for consumable merchandise sales and a stronger week for equipment due to yearend tax incentives the decline in north american dental equipment was primarily due to this difficult comparison as well as an acceleration of sales into the previous quarter related to the section  tax incentive the difficult calendar comparison will only occur in this q and its important to note that our current equipment backlog is strong and we anticipate at least midsingle digit growth in q for our north american dental equipment sales our international dental internal growth in local currencies were  included  growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and  growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue the international dental merchandise sales growth benefited from the same comparison that i just reviewed as well as internationally an extra day in a number of european countries this extra day is due to the timing of good friday which is a holiday in many countries and that occurred in q last year and this year will occur in q on an overall basis we believe we continue to outpace the global dental market in q and we believe the fundamentals of our business strategy remain strong turning to animal health our animal health sales were  million in the first quarter an increase of  internally generated sales in local currencies were up  acquisitions contributed an additional  and there was a  decrease due to foreign exchange the  internal growth in local currencies included  growth in north america and  growth internationally if you look at the sales growth from certain products that switched between agency sales and direct sales in north america that positively impacted our growth rate by approximately  basis points for the quarter these results were solid and as we – and we believe we continue to gain market share on a global animal health turning to medical our medical sales was  million in the first quarter an increase of  sales growth in local currencies was  all internally generated and  decrease due to foreign exchange the  growth included  growth in north america and growth of  in local currencies internationally we are pleased with our medical growth which was driven by sales increases with several idns that we started onboarding in the middle of last year as well as strong organic growth from existing customers we believe we continue to gain market share in our overall medical business technology and valueadded services sales were  million in the quarter an increase of  sales growth in local currencies was  all internally generated and  decrease related to foreign exchange the  growth included  growth in north america and  growth internationally in north america the  growth reflects some softness in financial services revenue and this is related to lower north american dental equipment sales and as people know we have leasing revenues related to north american dental equipment so it follows the overall equipment revenue cycle in the international markets sales of  were highlighted by strong software revenue in the uk and australia new zealand we continue to repurchase common stock in the open market for the first quarter specifically we repurchased approximately  shares during the quarter at an average price of  per share and that equated to approximately  million this impact of the repurchase of our shares in the first quarter was not material to our eps at the close of the first quarter henry schein had approximately  million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock we believe we will continue to drive increased shareholder value with a smart capital allocation strategy which is focused on deploying a large portion of our annual free cash flow to both share repurchases and ma activities if we look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter our operating cash flow for the quarter was negative  million but that is better than the negative  million in the prior years first quarter and as i think people know our first quarter cash flow was typically negative due to seasonality of working capital during the quarter for the year we continue to believe well have strong operating cash flow accounts receivable days sales outstanding was  days for the first quarter compared to  days in last years first quarter our inventory turns for the first quarter were  turns and thats essentially unchanged versus last year in addition ill note that we recently amended our revolving credit facility increasing the maximum borrowing amount by  million from  million to  million and extended the term through  this facility supports our longterm internal and acquisition growth strategies while maintaining a strong capital structure ill now conclude my remarks by affirming our  financial guidance diluted eps attributable to henry schein is expected to be  to  for  that guidance reflects growth of  to  compared to the gaap  diluted eps and  to  compared to the nongaap diluted eps which excludes restructuring costs in the prior year let me remind you that fiscal  include one less week than fiscal  ill also note that guidance for  diluted eps attributable to henry schein is for current continuing operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of potential future acquisitions if any and guidance also assumes that foreign exchange rates for our major international businesses are generally consistent with current levels with that id like to turn the call back to stanley stanley m bergman  henry schein inc thank you steven let me begin my review of our four business groups with the dental group we believe we continue to gain market share in our global dental business in the first quarter in north america our dental consumable merchandise internal sales growth was  in local currency which was the highest quarterly growth rate in the past several quarters we estimate the  growth rate to be approximately  when adjusting for the impact of precious metals in the quarter of course i think as steven mentioned the impact of the holiday and the holidays actually – and that should be taken into account that but overall we continue to be very pleased and believe with our consumable dental sales in north america believe that we continue to gain market share in this area while north american equipment internal sales in local currencies declined for the reasons which steven explained our equipment backlog for the second quarter of  is strong which we believe indicates a resumption in the yearoveryear growth we believe that dentists are in fact investing in their practices and this of course is good for our equipment business as part of our ongoing efforts to advance our leadership position in the dental equipment and specialty dental – specifically the digital dentistry we are pleased to announce that we entered into a threeyear agreement with dentsply sirona effective september   to distribute dentsply sironas full line of dental equipment in the united states as you may know we are the leading distributor of dentsply sirona dental equipment in european markets today and we are also a leading supplier of dentsply consumable merchandise around the world dentsply sirona and henry schein have been excellent business partners for decades and we are pleased to expand this longstanding and successful relationship of course our commitment to our dental customers has always been to offer a broad selection of products including equipment consumables and valueadded services that enable our customers to provide highquality care to their patients while realizing greater practice efficiency well this agreement with dentsply sirona henry schein will offer dentist and dental laboratories in the united states a greater selection of digital dental equipment solutions with a full range of the dentsply sirona equipment including the leading cerec brand of cadcam product the addition of this dental product line combined with the products manufactured by our other valued equipment supplier partners further this commitment by henry schein to providing greater access to the broadest range of highquality dental equipment products our dental platform accented on offering our customers choice across a number of highquality dental equipment systems that most importantly are interoperable henry scheins practice solutions software platform adding the full dentsply sirona equipment product line rounds up an excellent suite of digital technology solutions offered by henry schein to help dentist advance their practice in the digital age there is a huge opportunity to expand the digitalization of dentistry and we are very very pleased with our offering our expanded offering and the work weve done in the past with those existing suppliers that have provided henry schein with digital technology in addition to the dentsply sirona equipment products we will continue to represent products from planmeca shape and m as well as the dental equipment and consumer product lines of our longstanding partner danaher under the kavo kerr brands due to the timing of the agreements with dentsply sirona and initial trading startup expenses henry schein expects that earnings related to this agreement will be neutral to our  financial results and accretive in years thereafter in  and  and beyond we are of course excited to expand our partnership with dentsply sirona as we broaden our digital dentistry product offering with the highly respected global brands associated with dentsply sirona we believe that today together henry schein and dentsply sirona will help accelerate the adoption of dental and dentistry for the ultimate benefit of patients in the united states and actually around the world so were very pleased with this arrangement – this new arrangement to deepen our offering of products and very pleased with the relationship that weve had over the years with sirona in europe and with dentsply around the world this only aligns our business interest even further but at the same time expand the offering that we provide to our customers and therefore it is good for the american dentists at the recent ids show in germany there were innovative patientoriented solutions on display representing the continued evolution of the integrated digital workflows in the dental office henry schein announced our expansion of shape digital impressions scanner offering in germany we experienced continued yearoveryear growth of our global dental scanner products during the first quarter of  and we will continue to offer a broad set of cadcam and other equipment solutions offering customers technological advancements that drive efficiency and of course highquality dentistry as we believe the potential for growth over time in this segment of the market – the digital segment is significant so were very very excited with the digitalization of dentistry expansion of our offering and in fact our position in the marketplace of advancing the introduction of digital technology to dentists in this country and of course abroad at ids we also introduced camlog serolog implant system including a full range of ceramic implant products ceramic implants meet the growing customer demand for aesthetics metalfree materials the combination of the aesthetics and the metalfree materials we believe will be important to implant dentists and we believe that camlog is well positioned to yet introduce another area of advancement in dentistry with its twopiece design serolog products enable greater flexibility for restorations with this material we believe ceramic implant products have the potential to grow significantly and become a disruptive technology given the benefits for the patients oral care our connectdental and dedicam digital platform support dentist and laboratories in their efforts integrate digital technology into each dental clinical workflow for restorative dentistry at the core of these platforms thats the connectdental and dedicam and actually the bulk of the platform biohorizons side is a wide breadth of products of flexibility of open architecture so practices can choose the solutions that best meet their needs also relative to our dental business as mentioned on our last earnings call and of course in the press releases that weve issued we recently closed on the acquisition of southern anesthesia  surgical or sas as commonly known in the marketplace which offers surgical supplies and pharmaceuticals to approximately  oral surgeons dentists and of course dental anesthesiologists and periodontists across the us sas had  sales of  million and will be an excellent addition to our product offering targeting the needs of dental surgeons we have already good penetration at the henry schein level and also at the ace level so we have three excellent brands to advance our work with oral surgeons whether it is in general oral surgery or in the implant arena so very very pleased with performance of our global dental business very pleased with the expansion of the relationship with the dentsply sirona company and very happy to report good progress with all of our other major suppliers in general whether it is in the united states or on a global basis now let me turn to the animal health side while the animal health growth in north america did moderate during the quarter our internal international growth in local currencies was a multiyear high our animal health strategy is to deliver excellent solutions to support at prices that reflect the value we provide our customers rely on the products and services we offer including our robust and clearly differentiated software platforms all of which facilitate the delivery of quality care by veterinarians throughout the world in january we announced our entry into the brazilian animal health market with a  investment in tecnew a privately held distributor of animal health products tecnew serves about  customers in brazil and had  sales of approximately  million also during the first quarter the north american veterinary conference was held in orlando there we did launch a new samsungbranded diagnostic chemistry instrument with bidirectional functionality and a full body of digital radiography solution from canon we also introduced our new sparkline software dashboard which integrates with our practice management software to identify key performance metrics such as revenue growth and customer retention these products were well received as we endeavor to offer our customers a prescript approach that specifically targets the needs of their practices we believe that our animal health business in the united states and abroad continues to do well working well with our major suppliers and are confident that well continue to gain market share on this side of the business now let me talk about the medical business a little bit our medical business delivered doubledigit sales growth in the first quarter this reflects particularly strong patient traffic to physician offices particularly related to the late flu season as well as our continued execution in serving the market as its consolidating among large group practices including the integrated delivery network we are wellpositioned to help primary care practices and ambulatory surgical centers operate efficiently so our customers can focus on patient outcomes we believe that promoting wellness and prevention is key to the future of improving the healthcare landscape and that is precisely the part of healthcare that our customers are engaged with in line with helping physicians provide better clinical care we recently announced an exclusive distribution agreement with rijuven to sell its cardiosleeve diagnostic device to medical practitioners cardiosleeve is the worlds first stethoscope attachment that provides electrocardiogram and heart data via bluetooth for instant analysis another reflection of the digitalization of healthcare and area that we are highly committed to advancing this product is an excellent example of our expansion of innovative medical devices in our portfolio that we are helping doctors provide effective treatment and more efficient care we expect to continue to offer our customers this expanding suite of innovative medical device solutions again very pleased not only with our dental and animal health performance but on the medical side as well technology and valueadded services components although we saw some softness in the north american technology and valueadded services internal sales growth for this quarter were pleased with our performance in electronic services sales area most of which is reoccurring revenue as we continue to penetrate our customer base for these valueadded services as steven mentioned our technology and valueadded services sales had strong doubledigit growth and was of course slightly impacted by the level of financial services revenue but in general we are very pleased with the performance of this group and specifically as it relates to the recurring revenue electroniccommerce part of the business and of course enhancing our technology solutions offering is an important initiative as we empower our customers more with the tools we provide them to help boost productivity and yes improve efficiency in the practice so before we take the questions id like to note a couple of other highlights for the quarter in february we celebrated together with american dental association foundation the th annual give kids a smile program this is an initiative to which dental teams provide free oral care and education to underserved children across the us it is estimated that nearly  underserved children received free oral health screenings education and treatment under this program each year care is delivered by more than  dental volunteers including  dentists to use our healthcare products donated by henry schein and our suppliers were very pleased with this longstanding partnership with american dental association a true publicprivate partnership which at the end of the day advances the needs of society while enhancing the henry schein brand in march henry schein was recognized by ethisphere institute as a  worlds most ethical company marking the sixth consecutive year we received this recognition the ethisphere institute is a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices it is truly an honor to be recognized among some of the worlds most respected businesses for our commitment to ethical business practices and of course corporate social responsibility with those comments operator we are now ready to take questions questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from the line of jon block of stifel jonathan block  stifel nicolaus  co inc great thanks guys and good morning ill try to keep it to two real tight ones steven the first one on the tax rate of  i believe that gives you roughly an extra  for the year but not moving the guidance so maybe if you can just give some thoughts on the level of conservatism for the year and is that  tax rate the right one to extrapolate out to  and beyond and then stanley ill take a shot here in terms of when you mentioned net neutral to  the deal with dentsply sirona but accretive in  any sense in the level of accretion in  and beyond if – not specific in terms of eps just maybe some more detailed thoughts there thanks guys steven paladino  henry schein inc okay ill take the first part of your question so on the current year still early in the year versus our guidance its probably about  improved versus our guidance remember we said  to  effective tax rate going into the quarter for q came in at  so that represents approximately  i would say we have a relatively wide range of  in our guidance its early in the year there are a number of puts and takes including foreign exchange that we need to keep a watchful eye on so at this point we felt that the prudent thing was to just reaffirm guidance and not to change guidance at this time and lets see how the year progresses with respect to our tax rate going forward so its a little bit difficult to quantify i would expect that we should still see a similar benefit in future years but remember it depends on two key factors for us first factor is the stock appreciation which is hard to estimate and the second factor for us is because a number of our shares are performance based how many shares actually vest based on the performance so it might not be quite the same impact in future years because we had a very favorable on both of those counts this year but we would expect that there would still be a tax benefit in each q going forward again may not be quite as great as what we saw this year stanley m bergman  henry schein inc so on the impact of adding the dentsply sirona line first this year there will be significant expenses in bringing on board a comprehensive line this will entail of course a tremendous amount of education and training taking our salespeople and our technicians out to the field and of course adding some additional team members for capacity so the impact of that is factored into the guidance that steven has rendered as it relates to next year and beyond we remain very excited with henry scheins key strategy to advance digital dentistry on a global basis we think that digital dentistry will increase the efficiency of the practice while at the same time providing better quality in healthcare better quality of oral care in the dental practice we cannot give you the direct impact on the expansion of the strategy and we believe that by adding the dentsply sirona equipment line to our business we will in fact expand our strategy and expand our strategy even faster as we implement the – as we expand the line and implement further our plans on digital dentistry but i think it would be premature to provide a direct impact on the line and in fact on introducing the line i dont think its a good idea for us to talk about the impact of any specific supplier rather than talk about the category and we will of course report back to the extent we can on the impact of digital dentistry on our overall business and that has been pretty good for the last few years we have introduced many many dentist with digital technology specifically through our scanner lines and i might add some full chair side units as well while at the same time servicing the needs from a digital transformation point of view of dental labs throughout the world where we believe we are the biggest provider of products that is the dental labs operator your next question comes from the line of robert jones goldman sachs robert patrick jones  goldman sachs  co thanks for the question and just to follow up appreciate youre somewhat limited obviously stanley what you can say about the new agreement with dentsply sirona but i just wanted to maybe ask a more strategic question around the new arrangement should we anticipate any change in your gotomarket strategy if i think about the us market kind of post you having access to this product line there are arguably less differentiation between your product portfolio and your largest competitors so just curious if theres any change that you foresee in the sales force and their gotomarket strategy and i guess just related to that should we expect any disruption in your sales force as they take on this new portfolio stanley m bergman  henry schein inc i dont – i think its a very good question but i dont think much changes from a gotomarket strategy we have been building our digital technology capacity for the last four years perhaps even five years and our goal is to provide the best comprehensive solution to dentists of course theres a significant tiein to our practice solutions software which over the years has moved from being an accounting system to a clinical solution theres a lot going on in that area weve invested heavily a lot of those expenses are run through the valueadded services component of our pl which is shown separately weve added the ascend software in the area of cloudbased software these have been significant expenses and they all tie in one way or another to our digital equipment interoperability is something thats important for henry schein on the equipment side now for several years so i dont think much changes in our strategy we will continue to add more resources into this area we have added more resources over the last few years and well continue to do that of course by expanding our offering we will now have more competitive offering although i might hasten to add that our existing suppliers provide us with good products but the cerec brand is clearly the innovator perceived as the innovator and has been an innovator in this space for a long long time we do well with the cerec brand in europe but i think it is important to realize that henry schein is committed to differentiating ourselves to the valueadded services we offer to our customers so theres a lot more than a particular brand or a particular product of course were happy to have excited to have the dentsply sirona equipment line but its the valueadded service and the tiein with our practice solutions and other valueadded services that is the differentiator i dont think there will be disruptions in our sales force this is an exciting product to add but it will not be significant material as it relates to our total dental business of  billion or so so it is an important line were excited we think we can partner very well with dentsply sirona we have a lot of other manufacturers that we do well with everybody in dentistry every manufacturer understands the importance of digital dentistry everybody is committed to this and we look forward to working with a broader array of suppliers albeit the dentsply sirona equipment line is an outstanding line and i dont think we will have disruption either with our suppliers or with our customers and i think we will have steady growth in this area of digital dentistry as weve experienced over the last year operator your next question comes from the line of jeff johnson robert baird jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc thank you good morning guys so stanley and steven let me just ask one other question on the dentsply relationship if i could steve you were talking about it being neutral for the back half of this year accretive thereafter you will have expenses early on just from a gating standpoint should we think of the expenses really kind of coming in third quarter and then some revenue offsetting the expenses in the fourth quarter so just want to make sure we set up our models appropriately or between the third quarter expense and fourth quarter benefit maybe mixed steven paladino  henry schein inc yeah so remember the agreement does not start until september  so no revenues can be recognized by us before september  so i would say that – and itll take a little bit of time for us to build an order book on the product line so i dont think right outofthebox were going to be going at  i would say that what well also see some expenses in the same quarter starting a little bit before the september  date to train the sales force and do things like that but well start seeing it in the same quarter but were not looking at really any significant quarterly impact for q and q were trying really to have it relatively neutral in each quarter although it might be a little bit negative in the first quarter q versus q we havent given guidance going forward i dont know we feel comfortable it will be accretive and i think you have to give us a little bit of time to see later this year how we do in order to really have some specificity on the impact of it while were very excited remember we also support other manufacturers so there will be a net impact that we have to look at for us there are product categories that were selling other manufacturers but the net impact was supposed to be positive and again were pleased to have the dentsply sirona line in place now operator your next question comes from the line of john kreger william blair john c kreger  william blair  co llc hi thanks very much how does your dental implant line do in the quarter and then stanley may be more broadly what were your observations coming of ids just curious what you view as sort of any key innovations coming out of that show that you think could be the more profound growers for the industry over the next three four years thanks stanley m bergman  henry schein inc yeah and steven will give you information on the implant line to the extent we actually provide that data because we generally do not provide category growth having said that steven provides color please remember that we have an implant business and then we have businesses that provide products around the implant and when you compare performances of us to others remember that the implant companies are showing a broad line of products not only implants but products around the implant so its very hard to compare our performance but generally we are very pleased with our oral surgeon business for implants for bone regenerations products and the products around the implants the second question was  john c kreger  william blair  co llc just strategically on the implant line how the market is doing stanley m bergman  henry schein inc yeah well i think the market for implants is growing quite nicely throughout the world i would say that its pretty good in the us europe is a bit more muted but the developing world is growing significantly so i think its a good area to be in and perhaps the most exciting part of the implant business and i would say thats with all the specialties is an investment by specialists in digital technology be it in the prosthetic side or in the imaging side so specialists generally are investing more in the practices because of course they have the earning power and this is driving our equipment sales throughout the world steven paladino  henry schein inc and just to give you a little color on our overall performance for implants and this is excluding – its really just the implants not the products around the implants on a worldwide basis we grew in the midsingle digits or slightly higher than that overall with stronger growth in the us and slightly less growth internationally and overall we think that we at least maybe outpaced the market by a little bit in the quarter stanley m bergman  henry schein inc you also asked about ids i think there was a customary amount of new products i dont think it was extraordinary from the point of view of new products from a sales point of view they were very good for henry schein germany and the countries around germany because generally orders are placed by dentists from those countries its not an order booking business on a global basis of course there were distributors and manufacturers that come to the show from around the world but from an order point of view its really a germany austria may be the netherlands and a little bit extra and we did well from that point of view of course the area of greatest focus was the cadcam area we saw some advances in scanners molds  and i think all are more or less in line with what we shared on previous calls the whole cadcam area is getting better in terms of capabilities efficiencies and its becoming more affordable so from that point of view there was a lot showing there from henry schein point of view were very pleased with our advancements the offering an expanded offering the technology advancements on the implant side but overall i would say it was a solid meeting from an attendants point of view pretty okay from products but i wouldnt say a revolutionary show from a product innovation point of view operator your next question comes from the line of steven valiquette bofa merrill lynch steven j valiquette  bank of america merrill lynch thanks good morning stan and steve impressive results and also congrats on the new sirona dental equipment deal which i also have a question on so i guess at a high level is there perhaps any extra color that youre able to give around the magnitude of under penetration of cerec in particular into the legacy henry schein distribution customers in the us relative to the overall us market penetration rates for cerec im sure youve done plenty of studies on this but just wonder if youre able to share anything thanks stanley m bergman  henry schein inc sure there are more studies on this area than probably fact but it is clear theres a highly underpenetrated area i think that the number of dentists that either have a scanner or a full service is relatively small its probably under  some say its as low as  some say its  doesnt matter because theres  of dentists that dont have digital prosthetics in any way any form at all so we think its as an exciting market as the digital imaging markets and weve done very well in that market with lots more to go because we still have a lot of dentist that have wet xrays in their practices so digital imaging is an exciting market its a bit more penetrated actually quite a bit more penetrated than the prosthetics but the prosthetics is really an open market and for those that even may have bought a cerec it may have been bought with an older version so theres lots of opportunity for selling cerec to customers that dont have it and to customers that wish to have a newer version but at the same time we also see opportunities for some of the other manufacturers on the scanning side scanonly side and thats not only in the dental practice but in the dental lab practice and it will be exciting opportunities also in the milling arena anticipate that therell be some exciting opportunities from a number of manufacturers in the milling area and also im sure that from sirona so this is in generally a very exciting category and the advancement in blocks is exciting so the digitalization of dentistry which we spoke about six years or seven years ago from a prosthetics point of view is really going to be an area that is going to help henry schein grow our dental business in the future as we advanced the connectivity between our practice management software digital imaging digital prosthetics and improving the entire work stream in the office to drive more efficiency and better healthcare operator your next question comes from the line of stephen hagan of deutsche bank stephen r hagan  deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning thanks for the question in international dental did you see a pause in the equipment sales ahead of ids and equipment sales were still up  despite this or was the strength because of fewer dentists waited for ids than expected and also what are the particular geographies that drove the strength in international dental stanley m bergman  henry schein inc ill let steven answer the second component i mean we had – as i think i mentioned we had a very good ids from the order taking point of view but i would say that that was specifically related to germany and to austria a little bit in the netherlands because generally customers dont come to buy from beyond those markets perhaps a little bit from eastern europe but not much overall we had a good quarter in the equipment business and in our international markets i think that that was mostly related to countries outside of the germanic speaking countries where we are doing well with equipment in europe so i think you have to bifurcate the market a bit you have to look at the germanic countries and the rest of europe and there was of course in the germanic countries although it was a decent quarter and i think at least from our point of view we expect to have decent sales in the second quarter in the germanic countries and dont really see much of a pause in our growth in our international business in general steven paladino  henry schein inc yeah and ill just reiterate what stanley said really the softness which was probably related to ids was in the germanic countries but it was offset somewhat – more than somewhat was offset by other parts of our international dental business and thats typical you dont typically see people going to ids to buy equipment from for example the uk really its germany and the surrounding countries where the purchasing habits buying equipment although people may come from all over the world just to see the different types of equipment so again were expecting a bit of a pickup in germany but that will be muted by some of the other countries that were very strong also in q operator we do have time for one more question david larsen of leerink partners matt dellelo  leerink partners llc hey guys its matt in for dave congrats on a strong quarter just want to ask about a couple areas you mentioned relatively slower animal health is there anything to read into the growth moderation there or is that just seasonal in north america and then any other color on the relative softness in technology for the quarter or is that also just seasonal or cyclical stanley m bergman  henry schein inc i dont think you should read anything into the numbers in the animal health arena in north america there were some switching around some suppliers in particular supplier between us and the competitor there were some switching between agency and gaap booking of the full sales we continue to believe that were doing very well in the companion area of animal health from a consumable point of view general consumables pharma equipment the holidays theres so many different things that go into this but i think if you take a look at any particular four quarters in our animal health you will see that i think were gaining market share and the business is doing very well we did have our national sales meeting during the quarter it was a very good sales meeting i dont know the extent it impacted sales but overall our animal health is doing well on the technology side the core leading indicator we look at is in the ecommerce arena and the various kinds of transactions we undertake on behalf of our customers i think thats all very good solid you have to also look at the financial revenue primarily leasing from our financial services business which was a little bit weaker taking into account that our sales on a comparable basis on equipment were a little lower but i would not read anything into it and – nor would i assume that doubledigit sales growth on the medical side of our business is normal i think we are very pleased with our internal growth for the company of  which take a guess is anywhere between  times to  times the market growth were gaining market share in all of our business in a global basis very pleased we are managing our investment in the business very carefully were optimistic about the future specifically as it relates to increasing the valueadded service offering and so we were very pleased with the business in general its hard to get every single number perfectly aligned every quarter but overall the bottom – the sales – the internal sales the operating margin and the eps growth is something that were very pleased with were working on our strategic plan now for   and  so many opportunities and the challenge is always about determining what were not going to do rather than what to do – capitalizing on specific opportunities henry schein has so many opportunities in dental medical animal health space and were excited about the future and our management team is excited to be advancing our strategies more in the company is great and we continue to look forward to creating shareholder value for our shareholders so thank you all for calling in if you have any questions of course steve paladino is always available as our cfo at  and carolynne borders on the investor relations side carolynne carolynne borders  henry schein inc  stanley m bergman  henry schein inc and i think were all going to be out at the carolynne borders  henry schein inc bank of america stanley m bergman  henry schein inc bank of america conference on tuesday next week look forward to seeing those investors that are going to be there if youre not there i believe it will be webcast so well try to provide as much information as practical and appropriate and were very very excited with the addition of the dentsply sirona line but also so grateful and appreciative of those manufacturers that have worked with us to get us to where we are we believe we have the deepest bench in management and really a broad array of products and solutions with dental medical and animal health market so thank you very much for calling in operator this

ibs dean bruce magidby adam connersimonsapril  stanley m bergman’s company sells products and services that are  percent identical to those of its peers how then does he account for the fact that his enterprise is three and a half times bigger than its closest competitor “enlightened selfinterest” he told a roomful of students faculty and other guests at brandeis’ faculty club on tuesday “we deeply believe that being successful means doing well as an organization but doing good for society at the same time” bergman is chairman and ceo of henry schein inc a fortune  company and the worlds largest distributor of health products and services to officebased doctors dentists and veterinarians this week he visited campus to receive brandeis international business school’s  perlmutter award for excellence in global business leadership presented annually by brandeis ibs’ perlmutter institute for global business leadership the award honors individuals who practice valuesbased business leadership that has an international focus since taking the helm in  bergman has helped grow henry schein into a company with more than  employees and annual sales of  billion he is also an active supporter of organizations fostering the arts higher education grassroots healthcare and sustainable development in the united states africa and other regions in his lively lunch keynote bergman spoke about his organization’s efforts to create a culture of engagement among “team schein” members and the importance of catering to a “mosaic of constituents” that includes investors customers suppliers employees and society at large “we’re not running the company for our shareholders alone” he said “we are serving  million practitioners and interested parties all around the world” among those in attendance at the awards ceremony were perlmutter institute founders louis  and barbara perlmutter brandeis president frederick lawrence and brandeis ibs dean bruce magid in discussing the awardee’s qualifications lawrence addressed bergman and compared him to the university’s namesake justice louis brandeis – a man who lawrence said understood that theory and practice do not pull in opposite directions but actually reinforce each other  “if you were to have asked louis brandeis how he balanced his extensive probono practice with his highly successful forprofit law practice he would likely have responded ‘i don’t understand your question’’ “you are a business leader who understands that theory and practice do not pull in opposite directions and that one can do good just as one does well” lawrence said of bergman “you are most welcome on this campus and most appropriate for this honor” in addition to attending the luncheon the executive also spoke in professor daniel bergstresser’s class chatted with several brandeis ibs students and participated in a working session with faculty about business ethics throughout the day bergman singled out the university for
