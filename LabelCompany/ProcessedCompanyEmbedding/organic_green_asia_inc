flavor maple like flavor in this mayonnaise we wanted to like the new organic best foods mayonnaise however after tasting two different lots its a no for us it has an odd maple like flavor that imparts itself into everything we added into the mayonnaise especially garlic its impossible to have a great tasting aioli with this mayonnaise because that odd flavor takes over the garlic notes were not sure if its the natural flavor or the lemon juice concentrate that makes this odd aroma and flavor we hope best foods will make a better version as we want a great tasting organic mayonnaise we love your regular best foods mayonnaise but want a healthier better tasting non gmo and organic oil ingredients product date published  rated  out of  by louc from looks awful i just got your organic mayo and i will not open the jar because it does not look like mayonaise it is so watery or soupy is the only way i can describe it and when shaked it looked like sour milk in oil there is no way i would even taste it its a shame because i will not buy any other mayo but best foods i am  and that is the only one i have ever used plus there was no coupon to buy your product which i would have used it for the regular mayo thank you anyway  plus what can you use this oily mayo for date published  rated  out of  by dannao from tastes like mayo used to taste if you are old enough you will realize when you taste this that best foods lack of taste in their regular mayo is obivously because it isnt made with the same great ingredients it was when you were younger after tasting the organic mayo i realized what i have been missing for years i said to myself that is what best foods used to taste like before they cut corners with nonorganic ingredients like gmos love the organic mayo they should make all their mayo like this and stop selling gmos to people i have posted it to all my friends on facebook got to get it date published  rated  out of  by hcros from disgusting our family has used best foods real mayonnaise exclusively for over  years and we have always enjoyed your product in a recent attempt at culinary correctness my wife purchased a jar of your new organic mayonnaise and in short it tastes disgusting there is no other way to describe this awful product as a retired marketing executive i can with confidence advise you to withdraw this mess from the market as soon as possible to avoid irreparable damage to your reputation date published  rated  out of  by jeff from best foods organic tastes nothing like the regular best foods mayo i dont know if they use different oil or spices but definitely not as good it also costs alot more organic foods should cost less than conventional because the farmer does not have to buy pesticides herbicides fungicides chemical fertilizer the equipment used to apply it or spend the man hours to apply it the plants are healthier and stronger thereby able to resist pests and disease resulting in higher yeld date published  rated  out of  by jaclin from new organic this new organic best foods is great  hope more people will try it like i did date published  rated  out of  by chaddy from bummer best foods mayo is handsdown the best its so easy to just walk past all of the other choices and get the best this product on the other hand is handsdown the worst mayo i have ever had it tastes a little like it was made with rancid oil i highly doubt that any of the ingredients were subpar but thats the flavor i get i usually like organic foods better but i had to toss the unused portion and fetch a new jar of regular best foods mayo date published  rated  out of  by happily married  from rubbish thats where the rest of the jar of your organic mayo is going we buy only best foods mayo at our houseweve each been eating it since we were children and we wont change to any other brand but your organic mayo is a nonstarter great that you are trying to offer a healthier version but this is a failed attempt in our opinion it just tastes weird wed give it a zero rating if we could date published  organic mayonnaise reviews  page  y m d h bvseobulk prodbvrr vnbulkhotfix cp bvpage cohasreviews tv tr locenus
