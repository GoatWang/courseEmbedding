in the trust account will be released from the trust account until the earlier of i the consummation of our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering and ii a redemption to public shareholders prior to any voluntary windingup in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination within the applicable period the net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial business combination if our initial business combination is paid for using shares or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination we may apply the cash released from the trust account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital we believe that amounts not held in trust as well as the interest income that may be released to fund our working capital requirements will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so or the amount of interest available to use from the trust account is minimal as a result of the current interest rate environment we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable in this event we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management team but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on the nasdaq capital market we have agreed to pay an affiliate of our chairman a total of  per month for office space utilities and secretarial and administrative services upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation we will cease paying these monthly fees as of the date of this prospectus our sponsor has advanced to us a total of  and loaned to us a total of  to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering the advance is noninterest bearing and is payable on demand the loan is noninterest bearing unsecured and is due on the earlier of december   or the closing of this offering in addition in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we consummate our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts in the event that the initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the offering proceeds held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to  of such loans may be convertible into additional private units at a price of  per unit which for example would result in the holders being issued  ordinary shares if  of notes were so converted since the  rights included in the private units would result in the issuance of  ordinary shares upon the closing of our business combination as well as  warrants to purchase  shares in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  furthermore the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination in such case we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of i our consummation of our initial business combination and then only in connection with those ordinary shares that such shareholder properly elected to redeem subject to the limitations described herein or ii the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within  months following the closing of this offering subject to applicable law in no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination our initial shareholders have also agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any public shares purchased during or after the offering in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination in addition our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions with respect to its founder shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering however if our initial shareholders acquire public shares in or after this offering they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least  of the value of the trust account at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding rights and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination company description we are a newly organized blank check company incorporated in the british virgin islands as a business company with limited liability meaning that our public shareholders have no liability as members of our company for the liabilities of our company over and above the amount paid for their shares and formed for the purpose of acquiring engaging in a share exchange share reconstruction and amalgamation with purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of entering into contractual arrangements with or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination although we are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region we intend to focus on businesses that have their primary operations located in asia with an emphasis on china we have not identified any acquisition target and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any discussions research or other measures directly or indirectly with respect to identifying any acquisition target from the date of our incorporation through the date of this prospectus there have been no communications evaluations or discussions between any of our officers directors or our sponsor and any of their contacts or relationships regarding a potential initial business combination with our company additionally we have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate to conduct any research or take any measures directly or indirectly to locate or contact a target business we anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire  of the equity interest or assets of the target business or businesses we may however structure our initial business combination to acquire less than  of such interests or assets of the target business but we will only consummate such business combination if we will become the majority shareholder of the target or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes or are otherwise not required to register as an “investment company” under the investment company act of  as amended or the investment company act we will not consider any transaction that does not meet this criterion even though we will own a majority interest in the target our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction for example we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target in this case we would acquire a  controlling interest in the target however as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding
