form k for the year ended december   samestore we have provided certain information on a total portfolio samestore and redevelopment samestore basis information provided on a samestore basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared properties under development properties classified as held for development and properties classified as discontinued operations information provided on a redevelopment samestore basis includes the results of properties undergoing significant redevelopment for the entirety or portion of both periods being compared samestore and redevelopment samestore is considered by management to be important measures because they assist in eliminating disparities due to the development acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the companys stabilized and redevelopment properties as applicable additionally redevelopment samestore is considered by management to be an important measure because it assists in evaluating the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment opportunities and the impact that these redevelopments have in enhancing our operating performance while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations we typically reclassify significant development redevelopment or expansion properties into samestore properties once they are stabilized properties are deemed stabilized typically at the earlier of i reaching  occupancy or ii four quarters following a propertys inclusion in operating real estate we typically remove properties from samestore properties when the development redevelopment or expansion has or is expected to have a significant impact on the propertys annualized base rent occupancy and operating income within the calendar year our evaluation of significant impact related to development redevelopment or expansion activity is based on quantitative and qualitative measures including but not limited to the following the total budgeted cost of planned construction activity compared to the propertys annualized base rent occupancy and property operating income within the calendar year percentage of development redevelopment or expansion square footage to total property square footage and the ability to maintain historic occupancy and rental rates in consideration of these measures we generally remove properties from samestore properties when we see a decline in a propertys annualized base rent occupancy and operating income within the calendar year as a direct result of ongoing redevelopment development or expansion activity acquired properties are classified into samestore properties once we have owned such properties for the entirety of comparable periods and the properties are not under significant development or expansion table of contents in our determination of samestore and redevelopment samestore properties torrey reserve campus has been identified as a samestore redevelopment property due to significant construction activity office samestore net operating income increased approximately  for the three months ended march   compared to the same period

store   total properties   redevelopment samestore   total development properties   outlook we seek growth in earnings funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following growth in our samestore portfolio growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments and expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions our properties are located in some of the nations most dynamic highbarriertoentry markets primarily in southern california northern california oregon washington and hawaii which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation expansion reconfiguration andor retenanting we evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities we continue our development efforts at torrey point previously sorrento pointe with planned construction to increase rentable office space by approximately  square feet construction of the project is expected to be completed during the second quarter of  with an expected stabilization date in  projected costs of the development are approximately  million of which approximately  million has been incurred to date we expect the torrey point redevelopment to be stabilized in  with an estimated stabilized yield of approximately  to  based on initial estimates we intend to opportunistically pursue the development of future phases of lloyd district portfolio based on among other things market conditions and our evaluation of whether such opportunities would generate appropriate riskadjusted financial returns our redevelopment and development opportunities are subject to various factors including market conditions and may not ultimately come to fruition we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that would complement our portfolio and provide longterm growth opportunities some of our acquisitions do not initially contribute significantly to earnings growth however we believe they provide longterm releasing growth redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities any growth from acquisitions is contingent upon our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance a property acquisition generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash mortgage loans andor borrowings under our revolving line of credit which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt table of contents leasing our samestore growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy over the longterm we believe that the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide us with a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates we have continued to see signs of improvement for many of our tenants as well as increased interest from prospective tenants for our spaces while there can be no assurance that these positive signs will continue we remain cautiously optimistic regarding the improved trends we have seen over the past few years we believe the locations of our properties and diverse tenant base mitigate the potentially negative impact of the current economic environment however any reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations during the three months ended march   we signed  retail leases for a total of  square feet of retail space including  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental rate increase on a cash basis and gaap basis of  and  respectively new retail leases for comparable spaces were signed for  square feet at an average rental rate decrease on a cash and gaap basis of  and  respectively renewals for comparable retail spaces were signed for  square feet at an average rental rate increase on a cash and gaap basis of  and  respectively tenant improvements and incentives were  per square foot of retail space for comparable new leases for the three months ended march   mainly attributed to tenants at south bay marketplace during the three months ended march   we signed  office leases for a total of  square feet of office space including  square feet of comparable space leases at an average rental rate increase on a cash and gaap basis of  and  respectively new office leases for comparable spaces were signed for  square feet at an average rental rate increase on a cash and gaap basis of  and  respectively renewals for comparable office spaces were signed for  square feet at an average rental rate decrease on a cash and gaap basis of  and  respectively tenant improvements and incentives were  per square foot of office space for comparable new leases for the three months ended march   mainly attributed to tenants at city center bellevue and torrey reserve campus the rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed in armslength transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period the comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and in some instances projections of first lease year percentage rent to be paid on the new lease in some instances management exercises judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation the change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates location individual tenant creditworthiness use of space market conditions when the expiring lease was signed capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure tenant improvements and incentives include the total dollars committed for the improvement of a space as it relates to a specific lease but may also include basebuilding costs ie expansion escalators or new entrances which are required to make the space leasable incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements the leases signed in  generally become effective over the following year though some may not become effective until  and beyond further there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating financing or other matters however we believe that these increases do provide information about the tenantlandlord relationship and the potential fluctuations we may achieve in rental income over time through the remainder of  we believe our leasing volume will be inline with our historical averages and result in overall positive increases in rental income however changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative and we can provide no assurance that the rents on new leases will continue to increase at the above disclosed levels if at all table of contents capitalized costs certain external and internal costs directly related to the development and redevelopment of real estate including preconstruction costs real estate taxes insurance interest construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved are capitalized we capitalize costs under development until construction is substantially complete and the property is held available for occupancy the determination of when a development project is substantially complete and when capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment we consider a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of landlordowned tenant improvements or when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for construction of its own improvements but not later than one year from cessation of major construction activity we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy and capitalize only those costs associated with any remaining portion under construction we capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities combined of  million and  million for the three months ended march   and  respectively we capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements combined of  million and  million for the three months ended march   and  respectively we capitalized internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities and other property improvements which are not significant for the three months ended march   and  respectively interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use as noted above we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended however more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period we capitalized interest costs related to development activities of  million and  million for the three months ended march   and  respectively table of contents the following table

should be read in conjunction with the audited historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in item  financial statements and supplementary data of this report as used in this section unless the context otherwise requires we us our and our company mean american assets trust inc a maryland corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries including american assets trust lp this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth under item a risk factors or elsewhere in this document see item a risk factors and forwardlooking statements overview outlook we seek growth in earnings funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following growth in our samestore portfolio growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments and expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions our properties are located in some of the nations most dynamic highbarriertoentry markets primarily in southern california northern california oregon washington and hawaii which we believe allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation expansion reconfiguration andor retenanting we evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities our new development at torrey point previously sorrento pointe is close in proximity to torrey reserve campus groundbreaking on torrey point occurred in july  with development plans including two class a office buildings of approximately  square feet in the aggregate with panoramic unobstructed views of the torrey pines state park beach torrey reserve and the pacific ocean projected costs of the development at torrey point are approximately  million of which approximately  million has been incurred to date we expect to incur the remaining costs for development of torrey point in  we expect the torrey point development to be stabilized in  with an estimated stabilized cash yield of approximately  to  we intend to opportunistically pursue other projects in our development pipeline including future phases of lloyd district portfolio solana beach  highway  as well as other redevelopments at solana beach corporate centre and lomas santa fe plaza the commencement of these developments is based on among other things market conditions and our evaluation of whether such opportunities would generate appropriate risk adjusted financial returns our redevelopment and development opportunities are subject to various factors including market conditions and may not ultimately come to fruition we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that would complement our portfolio and provide longterm growth opportunities some of our acquisitions do not initially contribute significantly to earnings growth however we believe they provide longterm releasing growth redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance a property acquisition generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash mortgage loans andor borrowings under our amended and restated credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt samestore we have provided certain information on a total portfolio samestore and redevelopment samestore basis information provided on a samestore basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared properties under development properties classified as held for development and properties classified as discontinued operations information provided on a redevelopment samestore basis includes the results of properties undergoing significant redevelopment for the entirety or portion of both periods being compared samestore and redevelopment samestore is considered by management to be an important measure because it assists in eliminating disparities due to the development acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the companys stabilized and redevelopment properties as applicable additionally redevelopment samestore is considered by management to be an important measure because it assists in evaluating the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment opportunities and the impact that these redevelopments have in enhancing our operating performance while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations we typically reclassify significant development redevelopment or expansion properties to samestore properties once they are stabilized properties are deemed stabilized typically at the earlier of  reaching  occupancy or  four quarters following a propertys inclusion in operating real estate we typically remove properties from samestore properties when the development redevelopment or expansion has or is expected to have a significant impact on the propertys annualized base rent occupancy and operating income within the calendar year acquired properties are classified to samestore properties once we have owned such properties for the entirety of comparable periods and the properties are not under significant development or expansion in our determination of samestore and redevelopment samestore properties lloyd district portfolio and torrey reserve campus have been identified as redevelopment samestore properties due to the significant construction activity noted above office samestore net operating income increased approximately  for the year ended december   respectively compared to the same periods in  office redevelopment samestore net operating income increased approximately  for the year ended december   respectively compared to the same periods in  below is a summary of our samestore composition for the years ended december    and  for the year ended december   when compared to the designations for the year ended december   hassalo on eighth  retail was included in nonsamestore properties and one development property torrey reserve land was removed from development properties due to the completion of all torrey reserve campus development during the second quarter of  for the year ended december   one disposed property was removed from samestore and redevelopment samestore properties and hassalo on eighth  multifamily was included in nonsamestore properties when compared to the designations for the year ended december   december     samestore    nonsame store    total properties    redevelopment samestore    total development properties    revenue base multifamily leases our multifamily portfolio included four apartment properties as well as an rv resort with a total of  units including  rv spaces available for lease as of december   as of december   these properties were  leased for the year ended december   the multifamily segment contributed  of our total revenue our multifamily leases other than at our rv resort generally have lease terms ranging from  to  months with a majority having month lease terms tenants normally pay a base rental amount usually quoted in terms of a monthly rate for the respective unit spaces at the rv resort can be rented at a daily weekly or monthly rate the average monthly base rent per leased unit as of december   was  compared to  at december   our samestore growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy over the longterm we believe that the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide us with a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates we have continued to see signs of improvement for many of our tenants as well as increased interest from prospective tenants for our spaces while there can be no assurance that these positive signs will continue we remain cautiously optimistic regarding the improved trends we have seen over the past few years we believe the locations of our properties and diverse tenant base mitigate the potentially negative impact of a poor economic environment however any reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations during the three months ended december   we signed  retail leases for a total of  square feet of retail space including  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant an increase of  on a cash basis and an increase of  on a straightline basis new retail leases for comparable spaces were signed for  square feet at an average rental rate increase of  on a cash basis and  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable retail spaces were signed for  square feet at an average rental rate increase of  on a cash basis and an increase of  on a straightline basis tenant improvements and incentives were  per square foot of retail space for comparable new leases for the three months ended december   there were  per square foot of retail space of tenant improvement or incentives for comparable renewal leases for the three months ended december   during the three months ended december   we signed  office leases for a total of  square feet of office space including  square feet of comparable space leases at an average rental rate increase of  on a cash basis and an average rental increase of  on a straightline basis new office leases for comparable spaces were signed for  square feet at an average rental rate increase of  on a cash basis and an average rental rate increase of  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable office spaces were signed for

leases for the three months ended december   there were  per square foot of office space of tenant improvement or incentives for comparable renewal leases for the three months ended december   the rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed in armslength transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period the comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and in some instances projections of first lease year percentage rent to be paid on the new lease in some instances management exercises judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation the change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates location individual tenant creditworthiness use of space market conditions when the expiring lease was signed capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure tenant improvements and incentives include the total dollars committed for the improvement of a space as it relates to a specific lease but may also include base building costs ie expansion escalators or new entrances which are required to make the space leasable incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements the leases signed in  generally become effective over the following year though some may not become effective until  further there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating financing or other matters however we believe that these increases do provide information about the tenantlandlord relationship and the potential fluctuations we may achieve in rental income over time in  we believe our leasing volume will be inline with our historical averages with overall positive increases in rental income however changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative and we can provide no assurance that the rents on new leases will continue to increase at the above disclosed levels if at all critical accounting policies we make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straightline rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management the collectability of receivables is affected by numerous different factors including current economic conditions tenant bankruptcies the status of collectability of current cash rents receivable tenants recent and historical financial and operating results changes in our tenants credit ratings communications between our operating personnel and tenants the extent of security deposits and letters of credits held with respect to tenants and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement while we make estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance for them through bad debt expense actual collectability could differ from those estimates which could affect our net income with respect to the allowance for current uncollectible tenant receivables we assess the collectability of outstanding receivables by evaluating such factors as nature and age of the receivable past history and current financial condition of the specific tenant including our assessment of the tenants ability to meet its contractual lease obligations and the status of any pending disputes or lease negotiations with the tenant a change in the estimate of collectability of a receivable would result in a change to our allowance for doubtful accounts and corresponding bad debt expense and net income additionally our assessment of our tenants abilities to meet their contractual lease obligations includes consideration of the status of collectability of current cash rents receivable tenants recent and historical financial and operating results changes in our tenants credit ratings communications between our operating personnel and tenants and the extent of security deposits and letters of credits held with respect to tenants due to the nature of the accounts receivable from straightline rents the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year our experience relative to unbilled straightline rents is that a portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations lease modifications bankruptcies and other factors accordingly the extended collection period for straightline rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straightline rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straightline revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized the additional straightline rental income is    feb   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage don’t have a college degree these are the industries with the
