exhibit      sessa capital appeals texas court ruling   sessa commences appeal of court decision denying stockholders a choice of director nominees   new york – may   – sessa capital master lp “sessa” owner of  of the outstanding common shares of ashford hospitality prime inc nyse ahp “ashford prime” or the “company” today announced that it has commenced an appeal of the recent decisions by the united states district court for the northern district of texas in connection with sessa’s proxy contest with ashford prime the appeal is being taken to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit sessa intends to request that the district court’s orders be stayed and that ashford prime’s annual stockholders meeting which is currently scheduled for june   be postponed until after the appeal is resolved sessa also intends to request that its appeal be expedited   the district court held that maryland’s business judgment rule protects the decision of the ashford prime board to refuse to allow the sessa nominees to stand for election against the incumbent directors in its decisions the district court noted that ashford prime’s board contends sessa has undisclosed plans for the company that it did not adequately include in its nominee questionnaires in january  or upon further request the district court held that the board “could rationally believe” such plans existed although the district court made no finding as to what those plans might be   the district court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting sessa from soliciting proxies for its nominees accordingly sessa will not solicit proxies for its nominees unless permitted to do so following the outcome of the appeal and the motions filed in connection with the appeal   john petry sessa’s principal commented “we are deeply disappointed in the district court’s decision which will deny ashford prime stockholders the opportunity to participate in a competitive director election we believe that we have been transparent in our disclosures and that all of our plans and proposals for the company required to be disclosed under the federal securities laws have been fully disclosed in our filings on schedule d and in our proxy materials we intend to vigorously pursue our appeal of the district court’s decisions and hope that the courts will ultimately permit ashford prime’s stockholders to decide which directors should be their chosen representatives on the company’s board”   media contacts sard verbinnen  co margaret popper  zachary tramonti              exhibit                      exhibit

production of documents   the motion is denied as moot as to the board materials at issue and correspondence with notre dame based on plaintiffs representation that plaintiffs have produced all the documents that defendants seek regarding board meetings and minutes as well as correspondence with notre dame the motion is denied as to the documents reflected in privilege log entries            and  because plaintiffs represent and the declaration of david brooks explains that those documents are not in fact responsive to defendants document requeststhe motion is moot as to the documents reflected in privilege log entries           and  because plaintiffs report that they have produced those documents after carefully reviewing the parties filings the court determines that plaintiffs have established through the declaration of david brooks and as necessary and appropriate an in camera review of some of the documents that certain of the remaining  documents at issue are protected from disclosure either entirely or with redactions by the attorneyclient privilege andor workproduct protection  specifically those reflected in privilege log entries                                     and  the court denies the motion as to those documents as to any challenge to plaintiffs withholding or redactions based on attorneyclient privilege andor workproduct protection after carefully reviewing the parties filings including conducting an in camera review as to certain of these documents the court determines that plaintiffs have not established the existence and applicability of a socalled business strategy or white knight privilege or immunity under governing law in this case and cannot redact or entirely withhold portions of the documents reflected in privilege log entries      and  based on an assertion that those portions while not attorney work product or attorneyclient privileged communications constitute proprietary confidential strategic discussions the court grants the motion as to those portions of those documents which portions must be produced unredactedafter carefully reviewing the parties filings including conducting an in camera review the court determines that plaintiffs have not established that the documents reflected in privilege log entries  and  are protected from disclosure either entirely or with redactions by the attorneyclient privilege andor workproduct protection specifically plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden to establish that draft board meeting minutes contain legal analysis and attorney work product simply because they were prepared by outside counsel the court grants the motion as to those documents after carefully reviewing the parties filings including conducting an in camera review the court determines that plaintiffs have not established that the document reflected in privilege log entries   and  are protected from disclosure by the attorneyclient privilege or workproduct protection the court grants the motion as to those documents after carefully reviewing the parties filings including conducting an in camera review the court determines that plaintiffs have not established that the documents reflected in privilege log entries  and  are protected from disclosure in their entirety by the attorneyclient privilege andor workproduct protection rather the document logged as entry  must be reproduced with redaction of only the email to mr brooks and not the emails being forwarded to mr brooks and the document logged as entry  must be reproduced with redaction only of the draft questions and responses that reflect legal advice legal analysis and work product the court accordingly grants the motion in part as to these documents all documents required by this order to be produced or

ashford primes admissions of corporate governance weaknesses business wire may    am edt sessa capital master lp sessa owner of  of the outstanding common shares of ashford hospitality prime inc nyseahp ashford prime or the company today commented on the companys announcement of a series of lastminute governance proposals that sessa believes will do little to address the issues that have plagued ashford prime since its  spinoff sessa believes the incumbent directors newest proposal that monty bennett step down as ceo is merely a ruse to suggest that real governance changes are underway at most companies a ceo change would be meaningful but this is not the case at ashford prime where the incumbent directors relinquished their power to appoint the ceo less than a year ago by approving a highly unusual contractual arrangement in sessas view changing the companys ceo will be merely symbolic because by contract any ceo will be appointed by ashford inc and therefore beholden to monty bennett in his role as ashford incs chairman and ceo sessa believes this arrangement renders the companys latest proposal a mere cosmetic change that leaves monty bennetts power over ashford prime unchecked sessa also questions the incumbent directors campaign promise that they might appoint new independent directors if they are reelected sessa agrees that truly independent directors are needed at ashford prime but sessa believes that the governance problem at ashford prime isnt an insufficient number of directors but rather the conflicts of the existing independent directors the incumbent directors were all identified by chairman bennett and have personal professional and financial intersections with him and his other companies a larger board would be unwieldy in size more expensive and chosen by incumbent directors who have already failed to protect shareholders interests sessa believes that shareholders should be wary of director additions sourced by a board that includes a director who is a direct subordinate of chairman bennett and has worked for him for nearly  years a high school friend of more than  years of chairman bennett who serves on the companys compensation committee a director whose independence was questioned by riskmetrics while serving as a director of ashford primes predecessor because of his receipt of a  bonus a director whose affiliated company sold assets to ashford primes predecessor which later took  million in impairment charges on the purchase and two political cronies of chairman bennett texas state representatives who raised so much campaign money from chairman bennett that he was a leading individual donor to each for shareholders who like sessa believe new independent directors are needed electing sessas
