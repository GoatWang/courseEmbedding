description▼▲ jesus once said whoever drinks of the water that i will give them will never be thirsty so why are christians still thirsty we throw ourselves into church work bible studies prayer missions fellowship yet still we search restlessly for something more what are we missingperhaps the answer is more of jesus church meetings and programs ministry christian counseling and home groups are all good but they are not him it doesnt matter how devoted we are to these wonderful activities they are not the same thing as communion with jesus our souls crave him alonein sacred thirst author and pastor craig barnes brings us facetoface with our desperate longing for god like the woman at the well we have tried to satisfy our parched souls with so many other thingseven religious things but when we get to the bottom of our desire we find jesus quietly waiting with his living waterintimatecommunion with the father son and holy spiritthis book is filled with unique insights into human experience and the character of god with his keen understanding of the needs of contemporary christians barnes points to the only way our thirst will ever be satisfied drawing from his rich background in the bible and his tender insights as a pastor he leads us into a new understanding ofourselves and the uncontrollable but gracious god we seek author bio▼▲ m craig barnes is pastor of shadyside presbyterian church in pittsburgh pennsylvania his previous books are yearning hustling god and when god interrupts publishers weekly▼▲ in this deep inspiring book barnes plays with biblical images of deserts flowing streams and living waters applying them to contemporary life he says that he wrote the book especially for christians who find themselves in a spiritual desert with a sense of soul sadness or spiritual loneliness having lost the astonishment and joy of their faith barnes senior pastor of national presbyterian church in washington dc notes that in the old and new testaments characters from the patriarchs to jesus used such desert experiences as metaphors for pilgrimage toward god todays christians can use their spiritual deserts toward that same end seeking gods flowing streams of mercy to sustain and refresh them as they journey to the promised land barnes cautions that often christians mistake their intellectual knowledge prayers church attendance and good works as replacements for god he claims that making idols of these activities creates a sense of dissatisfaction and a longing for more often christians settle for the desert but barnes says that sacred thirst can call them from barren spirituality to embrace the holy joy of god just as jesus told the samaritan woman at the well that he could give her living waters and she would never thirst so he promises contemporary followers that the holy spirit is the living water that restores parched souls barness powerful and beautifully written book is a balm to the weary pilgrim jan copyright  cahners business

comprehensive and uniquely personal is the heidelberg catechism in this groundbreaking book body and soul theologian pastor and popular author m craig barnes reveals the heidelberg catechisms true identitywith profound insight clarity and a great deal of wonder barnes reclaiming of the heidelberg reveals the beauty and relevance of this th century statement of faith its not a list of doctrinal questions and answers its not a cutanddried summary of what christians believe its a deeply personal statement of faith and a surprisingly contemporary guide for everyday lifereflecting much of its primary authors own theological convictions that were firmly protestant with calvinistic leanings the heidelberg holds fast the fundamental teaching that mans salvation includes both body and soul body and soul serves as a reliable and inspiring companion in a world where faith and doubt coexist from the seasoned pastor theologian or believer to the seeker or newcomer to the body of christ barnes invites you to join him in finding comfort in belonging body and soul to the triune god product information▼▲ format paperbacknumber of pages vendor faith alive christian resourcespublication
