paradice investment management funds overview daily trust prices distribution statements approach our approach investment process corporate governance australian small cap fund australian mid cap fund australian large cap fund global small mid cap fund video updates home  funds  approach  our approach  print page font smaller font larger our approach we adopt a long term “bottomup” approach to investment bottom–up stock picking involves assessing how a particular company will perform over a given period if its potential performance appears strong we then assess the outlook for its industry and finally the overall economy we believe that equity markets are inefficient and therefore offer excellent investment opportunities over time the inefficiencies arise due to excesses in investor emotion short term investment horizons and disproportionate focus on one of the least important aspects of a company’s financial health – its profit and loss statement in our view objectivity is crucial to sound investing it is possible to benefit from market inefficiencies by focusing on logical ordered and objective investment decisions based on known facts we aim to buy shares which we believe are underpriced and expect to grow at rates greater than the market our strategy is to favour wellmanaged good value companies that have significant growth opportunities through their comparative advantage this comparative advantage can be via a combination of a better product or service a more efficient organisational model a favourable niche or a commanding leadership position within their industry in our view a good business requires good products services and execution the key to identifying these investment opportunities lies in our extensive insight and analysis of companies and the industries to which they belong we achieve this through an intense company visitation program as well as proven valuation techniques and models used by our experienced investment
