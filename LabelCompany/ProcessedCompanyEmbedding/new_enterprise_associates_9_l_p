diversity has long been a hallmark of nea founded on both us coasts in  and still deeply rooted in silicon valley and the midatlantic ask someone where nea is headquartered and youll see how ingrained that dual citizenship istheyll think about it for a minute and then either admit they dont know or err on the side of their home office it makes for some fierce sports rivalries but it also makes us better investors we have crossfunctional crosscountry collaboration down to such a science its bordering on art we want to find and fund innovation at its source and innovation is everywhere that pursuit of innovation and great partnerships has led us to spend a lot more time in certain hubs and over the last few years nea has established small offices in new york and chicago menlo park innovation is everywhere but silicon valley is still the undisputed hub of the venture capital and startup ecosystemsand few would dispute that sand hill road is to venture capital what wall street is to the stock markets neas founding west coast office was in san francisco and while were active up and down the west coast sand hill road has been home since the mids washington dc neas east coast roots are spread across the metropolitan dc region with a founding office in baltimore and a second location in virginia our dual residency came to an end in  when our east coast investing staff moved into our current friendship heights location our operations team has stayed close to the firms baltimore roots with an office in nearby timonium san francisco in  we harkened back to our city roots

innovation ecosystem we have a history of partnering with new englandbased startups and currently have over two dozen active portfolio companies in boston and surrounding areas in  we decided to formalize our relationship with the city by opening an office in the cambridge biopharma hub kendall square chicago our portfolio spans six continents but we have invested more capital in chicago than

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
