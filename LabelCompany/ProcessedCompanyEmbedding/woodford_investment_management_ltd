private investor investor type please note that by making your selection here you are agreeing to the woodford investment management ltd privacy statement and to our terms and conditions home  us the establishment of woodford in  has been the opportunity for neil woodford – one of the uk’s most highlyregarded fund managers – to distil  years of experience and learning into a business founded on his own principles our ambition was not to be just another fund management company but to create something different and better for our investors we believe that there are parts of our industry that have forgotten what it is that investors really want – too often they face noise and complexity and an industry focused on relative returns and shortterm pressures at woodford our approach is different as all of our attention is on providing a positive longterm return for our clients and it is not just our investment approach that is different we are building a strong and successful transformational fund management business with a unique culture a team of talented and passionate people specialists in their individual fields who share a vision for how a fund management company can and should operate and are united in their commitment to delivering outstanding outcomes for our clients it is an environment in which our investment managers can focus solely on managing money and delivering the performance our investors expect without the constraints of legacy infrastructure we have anchored our investment team in a dynamic cuttingedge business that embraces both increased regulation and a fastmoving world we have been able to make use of new technology and outsourcing models to provide an industryleading infrastructure that is unrivalled in its effectiveness and efficiency we aim to deliver more than just profit as well as enriching the lives of our clients we are actively engaging with the wider community and building a fund management business that will generate value not just for today’s generation but also for the generations of tomorrow our goal is to set a new benchmark for how fund management companies do business – with client outcomes our absolute focus investment approach at woodford we feel strongly that existing and potential investors are entitled to understand what we’re doing with their money understanding our longterm disciplined and diligent investment approach is crucial in helping clients to decide whether investing with us would be right for them and to understand how their investments are being managed and the experience they can expect with woodford first and foremost we are stock pickers we combine rigorous fundamental analysis of companies with our perspective of the longterm macroeconomic outlook and variables and how these might impact existing or potential holdings this approach allows us to construct robust investment rationales and make informed decisions we focus on what matters the long term and the fundamentals an active strategy we believe that being an active investor means doing something different from the market and adding value through the investment process every investment we buy we buy on merit – we never invest in companies to make our portfolios look more like the index as a result our portfolios tend to look and behave very differently to the general market we are happy for our performance to be compared to the market and our portfolio activity and performance are fully disclosed on our website but we are confident that we can better it over the long term by doing things differently company engagement we are also active in our engagement with company management teams as we want to represent our investors’ best interests in our discussions with management teams we aim to ensure that management is aligned with shareholders and that the course set for the business will create longterm shareholder value we engage with management to try to influence change where necessary successful investment requires a partnership between managers and owners longterm focus our longterm approach to investment management is encapsulated in a patient capital investment style equity markets take a random walk on a daily basis the forces of fundamentals and valuation may be overridden by sentiment and the whim of the market in the short term but it is the longer time periods that count we look beyond the shortterm noise and focus on the longterm drivers of share prices our approach is focused on value discovery not on price discovery we believe that by focusing on valuation and identifying companies that can deliver sustainable growth today or in the future we can deliver great longterm outcomes for our investors absolute focus we believe investors expect a return we don’t think we’ve done a good job if a fund falls in value even if the market has delivered an even worse outcome protecting our investors’ capital is key our approach is all about positive return over the long term we do not pay attention to hype and we are not distracted by the desire for instant results instead we seek wellrun highquality businesses – the fundamentals matter and neil’s ability to make investment decisions that balance macroviews business specifics and his view on management teams have resulted in exceptional longterm performance of course value is not a product of history but of the future and that is why neil and the investment team continue to adopt their disciplined diligent and focused methodology to spot opportunities and create positive outcomes for our clients in the case of younger businesses investors do have to tolerate the prospect of loss on a stockspecific basis although our due diligence efforts are designed to minimise this risk we aim to achieve capital preservation through diversification by investing in a larger number of smaller positions we acknowledge that there will be periods when a fund falls in value but we believe our disciplined strategy with a focus on valuation and diligent stock picking can help us prevent any temporary losses of capital becoming permanent we focus on absolute risk and on delivering a positive return over the long term what matters to our clients matters to us and our sole focus is on delivering robust and reliable performance for investors results the foundations of our investment principles and approach have been at the heart of neil’s successful investment philosophy for decades and have proved extremely rewarding for his investors the approach has been finetuned over the years – as our fund managers have learnt from both successes and failures – but it has not changed in any material way our aim of delivering consistent and attractive longterm performance has been achieved consistently throughout neil woodford’s career we strongly believe that our disciplined approach is robust and repeatable and will continue to deliver real value for investors in the period since woodford was established our assets under management have grown steadily to £bn source northern trust as at  may  with all types of investor demonstrating belief in neil and his team find

them fulfil their growth potential through the deployment of longterm patient capital aiming to identify the best untapped growth opportunities and deliver exceptional longterm returns an innovative fee structure aligning manager and investor the opportunity despite some of the best universities and finest intellectual property the uk’s record of converting this into commercial success is poor this is primarily due to a lack of appropriate capital investment – which creates a compelling investment opportunity a longterm ‘patient capital’ approach can deliver extremely successful outcomes and help businesses fulfil their potential while also helping to develop the uk’s ‘knowledge economy’ and support the muchneeded economic rebalancing unrivalled and untapped growth opportunities offer potential for outstanding longterm returns an investment team that shares a single goal the fund is managed by neil woodford widely regarded as one of the finest investors of his generation and with more than a decade’s experience of deploying longterm patient capital to young businesses neil is supported by a dedicated team that shares his approach and commitment to the goal of exceptional longterm performance for our clients three experienced fund managers work with neil – each with a different skill set for depth of crossmarket coverage three specialist analysts support the fund managers providing them with valuable analysis and support on specific investment opportunities understanding earlystage risks young businesses have a very different risk profile to more mature companies – risks are much more stockspecific which implies a lower correlation with equity markets in general and the wider economy this may offer diversification benefits it also means longterm outcomes are more binary – extremely attractive rewards for success but also risk of capital loss as some businesses will inevitably fail to fulfil their potential we aim to mitigate this risk through
