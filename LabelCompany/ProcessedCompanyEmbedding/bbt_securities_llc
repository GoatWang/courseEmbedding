hypothetical and are for illustrative purposes extended trading hours the following risks are assumed when trading during extended trading hours risk of lower liquidity liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy and sell securities generally the more orders that are available in a market the greater liquidity liquidity is important because with greater liquidity it is easier for investors to buy or sell securities and as a result investors are more likely to pay or receive a competitive price for securities purchased or sold there may be lower liquidity in extended hours trading as compared to regular market hours as a result your order may be only partially executed or not at all risk of higher volatility volatility refers to the changes in price that securities undergo when trading generally the higher the volatility of a security the greater its price swings there may be greater volatility in extended hours trading than in regular market hours as a result your order may only be partially executed or not at all or you may receive an inferior price in extended hours trading than you would during regular market hours risk of changing prices the prices of securities traded in extended hours trading may not reflect the prices either at the end of regular market hours or upon the opening the next morning as a result you may receive an inferior price in extended hours trading than you would during regular market hours risk of unlinked markets depending on the extended hours trading system or the time of day the prices displayed on a particular extended hours trading system may not reflect the prices in other concurrently operating extended hours trading systems dealing with the same securities accordingly you may receive an inferior price in an extended hours trading system than you would in another extended hours trading system risk of new announcements normally issuers make news announcements that may affect the price of their securities after regular market hours similarly important financial information is frequently announced outside of regular market hours in extended hours trading these announcements may occur during trading and if combined with lower liquidity and higher volatility may cause an exaggerated and unsustainable effect on the price of the security risk of wider spreads the spread refers to the difference in price between what you can buy a security for and what you can sell it for lower liquidity and higher volatility in extended hours trading may result in wider than normal spreads for a particular security usa patriot act know your customer important information you need to know about opening an accountin accordance with usa patriot act federal law requires bbt securities llc to
