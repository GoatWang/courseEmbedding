of t rowe price group inc t rowe price associates inc and t rowe price trust company   strategy investment objective the fund seeks to maximize total return through income and secondarily capital appreciation investment approach in an effort to protect investors from the adverse outcomes that can come with concentrated risk exposures the strategy takes a more diversified approach to credit risk allocation than many competing total return strategies that specialize in particular market segments the broad reach of the firm’s global research platform enables the strategy to spread risk more evenly and access highconviction investment ideas from a wide range of markets a byproduct of the portfolio’s riskbalanced structure is that it places increased emphasis on sectors that have historically produced strong riskadjusted returns and exhibited lower correlations with equities it also takes advantage of t rowe price’s strong track record investing in higheryielding “plus” sectors this results in an asset allocation that is differentiated from the index and competitors with a tilt toward securitized sectors and below investmentgrade securities—particularly bank loans which have produced high sharpe ratios over time these structural biases are not intended to be static however an important aspect of the management process will be ongoing evaluation of risk exposures making tactical adjustments as market conditions evolve to this end the strategy’s investment guidelines provide the management team with substantial flexibility to make active decisions including a larger tracking error budget than more benchmarkoriented core bond strategies significant latitude to hold outofbenchmark positions a wide duration band versus the index to actively manage interest rate risk the ability to use a variety of derivatives to hedge risk and express investment ideas though the strategy will use synthetic instruments to a lesser extent than many competitors

taxable bond team lead portfolio manager of the firms us gnma bond strategy and coportfolio manager for the total return strategy he also is a member of the fixed income steering committee mr mccormick is a vice president of t rowe price group inc t rowe price associates inc and t rowe price trust company   strategy investment objective the fund seeks to maximize total return through income and secondarily capital appreciation investment approach in an effort to protect investors from the adverse outcomes that can come with concentrated risk exposures the strategy takes a more diversified approach to credit risk allocation than many competing total return strategies that specialize in particular market segments the broad reach of the firm’s global research platform enables the strategy to spread risk more evenly and access highconviction investment ideas from a wide range of markets a byproduct of the portfolio’s riskbalanced structure is that it places increased emphasis on sectors that have historically produced strong riskadjusted returns and exhibited lower correlations with equities it also takes advantage of t rowe price’s strong track record investing in higheryielding “plus” sectors this results in an asset allocation that is differentiated from the index and competitors with a tilt toward securitized sectors and below investmentgrade securities—particularly bank loans which have produced high sharpe ratios over time these structural biases are not intended to be static however an important aspect of the management process will be ongoing evaluation of risk exposures making tactical adjustments as market conditions evolve to this end the strategy’s investment guidelines provide the management team with substantial flexibility to make active decisions including a larger tracking error budget than more benchmarkoriented core bond strategies significant latitude to hold outofbenchmark positions a wide duration band versus the index to actively manage interest rate risk the ability to use a variety of derivatives to hedge risk and express investment ideas though the strategy will use synthetic instruments to a lesser extent
