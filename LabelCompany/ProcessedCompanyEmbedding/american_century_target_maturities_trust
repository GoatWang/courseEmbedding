maturity fund sock me with such big gains elizabeth roy stanton jan    am est btttx american century benham target maturities trust  is a major financial irritant to me i have been in the fund since october and on dec  it declared a plus capitalgains distribution this is over  on a fund with an approximate price of  this is a lot of tax for me to pay for being in a zerocoupon fund for two months i understand yearend capitalgains distributions but in this case the investor gets nothing the fund uses a reverse share split which raises the funds share price back to its predividend price i started in this fund with  shares and after distributions ended up with the same amount plus a couple of percentage points of price appreciation  and a  capitalgains liability my problem is that the taxable capital gain is so much greater than the imputed interest on the bonds the bonds are accruing interest at  to  a year i understand the fund does some trading but does that account for the other  rich schneider rich its not as bad as you think before i explain why let me explain a bit about the kind of fund were talking about for readers who arent familiar with it a target maturity fund attempts to mimic the performance of a zerocoupon bond regular bonds pay interest for example if you buy a bond with a  coupon for  its face value the bond pays you  a year until it matures at which point you get your  back zerocoupon bonds have no coupons hence the name so they pay no interest instead they are priced at a steep discount to face value for example a  zerocoupon bond maturing in  years might cost  target maturity funds are designed to reach a target share price in a certain year at which point they liquidate your fund aims to reach its price target of about  in  hence its name the american century target maturity funds which invest in treasury zeros aim to match the performance of a treasury zero maturing in the target year there are a couple of important differences however between owning shares of a target maturity fund and owning zeros that mature in the target year the first has to do with interest zeros dont pay it a target maturity fund on the other hand is required by the internal revenue service to distribute dividends based on the zeros imputed interest says american centurys explanation of how these funds work imputed interest is effectively the interest you would have received if the bonds carried coupons whether you own zeros or target maturity fund shares you have to pay tax on them each year obviously like any mutual fund a target maturity fund also must distribute capital gains each year and thats the second difference between owning target maturity fund shares and owning zeros if you own zeros you pay capitalgains tax only when you sell bonds for more than their imputed value but if youre a fund shareholder and the fund has taken capital gains youre going to pay tax on them why such a big distribution rich you say you are aware that most funds distribute capital gains at yearend but were blindsided by the size of the distribution on your fund indeed it was a huge distribution the fund distributed a total of  on a net asset value of  of the total  was the dividend and  was capital gains no other american century target maturity fund distributed anywhere near that much in capital gains so what happened what happened is that the fund racked up huge gains last year and lots of investors cashed out socking those who stayed with the capitalgains distribution all bonds and bond funds do well when interest rates are dropping but zerocoupon bonds and funds do the best so as treasury yields headed steadily lower last year the prices of zeros and of target maturity fund shares shot up as you can see from this chart of btttx consequently many investors sold david schroder the funds manager said that in the year ended oct   the period for which capital gains were calculated the funds assets dropped to  million from  million and the number of shares shrank to  million from  million the large capital gain happened because the fund which is fully invested had to sell securities to meet redemptions when prices were high schroeder says the manager says he tries to sell the highestcost securities first in order to minimize the tax impact but theres only so much we can do examining the reverse split so all the gains that got taken in order to let the sellers out were distributed to the remaining shareholders why shouldnt that upset you for two reasons first the sellers dont get to avoid paying capitalgains tax they get taxed on their gains on their shares the second reason has to do with the devilishly complicated reverse share split you mentioned no shame in this but i think you partially misunderstand it when a normal mutual fund makes a distribution its net asset value drops by the amount of the distribution if you are reinvesting your distributions they go to purchase additional shares at the lower postdistribution price target maturity firms work the same way if you reinvest your distributions they go to purchase additional shares at the lower postdistribution price but immediately after the distribution a reverse share split is performed why if a target maturity funds share price dropped every time it made a distribution the fund would never reach its target price of  a share the reverse share split returns the share price to its predistribution level depending on whether you reinvested your dividend or took the cash you would have either the same number of shares as before or fewer shares its easiest to understand if you think in terms of the total value of your investment in a regular fund if you take your distributions in cash the total value of your investment will be less after the distribution than before youll have the same number of shares at a lower price if you reinvest the total value will be the same after as before youll have more shares at a lower price in a target maturity fund if you take your distributions in cash the total value of your investment will be less due to the reverse split youll have fewer shares than before  but at the same price if you reinvest the total value will be the same youll have the same number of shares at the same price the fact that you have the same number of shares now as before doesnt mean the fund hasnt given you anything its given you your predistribution share price back remember if youd taken your distribution in cash youd have fewer shares now than you had before the distribution cap gains taxes pay now or pay later how does this affect you from a capitalgains standpoint assuming you dont intend to hold this fund till maturity youre going to sell your shares someday hopefully at a gain youre paying a big tax bill this year but that will mean a smaller tax bill when you go to sell heres how it works youll be taxed on the difference between the price at which you bought your shares  your basis  and the price at which you sell but youre allowed to increase your basis by the same factor that was used to calculate the reverse share split an example courtesy of american century if a reverse share split leaves you with  of the shares you had before youre allowed to divide your basis by  so if you bought  shares at  in the event of a for reverse split your basis in those shares would rise to     but obviously the size of that factor  in the example depends on the size of the distribution that triggered the reverse share split the bigger the distribution the smaller the factor the bigger the distribution the fewer shares someone who took their distributions in cash would wind up with the smaller the factor the more your basis goes up when you divide by it the reverse split btttx underwent on dec  was roughly at the rate of to or for using whole numbers so if you bought your shares in october for about  your basis in them is now about  that means youll
