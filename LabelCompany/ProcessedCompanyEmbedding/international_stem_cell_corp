with a powerful new stem cell technology called human parthenogenetic activation that promises to significantly advance the field of regenerative medicine parthenogenetic from the greek parthenos meaning “virgin” and genesis meaning “birth” activation utilizes unfertilized human eggs to create parthenogenetic stem cells hpsc that can be immunematched to millions of people as a result a relatively small number of hpsc lines could provide enough immunematched cells to cover a large percentage of the world’s population isco’s scientists are focused on using hpsc to treat severe diseases of the nervous system joints and liver where cell therapy has been proven clinically effective but is limited by the availability of safe immunematched human cells research and corporate

some of the world’s most common medical diseases there are five steps to this treatment process in harvesting adipose tissue fat from your body step  preparation using local anesthetics our board certified physicians prep the lower abdomen for manual mini liposuction procedure the amount of adipose tissue to be extracted depends on which ailment is being treated in most cases between cc is needed step  collection once the adipose tissue is collected a centrifuge process is used to separate the gathered cells into a top layer of fat and a potent concentration containing millions of stem cells at the bottom step  enrichment blood is then taken from the patient and spun in a special centrifuge to separate the blood into its multiple parts the blood platelets prp that contain growth factors are added to the stem cell concentration this enrichment process prepares the platelet rich plasma and stem cells to be activated step  cell activation a stemedix™ physician uses a patented laser activation process to stimulate the enriched stem cells before they are reintroduced via intravenous intravascular andor direct injection into specific locations within the body step  transplantation the final step is to introduce the activated stem cells back into the body unlike traditional treatments offering less than optimal options this revolutionary procedure gathers stem cells from their most abundant source and activates them to ensure their survival adipose tissue fat has the highest concentration of stem cells and can produce billions of cells with the potential to repair replenish and begin rejuvenating your body immediately see our image gallery review our frequently asked questions or call us today for more information on how we can help your journey to a

is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time

different geographic regions times or days of the week and even demographics what determines my ad position bing ads is a payperclick ppc advertising system you bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the keyword shoe you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on shoe you determine how much you are willing to bid your ad position is based on several things including how closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched relevance how your bid compares to other bids in the bing ads auction how strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked clickthrough rate the stronger you are in these areas the better your chances of winning the top ad position how to use bing ads how can i use bing ads to drive more people to my website here are some tips to get better results review your budget and bid strategy if your ad keeps pausing your budget limit may be set too low competitive bids help your ad

bank is the life science industry’s first collection of nonembryonic histocompatible human stem cells available for research and commercial use the human leukocyte antigen hla system represents antigens important for transplantation normally donor tissue is screened for antigens in order to determine the degree of histocompatibility or tissue compatibility with the recipient hla haplotypes are classed as hlaa hlab hlac and hladr locus alleles and there are roughly  common hla haplotypes in the us caucasian population tissue derived from stem cells faces the same problem of tissue rejection as organ transplantation one way to produce hla matched cells for cellbased therapy is by using human histocompatible stem cells with homozygous hla loci matching donor and recipient tissue for hla greatly increases the likelihood of transplant survival international stem cell corporation has developed a proprietary technique for creating histocompatible stem cells via parthenogenetic activation human parthenogenetic stem cells or hpsc the process uses unfertilized human eggs and results in the cells inheriting a duplicate set of hla genes matching donor and recipient tissue for hla greatly increases the likelihood of transplant survival this significantly reduces the possibility of the derived cells being rejected by an individual’s immune system making a single cell line suitable for treating millions of individuals a relatively small number of such cell lines could be sufficient to provide “immune matched” cells to a large percentage of the world’s population use of hpsc why use hpsc this type of cell retains all of the advantages required to generate targeted histocompatible therapeutic tissues while being unable to generate a complete human organism  they are as pluripotent and proliferative as a human embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells ipsc but do not carry any possible genetic damage caused by reprogramming in the case of ipsc because hpsc are not derived from the patient they will not carry a genetic disease that is inherent in the patient for example if cells are taken from a person with cystic fibrosis to generate stem cells then those cells carry the same disease making them less useful an independent source of cells is a superior choice in this case stemedix  osteoarthritis stem cell therapy about about us travel

our loved ones autologous adipose stem cell transplantation stemedix™ adipose adult stem cell transplantation procedure is used to help repair some of the world’s most common medical diseases there are five steps to this treatment process in harvesting adipose tissue fat from your body step  preparation using local anesthetics our board certified physicians prep the lower abdomen for manual mini liposuction procedure the amount of adipose tissue to be extracted depends on which ailment is being treated in most cases between cc is needed step  collection once the adipose tissue is collected a centrifuge process is used to separate the gathered cells into a top layer of fat and a potent concentration containing millions of stem cells at the bottom step  enrichment blood is then taken from the patient and spun in a special centrifuge to separate the blood into its multiple parts the blood platelets prp that contain growth factors are added to the stem cell concentration this enrichment process prepares the platelet rich plasma and stem cells to be activated step  cell activation a stemedix™ physician uses a patented laser activation process to stimulate the enriched stem cells before they are reintroduced via intravenous intravascular andor direct injection into specific locations within the body step  transplantation the final step is to introduce the activated stem cells back into the body unlike traditional treatments offering less than optimal options this revolutionary procedure gathers stem cells from their most abundant source and activates them to ensure their survival adipose tissue fat has the highest concentration of stem cells and can produce billions of cells with the potential to repair replenish and begin rejuvenating your body immediately see our

attacked by one’s own immune system neurons in the brain are lined with a fatty protective tissue called the myelin sheath that surrounds each nerve fiber these protective tissues are attacked by an abnormal immune response causing inflammation and exposure of nerve fibers this exposure causes a disoriented signal flow between nerve cells and the brain resulting in loss of motor skills coordination and cognitive abilities multiple sclerosis can be a challenging disease to treat since the progression and severity of symptoms affect each patient uniquely some symptoms of ms can include abnormal sensations in extremities decreased tactility in hands fatigue loss of balance and muscle aches individuals with more severe symptoms may experience bladder problems difficulty walking dizziness muscle spasms and loss of vision the array of symptoms associated with ms generally appears in episodic periods of worsening also referred to as flareups and can cause progressive deterioration of neurological functions an example of this neurological damage can be seen in what patients consider as brain fog moments of confusion or an inability to concentrate on specified tasks how is ms treated today ms research has resulted in two treatment methods the first method is preventing the abnormal response of one’s immune system the second method is replenishing the myelin sheath cells protecting the nerve fibers medications designed today follow the first method in delaying the abnormal immune response traditionally there was a lack of treatment options for the second method however with new research and breakthrough technology physicians of regenerative medicine have produced a treatment to replace the cells damaged by this disease autologous stem cell therapy is a regenerative treatment designed to use the patient’s own adult stem cells to repair and replace diseased tissue in the body past treatments have shown that adult stem cells not only have the potential to regenerate lost or damaged myelin sheath tissues but also have the ability to modulate the immune system temporarily disabling the abnormal attack view more stemedix multiple sclerosis
