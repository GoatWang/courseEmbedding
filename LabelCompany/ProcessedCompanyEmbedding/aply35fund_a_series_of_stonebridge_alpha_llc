that llcs have an operating agreement that will govern it however delaware does not require that the operating agreement be filed with the state or even be in writingit is recommended that you have a written signed agreement even in a singlemember delaware llc the operating agreement is important because it provides a decisionmaking structure that will benefit the llc when dealing with other entities increase protection and increase credibility for financial transactions the operating agreement will include provisions such as liability ownership dissolution and transfer of interest among othersmany incorporation services use boilerplate agreements without provisions to prevent common problems a wellcrafted delaware operating agreement should serve like a prenuptial agreement to avoid any partnership disputes between members should any member decide to go in a different directionsigning the llc operating agreementonce the delaware operating agreement has been drafted and approved all members should execute it most delaware llcs as a practical matter will not draft and finalize the operating agreement until after formation many formal requirements of corporations such as those related to voting and annual meetings are not required by llcs  to this extent many wellcrafted operating agreements will avoid bureaucracy to streamline your business operationswhile an operating agreement can be enforceable unsigned it is more difficult to prove that an unsigned operating agreement was agreed upon by all members in multimember llcs it is especially important to have a signed operating agreement should you change the agreement or ownership structure an amended and restated llc operating agreement should be signed each time the agreement changes top  reasons to form an llc in delaware delaware llcs offer the most protection for you and your business with twoway protectionby forming a delaware llc you safeguard your personal assets by building a shield between them and your business liabilities this means that if the business itself cannot pay a creditor then this shield makes it difficult for creditors to penetrate into your personal assets such as your house car and other personal possessionsdelaware explicitly makes the “charging order” the sole and exclusive remedy for creditors of llc members this prevents creditors of your business partners from taking over the company creditors of a member can only get an economic interest in the llc’s distributions to that member not a control interest or a right to liquidate the llc delaware’s laws provide the strongest shield of any statedelaware governs the internal affairs of your company including its liability shield the corporate protection or “corporate shield” afforded by the delaware llc act which protects the personal assets of individual owners from creditors of their business is thicker than any protection offered in any other state delaware llcs can operate in almost any state or countryyou can form a delaware llc no matter where your business activities take place or where you live in the united states outside the united states there are very few countries and individuals restricted from using a delaware llc and a delaware llc does not need to have a bank account or office in delaware a registered agent such as incnow maintains a physical address in delaware required to forward court and delaware government notices to you delaware treats you like an adult and lets you manage your businesswhen entering into a delaware llc it is flexible in ownership and management structure one individual can serve as both the owner and manager an llc is governed by its operating agreement allowing you to arrange your business affairs between owners as you see fit and have that arrangement enforced as written since the llc is a contractual entity it is important that the delaware courts honor the contract between the parties as written furthermore there is no required annual general meeting and there is much less administrative paperwork in general compared to a corporation managers are protected from lawsuitsthe llc agreement in delaware can reduce or eliminate fiduciary duties this allows business managers and controlling managing members the flexibility to take risks that are not readily questioned by minority investors provided such actions are not in bad faith even if the fiduciary duties are not waived or reduced business managers have the freedom to make business decisions even if losses result without manager liability provided the decisions are not selfdealing even selfdealing is not entirely prohibited instead selfdealing needs to be “entirely fair” to the other members no delaware income tax if your operations are in other states and other business tax loopholesthere is no delaware tax return to file for llcs that are formed in delaware provided they conduct no business in delawareas with llcs in other states profits are taxed personally at the member level but not at the llc level an llc is taxed as a sole proprietorship or partnership unless it elects scorporation or ccorporation tax statushaving an llc that elects to be taxed as an scorporation can save thousands in selfemployment taxes because your income can be split  between selfemployment income and “sdividend” income the sdividend can reduce your taxes by thousands for example splitting  of income would save the selecting llc member more than  in social security and medicare taxes learn more about these advantages in our llc tax tips section delaware’s

intangible assets such as airplanes automobiles boats and patents delaware’s business courts handle business disputes in weeks not yearsdelaware has a separate court for the resolution of business disputes the court of chancery its appointed judges are highly experienced in business cases and effectively solve corporate disputes in a way that other states do not there are no jury trials in the court of chancery so court’s expertise is brought to bear in the decision of every case before the courtthe delaware court system can act very quickly sometimes the whole process from start to finish discovery and motions to trial decisions can be over in two months written decisions from the court of chancery are the standard and are often  pages long this wellreasoned process avoids arbitrary outcomes even appeals to the delaware supreme court can be expedited the delaware judges do their homework and read all the pleadings carefully before hearings and trials delaware has the most probusiness laws of any us statedelaware’s law is generally thought to be probusiness and has a “goldilocks” balance of being stable and slowly evolving – to be cutting edge without upsetting existing businesses because of the maturity of delaware’s law and the high volume of corporate cases handled by delaware’s judicial system there is predictability in outcomesthis means if there have been several similar cases to the one facing your llc there is less uncertainty about the judicial outcome which can be key in deciding to settle a dispute or invest the time and capital to litigate even when judges change it is not a favoritism or political system judges in delaware make reasoned nonpolitical decisions more about llcswhat is a delaware llcdelaware llc benefits –  advantagesdelaware

towards book bycat ltop  revieweron december  format kindle editionverified purchasescience fiction fantasy and ya are not the typical genre i am drawn to read i was impressed and liked almost the entire book i read it nearly straight through and enjoyed it enough to be reading the book  of the seriesthe plot was strong and the story line was unique and interesting enough that i was quickly page turning the entire time i can see how this is an appealing book for the young adult crowd though as a middleager i liked it tooi have only  critical things to say and they are minor compared to the overall positive parts of the book i feel like the dialogue in the beginning chapters does not match the rest of the book the conversation charlie has with her parents seem pretty off for a person who is about to be going to college and harvard at that the dialogue seems forced and does not really start the book off well however it really gets going after a short bit and seems to greatly improvethe end of the book gets a little drawn out just when you want it to have the quickest pace the scenes where charlie is battling almost everyone got me wanting to get through it because it slowed the action down too muchoverall the book was exciting and i look forward to finding out what happens next book  wraps up with just enough cliffhangers to keep the interest strongread

purchasethe unlocked is the first book in the charlie hartley series by author jd stonebridgethis kindle ebook was approximately  printed pages and was free at the time of writing this reviewgeneral theme minor spoilerscharlene charlie hartley is a girl with amazing special powers telekinesis to be exact the ability to move things with her mind rescued as an infant after a horrific mva which killed her parents she was adopted by her rescuers carl and sarah hartleyyears later when her talents are discovered she is recruited by a school that specializes in young adults with special but still very undeveloped abilitiesbut what initially seems to be a great opportunity turns out to hold something completely different for our young heroinesome thoughts on the unlockedthe pros this novel was very reminiscent of the xmen series the storyline once past the opening introductory sequence was crisp unique and attention holding it made me want to read on character development decently done but held back by  belowthe consa the opening detailed the rather overly unrealistic relationship that charlie and her adopted parents unknown to her at this time held just a series of too nice too pleasant and everything coming up roses scenarios i very nearly gave up on this book after the prologue and the first few chaptersb however once charlie got to the special school the storytelling improved many folda dialogues the weakest part of the entire book all conversations seemed stiff contrived and unrealistic and this was a constant feature from beginning to end and because of this perceived weakness the character development and relationships between individuals didnt keep pace with the seriousness and progressive intrigue of the storyb the weak dialogues kept this from being much more than a young adult ya read a subjective opinion on my part other will likely disagreeimpressionsdespite my concerns i liked the charlie and her story and will continue to read the next volume hoping some of the forced and unnatural conversations will lessenas it is  to   starsray nicholsonralannicholsonread morecomment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to

safety what she wonders is if it runs in her familybut her parents dont seem to know about anyone that hasduring a celebratory family vacation charlie uses her abilities to protect a young woman who

to light in an attempt to discover more about who she is and what her powers can develop into charlie attends a school for people like her is this just like the school that professor xavier created or is something more sinister brewing between the glassed walls of the schooli was approached by the author about reading and reviewing this book though in complete honesty because of the genre of this series i probably would have enjoyed the premise even if i had found it myself the dialogue between the characters in the beginning of the book seemed a little forced and too perfect but as the book continued the conversations between characters evened out and became more natural so much so that i stopped noticing completely and was just sucked into the ploti definitely am interested in finding out how charlie madison and hillary return to the school how charlie helps her sister and how the outside team helps the girls a cliffhanger has left me wanting to know more about the characters that

subadvisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result there can be no assurance that the funds investment objectives will be achieved the fund is subject to market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by the fund or shares of the fund in general may fall in value some of the securities held by the fund may be illiquid preferred securities combine some of the characteristics of both common stocks and bonds preferred securities are typically subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a companys capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to greater credit risk than those debt instruments preferred securities are also subject to credit risk interest rate risk and income risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest andor principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result interest rate risk is the risk that the value of fixedincome securities in the fund will decline because of rising market interest rates income risk is the risk that income from the funds portfolio could decline if interest rates fall the fund may invest in high yield securities or junk bonds which are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher

companies in the financial sector which involves additional risks including limited diversification financial companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession currency exchange rates government regulation decreases in the availability of capital volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business the fund may invest in reits companies involved in the real estate industry are subject to changes in the real estate market vacancy rates and competition volatile interest rates and economic recession an investment in a fund containing securities of nonus issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting nonus issuers the fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market the fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash rather than inkind securities as a result the fund may be less taxefficient the fund is classified as nondiversified and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers as a result the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers first trust advisors lp is the adviser to the fund first

edition of our hedge fund portfolio tracking series if youre unfamiliar with tracking hedge fund movements or sec filings check out our series preface on hedge fund f filings the next hedge fund in our series is chase colemans tiger global coleman is a tiger cub because he learned to ply his trade under mentor julian robertson at tiger management however coleman is also a tiger seed in that he is one of the few managers that robertson actually seeded himself in an effort to recognize talent tiger global is one of the hedge funds that comprises the tiger cub portfolio created with alphaclone where you can replicate their positions and enjoy  annualized returns since  heres some wall street trivia for you which hedge fund manager is a descendant of peter stuyvesant the man who built the wall that gave wall street its name yep chase coleman chase attended williams college and his focus in the markets has always been on smaller cap names and on technology although he has since expanded his horizons in  tiger global returned  and from  coleman returned  on average this year started off rough for tiger as financial and reit short positions hurt portfolio performance something they talked about in a past investor letter in terms of recent portfolio activity out of tiger weve seen them selling longtop financial shares for quite some time now keep in mind that the positions listed below were tigers long equity note and options holdings as of september th  as filed with the sec we dont cover every single portfolio maneuver as we instead focus on all the big moves all holdings are common stock unless otherwise denoted some new positions brand new positions that they initiated last quarter pepsico nysepep monsanto nysemon yahoo yhoo electronic arts erts mcdonalds nysemcd

longtop financial lft  yahoo yhoo  discovery communications nasdaqdisck  qualcomm qcom  cablevision cvc  notable moves in hedge fund tiger globals portfolio include starting a brand new stake in pepsico pep and bringing it up to their fourth largest holding this could possibly be arbitrage driven as john paulsons hedge fund paulson  co detailed some pepsi arbitrage in their investor letter additionally tigers new stakes in yahoo yhoo and monsanto mon were pretty sizable and are worth mentioning as well their position in priceline pcln certainly fared well for them as shares have risen sharply over the past few months as such theyve reduced their position in it by  another change worth mentioning is their continued selling of longtop financial weve detailed those sales right after theyve happened given that tiger had to file amended ds on this position each time a major sale took place they also sold off nearly a third of their american tower amt position and we mention this because shares of amt have been a favorite stock amongst hedge funds and particularly amongst tiger cub hedge funds the only major position they sold completely out of was philip morris pm but even that was only a marginal position for them in the past at  of the portfolio previously assets from the collective holdings reported to the sec via f filing were  billion this quarter compared to  billion last quarter please keep in mind that when we state percentage of portfolio we are referring to the percentage of assets reported on the f filing since these filings only report longs and not shorts or cash positions the percentages are skewed also please again note that these positions were as of september th so two months have elapsed and theyve undoubtedly shifted around their portfolio since then this is just one of the  prominent funds that well be covering in our q  hedge fund portfolio series weve already covered seth klarmans baupost group bill ackmans pershing square stephen

management structure and procedures delaware requires that llcs have an operating agreement that will govern it however delaware does not require that the operating agreement be filed with the state or even be in writingit is recommended that you have a written signed agreement even in a singlemember delaware llc the operating agreement is important because it provides a decisionmaking structure that will benefit the llc when dealing with other entities increase protection and increase credibility for financial transactions the operating agreement will include provisions such as liability ownership dissolution and transfer of interest among othersmany incorporation services use boilerplate agreements without provisions to prevent common problems a wellcrafted delaware operating

llc you safeguard your personal assets by building a shield between them and your business liabilities this means that if the business itself cannot pay a creditor then this shield makes it difficult for creditors to penetrate into your personal assets such as your house car and other personal possessionsdelaware explicitly makes the “charging order” the sole and exclusive remedy for creditors of llc members this prevents creditors of your business partners from taking over the company creditors of a member can only get an economic interest in the llc’s distributions to that member not a control interest or a right to liquidate the llc delaware’s laws provide the strongest shield of any statedelaware governs the internal affairs of your company including its liability shield the
