slinkard the president of hecs stealthscreen for taking the time to answer a bunch of my questions about hecs desertrat  i was pleased to see real scientific research backing up your product is one of your biggest challenges overcoming hunters who have been burned on fads gadgets and “snake oil” in the beginning that was a huge problem we had a solution to a problem most hunters never recognized they had while all hunters have seen the effects of animals pickling up on their emitted em fields not many realized what they were seeing like any truly new innovation we were seen by many as the next great gimmick back when we launched hecs fortunately we found a few thousand open minded hunters who gave hecs a try and saw the difference right away it took a couple of years but now hecs is accepted as a valuable tool to help keep people more concealed from most types of animals to this day we almost never have a customer who used hecs as directed who has given a negative report in  we sold well over  suits and had a total of  negative reports from customers in the field our ace in the hole has always been that the technology truly works and that knowledge was what kept us going in those early days  what was the biggest challenge developing this product and getting it to market once we asked ourselves the question of why animals act the way they do when they get in close even when all conditions are right and further developed the then theory of electromagnetic fields being involved the greatest challenge was determining the correct grid size and conductivity necessary to attenuate those specific wavelengths of energy fortunately we had meters that could measure the fields emitted by humans and some great experts to help us develop the original hecs technology that is the basis for our  issued us patents once we were able to effectively attenuate these fields we were then able to prove the concept and the rest as they say is history  will this technology continue to evolve or is it cut and dried hecs technology is constantly evolving as we learn more and more about how it effects the users in different environments and for different purposes for instance once we developed hecs for land based use it became apparent that the technology would also be useful under water the challenge was that our grid had to be more conductive than the medium around it to be effective to overcome this we had to change the grid size and up the conductivity of the grid significantly but we were eventually able to get the same effect under water as we had seen topside more recently we have begun providing hecs technology to us special forces and police departments who need added concealment when in harm’s way we have begun development of specific fits and features on our tactical products to work best in these situations there is just so many different purposes for hecs technology that i doubt we will reach them all anytime soon  how will you diversify from here different patterns different products different markets we have already begun bringing hecs technology into several different markets hecs hunting hecs llc and hecs aquatic llc are both going strong and bringing the hecs advantage to hunters and divers all over the world recently we launched hecs tactical llc in response to demand from military operators who had tested and approved hecs technology as an advantage in that realm we chose aardvark tactical of laverne california to be the exclusive distributor of hecs technology to military and police units across the country coming soon will be hecs wildlife llc which we are very excited about hecs wildlife will be headed up by wellknown wildlife biologist forrest galante who is a wellrespected scientist and also a familiar face on animal planet nat geo wild and discovery channel hecs wildlife will be focused on anyone who wants to have closer safer and more enjoyable interaction with wildlife we think this may well be the biggest division of hecs over time with every division we are striving to bring the best quality products with features that our customers will appreciate on top of the advantage hecs technology affords  your basic setup includes pants shirt and headwear is effectiveness proportional to how completely you suit up in the hecs gear yes the more you cover the more effective hecs is this is especially true with birds like turkeys and waterfowl birds are proven to see electrical fields visually and as such it is these fields that birds can use to tell a living being and movement from living beings from inanimate objects and motions with birds it is essential that everything is covered in hecs for good results with animal species the smaller muscle regions like the hands and feet are somewhat less critical than with birds but still the more you cover the better the result the thing to remember with animals is that with the exception of the heart which produces large amounts of electrical energy proportionate to is size the intensity if the field is directly proportionate to the size of the muscle being flexed so shirt and pants are most important followed by head and neck and those smaller muscles like hands and feet being somewhat less critical but still highly recommended  what are you most proud of regarding your productcompany i am most proud of our team here at hecs we have been blessed with a very capable and highly intelligent group of men and women who have faced the challenges of developing and introducing an innovative but relatively unknown productconcept to market in the face of initial skepticism our team has not only taken on these challenges with fervor and optimism  but has succeeded beyond my greatest expectations we all knew we had something significant and a technology that could really help people to have better safer and more enjoyable interactions with animals birds and fish but it took a very special group of professionals to bring it to fruition  if you had an opportunity to talk with my readers who had never heard of your product what would you want them to know we realize many hunters have yet to be introduced to hecs technology and many are not aware the true effects that the em energy output of our bodies can have in their success in the woods i would urge them to go to our website at wwwhecsllccom and watch the videos and learn more about the difference hecs can make in their own adventures in a nutshell hecs simply makes you appear more like an inanimate object and helps you get closer and stay close longer than ever before  you’re a hunter – whats the dream hunt on your bucket list i have been extremely blessed to have been able to bowhunt all over the world and have taken some awesome trophies i have hunted in the majority of us states as well as new zealand africa  times canada and mexico i guess the one big dram animals i haven’t yet hunted would be the big brown bears of alaska there is just something about those giants and the danger involved with bowhunting them that has always intrigued me someday i will scratch that one off the list i’d really like to thank mike again for taking time out to answer a few questions what a cool product you can watch some videos about the technology and some real encounters in the field here hecs videos  comments may

the same process and standards as ammunition currently manufactured by the oem brands today the product can be used by a wide range of shooting consumers including recreational and target shooters hunters law enforcement military government agencies and more cleanshot sells for  on firefundercom talking with curt  how on earth did you think of this you know – the old story that it just came to me… sorta was at the shot show with a client and happen to see something then another and another for me  that day – it made perfect sense i was really into “if i had an idea i would write it down” on a small pad that i always carried at the time drew a few pictures made some notes – by the flight home i was on page  of a business plan spent a lot of time looking online then patent office – next thing you know it just took over i knew that it solves a number of issues would be easy to use and be cost effective that was about  years ago  what prompted you to develop the concept and go to market i am a firm believer in disruptive invention something that may be unconventional or “outside the box” to an industry that has done something the same way for hundreds of years – to me is exhilarating andor addicting i didn’t live inside that industry’s box – and wasn’t restrained to  walls i just went in and figured it out once i got into something that i felt would work i was completely hooked so mornings evenings and weekends were consumed with shotshells wads cad books and patent research its the thrill of the chase fast forward to today – we have made investments in large capacity molds for  gauge and production is in full scale production for an april  delivery  what next for your company will this technology work on rifled barrels to complete the shotgun market we have development scheduled for    and  lines for production we have mm prototype materials in hand and are excited to move into more handgun gauges such as mm and cal in  we also have  cad concepts moving forward with possible release dates in … and a few more innovative bore cleaning solutions up our sleeves… cant give it all away rifled barrels we have found the cleanshot® to be a very effective field cleaning device for rifled barrels we have tested on a number of shotgun brands with consistent results  does this product eliminate traditional bore cleaning or supplement it cleanshot® is a shootthrough field cleaning device after a day at the range clays in the field dogging birdswaterfowl or just plinking targets – simply load a cleanshot and safely fire the device is designed to scrub trap particles and wipe the bore clean huntego limited is an absolute advocate of scheduled bench cleaning when you have the time energy and funds to do so  what has been the most surprising challenge in getting the product to market oh that’s loaded question its been a really long educational eyeopening process – on so many fronts – as it should be we are talking ammunition products  for readers who have never heard of your company what would you want to tell them watch this space huntego limited has a number of new product innovations to release… changing the game forever we are extremely excited to enter the industry with a product like cleanshot and the possibilities that lie ahead thanks again to curt for taking the time to talk with me can’s wait to see the progress desertrat  comments jan   talking to the folks from swagger bipods posted by desert rat a big shout out to josh kinser the marketing director from performance plus outdoors for taking some time to talk to me about swagger bipods  what prompted you to go into bipods when our team first saw this idea and design – the versatility was unmatched by anything in the market we had never seen something that could adapt to adverse situations in the field we saw the opportunity to help hunters in a way that current bipods and shooting sticks currently cannot  what makes your design different everything – flexibility maneuverability change from flexible to rigid with a click no “bipod hop” the ability to adapt to the situation in the field as it happens and much more accessibility to a solid rest to complete the mission or fill the tag  what has been the biggest challenge you’ve faced getting these to market we make a lot of this bipod in the united states but that is a huge challenge because we get compared to products manufactured in china in both quality and price we are labeled as a “conventional bipod” and everybody thinks “oh this is just a bipod or a cheap shooting stick” we are a much higher end and versatile product than what most consumers are used to seeing  for someone not familiar with your company what would you want them to know swagger bipods is owned by performance plus outdoors which also owns big  j long range attractants and the given right a show hosted by kenneth lancaster and airing on the pursuit channel  whats next for swagger swagger is going to continue to be a leader of innovative products for the shooter and hunter we are going to continue to bring more and more products and are currently working on prototypes for   whats your favorite thing to hunt my favorite is whitetail hands down i love hunting them in different environments and especially love to rattle down here in texas outside of that i love the mountains – i’ve been on a couple of new zealand tahr hunts spike camping i would do that every year if i could  what’s the big dream hunt on your bucket list i can’t go with just one for my mountain hunts i really want to go after a midasian ibex and a dagestan tur for deer high on my list is getting a coues deer in the arizona mountains and hunting blacktails on kodiak island from their website “revolutionary crazy legs technology gives you shooting agility and flexibility like never before which will dramatically expand your shooting zone swagger replaces ordinary “stiff ” bipods and shooting sticks that have to be held to stabilize must be carried and are heavy noisy and limited in how they allow you to shoot swagger is the allterrain bipod and can do anything the others can do and a whole lot more with swagger you can raise up lower down slide left  inch right move forward lean back twist or contort as the shot calls for all thanks to flexible hyperextending crazy legs you can shoot prone sitting or standing without the need to hold or stabilize and swagger retracts into the chassis for easy quiet transport swagger’s legs retract into the chassis where they are concealed and protected and when you sling your firearm over your shoulder swagger won’t dig into it like other bipods can” learn more about the bipod on their website the ways it can move different shooting positions learn about the products watch swagger videos learn about the lifetime warranty finally you can shop online thanks again to josh for telling my readers more about these cool bipods desertrat  comments jan   a review – “buck buck moose” by hank shaw posted by desert rat i wanted to thank kathi johnson and hank shaw for getting me a copy of “buck buck moose” to review desert rat from the press release noted cookbook author and james beard awardwinning writer hank shaw has just released his third cookbook buck buck moose recipes and techniques for cooking deer elk moose antelope and other antlered things hh books  more than a cookbook buck buck moose is the first and only comprehensive guide to working with and cooking all forms of venison – and it’s available just in time for hunting season and the holidays in addition to more than  recipes the book includes − stories of the hunt and essays on why venison holds such a special place in society − instructions for butchering aging and storing your venison and how to handle all parts of the carcass including the odd bits − extensive section on curing venison and how to make sausages drycured salami and jerky − and… venison beer and wine pairings shaw takes the cookreader around the world from nose to tail with recipes from six continents for every part of the animal from the simple – country fried venison to the classic – steak diane to the unexpected – venison tripe neapolitan released in september this essential guide already has sold more than  copies and has received nearly  percent “ star reviews”  on amazon about hank shaw a former restaurant cook and journalist shaw is the author of three cookbooks hunt gather cook rodale  duck duck goose ten speed  and buck buck moose hh books  as well as the james beard awardwinning website hunter angler gardener cook honestfoodnet he has been featured in numerous major media outlets ranging from the new york times to npr and field  stream as well as on numerous television shows including travel channel’s bizarre foods and cnn’s somebody’s gotta do it with mike rowe his writings have appeared in food  wine organic gardening garden  gun petersen’s hunting the art of eating among others so first off – to call this book a “cook book” is to do it a huge disservice this is a coffee table book that happens to be full of amazing wild game recipes it’s a manual on how to care for you game in the field it is a primer on food safety it’s part technical guide part personal musings and partly a conversation with your butcher about what cuts work best for what the photography is amazing the recipes are exotic and homey and comforting and zesty at the time of the review i had an elk roast left in the freezer i’m usually not too big on roasts so i thought this would make for a good test case i picked the italian pot roast recipe as might be expected this recipe is a “redwiney tomatoey oreganothyme and rosemaryy” pot of goodness the roast came out tender and nicely flavored with lots of accompanying sauce to drizzle over the meat the recipes in this book are amazing literally a trip around the world these recipes account for different cuts of meat and different types of game from south african bobotie to massaman curry to icelandic venison with blueberry sauce there is something for every taste the book is smartly divided into sections of cuts – roasts loins primal cuts stews ribs meatballs etc if you’re one that likes the “wobbly bits” as hank calls them – heart liver kidneys etc – there is a whole section dedicated to those recipes my favorite section is the section on sausage i can’t wait to try all of those recipes my only concern with the book was that these recipes could be intimidating for the novice hunterchef rest assured these recipes are wellexplained and easy to follow anyone with the most basic level of skill in the kitchen will now have the ability to table some amazing fare – well beyond grilled steaks or spaghetti sauce that had become the staples for many of us even better – if you have someone in your circle of friends or family that turns up their nose at wild game – i guarantee you’ll find a cure for that somewhere in this book there are some amazing recipes in here and hank does a great job coaching the cook through the why and the how as well if you like to hunt moose deer caribou or antelope – this may well be the last book you’ll ever need to buy from the time the creature hits the ground until it lands on your table – hank has you covered the book is wellorganized with fantastic photography clear instructions and lots of narrative which provides a ton of info besides the actual recipe i would absolutely  recommend this book right now you can buy it on amazon for less than  bucks it will be the best  bucks you’ll ever spend – especially when it comes to putting game on the table  comments dec   a review – rugged maps posted by desert rat i’d like to thank the folks over at rugged maps for sending me one of their maps to review they were kind enough to send me one in time for my mule deer hunt in unit  here in arizona i hunt  quite a bit so this is a great map to review the first thing you notice about the map is the materialthese maps are printed on a tarplike material that appears to be almost indestructible i can tell you with confidence that you won’t poke a hole in it or tear it by accident i was able to write on the maps with a ballpoint pen pencil was a bit harder i couldn’t find any of my omnichrome or grease pencils to try on the map but i bet they would work fine i suppose you might be able to cut it with a blade or drive a screwdriver through it but i guarantee that you would be hardpressed to damage it through routine use rugged maps prints maps of game management units nautical charts topo maps noaa maps usgs  minute maps rm lite quadshiking maps and even custom maps you’d think that they might lose some detail in printing on material like this but the detail was great colors didn’t bleed terrain was clear lettering crisp everything was clear and identifiable the map i tested runs about  bucks and i think it is well worth it particularly if you hunt certain units extensively you’re not going to wear it out you’re not going to damage it the map is easy to refoldroll up and it comes with a carrying pouch i’d definitely recommend these maps check out rugged maps’ facebook page here  comments nov   review – when bears attack posted by desert rat a big shout out to jake klein from skyhorse publishing for sending me a copy of “when bears attack – close encounters of the terrifying kind” for review nearly every outdoor enthusiast has an interest in bears whether its a mutual predatory respect or an awestruck preoccupation or a flatout paralyzing fear – most of us like stories about bears lots of us like bear encounters – when they are sane and safe unfortunately not all encounters end well this book edited by joseph b healy is a great compilation of bear attack tales here is the release bears are one of nature’s apex predators gentle and magnificent to watch from a distance fierce and unpredictable when aroused if startled or frightened it’s often too late for humans to escape a dangerous fearsome or fatal bear encounter in this collection we gather the ultimate thrilling and frightening bearattack stories including classic stories of the past few decades joseph b healy takes a closer look at some of the notable bear attacks of recent history in order to determine their causes evaluate what happened and appreciate the raw power—and danger—of mother nature he tells tales of hikers enjoying weekend camping trips as well as workers going about their daily routines follow along as the victims’ lives are disrupted by bears and see how survivors were forced to think and act in the moment to stay alive as modern life continues to encroach on the wilderness and as bears make a resurgence across north america and due to development are forced to live proximate to mankind encounters between bears and humans will only increase and while you’re still less likely to be attacked by a bear than you are to be killed by a lightning strike any and all outdoorsmen and outdoorswomen will enjoy the raw power and potential lifesaving tips found in this ferocious account  about the editor joseph b healy has spent more than two decades in publishing editing outdoors magazines for much of that time his editorial career began at outdoor life and continued in flyfishing and lifestyle publishing he currently is editor of covey rise a magazine covering the lifestyle of international wing shooting healy is the author of training a young pointer and he has edited jesus on forgiveness and john stuart mill on liberty he lives with his wife son and bird dog in vermont i enjoyed the book immensely and one of the things i enjoyed most was the diversity of the stories some were funny some were pretty scary some were informative and some told a bigger story than that just of the bear there were bears in maine and bears in alaska there were bears in canada and california there was a great tale of an alcoholic bear in montana causing a ruckus that bear was finally shot stealing beer there’s a yarn about a fisherman’s wife who had two big fears – bears and bush planes her personal nightmare story included both there are stories of fatalities stories about cuts and bruises and stories where someone’s pride was the only thing injured regardless the stories are all entertaining all wellwritten and once you start a new chapter it is really hard to stop until you finish that particular tale you can practically smell the pines of the west or the dank forest floor in maine you can imagine the rancid breath of a puffing bruin as it chases you up a tree it’s likely you’ll learn a thing or two about bears and maybe a thing or two about people you’ll probably chuckle a time or two and maybe – just maybe – you’ll read something that will penetrate to one of those deep shadowy corners within your brain – and stay there if you’re a camper hiker fisherman or hunter that is interested in bears – i’d really recommend this book it’s a great one  comments nov   triclawps rifle rest – a review posted by desert rat i grew up in the northeast where most shots at deer or moose were in cedar swamps or across clearcuts sure some folks were adept practitioners of the long shot but realistically most hunters were happy to keep shots at  yards or less and it worked hunting the west is a whole different ballgame where i would say many shots are at greater than  yards most hunters i know regularly shoot big game at   even  yards – and that’s how they practice they’re not simply lobbing lead around – they are proficient at the long shot shooting at longer ranges means you need or should use every tool at your disposal – rangefinders scope turrets good optics and sturdy shooting platforms that’s where the triclawps comes in from their website “the triclawps adapter clamps to your rifles shotguns crossbows and even some handguns and lets you attach your firearm to any camera tripod doing so provides a stable rest regardless of the field conditions you’re hunting or shooting in sure it’s always best to get prone but in reality that’s not always possible triclawps is the best alternative to situations where prone doesn’t work and has consistently led to more hunters and shooters hitting more targets in difficult field conditions since we first started offering it” not too long after i started hunting in arizona my friends started telling me about triclawps most people hunting in arizona do a lot of glassing they already have a tripod triclawps offers a device that securely holds your rifle firmly onto your tripod providing a steady rest for those long shots my first real hunting experience with a triclawps was my daughter’s st javelina it was called the claw back then but it’s the same company same product my daughter was shooting a singleshot  using the claw we helped her get set up got the rifle mostly lined up and she took over for the shot after that hunt i saw it used successfully a number of times since then i have taken a javelina and an elk with mine the elk in particular was a pretty steep downhill shot these are very wellmade and are also equipped with speed clamps to get them on and off your rifle quickly i have mine set up on an extra quickchange plate for my tripod this makes it easy to swap binos for the rifle pretty quickly if you are helping new hunters or are making shots in difficult terrain or making long shots where you need an extra sturdy rest i would highly recommend picking up a triclawps they retail for about  bucks and they are worth every penny they are a sturdy precisely made piece of equipment of a high quality if you need a tripod the folks at tri clawps can provide those as well again from the triclawps website  triclawps is made of a highdensity glassreinforced resin that is light weight and tough enough to handle the recoil from the largest mangum rifles the standard ″  threading ensures your system will work on any camera tripod triclawps comes with a lifetime no fault no questions asked warranty  comments nov   replaceable blade knife review – the vixen from wiebe posted by desert rat i’d like to really thank glenn walker from the providence marketing group and also the folks at wiebe knives for sending me a vixen folding knife to try per the press release the vixen joins the wiebe knives lineup lennox sd — wiebe knives® the replaceableblade knife category leader in durability and value has added the vixen to its extensive and diverse category hunting fielddressing and skinning knives every aspect of the wiebe vixen is designed under one simple premise don’t fight the knife the vixen features a folding replaceableblade design sporting a surgicalgrade scalpel for a longlasting and consistent edge to work with and when the blade does become dull simply dispose of the old blade and insert a new wickedsharp blade no more wasted time sharpening afield and no more messy precision work due to a dull blade wiebe’s replacement blades are designed to withstand the toughest field work by the most serious hunters as well as the lightest precision work done by the most detailoriented fur skinners when open the vixen measures  inches and sports a featherweight ergonomic handle for comfortable use on long jobs and the folding design makes the vixen the perfect takeanywhere companion the knife comes with  wickedsharp replacement blades msrp for the wiebe vixen replaceableblade folding knife is  about wiebe knives the entire collection of products from wiebe knives—including hunting knives fielddressing knives skinning knives and an extensive lineup of furhandling tools—were developed tested and proven by harduse hunters and trappers wiebe’s mission is simple to provide tools of exceptional quality at an unbeatable value the knife comes with extra blades right out of the gate so that’s a good thing the first thing i noticed is that although the knife is light the handle is thicker than many of competitor’s knives handles and it is contoured with finger grooves this handle is welldesigned to be easy to hold when covered in blood wet cold etc the knife feels great in the hand the blade changes easily with some replaceableblade knives this is a challenge not so with the vixen blade changes are pretty easy once you get the hang of it some replaceable blades seem to be brittle and snap at the first bit of twisting i pushed and twisted on these a fair amount with no blades snapped finally this knife just plain looks good the wood handle is attractive and the whole knife is welldesigned i couldn’t wait to get it into the field typically when i do a review i like to really give it a good going over on my bench or at the table then i like to use it in the field this time i had something happen that hasn’t happened in over  decades of outdoor writing i lost the product i don’t know if someone moved it i don’t know if someone took it i can’t explain it i came home from a scouting trip and i had  knives on my belt including the vixen i took them both off and put them on the counter in the regular spot a week later one knife was there the other one wasn’t i literally tore the house apart trying to find that knife to no avail i was heartsick i did use the knife enough to know that i want one and i will be purchasing one soon from their online store replacement blades are about  bucks per dozen – a very reasonable price if you are in the market for a replaceable blade knife i strongly suggest you look at the vixen or one of the other great models from wiebe knives the price at  dollars is reasonable for such a welldesigned sturdy knife blades are scalpelsharp as you would expect and the knife handles very well the thick contoured handle will come in handy when your hands are cold or covered in blood well done wiebe i’ll have another vixen with me when i head out to chase javelina in february i’ll be sure to post a followup report from the field  comments nov   testing the pine mountain® extremestart™ firestarter posted by desert rat a shout out to the folks from pine mountain fire for sending me this great firestarter to try out the extremestart firestarter seemed like a great addition to any camping trip or backyard bonfire so i thought i would give it a try from the press release are you tired of collecting kindling only to have an even harder time starting your fire kindling can be a conundrum not only can it be difficult to collect and light but sometimes it’s unclear whether it may cause more harm than good thanks to the new extremestart firestarter from pine mountain you can get the fire started in no time and without the fear of potential toxins about the size of a candy bar the extremestart firestarter is all natural portable and easytouse simply place one firestarter among your wood or coals and light for a perfect flame whether you’re using it for tailgating huntingcamping trips or fire pit entertaining the extremestart firestarter is a musthave for an unforgettable fire this fall enjoy a good fire with the simple strike of a match—anytime anywhere • for indoor or outdoor use—fireplaces fire pits charcoal grills chimineas wood barbeque grills and smokers • clean burning and odorless with less flareup • fits most grates the first thing i noticed about the firestarters is that they were clean and easy to handle best of all – they have a pleasant smell most firestarters i have tried had at best – a weird odor my first test was in my chimneystyle charcoal lighter not quite per directions i broke one in half and put the two pieces in the bottom f the chimney and filled it with charcoal i lit with a match through the bottom and within  minutes my charcoal was ready easy for the next test i wanted to utilize two guest reviewers my coworker amy was going camping with her family and i thought her kids katie and lucas might like to help me test the firestarters according to katie and lucas “the firestarter didn’t work as good as pine needles but it did work good” they stated that an added benefit was that mom didn’t make them go gather tinder when using the firestarters awesome guest review by year old katie and year old lucas they are great kids active in girl scouts and boy scouts doing good in school and more… i was grateful for their help finally i was on a hunting trip myself and we camped in the desert we had a campfire each night – there is nothing better than steak cooked over mesquite coals getting the fire going was super easy i put a firestarter at the bottom and arranged the kindling over it teepee style lit the corner of the wrapper and soon we had a crackling fire these things work great they would be especially useful if you were trying to start a fire in cold andor wet conditions pine mountain makes a number of great products related to making fire in the great outdoors like they say on their homepage “deep in our genetic code burns a desire to be near the warm glow of a flame strike a match and feed your soul”  comments « older entries    connect with me archive archives  select  july
