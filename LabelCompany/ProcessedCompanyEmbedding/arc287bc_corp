consider each of the following risk factors and any other information set forth herein and in our reports filed with the sec including our financial statements and related notes in evaluating our business and prospects the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that impact on our operations and business additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business or operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business and financial results or prospects could be harmed in that case the value of the common stock could decline risks related to our company and business if we do not obtain additional financing our business development plans will be delayed and we may not achieve profitable operations we will require significant additional capital to execute on our business development plans we intend to seek additional funds through private placements of our common stock or other securities our business plan calls for incurring expenses for development of our intellectual property brand website design manufacture and product packing as well as ongoing expenses for marketing staff and administration if no additional financing is secured we may have to significantly curtail our plan of operations if that is the case our business will not grow as desired our ability to raise additional financing is unknown we do not have any formal commitments or arrangements for the advancement of funds consequently there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain access to capital as and when needed or if so that the terms of any available financing will be commercially reasonable if we are unable to raise suitable financing our business development plans may be delayed and we may be unable to achieve profitable operations since we have a limited operating history and insignificant revenues to date we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays frequently encountered by an emerging growth company we have limited financial resources and limited revenues to date the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays frequently encountered by an emerging growth company starting a new business enterprise and the highly competitive environment in which we will operate since we have a limited operating history we cannot assure you that our business will be profitable or that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to fully meet our expenses and totally support our anticipated activities our ability to continue as a business and implement our business plan will depend on our ability to raise sufficient funds there is no assurance that any debt or equity offerings will be successful or that we will remain in business or be able to implement our business plan if the offerings are not successful or if we are unable to successfully market our products or our products do not perform as expected our business and financial condition will be adversely affected because of pressures from competitors with more resources we may fail to implement our business strategy profitably our business and growth may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees our success depends on the expertise and continued service of our chief executive officer wilson x bezerra this individual is a significant factor in our growth and ability to meet our business objectives it may be difficult to find a sufficiently qualified individual to replace mr bezerra in the event of death disability or resignation resulting in our inability to implement our business plan and even a complete cessation of our operations which would likely to result in the total loss of an investors investment furthermore our ability to expand operations to accommodate our anticipated growth will also depend on our ability to attract qualified employees however competition for these types of employees is intense due to the limited number of qualified professionals our ability to meet our business development objectives will depend in part on our ability to recruit train and retain top quality people who understand our business we hope that we will be able to attract competent employees but no assurance can be given that we will be successful in this regard if we are unable to engage and retain the necessary personnel our business may be adversely affected which may be material risks related to legal uncertainty if we are the subject of significant future product liability or related lawsuits our business will likely fail our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain and may be inadequate which would have a material and adverse effect on us our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products we currently have one patent issued and another patent pending thus we cannot assure you that we will be able to control all of the rights for all of our intellectual properties if we rely on patent protection as well as a combination of copyright trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology including our licensed technology however these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be timeconsuming and expensive competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products which provide outcomes which are comparable or even superior to ours steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology including entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with some of our officers employees consultants and advisors may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in the event a competitor infringes upon our licensed or pending patent or other intellectual property rights enforcing those rights may be costly uncertain difficult and time consuming even if successful litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge could be expensive and time consuming and could divert our managements attention we may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents rights against a challenge the failure to obtain patents andor protect our intellectual property rights could have a material and adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we may become subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others which could prohibit us from developing our products require us to obtain licenses from third parties or to develop noninfringing alternatives and subject us to substantial monetary damages third parties could in the future assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to products we develop whether a product infringes a patent or misappropriates other intellectual property involves complex legal and factual issues the determination of which is often uncertain therefore we cannot be certain that we have not infringed the intellectual property rights of others our potential competitors may assert that some aspect of our product infringes their patents because patent applications may take years to issue there also may be applications now pending of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents upon which our products could infringe there also may be existing patents or pending patent applications of which we are unaware upon which our products may inadvertently infringe any infringement or misappropriation claim could cause us to incur significant costs place significant strain on our financial resources divert managements attention from our business and harm our reputation if the relevant patents in such claim were upheld as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe them we could be prohibited from selling any product that is found to infringe unless we could obtain licenses to use the technology covered by the patent or are able to design around the patent we may be unable to obtain such a license on terms acceptable to us if at all and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement a court could also order us to pay compensatory damages for such infringement plus prejudgment interest and could in addition treble the compensatory damages and award attorney fees these damages could be substantial and could harm our reputation business financial condition and operating results a court also could enter orders that temporarily preliminarily or permanently enjoin us and our customers from making using or selling products and could enter an order mandating that we undertake certain remedial activities depending on the nature of the relief ordered by the court we could become liable for additional damages to third parties we have limited existing brand identity and customer loyalty if we fail to market our brand to promote our service offerings our business could suffer because of our limited operating history we currently do not have strong brand identity or brand loyalty we believe that establishing and maintaining brand identity and brand loyalty is critical to attracting customers to our program in order to attract copyright holders to our program we may be forced to spend substantial funds to create and maintain brand recognition among consumers we believe that the cost of our sales campaigns could increase substantially in the future if our branding efforts are not successful our ability to earn revenues and sustain our operations will be harmed promotion and enhancement of our services will depend on our success in consistently providing highquality services to our customers since we rely on technology partners to provide portions of the service to our customers if our suppliers do not send accurate and timely data or if our customers do not perceive the products we offer as superior the value of our brand could be harmed any brand impairment or dilution could decrease the attractiveness of our services to one or more of these groups which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition our service offerings may not be accepted as is typically the case involving service offerings anticipation of demand and market acceptance are subject to a high level of uncertainty the success of our service offerings primarily depends on the interest of copyright holders in joining our service in general achieving market acceptance for our services will require substantial marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant funds the availability of which we cannot be assured to create awareness and demand among customers we have limited financial personnel and other resources to undertake extensive marketing activities accordingly we cannot assure you that any of our services will be accepted or with respect to our ability to generate the revenues necessary to remain in business offering summary the following summary highlights selected information contained in this offering circular this summary does not contain all the

through the offering the costs associated with operating as a public company are included in all our budgeted scenarios and management is responsible for the preparation of the required documents to keep the costs to a minimum although we have no minimum offering we have calculated use of proceeds such that if we raise  of the offering is budgeted to sustain operations for a twelvemonth period  of the maximum offering is sufficient to keep the company current with its public listing status costs with prudently budgeted funds remaining which will be sufficient to complete the development of our marketing package if the company were to raise  of the maximum offering then we would be able to expand our marketing outside the us raising the maximum offering will enable the company to

calculation and division of funds on the current needs of the company however our market place is constantly changing management may depending on circumstances be required to divert funds from one heading to another as the business demands for example successful expanded marketing in the us may require us to use more resources in it to keep up with demand likewise if our marketing efforts are

and reduce stress on the joints of the arms legs and back our patent holders have assigned our patent rights to arcbc corporation       on august   arcbc corporation filed international application  pctus specifically we have placed this technology into the archimedesbc stepper bicycle allowing the bicycle to exceed speeds well above the conventional bike with greater ease and greater safety at present we have produced two different stepper bicycle prototypes both prototypes have been tested and driven verifying that this mechanism produces nearly a  to  advantage over the conventional bike and reduces or eliminates frame and fork failure this force coupled with its ergonomic advantages could potentially render the conventional rotary crank obsolete more data and testimonials can be found on our website wwwarcbccom we focus on both design and technology and strive to make our products superior to our competition we are a startup and we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering to place our mechanism into all of our humanpowered vehicles at present we have designs for four additional products and preliminary drawings for three other products our company has an extensive plan which includes a comprehensive growth strategy our technology has so many useful applications to humanpowered vehicles that make their use so easy that they can even be driven by people with mobility problems we plan to license this manpower transportation technology worldwide to propel our company forward even though our patent is for  years our income projection for our company is based on  years and the initial licensing of only five  of our products it does not include the additional three products that we have only preliminary drawings for we also did not factor in those that are physically challenged and the baby boomers who suffer from joint and back problems that will now be able to enter the market and utilize our products our projection of  billion is based on
