any forward looking statements made by or on our behalf we disclaim any obligation to update forward looking statements overview yummy flies inc we our or the company was incorporated on december   in the state of colorado under the name yummiefliescom inc in march  we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation changing our name to yummy flies inc in september  we engaged in a forward split of our issued and outstanding common stock whereby nine  shares of common stock were issued in exchange for every one  share then issued and outstanding all references to our issued and outstanding common stock in this report are presented on a postforward split basis unless otherwise indicated since inception our business has been to establish an online fly fishing company specializing in marketing trout flies we also plan to market a series of fly tying dvds our principal marketing efforts are directed to the postwar baby boomers we have never been subject to any bankruptcy proceeding our executive offices are located at  south lamar ct lakewood co  telephone   our cost of sales during the fiscal years ended december   and  was  and  respectively consequently our gross profit for the fiscal years ended december   and  was  and  respectively our general and administrative expense during our fiscal year ended december   was  compared to  during our fiscal year ended december   a decrease of  this decrease was primarily as a result of reduced legal fees incurred during  as a result we incurred a net loss of  during the year ended december   less than  per share compared to a net loss of  during the year ended december   the following is our plan of operation    plan of operation we are currently marketing a series of fly fishing flies under the titles of yummy tandem flies natural selection and canyon magic we attempt to create our flies with a degree of realism specifically most flies are tied with thread dubbing and feathers and fur our natural selection flies are tied with latex and microfibetts to form a smooth translucent body with realistic wings and legs the tandem flies are tied with two and even three bodies of nymphs andor larva flies on the same hook shank traditional flies are tied one fly body at a time on the hook each series is tied by one of our founders in addition we have produced a series of five fly tying dvds entitled the natural selections series which demonstrates how to tie our line of realistic midge mysis shrimp caddis baetis and scud patterns a dvd was initially produced on a limited run basis by mr yamauchi to test the viability of marketing a series of fly tying dvds that showed how to tie his signature patterns this was marketed at the international sportsman expo in denver colorado in  and at the west denver trout unlimited annual fly tying clinic held in  we intend to place all of our videos in area fly shops during  however as of the date of this report we have no arrangement with any area fly shops to sell our dvds as stated above we estimate we will require up to  in additional capital in order to fully implement our business plan as described in this report these funds are proposed to be utilized for our development and expansion from just a retail web based business to a retail and wholesale operation including the following proposed use of proceeds i approximately  to purchase raw materials that we utilize in the manufacturing of our flies in bulk including hooks latex gloves and other related materials included in this category would be the identification of a manufacturer who can produce our custom made ties in bulk by developing and utilizing injection molding with soft polyurethane plastics and polmers in order to establish an expanded inventory of our ties we currently do not have the capacity to fill a large order that we might receive from a large retail fishing business ii  for the development and marketing of additional dvds iii approximately  to increase our inventory of custom ties including the development of relationships with other established ties designers and retention of additional employees to assist in these expanded operations it is anticipated that these new employees will have accounting experience as well as sales and marketing experience iv approximately  for expansion of our existing website from a retail based marketing vehicle into a retail and wholesale marketing operation and v approximately  to accomplish the acquisition of related businesses and provide working capital to these business upon acquisition the balance of funds  would be utilized for working capital if we can raise only between  and  we believe we can successfully accomplish the objectives outlined in i and iii and become profitable once profitable we believe there are opportunities that will arise to expand our business without this additional capital but over a longer period of time this includes acquiring competitors in exchange for issuance of our securities however there can be no assurances that we will be able to raise the capital required to accomplish these objectives or if we are so successful in raising such capital that we will be able to implement our business plan see part i item  business we estimate that it will take approximately  years for us to accomplish all of the objectives described in the preceding paragraph provided that we are able to raise  we believe the most time consuming aspect of our business plan is the identification of a manufacturing entity either in the us or overseas that can develop the molds and then begin manufacturing our ties to our specifications we estimate that this will take a minimum of two years following this development we also estimate that it will take another year in which to develop the sales and marketing to sell these products as previously stated there are no assurances that our estimates are accurate or that we will be able to raise the funds necessary to accomplish these objectives because of our relatively low cost of operations we believe that if we are only able to raise between  and  we will continue to be a retail web based business but we will not be able to afford expanding into the wholesale market while no assurances can be provided with an additional  in equity capital we believe we would be able to successfully increase our inventory of fishing flies and as a result we believe that the revenues generated from the sale of these flies will be sufficient to allow us to break even or generate nominal profits there can be no assurances that this will occur for a more detailed description of our business and its development see part i item  business hereinabove    liquidity and capital resources at december   we had  in cash net cash used in operating activities was  during the fiscal year ended december   compared to  during  we anticipate that overhead costs in current operations will increase in the future as a result of our anticipated increased marketing activities cash flows provided or used in investing activities were  during the years ended december   and  cash flows provided or used by financing activities were  and  during  and  respectively and related to advances we received from one of our shareholders to date our operations have been limited and we have generated limited revenues we believe that our principal difficulty has been the lack of available capital to operate and expand our business we believe we need a minimum of approximately  in additional working capital to be utilized for marketing and sales of our existing products including hiring a marketingsales person advertising brochures and a presence at fly shows booth space estimated cost of  generate an inventory of dvds and flies  and develop a marketing kit for distribution  with the balance for working capital and general and administrative expense as described above under plan of operation we also believe we will require a total of up to  in additional capital to fully implement our business plan as described herein while no assurances can be provided we believe that if we are only able to raise  we should be able to successfully increase our inventory of fishing flies and as a result we believe that the revenues generated from the sale of these flies will be sufficient to allow us to continue to grow see part i item  business we lack a market presence that is needed in order for us to succeed as of the date of this report we have no commitment from any investor or investmentbanking firm to provide us with the necessary funding and there can be no assurances we will obtain such funding in the future failure to obtain this additional financing will have a material negative impact on our ability to generate profits in the fututed inflation although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during the year ended december   critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain leases  we follow the guidance in sfas no  accounting for leases as amended which requires us to evaluate the lease agreements we enter into to determine whether they represent operating or capital leases at the inception of the lease    recent accounting pronouncements under the jumpstart our business startups act or the jobs act we meet the definition of an emerging growth company we have irrevocably elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to section b of the jobs act as a result we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non emerging growth companies offbalance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of

company description we were incorporated on december   in the state of colorado under the name “yummiefliescom inc” in march  we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation changing our name to “yummy flies inc” since inception we have been engaged in marketing and selling our fly fishing ties that have been developed by our management the cost of our products is higher than customary due to the amount of time it takes to produce our ties as well as the quality of raw material utilized each of our flies is hand crafted in order to look like the bugs that fish feed upon our management believes that customary over the counter flies are mass produced with thread and feathers fur or hair our marketing efforts to date have been limited by our limited available capital our principal marketing efforts have been by word of mouth including exposure of our products at area fly tying clinics where our management has been and continues to be invited to appear about six times per year as a cost free featured tier at local fly shops where these shops have promoted their appearance in order to allow them to demonstrate their fly tying abilities we also have marketed our products through our website and to a limited extent our participation at various industry shows messrs okizaki and coleman two of our officers and directors are professional fishing guides and have introduced our flies to their patrons on their fishing excursions mr yamauchi has given them to friends and acquaintances including our shareholders that fish based upon the response we received initially from the fisherman on these excursions and other friends and family members we decided to attempt to initially market our products on a regional basis throughout the rocky mountain area an established trout fishing region the most important attribute of our flies that needed to be initially determined was simply that they had to catch fish regardless of the level of competency of the fisherman we examined answers to several questions including i were the flies successful in catching trout our target species and did they catch fish regardless of who was fishing them and ii more importantly did the fisherman fishing our fly’s think they were worth the extra cost and would they buy them we believe the natural fly selection was a success for all fishermen under varied weather conditions water conditions and light these results are our opinion only and there were no formal independent tests conducted on any of our flies there are no assurances that future performance will be consistent with the initial results even if the fishermen who thought our flies were worth the extra cost and they would purchase our flies there are no assurances they will actually do so when we provided samples of our flies to other fisherman and when these ties were used by our management the natural flies caught on average more trout than the fisherman who used them had caught on other patterns in these situations our yummy tandem flies and canyon magic caught less fish that when the natural fly ties were used but still caught fish there can be no assurances that these results will be duplicated in
