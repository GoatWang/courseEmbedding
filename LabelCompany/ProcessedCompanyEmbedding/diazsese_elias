foundations and events tim horton children’s foundation camp daytimbits minor sportsand the famous smile cookiethe customers of tim hortons recognize the support and advocacy that your company provides to help sustain strong communities however there is one large gap that i would like to address in the company and that is the lack of vegan options on the menu veganism a way of living which seeks to exclude as far as is possible and practicable all forms of exploitation of and cruelty to animals for food clothing or any other purpose it is  and there are a ton of milk egg and cheese
