relative to capital expenditures capital expenditures are funds used by a company to acquire or upgrade physical assets such as property industrial buildings equipment or a new business as the age of capital assets approaches record highs and companies look to grow their businesses through capital reinvestment companies increasing capital expenditures may be poised to outperform the broader market the companies selected for the trust have been researched and evaluated using databased screening techniques fundamental analysis and the judgment of the sponsors research team portfolio selection strategy to select the portfolio the sponsor begins with the nasdaq us capex achieverstm index which is an index comprised of us exchangelisted equities the uslisted common stocks held by the trust may include the common stocks of us and nonus companies the index selects issuers that have recently increased capital expenditures have historically generated high returns on invested capital and meet certain market capitalization and liquidity requirements finally the sponsor utilizes fundamental analysis to further narrow the universe of securities the final portfolio includes companies that the sponsor believes will meet the trusts investment objective the sponsor will also consider a range of factors such as competitive advantage industry or sector leadership andor betterthanaverage

initial offering period legislation and litigation from time to time various legislative initiatives or regulatory standards are proposed in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the companies represented in the trust in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the industries represented by such issuers may negatively impact the value of these securities we cannot predict what impact any pending or proposed legislation or pending or threatened litigation will have on the value of the securities inflation risk inflation

remaining deferred sales charge and the creation and development fee cd fee as described below the percentage and dollar amount of the initial sales charge will vary as the unit price varies and after deferred charges begin despite the variability of the initial sales charge each investor is obligated to pay the entire applicable total sales charge  the deferred sales charge is fixed at  per unit

the estimated organization costs include the amount per unit paid by the trust at the earlier of the end of the initial offering period or after six months  since certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts if the trust does not reach a certain size or falls below such size over its life the actual amount of the operating expenses may in some cases greatly exceed the amounts reflected to the extent the actual operating expenses are greater than the estimated amount only the estimated operating expenses will be charged to the trust any operating expenses exceeding this estimate will be borne by the sponsor other operating expenses do not include brokerage costs and other transactional fees but may include global custody charges  although not an actual trust operating expense the trust and therefore the unitholders of the trust will indirectly bear similar operating expenses of the etfs held by the trust in the estimated amount provided above estimated etf expenses are based upon the net asset value of the number of etf shares held by the trust per unit multiplied by the annual operating expenses of the etfs for the most recent fiscal year unitholders will therefore indirectly pay higher expenses than if the underlying etfs were held directly please note that the sponsor or an affiliate may be engaged as a service provider to certain etfs held by your trust and therefore certain fees paid by your trust to such etfs will be paid to the sponsor or an affiliate for its services of such etfs example this example helps you compare the cost of the trust with other unit trusts and mutual funds in the example the sponsor assumes that you reinvest your investment in a new trust every other year at a reduced sales charge and that the trusts annual return is  your

transmit the orders that they receive to the sponsor in a timely manner certain brokerdealers and clearing firms may charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit purchase orders units of a trust are available for purchase through financial professionals including the sponsor and are not available for purchase directly from the trust value of the securities the sponsor determines the value of the securities as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that exchange is open the sponsor generally determines the value of securities using the last sale price for securities traded on a national securities exchange for this purpose the trustee provides the sponsor with closing prices from a reporting service approved by the sponsor in some cases the sponsor will price a security based on its fair value after considering appropriate factors relevant to the value of the security this will only be done if a security is not principally traded on a national securities exchange or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate the sponsor determined the initial prices of the securities shown under portfolio for your trust in this prospectus as described above at the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on the business day before the date of this prospectus on the first day the sponsor sells units it will compute the unit price as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission becomes effective if later organization costs during the initial offering period part of the public offering price of the units represents an amount that will pay the costs of creating your trust these costs include the

units will decline when your trust pays these costs organization costs will only be included in the public offering price during the initial offering period transactional sales charge you pay a fee when you buy units we refer to this fee as the transactional sales charge the transactional sales charge has both an initial and a deferred component and is  of the public offering price based on a  unit this percentage amount of the transactional sales charge is based on the unit price on the inception date because the transactional sales charge equals the difference between the maximum sales charge and the cd fee the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales charge will vary as the unit price varies the transactional sales charge does not include the cd fee which is described under fee table in this prospectus initial sales charge based on a  unit the initial sales charge is equal to  of the public offering price the initial sales charge which you will pay at the time of purchase is equal to the difference between the maximum sales charge  of the public offering price and the sum of the maximum remaining deferred sales charges and the cd fee initially  per unit the dollar amount and percentage amount of the initial sales charge will vary over time deferred sales charge to keep your money working longer we defer payment of the rest of the transactional sales charge through the deferred sales charge  per unit in limited circumstances and only if deemed in the best interests of unitholders the sponsor may delay the payment of the deferred sales charge

sales such as the costs of developing trading or purchasing trading systems to process unit trades payments of such additional compensation some of which may be characterized as revenue sharing may create an incentive for financial intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend an elkhorn product including your trust over products offered by other sponsors or fund companies these arrangements will not change the price you pay for your units we generally register units for sale in various states in the united states we do not register units for sale in any foreign country it is your financial professionals responsibility to make sure that units are registered or exempt from registration if you are a foreign investor or if you want to buy units in another country this prospectus does not constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be offered or sold lawfully we may reject any order for units in whole or in part we may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary market due to fluctuations in unit prices the gain or loss is equal to the difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or redeem them we may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to create units for example we lost the amount set forth in each trusts trust portfolio on the initial deposit of securities into each trust how to sell your units you can sell your units on any business day by contacting your financial professional or in some cases the trustee unit prices are available daily on the internet at wwwelkhorncomuits or through your financial professional we often refer to the sale price of units as the liquidation price you pay any remaining deferred sales charge when you sell or redeem your units certain brokerdealers may charge a transaction fee for processing unit redemptions or sale requests until the end of the initial offering period or six months after the inception date at the discretion of the sponsor the price at which the trustee will redeem units and the price at which the sponsor may repurchase units include estimated organization costs after such period the amount paid will not include such estimated organization costs selling units the sponsor may maintain a secondary market for units this means that if you want to sell your units the sponsor may buy them at the current net asset value or liquidation price depending on whether or not your trust is in its initial offering period the sponsor may then resell the units to other investors at the public offering price or redeem them for the redemption price after the close of the initial offering period the sale and redemption price of units is equal to the net asset value per unit during the initial offering period the sale and redemption price of units is equal to the net asset value per unit less the total of any deferred sales charges and cd fees during the initial offering period the sale and redemption price is sometimes referred to as the liquidation price certain brokerdealers might also maintain a secondary market in units you should contact your financial professional for current repurchase prices to determine the best price available the sponsor may discontinue the secondary market at any time without notice even if the sponsor does not make a market you will be able to redeem your units with the trustee on any business day for the current redemption price redeeming units you may also redeem your units directly with the trustee on any day the new york stock exchange is open you will receive the redemption price for a particular day if the trustee receives your completed redemption request prior to the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange redemption requests received by authorized financial professionals prior to the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange that are properly transmitted to the trustee by the time designated by the trustee are priced based on the date of receipt redemption requests received by the trustee after the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange redemption requests received by authorized financial professionals after that time or redemption requests received by such persons that are not transmitted to the trustee until after the time designated by the trustee are priced based on the date of the next determined redemption price provided they are received in a timely manner by the trustee on such date it is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit redemption requests received by them to the trustee so they will be received in a timely manner if your request is not received in a timely manner or is incomplete in any way you will receive the next redemption price computed after the trustee receives your completed request if you redeem your units the trustee will generally send you a payment for your units no later than seven days after it receives all necessary documentation this will usually only take three business days the only time the trustee can delay your payment is if the new york stock exchange is closed other than weekends or holidays the securities and exchange commission determines that trading on that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists making sale or evaluation of the securities not reasonably practicable and for any other period that the securities and exchange commission permits inkind distribution you can request an inkind distribution of the securities underlying your units if you tender at least  units for redemption or such other amount as required by your financial professionals firm or clearing firm this option is generally available only for securities traded and held in the united states the trustee will make any inkind distribution of securities by distributing applicable securities in bookentry form to the account of your financial professional at the depository trust company you will receive whole shares of the applicable securities and cash equal to any fractional shares you may not request this option in the last  days of your trusts life the sponsor may discontinue this option upon  days notice rollover the trust strategy is a longterm investment strategy designed to be followed on an annual basis you may achieve more consistent longterm investment results by following this strategy as part of the strategy the sponsor currently intends to offer a subsequent series of the trusts for a rollover investment when the current trusts terminate however it is possible that a future run of your trust strategy may produce results that could make the offering of a subsequent series of such trust impossible at trust termination you must therefore be aware that a future series of your trust may not be available for a rollover investment when a trust terminates you may have the option to participate in a rollover and have your units reinvested into a subsequent trust series through a rollover as described in this section if you elect to participate in the rollover your units will be invested in the subsequent series of your trust on the trusts termination date upon termination the value of your units will be invested in a new trust series if available at the public offering price of the new trust the trustee will attempt to sell securities to satisfy the redemption as quickly as practicable on the termination date the sponsor does not anticipate that the sale period will be longer than one day however certain factors could affect the ability to sell the securities and could impact the length of the sale period the liquidity of any security depends on the daily trading volume of the security and the amount available for redemption and reinvestment on any day the sponsor intends to make subsequent trust series available for sale at various times during the year of course the sponsor cannot guarantee that a subsequent trust or sufficient units will be available or that any subsequent trust will offer the same investment strategy or objectives as the current trust the sponsor cannot guarantee that a rollover will avoid any negative market price consequences resulting from trading large volumes of securities market price trends may make it advantageous to sell or buy securities more quickly or more slowly than permitted by the trusts procedures the sponsor may in its sole discretion modify a rollover or stop creating units of your trust at any time regardless of whether all proceeds of unitholders have been reinvested in a rollover the sponsor may decide not to offer the rollover upon  days notice cash that has not been reinvested in a rollover will be distributed to unitholders shortly after the termination date rollover participants may receive taxable dividends or realize taxable capital gains that are reinvested in connection with a rollover but may not be entitled to a deduction for capital losses due to the wash sale tax rules due to the reinvestment in a subsequent trust no cash will be distributed to pay any taxes see taxes distributions distributions you can elect to o reinvest distributions in additional units of your trust at no fee or o receive distributions in cash your trust generally pays distributions of its net investment income along with any excess capital on each distribution date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date the record and distribution dates are shown under essential information for the trust in some cases your trust might pay a special distribution if it holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution for example this could happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction involving a company whose stock is in your portfolio the amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as companies change their dividends or trust expenses change when a trust receives dividends from a portfolio security the trust credits the dividends to the trusts accounts distributions will be made from such accounts on the distribution date provided the aggregate amount available for distribution equals at least  of the net asset value of the trust undistributed money in the accounts will be distributed in the next month in which the aggregate amount available for distribution equals or exceeds  of the net asset value of your trust reinvest in your trust you can keep your money working by electing to reinvest your distributions in additional units of the trust the easiest way to do this is to have your financial professional purchase units with one of the reinvestment cusip numbers listed in the essential information section of this prospectus you may also make or change your election by contacting your financial professional or the trustee this reinvestment option may be subject to availability or limitation by the brokerdealer or selling firm in certain circumstances brokerdealers may suspend or terminate the offering of a reinvestment option at any time reports the trustee or your financial professional will make available to you a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each distribution each year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your trusts activity and certain tax information you can request copies of security evaluations to enable you to complete your tax forms and audited financial statements for your trust if available additional investment risks all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of the securities in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest you could lose some or all of your investment in the trust recently equity markets have experienced significant volatility if the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall the sponsor cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security in a trust the trust itself or securities in general may fall in value market value may be affected by a variety of factors including general securities markets movements changes in the financial condition of an issuer or a sector changes in perceptions about an issuer or a sector interest rates and inflation governmental policies and litigation and purchases and sales of securities by the trust even though the evaluator carefully supervises your portfolio you should remember that it does not nor does the sponsor manage your portfolio your trust will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund price volatility the value of a trusts units will fluctuate with changes in the value of its underlying securities common stock prices fluctuate for several reasons including changes in investors perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition of the relevant stock market such as current market volatility or when political or economic events affecting the issuers occur in addition common stock prices may be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates as the cost of capital rises and borrowing costs increase because the trusts are not managed the trustee will not sell stocks in response to or in anticipation of market fluctuations as is common in managed investments as with any investment we cannot guarantee that the performance of any trust will be positive over any period of time or that you will not lose money units of your trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic or any other government agency foreign securities the capx achievers trust and the pure water trust invest in uslisted foreign securities andor adrs adrs are issued by a bank or trust company to evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by foreign corporations securities of foreign issuers present risks beyond those of domestic securities the prices of foreign securities can be more volatile than us securities due to such factors as political social and economic developments abroad the differences between the regulations to which us and foreign issuers and markets are subject the seizure by the government of company assets excessive taxation withholding taxes on dividends and interest limitations on the use or transfer of portfolio assets and political or social instability other risks include the following o enforcing legal rights may be difficult costly and slow in foreign countries and there may be special problems enforcing claims against foreign governments o foreign issuers may not be subject to accounting standards or governmental supervision comparable to us issuers and there may be less public information about their operations o foreign markets may be less liquid and more volatile than us markets o foreign securities often trade in currencies other than the us dollar changes in currency exchange rates may affect a trusts value the value of dividends and interest earned and gains and losses realized on the sale of securities an increase in the strength of the us dollar relative to these other currencies may cause the value of a trust to decline certain foreign currencies may be particularly volatile and foreign governments may intervene in the currency markets causing a decline in value or liquidity in a trusts foreign currency holdings and o future political and governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the payment or receipt of income on the foreign securities emerging markets risk the pure water trust invests in companies headquartered or incorporated in countries considered to be emerging markets emerging markets are generally defined as countries with low per capita income in the initial stages of their industrialization cycles risks of investing in developing or emerging countries include the possibility of investment and trading limitations liquidity concerns delays and disruptions in settlement transactions political uncertainties and dependence on international trade and development assistance in addition emerging market countries may be subject to overburdened infrastructures obsolete financial systems and environmental problems for these reasons investments in emerging markets are often considered speculative smallcapitalization and midcapitalization company risk the capx achievers trust the pure water trust and certain etfs held by the dwa sector neutral trust include securities issued by smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies these securities customarily involve more investment risk than securities of largecapitalization companies these additional risks are due in part to the following factors smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies may o have limited product lines markets or financial resources o be new and developing companies which seek to develop and utilize new andor emerging technologies these technologies may be slow to develop or fail to develop altogether o have less publicly available information o lack management depth or experience o be less liquid o be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments and o be dependent upon products that were recently brought to market or upon key personnel water company risks the pure water trust invests significantly in water companies as a result the factors that impact the global water market generally and each of the water companies will likely have a more significant effect in the trust than on a more broadly diversified securities portfolio companies involved on the potable water and wastewater businesses are subject to environmental considerations taxes government regulation price and supply fluctuations competition and conservation the failure of water companies to address these factors and others involving global water supply and demand could have an adverse effect on the companies and the portfolio performance industrials sector risks the capx achievers trust invests in and the pure water trust is concentrated in the industrials sector industrial companies convert unfinished goods into finished durables used to manufacture other goods or provide services general risks of industrial companies include the general state of the economy intense competition consolidation domestic and international politics excess capacity and consumer demand and spending trends in addition they may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending levels economic cycles technical obsolescence delays in modernization labor relations government regulations and ecommerce initiatives consumer products risk the capx achievers trust is concentrated in and the dwa sector neutral trust invests in the consumer products sector as a result the factors that impact the consumer products sector will likely have a greater effect on these trusts than on a more broadly diversified trust some of the risks associated with the consumer products sector are listed below general risks of companies in the consumer products sectors include cyclicality of revenues and earnings economic recession currency fluctuations changing consumer tastes extensive competition product liability litigation and increased government regulation generally spending on consumer products is affected by the health of consumers companies in the consumer products

care sector as a result the factors that impact the health care sector will likely have a greater effect on this trust than on a more broadly diversified trust some of the risks associated with the health care sector are listed below general risks of companies in the health care sector include extensive competition generic drug sales the loss of patent protection product liability litigation and increased government regulation research and development costs of bringing new drugs to market are substantial and there is no guarantee that the product will ever come to market health care companies seeking government approval for medical products and services may have losses and may not offer proposed products for several years if at all the failure to gain approval for new medical products or services can have a significant negative impact on a health care company and its stock health care facility operators may be affected by the demand for services efforts by government or insurers to limit rates restriction of government financial assistance such as medicare medicaid or similar programs and competition from other providers the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of  had significant implications on the health care sector the goal of the legislation was to provide health insurance coverage for those who do not have it the measure required most americans to purchase health insurance coverage added approximately  million people to the medicaid rolls and subsidized private coverage for lowand middle income people it also regulated private insurers more closely banning practices such as denial of care for preexisting conditions the implementation of the acts provisions will take place over the next several years through  and could cause a decrease in the profitability of companies in the health care sector through increased costs and possible downward pressure on prices charged the health care sector may also be impacted if congress proposes additional legislative action to reform the health care sector such proposals may include a broad array of health care topics including cost and price controls incentives for competition for health care services promotion of prepaid health care plans and additional tax incentives and penalties such proposals may also target the reduction of funding for health care related research the longterm effects of the act on the health care sector remain uncertain and cannot be predicted technology sector risk certain etfs held by the dwa sector neutral trust invest in the technology sector as a result the factors that impact the technology sector will likely have a greater effect on this trust than on a more broadly diversified trust companies involved in this sector must contend with o rapid changes in technology o worldwide competition o dependence on key suppliers and supplies o rapid obsolescence of products and services o termination of their patent protections o cyclical market patterns o evolving industry standards o frequent new product introductions o government regulation o unexpected changes in one or more of the technologies affecting an issuers products or in the market for products based on a particular technology and o the fact that operating results and customer relationships could be adversely affected by  an increase in price for or an interruption or reduction in supply of any key components or the loss of key customers and  the failure of the issuer to comply with rigorous industry standards exchangetraded funds risk the dwa sector neutral trust invests in shares of etfs which are investment pools that hold other securities the etfs in the trust are usually passively managed index funds that seek to replicate the performance or composition of a recognized securities index the etfs held by the trust are either openend management investment companies or unit investment trusts registered under the investment company act of  as amended unlike mutual funds or unit investment trusts etfs generally do not sell or redeem their individual shares at net asset value etfs generally sell and redeem shares in large blocks often referred to as creation units however the sponsor does not intend to sell or redeem etfs in this manner shares of etfs are listed on securities exchanges for trading which allows investors to purchase and sell individual etf shares at current market prices throughout the day the trust will purchase and sell etf shares on these securities exchanges etfs therefore possess characteristics of traditional openend mutual funds and unit investment trusts which issue redeemable shares and of corporate common stocks or closedend funds which generally issue shares that trade at negotiated prices on securities exchanges and are not redeemable etfs are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the funds investment objective the trust is also subject to the risks to which the underlying etfs may be subject as well as the etfs management and operating expenses you will bear not only your share of your trusts expenses but also the expenses of the etfs by investing in the etfs the trust incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the etfs shares of etfs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of the etf shares may decrease the amount of such discount from the net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors index correlation risk index correlation risk is the risk that the performance of an indextrading etf will vary from the actual performance of the etfs target index known as tracking error this can happen due to fund expenses transaction costs market impact corporate actions such as mergers and spinoffs and timing variances some etfs use a technique called representative sampling which means the etf invests in a representative sample of securities in its target index rather than all of the index securities the use of representative sampling could increase the risk of a tracking error dividends there is no guarantee that the issuers of the securities will declare dividends in the future or that if declared they will either remain at current levels or increase over time financial condition of issuer the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the initial offering period inflation risk inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money distribution of units the sponsor sells units to the public through brokerdealers registered investment advisers certified financial planners and other firms the sponsor may pay part of the distribution fee to thirdparty distribution and marketing firms when they introduce units to potential buyers or intermediaries the sponsor may at its own expense and out of its own profits pay for thirdparty distribution assistance including but not limited to obtaining shelf space in clearing firms and similar activities designed to aid in the sale of the sponsors products these arrangements will not change the price you pay for your units in addition part of the distribution fee will be used to compensate third parties for providing services to the sponsor and access to their trading platforms and adviser networks the level of compensation third parties receive will be based on various criteria which may include sales volume the sponsor generally registers units for sale in various states in the united states the sponsor does not register units for sale in any foreign country this prospectus does not constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be offered or sold lawfully the sponsor may reject any order for units in whole or in part the sponsor may gain or lose money when it holds units in the primary or secondary market due to fluctuations in unit prices the gain or loss is equal to the difference between the price the sponsor pays for units and the price at which it sells or redeems them the sponsor may also gain or lose money when it deposits securities to create units the amount of its profit or loss on the initial deposit of securities into your trust is shown in the notes to portfolio for the trust trust administration the trust the trust is a unit investment trust registered under the investment company act of  the sponsor created your trust under a trust agreement between elkhorn securities llc as depositor elkhorn investments llc as evaluator and supervisor the evaluator and the bank of new york mellon as trustee each unit represents an undivided interest in the assets of the trust to create the trust the sponsor deposited securities with the trustee or contracts to purchase securities along with an irrevocable letter of credit cash or other consideration to pay for the securities in exchange the trustee delivered units of each trust to the sponsor these units remain outstanding until redeemed or until your trust terminates at the close of the new york stock exchange on the trusts inception date or on the first day units are sold to the public if later the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals  the number of units and fractional interest of each unit in your trust will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment changing your portfolio the trust is not a managed fund unlike a managed fund the sponsor designed the portfolio to remain relatively fixed the trust will generally buy and sell securities to pay expenses to issue additional units or to redeem units in limited circumstances to protect the trust to make required distributions or to avoid imposition of taxes on the trust specifically the trust agreement provides that the evaluator may but need not direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain events such as the issuer having defaulted on the payment on any of its outstanding obligations the issuer having qualified as a passive foreign investment company under the internal revenue code the price of a security has declined to such an extent or other such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the evaluator the sale of such securities is necessary to maintain the sound investment character of the trust or the sale of such securities is necessary or advisable to maintain the qualification of the trust as a regulated investment company or provide funds to make any distribution for a taxable year in order to avoid imposition of any income or excess taxes on the trust or on undistributed income in the trust the proceeds from the sale of any securities will not be used to purchase any additional securities when your trust sells securities the composition and diversity of the securities in the portfolio may be altered if a public tender offer has been made for a security or if a merger acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security the trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to unitholders if your trust receives securities or other property it will either hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds if any contract for the purchase of securities fails the sponsor will refund the cash and sales charge attributable to the failed contract to unitholders on or before the next distribution date unless substantially all of the moneys held to cover the purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement as described below replacement securities in the event that any contract to purchase a security is not consummated in accordance with its terms a failed contract security the sponsor may instruct the trustee in writing either to effect a buyin in accordance with the rules of the marketplace where the failed contract securities were purchased or its clearinghouse or to purchase a replacement security the replacement security which has been selected by the sponsor out of funds held by the trustee purchases of replacement securities will be made subject to the following conditions o the replacement securities will be securities as originally selected for the trust or in the case of a trust that is a registered investment company for tax purposes securities that the sponsor determines to be similar in character as securities originally selected for the trust o the purchase of the replacement securities will not adversely affect the federal income tax status of the trust o the purchase price of the replacement securities will not exceed the total amount of cash deposited or the amount available under the letter of credit deposited by the sponsor at the time of the deposit of the failed contract security and o the replacement securities will be purchased within  days after the failed deposit of the failed contract security in the event of a failed contract security where replacement securities cannot be purchased the cash will be returned to the unitholders and generally treated as a return on principal for tax purposes any contract to deliver trust securities may not exceed  days from the effective date of the trusts registration statement the sponsor will increase the size of your trust as it sells units during the initial offering period when the sponsor creates additional units it will seek to replicate the existing portfolio when your trust buys securities it may pay brokerage or other acquisition fees you could experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and fluctuations in security prices between the time the sponsor creates units and the time the trust buys the securities when your trust buys or sells securities the sponsor may direct that it place orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers that sell units or are affiliated with the trust or the trustee investment policies when your trust was created the sponsor delivered to the trustee securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the trust after your trust is created the sponsor may deposit additional securities in the trust contracts to purchase additional securities along with cash or a bank letter of credit in lieu of cash to pay for such contracted securities or cash including a letter of credit with instructions to purchase additional securities such additional deposits will be in amounts which will seek to replicate as closely as practicable the portfolio immediately prior to such deposits if the sponsor deposits cash existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay the associated brokerage fees unitholders will not be able to dispose of or vote any of the securities in a trust as the holder of the securities the trustee will vote the securities and will endeavor to vote the securities such that the securities are voted as closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion as are the securities held by owners other than such trust however the trustee may not be able to vote the securities in a trust that are traded on foreign exchanges amending the trust agreement the sponsor the evaluator and the trustee can change the trust agreement without your consent to correct any provision that may be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely affect your interest as determined by the sponsor and the trustee the sponsor cannot change this agreement to reduce your interest in a trust without your consent investors owning twothirds of the units in a trust may vote to change this agreement termination of the trust the trust will terminate on the termination date set forth under essential information for the trust the trustee may terminate your trust early if the value of the trust is less than  of the original value of the securities in the trust at the time of deposit at this size the expenses of your trust may create an undue burden on your investment investors owning twothirds of the units in your trust may also vote to terminate the trust early the trustee will liquidate your trust in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold to the public are tendered for redemption so that the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than  of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in the trust if this happens the sponsor will refund any sales charge that you paid the trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any remaining securities the trustee will send your final distribution to you within a reasonable time following liquidation of all the securities after deducting final expenses your termination distribution may be less than the price you originally paid for your units the

section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trusts this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax adviser trust status each trust intends to qualify as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if a trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes distributions trust distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates your trusts distributions into two categories ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate however as further discussed below certain ordinary income distributions received from a trust may be taxed at the capital gains tax rates generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition a trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales fee if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year under the health care and education reconciliation act of  income from the trusts may also be subject to a new  medicare tax imposed for taxable years beginning after  this tax will generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received from the trusts because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies however certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by a trust from certain corporations may be reported by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction sale or redemption of shares if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units capital gains and losses and certain ordinary income dividends if you are an individual the maximum marginal stated federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  for taxpayers in the  tax bracket  for taxpayers in the    and  tax brackets and  for taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets some capital gains dividends from the trusts may be subject to a higher marginal stated federal tax rate capital gains may also be subject to the medicare tax described above net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your units at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a regulated investment company such as the trusts are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust itself each trust will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible for the capital gains tax rates inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an inkind distribution of trust securities when you redeem units or when your trust terminates this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received the internal revenue service could however assert that a loss could not be currently deducted exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future series of the trust the exchange would generally be considered a sale for federal income tax purposes deductibility of trust expenses expenses incurred and deducted by your trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income some individuals may also be subject to further limitations on the amount of their itemized deductions depending on their income foreign tax credit if your trust invests in any foreign securities the tax statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust paid to other countries in this case dividends taxed to you will include your share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries you may be able to deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes investments in certain foreign corporations if your trust holds an equity interest in any passive foreign investment companies pfics which are generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gains or that hold at least  of their assets in investments producing such passive income the trust could be subject to us federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity interests even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its unitholders the trust will not be able to pass through to its unitholders any credit or deduction for such taxes the trust may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences in this case the trust would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such pfic shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income under this election the trust might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from pfics and its proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock during that year and such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the  excise tax dividends paid by pfics are not treated as qualified dividend income foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you should be aware that generally subject to applicable tax treaties distributions from the trusts will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes other than dividends which the trust properly reports as capital gain dividends and will be subject to us income taxes including withholding taxes subject to certain exceptions described below however distributions received by a foreign investor from a trust that are properly reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met in addition distributions in respect of units may be subject to a us withholding tax of  in the case of distributions to i certain nonus financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with the us treasury to collect and disclose certain information and are not resident in a jurisdiction that has entered into such an agreement with the us treasury and ii certain other nonus entities that do not provide certain certifications and information about the entitys us owners dispositions of units by such persons may be subject to such withholding after december   expenses the trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations the fee table shows the estimated amount of these expenses the sponsor will receive a fee from the trusts for creating and developing each trust including determining the trusts objectives policies composition and size selecting service providers and information services and providing other similar administrative and ministerial functions this creation and development fee is a charge of  per unit the trustee will deduct this amount from the trusts assets as of the close

the ishares  year treasury bond etf an etf that invests in us treasury bonds with remaining maturities between one and three years the “treasury bond etfs” the portfolio attempts to replicate the performance and characteristics of the index   the uslisted common stocks held by the trust may include the common stock of us and nonus companies including issuers in emerging markets   the trust is designed to track the index the portfolio is not actively managed but will be rebalanced monthly to track changes in the index the trust intends to invest in all of the component securities of the index for more information regarding the index please see “index description”   index eligibility   the index is selected based upon the following criteria     ● begin with all us exchangelisted common stock listed on the amex nasdaq nyse and nyse arca     ● exclude common stock with a market capitalization lower than or equal to  billion and     ● exclude all common stock that do not meet the following mga generated criteria based on the closing price of the previous trading day     a the economic climate rating “ecr” which measures how favorable the current economic climate is for a security over the next  to  months must be greater than or equal to  out of a star scale  being the worst and  being the best     b a stoplight equity “sle” of “green” sle is an indicator for expected longterm sharpe ratio      a measurement of riskadjusted returns an sle of “green” means that the stock is likely to be in the top third of sharpe ratios over time when compared to the other equities in the universe     c a macro risk level “mrl” greater than or equal to  mrl is the sum of absolute value of the eta® statistics for  key macroeconomic and macrofinance variables such as inflation unemployment rates interest rates and euro exchange rates the “key variables” the eta® statistics are separately computed for each asset using a nonlinear statistical method and are adjusted to reflect the statistical distribution of each of the  key macro variables mrl measures an asset’s sensitivity to economic change an mrl of at least  represents a high sensitivity to the economy     d an economic influence level “eil” greater than or equal to  eil measures what percentage of the equity price variation can be attributed to the  key macroeconomic and macrofinance variables an eil of at least  means that  or more of the common stock’s price movements are attributable to  key variables which improves the consistency of the model’s ability to forecast future price movements     e an eta value at risk “evar” less than or equal to  evar utilizes statistical analysis to measure the estimated impact that surprise movements in the variables not included in the key variables can have on the price movements of an equity     f a down market beta “dmb” less than or equal to  dmb measures a stock’s sensitivity to the “market” where “market” is defined by the value of the sp  index on days that the market return was negative     g a relative value greater than or equal to  relative value is calculated by taking the intrinsic value from the eta® model based on  key macro variables divided by the closing price of the asset from the previous day where the intrinsic value is the theoretical value of the stock based on its nonlinear statistical relationship with each of the key variables   the remaining common stocks are classified as “qualified equities” for the initial index mga will select the  common stocks with the highest mrl and weight each common stock at  if the initial qualified equities are less than  then the the remaining weight of the index will be allocated to the treasury bond etfs the common stocks in the initial index will constitute the trust’s portfolio on the day of deposit the “inception date”   the sponsor seeks to replicate the composition of the index in the trust’s portfolio to the greatest extent practicable during the trust’s life the portfolio will change to reflect any change in the component securities in the index the trust’s portfolio will generally change to reflect any changes in the components of the index only at the time that the index is rebalanced the index is described in greater detail under “understanding your investment — index description” precise replication of the      securities in the index may not be achieved at the time of the index rebalancing see “principal risks — index correlation risk”   exchange traded funds   etfs are investment pools that hold securities etfs provide an efficient and relatively simple way to invest in that they offer investors the opportunity to buy and sell an entire basket of securities with a single transaction throughout the trading day etfs are often built like an index fund but trade like a stock on an exchange etfs generally offer advantages similar to those found in index funds such as low operating costs performance designed to track an index the potential for high tax efficiency and consistent investment strategies unlike conventional mutual funds etfs normally issue and redeem shares on a continuous basis at their net asset value in large specified blocks of shares known as “creation units” market makers large investors and institutions deal in creation units the trust will buy shares of the treasury bond etfs on the exchanges and will incur brokerage costs   treasury bond etfs   the ishares short treasury bond etf seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of us treasury bonds with remaining maturities between one

trust no assurance can be given that the trust’s investment objective will be achieved the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these   the portfolio is not actively managed the value of your investment may fall over time except in limited circumstances the trust will generally hold and may continue to buy the same securities even if their market value declines      price volatility the value of your investment will fluctuate with changes in the value of the trust’s securities securities prices fluctuate for several reasons including changes in investors’ perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition of the relevant stock market such as current market volatility or when political or economic events affecting the issuers occur in addition common stock prices may be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates as the cost of capital rises and borrowing costs increase   as with any investment we cannot guarantee that the performance of the trust will be positive over any period of time or that you will not lose money units of the trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency   dividends risk there is no guarantee that the issuers of the securities will declare dividends in the future and if declared whether they will remain at current levels or increase over time   index risk the trust’s portfolio’s performance might not sufficiently correspond with that of its target index this can happen for reasons such as the timing of rebalancings index tracking errors round lot trading requirements regulatory restrictions the time that elapses between an index change and a change in the trust and trust expenses in addition due to the index eligibility criteria the portfolio may hold an increasing number of shares of the treasury bond etfs rather than common stocks in this case it is likely that the returns and capital appreciation of the portfolio may be lower than if the portfolio was made up of all common stocks   foreign securities risk the trust may invest in uslisted foreign securities securities of foreign issuers present risks beyond those of domestic securities the prices of foreign securities can be more volatile than us securities due to such factors as political social and economic developments abroad the differences between the regulations to which us and foreign issuers and markets are subject the seizure by the government of company assets excessive taxation withholding taxes on dividends and interest limitations on the use or transfer of portfolio assets and political or social instability other risks include the following     ● enforcing legal rights may be difficult costly and slow in foreign countries and there may be special problems enforcing claims against foreign governments     ● foreign issuers may not be subject to accounting standards or governmental supervision comparable to us issuers and there may be less public information about their operations and     ● future political and governmental restrictions might adversely affect the payment or receipt of income on the foreign securities   emerging markets risk the trust may invest in securities issued by companies headquartered in countries considered to be emerging markets emerging markets are generally defined as countries with low per capita income in the initial stages of their industrialization cycles risks of investing in developing or emerging countries include the possibility of investment and trading limitations liquidity concerns delays and disruptions in settlement transactions political uncertainties and dependence on international trade and development assistance companies headquartered in emerging market countries may be exposed to greater volatility and market risk      etf risk the trust may invest in shares of the treasury bond etfs etfs are investment pools that hold other securities the treasury bond etfs are passively managed index funds that seeks to replicate the performance or composition of a recognized securities index   etfs are subject to various risks including management’s ability to meet the fund’s investment objective shares of etfs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of an etf’s shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors the treasury bond etfs have management and operating expenses consequently you will bear not only your share of the trust’s expenses but also the expenses of the treasury bond etfs as a result of the trust’s investment in an etf you will incur greater expenses than if you invest directly in the treasury bond etfs   the treasury bond etfs are subject to annual fees and expenses including a management fee unitholders of the trust will bear these fees in addition to the fees and expenses of the trust see “fees and expenses” for additional information   the trust is subject to index correlation risk to the extent that an underlying etf is an index tracking etf index correlation risk is the risk that the performance of an etf will vary from the actual performance of the fund’s target index known as “tracking error” this can happen due to fund expenses transaction costs market impact corporate actions such as mergers and spin offs and timing variances   the financial condition of an etf may worsen resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period   index correlation risk index correlation risk is the risk that the performance of the trust will not sufficiently correspond with the index this can happen for reasons such as     ● the impracticability of owning each of the index components with the exact weightings at a given time     ● the trust will generally adjust component share weightings in an effort to match the ondex only when the index itself is rebalanced     ● the possibility of index tracking errors     ● the inability to adequately replicate the weightings of certain index components due to round lot trading requirements or practices especially in certain foreign securities markets     ● regulatory restrictions applicable to this trust     ● the time that elapses between a change in the index and a change in the trust portfolio and     ● fees and expenses of the trust   treasury bond risk the treasury bond etfs invest in us treasury obligations us treasury obligations are direct obligations of the united states which are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states us treasury obligations are generally not affected by credit risk but are subject to changes in market value resulting from changes in interest rates      the value of us treasury obligations will be adversely affected by decreases in bond prices and increases in interest rates   interest rate risk the value of the fixedincome securities in the treasury bond etfs will generally fall if interest rates in general rise typically fixedincome securities with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes in addition the duration of a bond will also affect its price sensitivity to interest rate changes for example if a bond has a duration of  years and interest rates go up by  it can be expected that the bond price will move down by  the trust may be subject to greater risk of rising interest rates than would normally be the case due to the current period of historically low rates   midcap companies risk the trust invests in securities issued by mid capitalization companies these securities customarily involve more investment risk than securities of largecapitalization companies midcapitalization companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments   selection risk securities selected according to the trust’s strategy may not perform as intended the trust is exposed to additional risk due to its policy of investing in accordance with an investment strategy although the trust’s investment strategy is designed to achieve the trust’s investment objective the strategy may not prove to be successful the investment decisions may not produce the intended results and there is no guarantee that the investment objective will be achieved   financial condition of an issuer the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the initial offering period   legislation and litigation from time to time various legislative initiatives or regulatory standards are proposed in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the companies represented in the trust in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the industries represented by such issuers may negatively impact the value of these securities we cannot predict what impact any pending or proposed legislation or pending or threatened litigation will have on the value of the securities   inflation risk inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money   fee table   the amounts below are estimates of the direct and indirect expenses that you may incur based on a ten dollar  unit price actual expenses may vary   investor fees

acquired fund expenses    total      based on a unit with a  per unit public offering price as of the inception date    the initial sales charge provided is based on the unit price on the inception date because the initial sales charge equals the difference between the maximum sales charge and the sum of the remaining deferred sales charge and the creation and development fee “cd fee” as described below the percentage and dollar amount of the initial sales charge will vary as the unit price varies and after deferred charges begin despite the variability of the initial sales charge each investor is obligated to pay the entire applicable total sales charge    the deferred sales charge is fixed at  per unit and is deducted in monthly installments of  per unit on       and  on    the percentage provided is based on a  unit as of the inception date and the percentage amount will vary over time if units are redeemed prior to the deferred sales charge period the entire deferred sales charge will be collected upon redemption    the cd fee compensates the sponsor for creating and developing the trust the cd fee is fixed at  per unit and is paid to the sponsor at the close of the initial offering period which is expected to be approximately three months from the inception date    the estimated organization costs include the amount per unit paid by the trust at the earlier of the end of the initial offering period or after six months    since certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts if the trust does not reach a certain size or falls below such size over its life the actual amount of the operating expenses may in some cases greatly exceed the amounts reflected to the extent the actual operating expenses are greater than the estimated amount only the estimated operating expenses will be charged to the trust any operating expenses exceeding this estimate will be borne by the sponsor other operating expenses do not include brokerage costs and other transactional fees but may include a licensing fee paid by the trust to mga for the use of intellectual property owned by mga and may include global custody charges    although not an actual trust operating expense the trust and therefore the unitholders of the trust will indirectly bear similar operating expenses of the treasury bond etfs held by the trust in the estimated amount provided above estimated etf expenses are based upon the net asset value of the number of etf shares held by the trust per unit multiplied by the annual operating expenses of the etfs for the most recent fiscal year unitholders will therefore indirectly pay higher expenses than if the underlying etfs were held directly please note that the sponsor or an affiliate may be engaged as a service provider to certain etfs held by your trust and therefore certain fees paid by your trust to such etfs will be paid to the sponsor or an affiliate for its services to such etfs   example   this example helps you compare the cost of the trust with other unit trusts and other registered funds in the example the sponsor assumes that you reinvest your investment in a new trust every year at a reduced sales charge and that the trust’s annual return is  your actual returns and expenses will vary based on these assumptions you would pay these expenses for every  you invest in the trust   year    year    year    year      this example assumes that you continue to follow the trust’s strategy and roll your investment including all distributions into a new series of the trust every year subject to a

of the trust on any business day the new york stock exchange is open by contacting your financial professional units may be purchased in denominations of one unit or any multiple thereof subject to the minimum investment requirement fractions of units if any as the result of reinvestment of dividends or a rollover transaction will be computed to three decimal places unit prices are available daily on the internet at wwwelkhorncomuits the public offering price of the units includes     ● the net asset value per unit plus     ● organization costs plus     ● the sales charge   the “net asset value per unit” is the value of the securities cash and other assets in the trust reduced by the liabilities of that trust divided by the total units outstanding the sponsor often refers to the public offering price of units as the “offer price” or “purchase price” the offer price will be effective for all orders received prior to the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange normally  pm eastern time if the sponsor receives your order prior to the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or authorized financial professionals receive your order prior to that time then you will receive the price computed on the date of receipt if the sponsor receives your order after the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or if authorized financial professionals receive your order after that time then you will receive the price computed on the date of the next determined offer price provided that your order is received in a timely manner on that date it is the responsibility of the authorized financial professional to transmit the orders that they receive to the sponsor in a timely manner certain brokerdealers and clearing firms may charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit purchase orders units of the trust are available for purchase through financial professionals including the sponsor and are not available for purchase directly from the trust   value of the securities the sponsor determines the value of the securities as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that exchange is open the sponsor generally determines the value of securities using the last sale price for securities traded on a national securities exchange for this purpose the trustee provides the sponsor with closing prices from a pricing service approved by the sponsor in some cases the sponsor will price a security based on its fair value after considering appropriate factors relevant to the value of the security this will only be done if a security is not principally traded on a national securities exchange or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate   the sponsor determined the initial prices of the securities shown under “trust portfolio” for the trust in this prospectus as described above at the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on the business day before the date of this prospectus on the first day the sponsor sells units it will compute the unit price as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission becomes effective if later   organization costs during the initial offering period part of the public offering price of the units represents an amount that will pay the costs of creating your trust these costs include the costs of preparing the registration      statement and legal documents federal and state registration fees the portfolio consulting fee if any the initial fees and expenses of the trustee and the initial audit your trust will sell securities to reimburse the sponsor for these costs at the end of the initial offering period or after six months if earlier the value of your units will decline when your trust pays these costs   organization costs will only be included in the public offering price during the initial offering period   transactional sales charge you pay a fee when you buy units we refer to this fee as the “transactional sales charge” the transactional sales charge has both an initial and a deferred component and is  of the public offering price based on a  unit this percentage amount of the transactional sales charge is based on the unit price on the inception date because the transactional sales charge equals the difference between the maximum sales charge and the cd fee the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales charge will vary as the unit price varies the transactional sales charge does not include the cd fee which is described under “fee table” in this prospectus   initial sales charge based on a  unit the initial sales charge is equal to  of the public offering price the initial sales charge which you will pay at the time of purchase is equal to the difference between the maximum sales charge  of the public offering price and the sum of the maximum remaining deferred sales charges and the cd fee initially  per unit the dollar amount and percentage amount of the initial sales charge will vary over time   deferred sales charge to keep your money working longer we defer payment of the rest of the transactional sales charge through the deferred sales charge  per unit in limited circumstances and only if deemed in the best interests of unitholders the sponsor may delay the payment of the deferred sales charge from the dates listed under “fee table”   units purchased subsequent to the initial deferred sales charge payment will be subject to the initial sales charge the remaining deferred sales charge payments and the creation and development fee units sold or redeemed prior to such time as the entire applicable deferred sales charge has been collected will be assessed the remaining deferred sales charge at the time of such sale or redemption   reducing your sales charge we offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the maximum sales charge you pay it is your financial professional’s responsibility to alert us of any discount when you order units since the deferred sales charge and the cd fee are a fixed dollar amount per unit the trust must charge the deferred sales charge and the cd fee per unit regardless of any discounts however when you purchase units of the trust if you are eligible to receive a discount such that your total maximum sales charge is less than the fixed dollar amount of the deferred sales charge and the cd fee the sponsor will credit you the difference between your maximum sales charge and the sum of the deferred sales charge and the cd fee at the time you buy units by providing you with additional units   large purchases you can reduce your maximum sales charge by increasing the size of your investment   investors who make large purchases are entitled to the following sales charge schedule      purchase amount sales charge less than            or more    you

the fee account cusip numbers to facilitate purchases under this discount however we do not require that you buy units with these cusip numbers to qualify for the discount if you purchase units with these special cusip numbers you should be aware that you may have the distributions automatically reinvested into additional units of your trust or receive cash distributions we reserve the right to limit or deny purchases of units not subject to the transactional sales charge by investors whose frequent trading activity we determine to be detrimental to your trust we as sponsor will receive and

transaction and will be retroactive to the prior sales once  in sales has been reached for the calendar quarter such payments will be in addition to the regular concessions paid to dealer firms as set forth in the applicable trust’s prospectus eligible dealer firms and other selling agents include clearing firms that place      orders with elkhorn and provide elkhorn with information with respect to the representatives who initiated such transactions eligible dealer firms and other selling agents will not include firms that solely provide clearing services to other brokerdealer firms or firms who place orders through clearing firms that are eligible dealers in determining whether the above volume sales levels are met eligible unit trusts include all elkhorn unit trusts sold in the primary market either on a transactional or fee based account basis however dealers and other selling agents will not receive a concession on the sale of the units which are not subject to a transactional sales charge redemptions of units during the primary offering period will reduce the amount of units used to calculate the volume concessions   elkhorn reserves the right to modify or terminate the volume concession program at any time in addition whether certain sales will be included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level breakpoints for volume concessions also will be subject to the policies of the related selling firm the sponsor may also pay to certain dealers an administrative fee for information or service used in connection with the distribution of trust units such amounts will be in addition to any concessions received for the sale of units   in addition to the concessions described above the sponsor may pay additional compensation out of its own assets to broker dealers that meet certain sales targets and that have agreed to provide services relating to the trust to their customers this compensation is intended to result in additional sales of elkhorn products andor compensate brokerdealers and financial advisers for past sales a number of factors are considered in determining whether to pay these additional amounts such factors may include but are not limited to the level or type of services provided by the intermediary the level or expected level of sales of elkhorn products by the intermediary or its agents the placing of elkhorn products on a preferred or recommended product list access to an intermediary’s personnel and other factors   the sponsor may enter into marketing support arrangements with certain brokerdealers that market and promote the sponsor’s unit investment trusts to other brokerdealers and selling agents the sponsor compensates these marketing support firms out of its own assets the amount of compensation paid to a particular firm may vary and will generally comprise an amount up to  of the price of units of elkhornsponsored unit investment trusts sold during the initial offering period in the regions or by the brokerdealers or selling agents covered by the particular firm pursuant to its agreement with the sponsor   the sponsor makes these payments for marketing promotional or related expenses including but not limited to expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisers advertising sponsorship of events or seminars obtaining information about the breakdown of unit sales among an intermediary’s representatives or offices obtaining shelf space in brokerdealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale of the sponsor’s products the sponsor may make such payments to many intermediaries that sell elkhorn products the sponsor may also make certain payments to or on behalf of intermediaries to defray a portion of their costs incurred for the purpose of facilitating unit sales such as the costs of developing trading or purchasing trading systems to process unit trades      payments of such additional compensation some of which may be characterized as “revenue sharing” may create an incentive for financial intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend an elkhorn product including your trust over products offered by other sponsors or fund companies these arrangements will not change the price you pay for your units   we generally register units for sale in various states in the united states we do not register units for sale in any foreign country it is your financial professional’s responsibility to make sure that units are registered or exempt from registration if you are a foreign investor or if you want to buy units in another country this prospectus does not constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be offered or sold lawfully we may reject any order for units in whole or in part we may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary market due to fluctuations in unit prices the gain or loss is equal to the difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or redeem them we may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to create units the amount of gain or loss relating to the trust is set forth in the trust’s “trust portfolio” on the initial deposit of securities into the trust   how to sell your units   you can sell your units on any business day by contacting your financial professional or in some cases the trustee unit prices are available daily on the internet at wwwelkhorncomuits or through your financial professional we often refer to the sale price of units as the “liquidation price” you pay any remaining deferred sales charge when you sell or redeem your units certain brokerdealers may charge a transaction fee for processing unit redemptions or sale requests until the end of the initial offering period or six months after the inception date at the discretion of the sponsor the price at which the trustee will redeem units and the price at which the sponsor may repurchase units include estimated organization costs after such period the amount paid will not include such estimated organization costs   selling units the sponsor may maintain a secondary market for units this means that if you want to sell your units the sponsor may buy them at the current net asset value or “liquidation price” depending on whether or not your trust is in its initial offering period the sponsor may then resell the units to other investors at the public offering price or redeem them for the redemption price after the close of the initial offering period the sale and redemption price of units is equal to the net asset value per unit during the initial offering period the sale and redemption price of units is equal to the net asset value per unit less the total of any deferred sales charges and cd fees during the initial offering period the sale and redemption price is sometimes referred to as the “liquidation price” certain brokerdealers might also maintain a secondary market in units you should contact your financial professional for current repurchase prices to determine the best price available the sponsor may discontinue the secondary market at any time without notice even if the sponsor does not make a market you will be able to redeem your units with the trustee on any business day for the current redemption price   redeeming units you may also redeem your units directly with the trustee on any day the new york stock exchange is open you will receive the redemption price for a particular day if the trustee receives your completed redemption request prior to the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange      redemption requests received by authorized financial professionals prior to the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange that are properly transmitted to the trustee by the time designated by the trustee are priced based on the date of receipt redemption requests received by the trustee after the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange redemption requests received by authorized financial professionals after that time or redemption requests received by such persons that are not transmitted to the trustee until after the time designated by the trustee are priced based on the date of the next determined redemption price provided they are received in a timely manner by the trustee on such date it is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit redemption requests received by them to the trustee so they will be received in a timely manner if your request is not received in a timely manner or is incomplete in any way you will receive the next redemption price computed after the trustee receives your completed request   if you redeem your units the trustee will generally send you a payment for your units no later than seven days after it receives all necessary documentation this will usually only take three business days the only time the trustee can delay your payment is if the new york stock exchange is closed other than weekends or holidays the securities and exchange commission determines that trading on that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists making sale or evaluation of the securities not reasonably practicable and for any other period that the securities and exchange commission permits   inkind distribution you can request an in kind distribution of the securities underlying your units if you tender at least  units for redemption or such other amount as required by your financial professional’s firm or clearing firm this option is generally available only for securities traded and held in the united statesthe trustee will make any inkind distribution of securities by distributing applicable securities in bookentry form to the account of your financial professional at the depository trust company you will receive whole shares of the applicable securities and cash equal to any fractional shares you may not request this option in the last  days of your trust’s life the sponsor may discontinue this option upon  days’ notice   rollover the trust strategy is a longterm investment strategy designed to be followed on a periodic basis you may achieve more consistent longterm investment results by following this strategy as part of the strategy the sponsor currently intends to offer a subsequent series of the trust for a rollover purchase when the current trust terminates however it is possible that a future series of your trust’s strategy may produce results that could make the offering of a subsequent series of such trust impossible at its termination you must therefore be aware that a future series of your trust may not be available for a rollover purchase when the trust terminates you may have the option to participate in a rollover purchase and have your units reinvested into a subsequent trust series through a rollover as described in this section   if you elect to participate in the rollover purchase your units will be invested in the subsequent series of your trust on the trust’s termination date upon termination the value of your units will be invested in a new trust series if available at the public offering price of the new trust the trustee will attempt to sell securities to satisfy the redemption as quickly as practicable on the termination date the sponsor does not anticipate that the sale period will be      longer than one day however certain factors could affect the ability to sell the securities and could impact the length of the sale period the liquidity of any security depends on the daily trading volume of the security and the amount available for redemption and reinvestment on any day   the sponsor intends to make subsequent trust series available for sale at various times during the year of course the sponsor cannot guarantee that a subsequent trust or sufficient units will be available or that any subsequent trust will offer the same investment strategy or objectives as the current trust the sponsor cannot guarantee that a rollover will avoid any negative market price consequences resulting from trading large volumes of securities market price trends may make it advantageous to sell or buy securities more quickly or more slowly than permitted by the trust’s procedures the sponsor may in its sole discretion modify a rollover or stop creating units of your trust at any time regardless of whether all proceeds of unitholders have been reinvested in a rollover the sponsor may decide not to offer the rollover upon  days’ notice cash that has not been reinvested in a rollover will be distributed to unitholders shortly after the termination date rollover participants may receive taxable dividends or realize taxable capital gains that are reinvested in connection with a rollover but may not be entitled to a deduction for capital losses due to the “wash sale” tax rules due to the reinvestment in a subsequent trust no cash will be distributed to pay any taxes see “taxes”   distributions   distributions you can elect to     ● reinvest distributions in additional units of your trust at no fee or     ● receive distributions in cash   your trust generally pays distributions of its net investment income along with any excess capital on each distribution date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date the record and distribution dates are shown under “essential information” for the trust in some cases your trust might pay a special distribution if it holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution for example this could happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction involving a company whose stock is in your portfolio the amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as companies change their dividends or trust expenses change   in addition your trust may pay a special distribution in order to maintain the qualification of your trust as a regulated investment company or to provide funds to make any distribution for a taxable year in order to avoid imposition of any income or excise tax on undistributed income in the trust the amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as companies change their dividends trust expenses change or as a result of changes in the trust’s portfolio   reinvest in your trust you can keep your money working by electing to reinvest your distributions in additional units of the trust the easiest way to do this is to have your financial professional purchase units with one of the reinvestment cusip numbers listed in the “essential information” section of this prospectus you may also make or change your election by contacting your financial professional or the trustee this reinvestment option may be subject to availability or limitation by the broker dealer or selling firm in certain circumstances brokerdealers may suspend or terminate the offering of a reinvestment option at any time      estimated annual distributions the estimated net annual distributions are shown under the “essential information” section of this prospectus we generally base the estimate of the income the trust may receive on annualizing the most recent ordinary dividend declared by an issuer or adding the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign issuers or on scheduled income paymentshowever dividend conventions for certain companies andor certain countries differ from those typically used in the united states and in certain instances dividends paid or declared over several years or other periods were used to estimate annual distributions due to this and various other factors actual income payments received by each trust will most likely differ from the most recent annualized dividends or scheduled income payments there is no guarantee that the issuers of the securities in the trust’s portfolio will declare dividends in the future or that if declared they will either remain at current levels or increase over time due to this and various other factors actual dividends received from the securities may be less than their most recent annualized dividends in this case the actual net annual distributions you receive may be less than the estimated amount set forth under the “essential information” section of this prospectus the actual net annual distributions you will receive will vary with changes in each trust’s fees and expenses due to the semiannual distribution dates for the trust changes in income payments received and in connection with the sale of securities   reports the trustee or your financial professional will make available to you a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each distribution each year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your trust’s activity and certain tax information you can request copies of security evaluations to enable you to complete your tax forms and audited financial statements for your trust if available   additional investment risks   all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of the securities in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest you could lose some or all of your investment in the trust securities markets may experience significant volatility if the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall the sponsor cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period   market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security in your trust the trust itself or securities in general may fall in value market value may be affected by a variety of factors including general securities markets movements changes in the financial condition of an issuer or a sector changes in perceptions about an issuer or a sector interest rates and inflation governmental policies and litigation and purchases and sales of securities by the trust   even though the evaluator carefully supervises your portfolio you should remember that it does not nor does the sponsor manage your portfolio your trust will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund   price volatility the value of your trust’s units will fluctuate with changes in the value of its underlying securities security prices fluctuate for several reasons including changes in investors’ perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition of the relevant stock market such as current market      volatility or when political or economic events affecting the issuers occur in addition security prices may be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates as the cost of capital rises and borrowing costs increase   because the trust is not activelymanaged the trustee will not sell stocks in response to or in anticipation of market fluctuations as is common in managed investments as with any investment we cannot guarantee that the performance of any trust will be positive over any period of time or that you will not lose money units of your trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” or any other government agency   additional deposits some of the securities may have limited trading volume the trustee with directions from the sponsor will endeavor to purchase securities with deposited cash as soon as practicable reserving the right to purchase those securities over the  business days following each deposit in an effort to reduce the effect of these purchases on the market price of those stocks this could however result in the trust’s failure to participate in any appreciation of those stocks before the cash is invested if any cash remains at the end of this period and such date is within the day period following the inception date and cannot be invested in one or more stocks at what the sponsor considers reasonable prices it intends to use that cash to purchase each of the other securities in the original proportionate relationship among those securities similarly at termination of the trust the sponsor reserves the right to sell securities over a period of up to nine business days to lessen the impact of its sales on the market price of the securities the proceeds received by unitholders following termination of the trust will reflect the actual sales proceeds received on the securities which will likely differ from the closing sale price on the termination date   index correlation risk index correlation risk is the risk that the performance of the trust will not sufficiently correspond with the index this can happen for reasons such as     ● the impracticability of owning each of the index components with the exact weightings at a given time     ● the trust will generally adjust component share weightings in an effort to match the ondex only when the index itself is rebalanced     ● the possibility of index tracking errors     ● the inability to adequately replicate the weightings of certain index components due to round lot trading requirements or practices especially in certain foreign securities markets     ● regulatory restrictions applicable to this trust     ● the time that elapses between a change in the index and a change in the trust portfolio and     ● fees and expenses of the trust   foreign securities risk the trust may invest in us listed foreign securities securities of foreign issuers present risks beyond those of domestic securities the prices of foreign securities can be more volatile than us securities due to such factors as political social and economic developments abroad the differences between the regulations to which us and foreign issuers and markets are subject the seizure by the government of company assets excessive taxation withholding taxes on      dividends and interest limitations on the use or transfer of portfolio assets and political or social instability other risks include the following     ● enforcing legal rights may be difficult costly and slow in foreign countries and there may be special problems enforcing claims against foreign governments     ● foreign issuers may not be subject to accounting standards or governmental supervision comparable to us issuers and there may be less public information about their operations and     ● future political and governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the payment or receipt of income on the foreign securities   emerging markets risk the trust may invest in securities issued by companies headquartered in countries considered to be emerging markets emerging markets are generally defined as countries with low per capita income in the initial stages of their industrialization cycles risks of investing in developing or emerging countries include the possibility of investment and trading limitations liquidity concerns delays and disruptions in settlement transactions political uncertainties and dependence on international trade and development assistance in addition emerging market countries may be subject to overburdened infrastructures political risk obsolete financial systems and environmental problems for these reasons investments in emerging markets are often considered speculative   exchange traded funds risk the trust may invest in shares of the treasury bond etfs which are investment pools that hold other securities the treasury bond etfs are passively managed index funds that seek to replicate the performance or composition of a recognized securities index etfs are either open end management investment companies or unit investment trusts registered under the investment company act of  as amended unlike mutual funds or unit investment trusts etfs generally do not sell or redeem their individual shares at net asset value etfs generally sell and redeem shares in large blocks often referred to as “creation units” however the sponsor does not intend to sell or redeem etfs in this manner shares of etfs are listed on securities exchanges for trading which allows investors to purchase and sell individual etf shares at current market prices throughout the day the trust will purchase and sell etf shares on these securities exchanges etfs therefore possess characteristics of traditional open end mutual funds and unit investment trusts which issue redeemable shares and of corporate common stocks or closed end funds which generally issue shares that trade at negotiated prices on securities exchanges and are not redeemable   etfs are subject to various risks including management’s ability to meet the funds’ investment objective the trust is also subject to the risks to which the treasury bond etfs may be subject as well as the treasury bond etfs’ management and operating expenses you will bear not only your share of your trust’s expenses but also the expenses of the treasury bond etfs by investing in the treasury bond etfs the trust incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the treasury bond etfs shares of etfs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of the treasury bond etfs shares may decrease      the amount of such discount from the net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors   index correlation risk index correlation risk is the risk that the performance of an index trading etf will vary from the actual performance of the etf’s target index known as “tracking error” this can happen due to fund expenses transaction costs market impact corporate actions such as mergers and spin offs and timing variances some etfs use a technique called “representative sampling” which means the etf invests in a representative sample of securities in its target index rather than all of the index securities the use of representative sampling could increase the risk of a tracking error   treasury bond risk the treasury bond etfs invest in us treasury bonds as with other fixedincome securities us treasury bonds are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixedincome security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates when the general level of interest rates goes up the prices of most fixedincome securities go down when the general level of interest rates goes down the prices of most fixedincome securities go up credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will be unable andor unwilling to make timely interest payments andor repay the principal on its debt however us treasury bonds are issued by the united states government and are subject to limited credit risk   interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the value of securities held by the treasury bond etfs will decline in value because of a rise in interest rates generally securities that pay fixed rates of return will increase in value when interest rates decline and decrease in value when interest rates rise typically securities that pay fixed rates of return with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes the trust may be subject to greater risk of rising interest rates than would normally be the case due to the current period of historically low rates   midcapitalization company risk the trust invests in securities issued by mid capitalization companies these securities customarily involve more investment risk than securities of largecapitalization companies these additional risks are due in part to the following factors midcapitalization companies may     ● have limited product lines markets or financial resources     ● be new and developing companies which seek to develop and utilize new andor emerging technologies these technologies may be slow to develop or fail to develop altogether     ● have less publicly available information     ● lack management depth or experience     ● be less liquid     ● be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments and     ● be dependent upon products that were recently brought to market or upon key personnel   dividends there is no guarantee that the issuers of the securities will declare dividends in the future or that if declared they will either remain at current levels or increase over time      selection risk securities selected according to this strategy may not perform as intended the trust is exposed to additional risk due to its policies of investing in accordance with an investment strategy although the trust’s investment strategies are designed to achieve the trust’s investment objective the strategies may not prove to be successful the investment decisions may not produce the intended results and there is no guarantee that the investment objective will be achieved   liquidity whether or not the securities are listed on a national securities exchange the principal trading market for the securities may be in the overthecounter market as a result the existence of a liquid trading market for the securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in the securities there can be no assurance that a market will be made for any of the securities that any market for the securities will be maintained or of the liquidity of the securities in any markets made in addition the trust is restricted under the investment company act of  from selling securities to the sponsor the price at which the securities may be sold to meet redemptions and the value of the trust will be adversely affected if trading markets for the securities are limited or absent   financial condition of issuer the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the initial offering period   inflation risk inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money   distribution of units   the sponsor sells units to the public through brokerdealers registered investment advisers certified financial planners and other firms the sponsor may pay part of the distribution fee to thirdparty distribution and marketing firms when they introduce units to potential buyers or intermediaries   the sponsor may at its own expense and out of its own profits pay for thirdparty distribution assistance including but not limited to obtaining shelf space in clearing firms and similar activities designed to aid in the sale of the sponsor’s products these arrangements will not change the price you pay for your units in addition part of the distribution fee will be used to compensate third parties for providing services to the sponsor and access to their trading platforms and adviser networks the level of compensation third parties receive will be based on various criteria which may include sales volume   the sponsor generally registers units for sale in various states in the united states the sponsor does not register units for sale in any foreign country this prospectus does not constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be offered or sold lawfully the sponsor may reject any order for units in whole or in part   the sponsor may gain or lose money when it holds units in the primary or secondary market due to fluctuations in unit prices the gain or loss is equal to the difference between the price the sponsor pays for units and the price at which it sells or redeems them the sponsor may also gain or lose money when it deposits securities to create units the amount of its profit or loss on the initial deposit of securities into your trust is shown in the “notes to portfolio” for the trust      trust administration   the trust the trust is a unit investment trust registered under the investment company act of  the sponsor created your trust under the trust agreement between elkhorn securities llc as depositor elkhorn investments llc as evaluator and supervisor the “evaluator” and the bank of new york mellon as trustee each unit represents an undivided interest in the assets of the trust to create the trust the sponsor deposited securities with the trustee or contracts to purchase securities along with an irrevocable letter of credit cash or other consideration to pay for the securities in exchange the trustee delivered units of the trust to the sponsor these units remain outstanding until redeemed or until your trust terminates at the close of the new york stock exchange on the trust’s inception date or on the first day units are sold to the public if later the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals  the number of units and fractional interest of each unit in your trust will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment   changing your portfolio the trust is not a managed fund unlike a managed fund the trust’s ability to buy and sell securities is limited the trust will generally buy and sell securities     ● to invest on an ongoing basis in substantially all of the securities that comprise the index and to replicate the composition of the index     ● to pay expenses     ● to issue additional units or redeem units     ● in limited circumstances to protect the trust     ● to avoid direct or indirect ownership of a passive foreign investment company     ● to make required distributions or avoid imposition of taxes on the trust     ● to maintain the qualification of the trust as a regulated investment company or     ● as otherwise permitted by the trust agreement   when your trust sells securities the composition and diversity of the securities in the portfolio may be altered if a public tender offer has been made for a security or if a merger acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security the trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to unitholders if your trust receives securities or other property it will either hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds if any contract for the purchase of securities fails the sponsor will refund the cash and sales charge attributable to the failed contract to unitholders on or before the next distribution date unless substantially all of the moneys held to cover the purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement as described below   in the event that an issuer of any of the securities in the trust’s portfolio offers to issue new securities or to exchange securities for trust securities the trustee will at the direction of the sponsor accept or reject such offer or vote for or against any offer for new or exchanged securities or property in exchange for a portfolio security should any issuance exchange or substitution take place any securities or cash received will be deposited and promptly sold by the trustee      pursuant to the sponsor’s direction unless the sponsor advises the trustee to keep such securities or cash   notwithstanding the preceding discussion the trust will consist of as many of the securities in the index as is feasible on an ongoing basis it may be impracticable for the trust to own certain of such securities at any time adjustments to the trust to match the weightings of the securities as closely as is feasible with their weightings in the index may occur periodically of course there is no guarantee that this will always be practicable the excess proceeds from any sale will generally be invested in those securities that are most underrepresented in the trust changes in the index may occur as a result of merger or acquisition activity in such cases the trust as a shareholder of an issuer which is the object of such merger or acquisition activity will presumably receive various offers from potential acquirers of the issuer the trust is generally not permitted to accept any such offers until such time as the issuer has been removed from the index since in most cases an issuer is removed from an index only after the consummation of a merger or acquisition it is anticipated that the trust will generally acquire in exchange for the stock of the deleted issuer the consideration that is being offered to shareholders of that issuer who have not tendered their shares prior to that time   if the index is no longer maintained we may continue operation of the trust using the index as it existed on the last date it was available or we may terminate the trust   replacement securities in the event that any contract to purchase a security is not consummated in accordance with its terms a “failed contract security” the sponsor may instruct the trustee in writing either to effect a buyin in accordance with the rules of the marketplace where the failed contract securities were purchased or its clearinghouse or to purchase a replacement security the “replacement security” which has been selected by the sponsor out of funds held by the trustee purchases of replacement securities will be made subject to the following conditions     ● the replacement securities will be securities as originally selected for the trust or in the case of the trust that is a registered investment company for tax purposes securities that the sponsor determines to be similar in character as securities originally selected for the trust     ● the purchase of the replacement securities will not adversely affect the federal income tax status of the trust     ● the purchase price of the replacement securities will not exceed the total amount of cash deposited or the amount available under the letter of credit deposited by the sponsor at the time of the deposit of the failed contract security and     ● the replacement securities will be purchased within  days after the failed deposit of the failed contract security   in the event of a failed contract security where replacement securities cannot be purchased the cash will be returned to the unitholders and generally treated as a return on principal for tax purposes   any contract to deliver trust securities may not exceed  days from the effective date of the trust’s registration statement      the sponsor will increase the size of your trust as it sells units during the initial offering period when the sponsor creates additional units it will seek to replicate the existing portfolio   when your trust buys securities it may pay brokerage or other acquisition fees you could experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and fluctuations in security prices between the time the sponsor creates units and the time the trust buys the securities when your trust buys or sells securities the sponsor may direct that it place orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers that sell units or are affiliated with the trust or the trustee   investment policies when your trust was created the sponsor delivered to the trustee securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the trust after your trust is created the sponsor may deposit additional securities in the trust contracts to purchase additional securities along with cash or a bank letter of credit in lieu of cash to pay for such contracted securities or cash including a letter of credit with instructions to purchase additional securities such additional deposits will be in amounts which will seek to replicate as closely as practicable the portfolio immediately prior to such deposits if the sponsor deposits cash existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay the associated brokerage fees   unitholders will not be able to dispose of or vote any of the securities in the trust as the holder of the securities the trustee will vote the securities and will endeavor to vote the securities such that the securities are voted as closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion as are the securities held by owners other than the trust however the trustee may not be able to vote the securities in the trust that are traded on foreign exchanges   amending the trust agreement the sponsor the evaluator and the trustee can change the trust agreement without your consent to correct any provision that may be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely affect your interest as determined by the sponsor and the trustee the sponsor cannot change this agreement to reduce your interest in the trust without your consent investors owning twothirds of the units in the trust may vote to change this agreement   termination of the trust the trust will terminate on the termination date set forth under “essential information” for the trust the trustee may terminate your trust early if the value of the trust is less than  of the original value of the securities in the trust at the time of deposit at this size the expenses of your trust may create an undue burden on your investment investors owning twothirds of the units in your trust may also vote to terminate the trust early the trustee will liquidate your trust in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold to the public are tendered for redemption so that the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than  of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in the trust the trust may also terminate if the index is no longer maintained if this happens the sponsor will refund any sales charge that you paid   the trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any remaining securities the trustee will send your final distribution to you within a reasonable time following      liquidation of all the securities after deducting final expenses your termination distribution may be less than the price you originally paid for your units   the sponsor the sponsor of the trust is elkhorn securities llc elkhorn is registered under the securities exchange act of  as amended as a brokerdealer elkhorn is organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the state of delaware elkhorn is a member of the financial industry regulatory authority inc and the securities investor protection corporation the principal office of elkhorn is  reber street suite  wheaton illinois  if the sponsor fails to or cannot perform its duties as sponsor or becomes bankrupt the trustee may replace it continue to operate the trust without a sponsor or terminate the trust   the sponsor and the trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring their employees who have access to information on trust transactions to report personal securities transactions the purpose of the code is to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud deception or misconduct with respect to the trust   the evaluator and the supervisor the evaluator and supervisor of the trust is elkhorn investments llc a delaware limited liability

this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences   this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law   as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor   trust status the trust intends to qualify as a “regulated investment company” under the federal tax laws if the trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes   distributions trust distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates your trust’s distributions into two categories ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate however as further discussed below certain ordinary income distributions received from the trust may be taxed at the capital gains tax rates generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be currently taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year income from the trust may also be subject to a  “medicare tax” this tax generally applies      to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals   dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies however certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust from certain corporations may be reported by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction   sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units   capital gains and losses and certain ordinary income dividends if you are an individual the maximum marginal stated federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  for taxpayers in the  tax bracket  for taxpayers in the    and  tax brackets and  for taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets some portion of your capital gains dividends from the trust may be subject to a higher marginal stated federal tax rate capital gain received from assets held for more than one year that is considered “unrecaptured section  gain” which may be the case for example with some capital gains attributable to the reits included in the trust is taxed at a maximum stated tax rate of  in the case of capital gains dividends the determination of which portion of the capital gains dividend if any is subject to the  tax rate will be made based on rules prescribed by the united states treasury capital gains may also be subject to the “medicare tax” described above   net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your units at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations   ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a regulated investment company such as the trust are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust itself dividends from reits such as those held by the trust are qualifying dividends only in limited circumstances the trust will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible for the capital gains tax rates      inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an inkind distribution of trust securities when you redeem units or when your trust terminates this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received the internal revenue service could however assert that a loss could not be currently deducted   exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future series of the trust the exchange would generally be considered a sale for federal income tax purposes   deductibility of trust expenses expenses incurred and deducted by your trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individual’s adjusted gross income some individuals may also be subject to further limitations on the amount of their itemized deductions depending on their income   foreign tax credit if your trust invests in any foreign securities the tax statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust paid to other countries in this case dividends taxed to you will include your share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries you may be able to deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes   investments in certain foreign corporations if your trust holds an equity interest in any “passive foreign investment companies” “pfics” which are generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gains or that hold at least  of their assets in investments producing such passive income the trust could be subject to us federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity interests even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its unitholders the trust will not be able to pass through to its unitholders any credit or deduction for such taxes the trust may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences in this case the trust would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such pfic shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income under this election the trust might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from pfics and its proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock during that year and such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the  excise tax dividends paid by pfics are not treated as qualified dividend income   foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you should be aware that generally subject to applicable tax treaties distributions from the trust will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes other than dividends which the trust properly reports as capital gain dividends and will be subject to us income      taxes including withholding taxes subject to certain exceptions described below however distributions received by a foreign investor from the trust that are properly reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met distributions from the trust that are properly reported by the trust as an interestrelated dividend attributable to certain interest income received by the trust or as a shortterm capital gain dividend attributable to certain net short term capital gain income received by the trust may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes when received by certain foreign investors provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met in addition distributions in respect of units may be subject to a us withholding tax of  in the case of distributions to i certain nonus financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with the us treasury to collect and disclose certain information and are not resident in a jurisdiction that has entered into such an agreement with the us treasury and ii certain other nonus entities that do not provide certain certifications and information about the entity’s us owners dispositions of units by such persons may be subject to such withholding after december     expenses   the trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations the “fee table” shows the estimated amount of these expenses   the sponsor will receive a fee from the trust for creating and developing the trust including determining the trust’s objectives policies composition and size selecting service providers and information services and providing other similar administrative and ministerial functions this “creation and development fee” is a charge of  per unit the trustee will deduct this amount from the trust’s assets at the close of the initial offering period no portion of this fee is applied to the payment of distribution expenses or as compensation for sales efforts this fee will not be deducted from proceeds received upon a repurchase redemption or exchange of units before the close of the initial public offering period   the trust will pay a fee to the trustee for its services the trustee also benefits when it holds cash for the trust in noninterestbearing accounts the supervisor receives an annual fee as set forth herein for maintaining surveillance over the portfolio and for performing certain administrative services for the trust in providing such supervisory services the supervisor may purchase research from a variety of sources which may include dealers of the trust if so provided the sponsor may also receive an annual fee for providing bookkeeping and administrative services for the trust such services may include but are not limited to the preparation of various materials for unitholders and providing account information to the unitholders if so provided the evaluator may also receive an annual fee for performing evaluation services for the trust all of these fees may adjust for inflation without your approval   the trust will also pay licensing fees to mga for its use of trademarks trade names or other intellectual property owned by mga the licensing fee received by mga is equal to  annually of the average daily assets of the trust and is paid quarterly in arrears   the trust may pay expenses such as trustee expenses including legal and auditing expenses licensing andor portfolio consultant fees if applicable various governmental charges      fees for extraordinary trustee services costs of taking action to protect the trust costs of indemnifying the trustee and the sponsor offering costs incurred after the end of the initial offering period legal fees and expenses expenses incurred in contacting you and costs incurred to reimburse the trustee for advancing funds to meet distributions the trust may pay the costs of updating its registration statement each year the trustee may pay trust expenses from distributions received on the securities or may sell securities to pay trust expenses   index description   sponsor relies on the macro growth index for the trust’s initial universe of securities when selecting the trust’s portfolio the qualifications for the initial portfolio are set forth under “index eligibility”   the index is rebalanced monthly according to the following steps      on the last calendar date of the month review the portfolio as a whole and give the portfolio an ecr     a if the ecr of the portfolio as a whole is  or  no changes to the portfolio are made     b if the ecr of the portfolio as a whole is less than  then a “rebalance” will occur by removing the individual common stocks in the portfolio with an ecr of   or no rating and replacing them with the qualified equities with the highest mrl until  individual common stocks are in the portfolio     c if there are no qualified equities available or not enough to replace the removed common stocks such that the portfolio is holding less than  common stocks change the qualified equities screen by lowering the ecr minimum from  to      d select the remaining stocks from the eil ranking based on the highest listed eil   if there is still not enough holdings to reach  common stocks in the portfolio then the remaining portfolio will be allocated to the treasury bond etfs until the next rebalance date as described in “principal investment strategy” if the portfolio holds less than  common stocks at the end of the month on the next rebalance date skip step a of the rebalance methodology above and begin at step b      each common stock in the portfolio will be given a weight of  at each rebalance if a rebalance results in less than  stocks in the portfolio each stock will still receive a  weight and the remaining weight of the portfolio will be held in the treasury bond etfs up to the limitations described in the principal investment strategy until the next rebalance date      if at any point in the month a common stock is converted to cash ceases to trade as a listed security or shares of such common stock are converted to shares of another company “corporate action” the cash value generated from the corporate action will go to cash in the portfolio thus creating a portfolio that holds less than  common stocks if the portfolio ever holds less than       common stocks at the end of the month on a rebalance evaluation date begin the rebalance methodology with step b      if at any point in the month a common stock is no longer affiliated with its original parent company ignore the corporate action so that the portfolio continues to hold the parent company equity security or same ticker symbol at the same weighting as the portfolio security at the close of business on the last day of trading before the “spin off” occurs   the trust’s portfolio is not managed but will be rebalanced to track changes to the index mga will run the index strategy on the last business day of each month the trustee will use its best efforts to purchase or sell securities based on the rebalanced index portfolio at the close of trading on the new york stock exchange on the first business day of the following month   experts   legal matters chapman and cutler llp  west monroe street chicago illinois  acts as
