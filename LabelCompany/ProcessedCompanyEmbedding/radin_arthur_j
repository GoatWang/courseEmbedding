sustainability assurance reporting a nascent magazine article the cpa journal sustainability assurance reporting a nascent niche likely to grow by radin arthur j read preview magazine article the cpa journal sustainability assurance reporting a nascent niche likely to grow by radin arthur j read preview article excerpt the use of sustainability reports for public and private companies has blossomed in the last few years reports run from as few as five to more than  pages and generally have pretty pictures lots of verbiage as to the companys intentions improvements from previous years and a future commitment to be a good corporate citizen they indicate room for improvement and managements intent to improve as sustainability reporting becomes more widespread it will increasingly encroach on territory long considered within the remit of cpaselements of sustainability reportingadvocates for sustainability reportingwho have become increasingly numerous and vociferous in recent yearsuse many different terms such as sustainability good citizenship environmental social and governance esg environmental responsibility and responsible investing the terms are not quite equivalent but all address the same general conceptsone key concept in sustainability reporting is that of stakeholders stakeholders include anyone currently doing business with the company or using its products anyone living in communities where the company operates and anyone who might be affected by the company in the future the breadth of this definition however raises the question of its usefulness companies generally limit their reporting to investors suppliers employees customers neighbors and governments all of whom clearly have a stake in the company issues such as greenhouse gas emissions ghg however clearly have an effect beyond those partiesanother significant issue is materiality or what is material to a stakeholder and which stakeholders are material to the company many sustainability reports discuss how the company has determined what is material normally not in a quantitative manner because stakeholders can be defined as anything from a small number of people to all living things materiality is an open issue and debate as to standards continuessustainability reports themselves differ significantly in quantity of statistics some give percentages showing improvements such as our use of water for each dollar of sales was down  others have tables going back many years indicating in detail the quantitative improvements being made the reports may also address good citizenship covering many areas that do not directly affect environmental sustainability such as employee diversity community involvement human rights womens empowerment charitable giving or indigenous rights many also have a governance section indicating the appropriateness of their corporate controls as with most corporate reporting the reports are very upbeatstandards of sustainability reportingthere are a number of published standards for sustainability reports generally referred to as frameworks the global reporting initiative gri sustainability reporting guidelines is the most commonly used the gri is based in europe and has partnered with many companies and the major accounting firms in the united states the sustainability accounting standards board sasb provides standards for specific industries in addition at least nine other organizations have published their own sustainability frameworksin this authors view the gris guidelines are the most comprehensive with  different disclosures required for complete conformity some companies list all of them and disclose whether or why any are omitted others just list those they are following the companies listing the requirements give interactive crossreferences to the information including in some cases the form k proxy statements and similar documents the gris website indicates which companies currently use its frameworkthere is no legal requirement for a sustainability report in the united states the pressure comes from various stakeholders in addition some investment analysts believe very strongly in esg issues and will only recommend investment in a company with an appropriate esg profile … subscribe today subscribe to questia and enjoy full access to this article and
