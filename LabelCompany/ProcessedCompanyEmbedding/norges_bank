norways new banknote series were put into circulation on may  this is an important milestone in the work to issue new banknotes the notes  are the product of highly advanced graphic design that will function as a secure and effective means of payment for many years to come governor øystein olsen saidenhanced securitythe public should familiarise themselves with the security features on the new banknotessecurity and confidence in cash as a means of payment are the main reasons why we are now launching new banknotes the general public needs to be confident that a krone note is actually worth its face value at the same time the authenticity of the banknotes must be easy to verify trond eklund the project manager for the new banknote series saidthe general public should note two new security features in the lowerleft corner of the front side of the new notes there is a ring when you tilt the banknote in different directions the ring appears to float and you can see a play of colors when you tilt the note back and forth the chain on the righthand side of the banknote appears to moveas with previous series watermarks and security threads are also featured in the new banknote seriesold banknotes to circulate until the old krone and krone banknotes will circulate in parallel with the new banknotes for a period and will remain legal tender until may   after this period norges bank is obliged to exchange these notes for at least  more yearswe encourage the general public to either spend their old banknotes or deposit them in a bank account well ahead of  may  mr eklund saidthe motifs on all of the new banknote series denominations show the importance of the sea for the prosperity and welfare of the people of norway the primary motif on the front side of the krone banknote is a viking ship while on the krone note a cod is portrayed facing left on the back sides abstract representations of a cargo ship krone note and a fishing boat krone note can be seen on the horizonthe banknotes were designed by norges banks banknote designers arild yttri and morten johansen the designs on the front sides of the banknotes are based on the proposal from metric design and terje tønnessen the proposals for the back of the notes were submitted by snøhetta design the primary motifs were drawn by the artist sverre morken the atlantic puffin watermark motif is based on a photo taken by photographer tom schandythe new krone and krone banknotes were printed by oberthur fiduciare in francelaunch in lofotenthe official launch of the new banknotes took place in svolvær on may  at  pm from that time the new  and krone banknotes will be made available to banks at norges banks central bank depots in tromsø trondheim bergen stavanger and oslothere are very few places that reflect the primary motifs of the krone and krone bank notes better than lofoten abundant cod from the lofoten fisheries has sustained people in norway and abroad for centuries and lofoten has a history as a seat of power in the viking age we are therefore delighted that the launch of the new banknotes will be marked in lofoten governor olsen saidthe krone and krone banknotes in the new banknote series will be issued in autumn  while the krone banknote will be issued in  world banknotes currently available on ebay  pic title details world banknotes scarce lot of ps mix world
