insurance company  wilson mills road mayfield village ohio  httpwwwprogressivecom ■ glenn m renwick served as president chairman and chief executive officer of progressive casualty insurance company at progressive he was able to create longterm profitability through his accurate predictive insurance models which allowed the company to insure highrisk drivers renwick was known as a responsive and accessible leader who welcomed new innovations in technology and believed in truthfulness in business learning about and marketing to the customer renwick joined progressive casualty insurance company in  as an auto product manager for florida as he worked in the daytoday local operations of the company he learned much about progressives clients foremost among these lessons was that customers find it hard to shop for car insurance the easier a company makes it to buy a policy the more likely a customer is to purchase the insurance he also learned that good accessible customer service can make the difference in a companys reputation whether the customer is shopping for insurance or submitting a claim following an accident these customer details became very important to renwick when he entered progressives brand advertising and marketing department remembering the lessons learned in progressives local operations renwick developed a strategy to help customers shop for insurance his idea was to focus progressives marketing campaign on the specific services that assisted customers in their search for the best insurance carrier these services included competitively priced auto insurance rates excellent customer services and a practice of giving customers quotes from other competitive insurance companies as well as their own progressives successful marketing campaign resulted in an increase of market share from  percent in  to  percent in  using the internet after his successes in the consumer marketing group renwick moved into a new role as chief information officer in  the position of cio at progressive proved to be an intense and important role since progressive placed so much weight on technology and customer education one of progressives most marketed features was their provision of insurance quotes and the selling of insurance over the internet beginning in  renwick extended progressives internet services through creation of online interactive customer services through which customers could look up their policy information obtain a policy quote check the status of a claim make online payments and update personal account information renwick considered the project named personal progressive one of his best customerfocused innovations because it allowed customers to examine their insurance policies without going through an insurance agent or customer service representative as part of his plan to educate customers renwick added the insurance institute for highway safetys sideimpact headprotection crash videos to the progressive website the stated purpose of the videos was to help progressives customers make informed vehicle and insurancepurchase decisions the posting of the videos on progressives website garnered considerable media attention since it was the only authorized online outlet for viewing the crashtest videos at that time in recognition of its usefulness and functionality the companys web site was named one of infoweek magazines top  web sites that work in  and also was named to smart business magazines smart business  later in his term as chief information office renwick used his finance and engineering skills to create an accurate predictive formula to determine insurance rates the formula models were set up as a detailed oriented approach to calculating insurance rates based on how much when and where a particular person drives the high level of predictive accuracy from the calculations allowed the company to profitably insure highrisk drivers the main goal of the cio during renwicks tenure was to ensure that progressives technology remained ahead of the other industry leaders and he met it with great success the big picture shortterm loss for a longterm goal in  after two successful years as cio renwick became progressives chief executive officer as ceo renwick made the tough decision to raise insurance rates because it was the only strategy that would keep rates accurately reflecting current costs at the same time renwick changed the duration of the insurance policies from  months to six months although a survey of customers found that most people prefer a longerduration policy renwick felt that a shorter policy would allow the company to enhance the accuracy of their insurance rates wall street and other industry leaders immediately criticized renwick for his rate hike and in  progressive had only  percent net new business however the company soon gained more new business when larger companies such as state farm insurance had to start aggressively raising their insurance rates after their artificially low rates resulted in large financial losses by  progressives new net business was booming and the company had a  percent increase in newinsurance premiums as progressives new ceo renwick felt that it was best to categorize and prioritize the different challenges confronting him he narrowed his management goals to making operations more efficient improving customer services and keeping expenses low to decrease expenses and improve corporate efficiency renwick reorganized and clarified progressives management structure and focused on new technologies to boost efficiency as a way to keep his finger on the pulse of clients needs renwick created a series of customer questionnaires outside his goals as ceo renwicks priority for the company was to ensure that the insurance companys rates and reserves remained adequate progressives focus on the accuracy of rates helped the company remain true to its slogan to make their business all about the customer innovation and information technologies when renwick became ceo after the tenure of the eccentric visionary peter lewis progressive was already known for its ability to implement new and innovative ideas successfully renwick continued the companys policy of innovation by concentrating on the weaknesses of the carinsurance business and trying to find creative solutions to solve the problems for example renwick recognized that carinsurance companies have the least control over events when customers are most anxious right after an accident to address this issue renwick created a network of onestop shopping centers that allow the customer to bring in the damaged car and get a replacement car immediately and also get a beeper so that the insurer can get in touch with the customer when the car is ready  businessweek online  april   these onestopshopping centers helped lessen customer confusion following an accident and increased the speed with which claims were processed in keeping with his former role as cio renwick created another model for progressive to track information technology it expenses given the large number of technological innovations implemented throughout the company it was important to efficiently track the amount of profit directly related to the cost of specific it developments with an it expense tracking model renwick was able to develop a simple budget that kept tabs on specific innovations their cost and their overall impact on business operations if a project was costing more money and having a minimal positive effect compared with other innovations renwick and his managers would be aware of it and could further evaluate the merit of that particular it innovation management style renwick was known as a responsive and communicative leader who welcomed new innovations in technology when he became ceo of progressive he focused on the companys organizational structure so that every employee would understand his or her job objectives and responsibilities by establishing accountability and clear objectives renwick encouraged employees to focus fully on their positions goals and thus improve company productivity and he communicated openly and honestly with his employees and shareholders so that they understood the motivations behind the business decisions made in the company in fact to emphasize his position renwick placed a picture of a naked man and the title bare all on the companys  annual report he believed that the atmosphere of candor and openness at progressive was responsible for the success of the company as he put it in insurance the foundation of success is trust to be trusted you need integrity and you need to be open  intelligent enterprise  march

officer address progressive casualty insurance company  wilson mills road mayfield village ohio  httpwwwprogressivecom ■ glenn m renwick served as president chairman and chief executive officer of progressive casualty insurance company at progressive he was able to create longterm profitability through his accurate predictive insurance models which allowed the company to insure highrisk drivers renwick was known as a responsive and accessible leader who welcomed new innovations in technology and believed in truthfulness in business learning about and marketing to the customer renwick joined progressive casualty insurance company in  as an auto product manager for florida as he worked in the daytoday local operations of the company he learned much about progressives clients foremost among these lessons was that customers find it hard to shop for car insurance the easier a company makes it to buy a policy the more likely a customer is to purchase the insurance he also learned that good accessible customer service can make the difference in a companys reputation whether the customer is shopping for insurance or submitting a claim following an accident these customer details became very important to renwick when he entered progressives brand advertising and marketing department remembering the lessons learned in progressives local operations renwick developed a strategy to help customers shop for insurance his idea was to focus progressives marketing campaign on the specific services that assisted customers in their search for the best insurance carrier these services included competitively priced auto insurance rates excellent customer services and a practice of giving customers quotes from other competitive insurance companies as well as their own progressives successful marketing campaign resulted in an increase of market share from  percent in  to  percent in  using the internet after his successes in the consumer marketing group renwick moved into a new role as chief information officer in  the position of cio at progressive proved to be an intense and important role since progressive placed so much weight on technology and customer education one of progressives most marketed features was their provision of insurance quotes and the selling of insurance over the internet beginning in  renwick extended progressives internet services through creation of online interactive customer services through which customers could look up their policy information obtain a policy quote check the status of a claim make online payments and update personal account information renwick considered the project named personal progressive one of his best customerfocused innovations because it allowed customers to examine their insurance policies without going through an insurance agent or customer service representative as part of his plan to educate customers renwick added the insurance institute for highway safetys sideimpact headprotection crash videos to the progressive website the stated purpose of the videos was to help progressives customers make informed vehicle and insurancepurchase decisions the posting of the videos on progressives website garnered considerable media attention since it was the only authorized online outlet for viewing the crashtest videos at that time in recognition of its usefulness and functionality the companys web site was named one of infoweek magazines top  web sites that work in  and also was named to smart business magazines smart business  later in his term as chief information office renwick used his finance and engineering skills to create an accurate predictive formula to determine insurance rates the formula models were set up as a detailed oriented approach to calculating insurance rates based on how much when and where a particular person drives the high level of predictive accuracy from the calculations allowed the company to profitably insure highrisk drivers the main goal of the cio during renwicks tenure was to ensure that progressives technology remained ahead of the other industry leaders and he met it with great success the big picture shortterm loss for a longterm goal in  after two successful years as cio renwick became progressives chief executive officer as ceo renwick made the tough decision to raise insurance rates because it was the only strategy that would keep rates accurately reflecting current costs at the same time renwick changed the duration of the insurance policies from  months to six months although a survey of customers found that most people prefer a longerduration policy renwick felt that a shorter policy would allow the company to enhance the accuracy of their insurance rates wall street and other industry leaders immediately criticized renwick for his rate hike and in  progressive had only  percent net new business however the company soon gained more new business when larger companies such as state farm insurance had to start aggressively raising their insurance rates after their artificially low rates resulted in large financial losses by  progressives new net business was booming and the company had a  percent increase in newinsurance premiums as progressives new ceo renwick felt that it was best to categorize and prioritize the different challenges confronting him he narrowed his management goals to making operations more efficient improving customer services and keeping expenses low to decrease expenses and improve corporate efficiency renwick reorganized and clarified progressives management structure and focused on new technologies to boost efficiency as a way to keep his finger on the pulse of clients needs renwick created a series of customer questionnaires outside his goals as ceo renwicks priority for the company was to ensure that the insurance companys rates and reserves remained adequate progressives focus on the accuracy of rates helped the company remain true to its slogan to make their business all about the customer innovation and information technologies when renwick became ceo after the tenure of the eccentric visionary peter lewis progressive was already known for its ability to implement new and innovative ideas successfully renwick continued the companys policy of innovation by concentrating on the weaknesses of the carinsurance business and trying to find creative solutions to solve the problems for example renwick recognized that carinsurance companies have the least control over events when customers are most anxious right after an accident to address this issue renwick created a network of onestop shopping centers that allow the customer to bring in the damaged car and get a replacement car immediately and also get a beeper so that the insurer can get in touch with the customer when the car is ready businessweek online april   these onestopshopping centers helped lessen customer confusion following an accident and increased the speed with which claims were processed in keeping with his former role as cio renwick created another model for progressive to track information technology it expenses given the large number of technological innovations implemented throughout the company it was important to efficiently track the amount of profit directly related to the cost of specific it developments with an it expense tracking model renwick was able to develop a simple budget that kept tabs on specific innovations their cost and their overall impact on business operations if a project was costing more money and having a minimal positive effect compared with other innovations renwick and his managers would be aware of it and could further evaluate the merit of that particular it innovation management style renwick was known as a responsive and communicative leader who welcomed new innovations in technology when he became ceo of progressive he focused on the companys organizational structure so that every employee would understand his or her job objectives and responsibilities by establishing accountability and clear objectives renwick encouraged employees to focus fully on their positions goals and thus improve company productivity and he communicated openly and honestly with his employees and shareholders so that they understood the motivations behind the business decisions made in the company in fact to emphasize his position renwick placed a picture of a naked man and the title bare all on the companys  annual report he believed that the atmosphere of candor and openness at progressive was responsible for the success of the company as he put it in insurance the foundation of success is trust to be trusted you need integrity and you need to be open intelligent enterprise march   sources for further information gallagher julie alone in the spotlight insurance and technology june   pp – gogoi pallavi progressive
