contains four financial metrics adjusted net income ebitda adjusted ebita and free cash flow that are considered “nongaap” financial metrics under applicable securities and exchange commission rules and regulations these nongaap financial metrics should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the company’s definition of these nongaap metrics may differ from similarly titled metrics used by others adjusted net income adjusts for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to

financial metrics as a means to facilitate management’s financial and operational decisionmaking including evaluation of the company’s historical operating results and comparison to competitors’ operating results these nongaap financial metrics reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company’s operations that when viewed with gaap results may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company’s business the determination of the amounts that are excluded from these nongaap financial metrics is a matter of management judgment and depends upon among other factors the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts because nongaap financial metrics exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the company’s reported results of
