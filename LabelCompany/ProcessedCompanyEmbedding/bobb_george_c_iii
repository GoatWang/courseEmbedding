jason is the general manager of a teledyne company with international sales after receiving the necessary corporate approvals under teledyne s policy his company entered into an agreement with michael a sales representative in france during a visit to france jason meets with michael to discuss upcoming sales opportunities with a government entity jason asks michael whether he thinks his company will have a good chance of winning the competition to supply products to a new industrial site michael says if you double my commission it might give me enough wiggle room to win the project jason asks how doubling the commission would help michael says don t worry about the details you double my commission and i can get the sale response a sales representative asking for an increased commission in connection with a particular sale is a red flag because the sales representative may be seeking funds he can use to bribe a procurement official another red flag is the sales representative being vague about why he wants an increased commission jason should tell the sales representative that he cannot increase the commission and should reiterate the company s anticorruption policies which are set forth in teledyne s code of conduct for service providers jason should report the discussion to the chief compliance officer or the general counsel so that the company can take appropriate action with respect to the sales representative situation in the course of the performance of a contract jason has arranged for a training session to take place in his
