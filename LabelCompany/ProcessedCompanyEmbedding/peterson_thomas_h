hereintechnical fieldthe present disclosure relates to chemical production processes systems and catalyst compositionsbackground of the disclosurefor nearly a century scientists have struggled with the efficient dehydration of multihydric alcohol compounds for example the dehydration of glycerol to acrolein acetol and glycerol oligomers was first reported by nef in  when compositions were heated to temperatures between ° c and ° c carbonaceous materials and a distillate were produced that contained acrolein acetol water and formaldehyde among other products over the next  years occasional reports of catalyzed conversions of glycerol had been communicated targeting conversion to acrolein and acetol directly as an example the condensation of glycerol to di tri and oligoglycerol ethers had been effected with basic catalysts however when acidic catalysts were employed acrolein is formed as a major byproduct as another example acrolein has also been reported as a product of castor oil hydrolysis and cracking conversion of multihydric alcohol compounds has been performed in the temperature range of ° c to ° c utilizing phosphate or sulfate acid or acid salt as a catalyst however clays zeolites co or autoionization of supercritical ho has been shown to effect dehydration with the yields of acrolein rarely exceeding while examples of glycerol to acrolein transformation do exist they are relatively few in number as recently as  us japanese and european patents have been awarded describing the conversion of glycerol to acrolein and acrolein hydrogenation to a mixture of isomeric propanediols in  platinum bisphosphine complexes were used in the presence of strong acids and syn gas to carry out the conversion of glycerol to acrolein in  yield more recently glycerol dehydration in subcritical water catalyzed by znso in a staged reactor process has been utilized to convert glycerol to acrolein and acrylic acid to date processes having high selectivity and commercial viability are still not known for the conversion of glycerol to acroleinsummary of the disclosurechemical production processes are provided that can include exposing a reactant composition

plot of data acquired utilizing an embodiment of the disclosurefig  is a plot of data acquired utilizing an embodiment of the disclosuredescriptionthis disclosure is submitted in furtherance of the constitutional purposes of the us patent laws “to promote the progress of science and useful arts” article  section the chemical production processes of the present disclosure will be described with reference to figs  referring first to fig  a chemical production process system  is shown that includes a reactor  coupled to both a reactant reservoir  and a product reservoir  in accordance with the present disclosure reactant reservoir  can be coupled to reactor  utilizing conduits that facilitate the flow of reactant from reactant reservoir  to reactor  this flow can be facilitated utilizing pressure differentials between reactant reservoir  and reactor  for example these pressure differentials can be facilitated utilizing pumps to provide a pressure differential between reactant reservoir  and reactor  the reactant within reactant reservoir  can be a multihydric alcohol compound an example multihydric alcohol compound can include the compound glycerol which when dehydrated can result in a product composition that includes one or both of acrolein andor acetol for examplereactor  can include a housing that can be configured to house a catalyst and be utilized to facilitate the exposure of the reactant within reactant reservoir  to catalyst within reactor  the catalyst can be supported andor unsupported catalyst for example unsupported catalysts can be referred to as bulk catalysts reactor  can be jacketed or can be configured as a fluidized bed reactor for examplethe product composition provided to product reservoir  can be a dehydration product of the multihydric alcohol compound such as a carbonyl compound the pressure differential apparatus used to facilitate the transfer of reactant from reactant reservoir  can also be utilized to provide product from reactor  to product reservoir  in accordance with an example embodiment system  can be configured to expose a multihydric alcohol compound such as glycerol from reservoir  to a catalyst composition within reactor  to form a product composition including one or both of acrolein and acetolin accordance with another embodiment fig  depicts a chemical production system  that includes a reactor  coupled to a reactant reservoir  as well as a product reservoir  reactant of reactant reservoir  can be a multihydric alcohol compound for example to facilitate the flow of reactant from reactant reservoir  to reactor  a carrier composition  including a gas or liquid such as nitrogen is provided to a reactant reservoir conduit utilizing flow control  in accordance with another embodiment co can be utilized as the carrier composition  these solid support beds were also treated with co and reactant from reactor reservoir  can be combined with carrier composition  and provided to reactor reactor  can be configured as an oil heated reactor utilizing an oil heater  reactor  can be configured having a catalyst  supported by packing material  catalyst  can include elements of group  and  of the periodic table of elements for example such as the polyoxometallates of these elements more particularly catalyst  can include nb mo andor w catalyst  can be hydrated or oxided for example catalyst  can be hydrated nobia catalyst  can include tungstic acid andor phosphotungstic acid catalyst  can include phosphomolybdic acid catalyst  can be supported with a silica support prior to exposing reactant to catalyst  catalyst  can be exposed to carrier composition  such as cocatalyst  can be prepared in a jar by placing  g of tungstic acid for example with a stir bar in the jar the acid can be slurried with  ml of ho and approximately  ml of m aqueous ammonia solution ph colloidal silica  g  ml can then be added to the jar with vigorous stirring resulting in precipitation after stirring for  hours the solution can be concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator with a bath temperature of ° c and operating at a pressure of  torr the solid can be transferred to a porcelain crucible and calcined for  hours at ° c to provide a solid product subsequently the solid product can be crushed and sieved to × mesh for examplepacking material  can include quartz wool in accordance with one example glycerol from reactant reservoir  can be provided with carrier composition  to reactor  and exposed to catalyst  such as solid support materials a temperature within reactor  during exposure of reactant to these solid support materials is in the range of about ° c to about ° c more particularly in the range of from about ° c to about ° c reactant can reside in reactor  for contact times of from about  to about  millisecondsin accordance with example implementations the production process can include exposing the multihydric alcohol compound glycerol to catalyst  to form a product composition that includes both acrolein and acetol for every mole of glycerol exposed to catalyst  at least about  moles of product composition can be formed andor from about  to about  moles of product composition can be formed further a mole ratio of acrolein to acetol within the product composition can be at least about  andor from about  to about hydrated forms of metal oxides of catalyst  can demonstrate acidic behavior and the overall acidity can be controlled by the degree of hydration in some cases niobia for example the degree of hydration can itself be controlled by the pretreatment temperature of the oxide thus pretreatment can provide a vehicle for tuning the acidity of a materialpelleted niobia can be calcined for periods of  hours at temperatures of ° c ° c ° c and ° c the calcined materials can then be crushed and sieved to a size appropriate for the reactor and evaluated at temperatures between ° c and ° c employing contact times of  milliseconds or less results for catalysts which are tabulated as averages of multiple runs are shown in tables  and  belowtable performance of hydrated niobia for glycerol dehydration at °

remaining data of the present application can be acquired utilizing gas and liquid chromatography techniques for example gas chromatographic analyses can be performed utilizing a shimadzu gc gas chromatograph gc equipped with a flame ionization detection fid operating at ° c and an aoc autosampler and employing gc solutions software a dbwax j  w scientific capillary column  m× mm id× μm film thickness can be employed utilizing helium as carrier gas at a  mlmin flow rate injections of  μl utilizing a  split ratio can be made with the injector port maintained at ° c oven temperature programming can utilize an initial temperature of ° c with a hold for  minutes followed by a ° cmin ramp to ° c and a hold at the final temperature for  minutes calibrations can be performed on a periodic or monthly basis using known standard solutions for glycerol acrolein and acetol calibrations can take place using a series of five standard solutions prepared by serial dilution to determine the linear response for each compound and acceptance of each curve determined if the linear response had an r value of greater than liquid chromatographic analyses can be carried out on a waters lc system incorporating a waters  pump waters  refractive index detector rid and a waters plus autosampler for sample introduction analyses can be performed utilizing empower pro software separations of  μl injections can be effected on an aminex hpxh organic acid analysis column operated at ° c and employing a  m hso as the eluent with a flow rate of  mlmin total run times of  minutes were sufficient to elute all compounds of interest calibration curves can be prepared as described for gc calibrations and using the same set of standard solutions used for gc calibrationreferring to product reservoir  of system  upon exiting reactor  product can be acquired by time collection of reactor  effluent in a known quantity of a chilled scrub solution containing  wt  nbuoh with mass balances for a given reactor run determined by a ratio of collected effluent mass to expected mass based on feed rate and run time for example two small aliquots can be removed and diluted to concentrations appropriate for gc and lc analyses the diluted samples can then be analyzed as described previously and wt  compositions determined from calibrated detector responses used to determine absolute compositions of the collected effluent the use of known quantities of nbuoh in the scrub solutions can permit a primary check of analytical sampling technique reported values for conversion yield selectivity and carbon balance present averages of those values determined by both gc and lc analyses glycerol conversion can be calculated by the differences between calculated quantity of glycerol feed based on feed rate and run time and the quantity of glycerol collected in the reactor effluent and may be uncertain when mass balances are not satisfactory values exclude any experimental runs that did not provide mass balances between  and  product yields can be calculated by the ratio of quantity of product formed to the quantity of glycerol product selectivities can be calculated from the quantity of product formed divided by the quantity of glycerol converted carbon balances can be calculated from the sum of the molar quantities of glycerol acrolein and acetol components divided by the molar quantity of glycerol fed liquid chromatographic techniques can permit the quantification of formic acid and acetic acid byproducts however since their combined quantity rarely exceeded  their presence was not included in carbon balance determinationreferring to tables  and  for catalyst calcined at ° c conversion can be reduced consistent with reduced acidity the differences between niobia samples calcined at ° c and lower temperatures can indicate that niobia rehydration to more acidic forms even under hydrothermal conditions may not occur for runs at  and ° c the niobia samples calcined at ° c can provide low yields and carbon balances niobia deposition onto an inert support tables  and  silica entry can result in lower activity but increased selectivity both observations can be consistent with reduced total acidity in the prepared catalysts which lead to lower rates for both catalytic dehydration and catalystpromoted product decompositioncommercial samples of tungstic and phosphotungstic acid can be dissolved in water and deposited onto colloidal silica to prepare catalyst  as well the supported catalysts can be evaluated for glycerol dehydration at ° c and ° c
