accepted in the united states of america “us gaap”   note  – summary of significant accounting policies   use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made however actual results could differ materially from those results   segment information asc  requires companies to report information about operating segment in interim and annual financial statements it also requires segment disclosures about products and services geographic and major customers the company has determined that it does not have any separately reportable operating segments   accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount net of an allowance for doubtful accounts the company follows paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer’s current credit worthiness as determined by the review of their current credit information and determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical writeoff experience customer specific facts and economic conditions   outstanding account balances are reviewed individually for collectability the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the company’s existing accounts receivable bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expenses if any pursuant to paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote the company has adopted paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification and determine when receivables are past due or delinquent based on how recently payments have been received     f      inventories the company values inventories consisting of raw materials packaging material and finished goods at the lower of cost or market cost is determined on the firstin and firstout “fifo” method for raw materials and packaging materials and the weighted average cost method for finished goods cost of finished goods comprises direct labor direct materials direct production cost and an allocated portion of production overhead the company reduces inventories for the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence damage or other issues affecting marketability equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates ii estimates of future demand iii competitive pricing pressures ivnew product introductions v product expiration dates and vi component and packaging obsolescence   the company evaluates its current level of inventories considering historical sales and other factors and based on this evaluation classify inventory markdowns in the income statement as a component of cost of goods sold pursuant to paragraph s of the fasb accounting standards codification to adjust inventories to net realizable value these markdowns are estimates which could vary significantly from actual requirements if future economic conditions customer demand or competition differ from expectations other significant estimates include the allocation of variable and fixed production overheads while variable production overheads are allocated to each unit of production on the basis of actual use of production facilities the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion is based on the normal capacity of the company’s production facilities and recognizes abnormal idle facility expenses as current period charges certain costs including categories of indirect materials indirect labor and other indirect manufacturing costs which are included in the overhead pools are estimated the management of the company determines its normal capacity based upon the amount of operating hours of the manufacturing machinery and equipment in a reporting period   as of march   the inventory value was    revenue recognition the company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with asc  originally issued as staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when a formal arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable the delivery is completed no other significant obligations of the company exist and collectability is reasonably assured payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue discounts provided to customers by the company at the time of sale are recognized as a reduction in sales as the products are sold sales taxes are not recorded as a component of sales   the company derives its revenues from sales contracts with customers with revenues being generated upon the shipment of merchandise persuasive evidence of an arrangement is demonstrated via sales invoice or contract product delivery is evidenced by warehouse shipping log as well as a signed acknowledgement of receipt from the customers or a signed bill of lading from the third party trucking company and title transfers upon shipment based on free on board “fob” warehouse terms the sales price to the customer is fixed upon acceptance of the signed purchase order or contract and there is no separate sales rebate discount or volume incentive when the company recognizes revenue no provisions are made for returns because historically there have been very few sales returns and adjustments that have impacted the ultimate collection of revenues   the company markets and distributes electronic products and general cargo for automobile use and follows section  formerly eitf  “asc section ” of the fasb accounting standards codification for revenue recognition to report revenue gross as a principal for its sales since the company  acts as principal in the transaction  takes title to the products  has risks and rewards of ownership such as the risk of loss for collection delivery or returns and  does not act as an agent or broker including performing services in substance as an agent or broker with compensation on a commission or fee basis on its sales the management of the company determined that the company should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer when considering each of the following eight  indicators of gross revenue reporting listed in asc paragraph  through  as specified  the entity is the primary obligor in the arrangement — the company signs a product sales agreement with its customer and represents in writing that the company is responsible for fulfillment including the acceptability of the products or services ordered or purchased by the customer  the entity has general inventory risk before customer order is placed or upon customer return  the entity has latitude in establishing price — the company has reasonable latitude within economic constraints to establish the exchange price with a customer for the product or service  the entity changes the product or performs part of the service— the company developed a method for blending the raw materials in its manufacturing process through its proprietary technology catalysts can be mixed with fuel and alcohols to become a finished product to be sold after pumping and piping  the entity has discretion in supplier selection — the company has multiple suppliers for the products ordered by a customer and discretion to select the supplier that will provide the products or services ordered by a customer  the entity is involved in the determination of product or service specifications — the company determines the nature type characteristics or specifications of the products or services ordered by the customer  the entity has physical loss inventory risk of purchased inventories after customer order and  the entity has credit risk — the company is responsible for collecting the sales price from its customer but must pay the amount owed to its supplier after the supplier performs regardless of whether the sales price is fully collected net sales of products represent the invoiced value of goods net of value added taxes “vat” the company is subject to vat which is levied on all of the company’s products at the rate of  on the invoiced value of sales sales or output vat is borne by customers in addition to the invoiced value of sales and purchase or input vat is borne by the company in addition to the invoiced value of purchases to the extent not refunded for export sales     f      fair value of financial instruments the fair values of the company’s accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values due to the relatively short maturities of these instruments the carrying value of the company’s short and long term debt approximates fair value based on management’s best estimate of the interest rates that would be available for similar debt obligations having similar terms at the balance sheet date   impairment of longlived assets the company accounts for the impairment and disposition of longlived assets in accordance with asc  property plant and equipment the company periodically evaluates longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable if the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the use of an asset were less than the carrying value a writedown would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value   the assumptions used by management in determining the future cash flows are critical in the event these expected cash flows are not realized future impairment losses may be recorded   income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes which requires that the company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse deferred income tax benefit expense results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities a valuation allowance is recorded when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some or all of any deferred tax assets will not be realized   the company adopted asc  income taxes overallrecognition on january   which provides criteria for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax position the company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the company did not recognize any additional liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a result of the implementation of asc    net income loss per share the company calculates its basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with asc  basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average outstanding shares to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive warrants and options and convertible securities   translation adjustment

foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of transaction any differences between the initially recorded amount and the settlement amount are recorded as a gain or loss on foreign currency transaction in the consolidated statements of operations monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the functional

going concern “asu ”   in connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period an entity’s management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events considered in the aggregate that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable   management’s evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are issued or at the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events considered in the aggregate indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued the term probable is used consistently with its use in topic  contingencies   when management identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern management should consider whether its plans that are intended to mitigate those relevant conditions or events will alleviate the substantial doubt the mitigating effect of management’s plans should be considered only to the extent that  it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented and if so  it is probable that the plans will mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern   if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern but the substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management’s plans the entity should disclose information that enables users of the financial statements to understand all of the following or refer to similar information disclosed elsewhere in the footnotes a principal

assumptions   overview   from november  until october  through our china subsidiary we were engaged in design marketing and distributing of alcohol base clean fuel which are designed to use less fossil fuel and have less pollution than traditional fuel   on october   pursuant to agreements with one of our former directors we transferred the stock in our china subsidiaries to the former director in exchange for cancellation of debt totaling  as a result of the transfer of the subsidiaries we were no longer engaged in the china cleanfuel business we transferred the stock of the china subsidiaries because we felt that its not our best interest to continue china cleanfuel business as a result of our decreasing revenue continued losses and inability to raise capital for our business   on november   the company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding stock of jin chih international ltd a taiwan corporation from its sole owner chu li an for five million shares of the company’s common stock as of march   the stock has not been issued   as a result of the above transactions we carry out the electronic products and general cargo trading and

company has disposed china branches the companys new management will continue to expand the current green energy and technology business in the united states and globally at the same time to explore many other green and renewable energy such as solar wind power sea power by signing licensing agreement or joint venture with other research institutes    results of operations   for the three months ended march   we derived our revenues of  compared to  for the three months ended march   representing an increase of  our sales came from the electronic products and general cargo trading and related consulting service to our customers operated by the taiwan subsidiary   selling general and administrative expenses consist of provision for doubtful debts primarily of payroll local taxes investor relation expenses and professional fees selling general and administrative expenses for the three months ended march   were  comparing to  for the last period   our business operates primarily in taiwanese dollars “twd” but we report our results in our sec filings in us dollars the conversion of our accounts from twd to dollars results in translation adjustments while our net income is added to the retained earnings on our balance sheets the translation adjustments are added to a line item on our balance sheets labeled “accumulated other comprehensive income” since it is more reflective of changes in the relative values of us and taiwanese currencies than of the success of our business during the three months ended march   the effect of converting our financial results to us dollars was to decrease  to our accumulated other comprehensive income   liquidity and capital resources   our operations to date have been funded primarily by operations due from related parties and capital contributions at march   and december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and  respectively our cash at march   was decreased by  from december     our current assets at march   were  compared to  at december   this increase mainly reflects increase in accounts receivable and inventory and partially offset by decreases in cash shortterm investments   our current liabilities at march   were  compared to   at december   this increase mainly reflects a significant increase of account payable and long term debt and partially offset by decrease in borrowing and tax payable   statements of

first three months of  cash used in financing activities of  consisted of the repayment of borrowing  and the new increased long term debt of    offbalance sheet arrangements   we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations   critical accounting policies and estimates   this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements that have been prepared under accounting principle generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period   actual results could differ from those estimates   a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report of these policies we believe that the following items are the most critical in preparing our financial statements   accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount net of an allowance for doubtful accounts the company follows paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer’s current credit worthiness as determined by the review of their current credit information and determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical writeoff experience customer specific facts and economic conditions   outstanding account balances are reviewed individually for collectability the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the company’s existing accounts receivable bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expenses if any pursuant to paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote the company has adopted paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification and determine when receivables are past due or delinquent based on how recently payments have been received   inventories the company values inventories consisting of raw materials packaging material and finished goods at the lower of cost or market cost is determined on the firstin and firstout “fifo” method for raw materials and packaging materials and the weighted average cost method for finished goods cost of finished goods comprises direct labor direct materials direct production cost and an allocated portion of production overhead the company reduces inventories for the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence damage or other issues affecting marketability equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates ii estimates of future demand iii competitive pricing pressures iv new product introductions v product expiration dates and vi component and packaging obsolescence   the company evaluates its current level of inventories considering historical sales and other factors and based on this evaluation classify inventory markdowns in the income statement as a component of cost of goods sold pursuant to paragraph s of the fasb accounting standards codification to adjust inventories to net realizable value these markdowns are estimates which could vary significantly from actual requirements if future economic conditions customer demand or competition differ from expectations other significant estimates include the allocation of variable and fixed production overheads while variable production overheads are allocated to each unit of production on the basis of actual use of production facilities the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion is based on the normal capacity of the company’s production facilities and recognizes abnormal idle facility expenses as current period charges certain costs including categories of indirect materials indirect labor and other indirect manufacturing costs which are included in the overhead pools are estimated the management of the company determines its normal capacity based upon the amount of operating hours of the manufacturing machinery and equipment in a reporting period   revenue recognition the company applies paragraph s of the fasb accounting standards codification for revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured   the company derives its revenues from sales contracts with customers with revenues being generated upon the shipment of merchandise persuasive evidence of an arrangement is demonstrated via sales invoice or contract product delivery is evidenced by warehouse shipping log as well as a signed acknowledgement of receipt from the customers or a signed bill of lading from the third party trucking company and title transfers upon shipment based on free on board “fob” warehouse terms the sales price to the customer is fixed upon acceptance of the signed purchase order or contract and there is no separate sales rebate discount or volume incentive when the company recognizes revenue no provisions are made for returns because historically there have been very few sales returns and adjustments that have impacted the ultimate collection of revenues   the company markets and distributes electronic products and general cargo for automobile use and follows section  formerly eitf  “asc section ” of the fasb accounting standards codification for revenue recognition to report revenue gross as a principal for its sales since the company  acts as principal in the transaction  takes title to the products  has risks and rewards of ownership such as the risk of loss for collection delivery or returns and  does not act as an agent or broker including performing services in substance as an agent or broker with compensation on a commission or fee as is on its sales the management of the company determined that the company should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer when considering each of the following eight  indicators of gross revenue reporting listed in asc paragraph  through  as specified  the entity is the primary obligor in the arrangement — the company signs a product sales agreement with its customer and represents in writing that the company is responsible for fulfillment including the acceptability of the products or services ordered or purchased by the customer  the entity has general inventory risk before customer order is placed or upon customer return  the entity has latitude in establishing price — the company has reasonable latitude within economic constraints to establish the exchange price with a customer for the product or service  the entity changes the product or performs part of the service— the company developed a method for blending the raw materials in its manufacturing process through its proprietary technology catalysts can be mixed with fuel and alcohols to become a finished product to be sold after pumping and piping  the entity has discretion in supplier selection — the company has multiple suppliers for the products ordered by a customer and discretion to select the supplier that will provide the products or services ordered by a customer  the entity is involved in the determination of product or service specifications — the company determines the nature type characteristics or specifications of the products or services ordered by the customer  the entity has physical loss inventory risk of purchased inventories after customer order and  the entity has credit risk — the company is responsible for collecting the sales price from its customer but must pay the amount owed to its supplier after the supplier performs regardless of whether the sales price is fully collected   net sales of products represent the invoiced value of goods net of value added taxes “vat” the company is subject to vat which is levied on all of the company’s products at the rate of  on the invoiced value of sales sales or output vat is borne by customers in addition to the invoiced value of sales and purchase or input vat is borne by the company in addition to the invoiced value of purchases to the extent not refunded for export sales   foreign currency translation the company follows section  of the fasb accounting standards codification “section ” for foreign currency translation to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiary from the functional currency generally the local currency into us dollars section  sets out the guidance relating to how a reporting entity determines the functional currency of a foreign entity including of a foreign entity in a highly inflationary economy remeasures the books of record if necessary and characterizes transaction gains and losses the assets liabilities and operations of a foreign entity shall be measured using the functional currency of that entity an entity’s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates normally that is the currency of the environment or local currency in which an entity primarily generates and expends cash   the functional currency of each foreign subsidiary is determined based on management’s judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary generally the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions including billings financing payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary’s operations must also be considered if a subsidiary’s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary’s financial statements is included in accumulated other comprehensive income however if the functional currency is deemed to be the us dollar then any gain or loss associated with the remeasurement of these financial statements from the local currency to the functional currency would be included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income loss if the company disposes of foreign subsidiaries then any cumulative translation gains or losses would be recorded into the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income loss if the company determines that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the us dollar any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within the statement of income and comprehensive income loss   based on an assessment of the factors discussed above the management of the company determined the relevant subsidiaries’ local currencies to be their respective functional currencies   the financial records of the companys taiwan operating subsidiaries acquired on november   are maintained in their local currency the “twd” which is also the functional currency assets and liabilities are translated from the local currency into the reporting currency us dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates for the period to approximate translation at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates those elements are recognized in the consolidated financial statements foreign currency translation gain loss resulting from the process of translating the local currency financial statements into us dollars are included in determining accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity   most recent accounting pronouncements   refer to note  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements   impact of accounting pronouncements   there were no recent accounting pronouncements that have had a material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   not required for smaller reporting companies   item  controls and procedures   disclosure controls and procedures   regulations under the securities exchange act of  the “exchange act” require public companies to maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” which are defined as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commissions rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the issuers management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   we conducted an evaluation with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of march   based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of march   our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described below   in light of the material weaknesses described below we performed additional analysis to ensure our financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles accordingly we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented   a material weakness is a control deficiency within the meaning of the public company accounting oversight board pcaob auditing standard no  or combination of control deficiencies that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected management has identified the following two material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that as of march   our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level    we do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of section  of the sarbanesoxley act which is applicable to us for the quarter ending march   management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness    we do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions which is a basic internal control due to our size and nature segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible however to the extent possible the initiation of transactions the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness   to address these material weaknesses management performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial statements included herein fairly present in all material respects our financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented   managements report on internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company in accordance with as defined in rules af and df under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the i effectiveness and efficiency of operations ii reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and iii compliance with applicable laws and regulations our internal controls framework is based on the criteria set forth in the internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso   due to inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate   a material weakness in internal controls is a deficiency in internal control or combination of control deficiencies that adversely affects the company’s ability to initiate authorize record process or report external financial data reliably in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected in the course of making our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting we identified some material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting   we lack sufficient personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge experience and training in the application of accounting operations of our company this weakness causes us to not fully identify and resolve accounting and disclosure issues that could lead to a failure to perform timely internal control and reviews   management is currently reviewing its staffing and systems in order to remedy the weaknesses identified in this assessment however because of the above condition management’s assessment is that the company’s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of march   additionally the registrant’s management has concluded that the registrant has a material weakness associated with its us gaap expertise   this annual report does not include an attestation report of the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting management’s report was not subject to attestation by the company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the securities and exchange commission that permit the company to provide only management’s report in this annual report   managements remediation initiatives   in an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls we have initiated or plan to initiate the following series of measures   we intend to our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function first we intend to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives of having separate individuals perform i the initiation of transactions ii the recording of transactions and iii the custody of assets second we intend to create a senior position to focus on financial reporting and standardizing and documenting our accounting procedures with the goal of increasing the effectiveness of the internal controls in preventing and detecting misstatements of accounting information third we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us we anticipate the costs of implementing these remediation initiatives will be approximately  to  a year in increased salaries legal and accounting expenses   management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board   part ii — other information   item  legal

conversion of our accounts from twd to dollars results in translation adjustments while our net income is added to the retained earnings on our balance sheets the translation adjustments are added to

do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements that have been prepared under accounting principle generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report of these policies we believe that the following items are the most critical in preparing our financial statements accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount net of an allowance for doubtful accounts the company follows paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness as determined by the review of their current credit information and determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical writeoff experience customer specific facts and economic conditions outstanding account balances are reviewed individually for collectability the allowance for doubtful accounts is the companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the companys existing accounts receivable bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expenses if any pursuant to paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote the company has adopted paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification and determine when receivables are past due or delinquent based on how recently payments have been received inventories the company values inventories consisting of raw materials packaging material and finished goods at the lower of cost or market cost is determined on the firstin and firstout fifo method for raw materials and packaging materials and the weighted average cost method for finished goods cost of finished goods comprises direct labor direct materials direct production cost and an allocated portion of production overhead the company reduces inventories for the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence damage or other issues affecting marketability equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates ii estimates of future demand iii competitive pricing pressures the company evaluates its current level of inventories considering historical sales and other factors and based on this evaluation classify inventory markdowns in the income statement as a component of cost of goods sold pursuant to paragraph s of the fasb accounting standards codification to adjust inventories to net realizable value these markdowns are estimates which could vary significantly from actual requirements if future economic conditions customer demand or competition differ from expectations other significant estimates include the allocation of variable and fixed production overheads while variable production overheads are allocated to each unit of production on the basis of actual use of production facilities the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion is based on the normal capacity of the companys production facilities and recognizes abnormal idle facility expenses as current period charges certain costs including categories of indirect materials indirect labor and other indirect manufacturing costs which are included in the overhead pools are estimated the management of the company determines its normal capacity based upon the amount of operating hours of the manufacturing machinery and equipment in a reporting period revenue recognition the company applies paragraph s of the fasb accounting standards codification for revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and ivcollectability is reasonably assured the company derives its revenues from sales contracts with customers with revenues being generated upon the shipment of merchandise persuasive evidence of an arrangement is demonstrated via sales invoice or contract product delivery is evidenced by warehouse shipping log as well as a signed acknowledgement of receipt from the customers or a signed bill of lading from the third party trucking company and title transfers upon shipment based on free on board fob warehouse terms the sales price to the customer is fixed upon acceptance of the signed purchase order or contract and there is no separate sales rebate discount or volume incentive when the company recognizes revenue no provisions are made for returns because historically there have been very few sales returns and adjustments that have impacted the ultimate collection of revenues the company markets and distributes ethanol and methanol based alternative fuel for automobile use and follows section  formerly eitf  asc net sales of products represent the invoiced value of goods net of value added taxes vat the company is subject to vat which is levied on all of the companys products at the rate of  on the invoiced value of sales sales or output vat is borne by customers in addition to the invoiced value of sales and purchase or input vat is borne by the company in addition to the invoiced value of purchases to the extent not refunded for export sales foreign currency translation the company follows section  of the fasb accounting standards codification section  for foreign currency translation to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiary from the functional currency generally the local currency into us dollars section  sets out the guidance relating to how a reporting entity determines the functional currency of a foreign entity including of a foreign entity in a highly inflationary economy remeasures the books of record if necessary and characterizes transaction gains and losses the assets liabilities and operations of a foreign entity shall be measured using the functional currency of that entity an entitys functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates normally that is the currency of the environment or local currency in which an entity primarily generates and expends cash the functional currency of each foreign subsidiary is determined based on managements judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary generally the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions including billings financing payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiarys operations must also be considered if a subsidiarys functional currency is deemed to be the local currency then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiarys financial statements is included in accumulated other comprehensive income however if the functional currency is deemed to be the us dollar then any gain or loss associated with the remeasurement of these financial statements from the local currency to the functional currency would be included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income loss if the company disposes of foreign subsidiaries then any cumulative translation gains or losses would be recorded into the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income loss if the company determines that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the us dollar any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within the statement of income and comprehensive income loss based on an assessment of the factors discussed above the management of the company determined the relevant subsidiaries local currencies to be their respective functional currencies the financial records of the companys chinese operating subsidiaries are maintained in their local currency the renminbi rmb which is the functional currency the financial records of the companys taiwan operating subsidiaries acquired on november   are maintained in their local currency the twd which is also the functional currency assets and liabilities are translated from the local currency into the reporting currency us dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates for the period to approximate translation at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates those elements are recognized in the consolidated financial statements foreign currency translation gain

of stockholders equity equity instruments issued to parties other than employees for acquiring goods or services the company accounts for equity instruments issued to parties other than employees for acquiring goods or services under guidance of subtopic  of the fasb accounting standards codification subtopic  pursuant to section  all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued whichever is more reliably measurable the measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur the fair value of option or warrant award is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes optionpricing valuation model the ranges of assumptions for inputs are as follows  expected term of share options and similar instruments pursuant to paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification the expected term of share options and similar instruments represents the period of time the options and similar instruments are expected to be outstanding taking into consideration of the contractual term of the instruments and holders expected exercise behavior into the fair value or calculated value of the instruments the company uses historical data to estimate holders expected exercise behavior the contractual term of share options or similar instruments is used as expected term of share options or similar instruments for the company if it is a newly formed corporation  expected volatility of the entitys shares and the method used to estimate it an entity that uses a method that employs different volatilities during the contractual term shall disclose the range of expected volatilities used and the weightedaverage expected volatility a thinlytraded or nonpublic entity that uses the calculated value method shall disclose the reasons why it is not practicable for the company to estimate the expected volatility of its share price the appropriate industry sector index that it has selected the reasons for selecting that particular index and how it has calculated historical volatility using that index the company uses the average historical volatility of the comparable companies over the expected contractual life of the share options or similar instruments as its expected volatility if shares of a company are thinly traded the use of weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as the volatility calculation using daily observations for such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market  expected annual rate of quarterly dividends an entity that uses a method that employs different dividend rates during the contractual term shall disclose the range of expected dividends used and the weightedaverage expected dividends the expected dividend yield is based on the companys current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected dividend yield for periods within the expected contractual life of the option and similar instruments  riskfree rates an entity that uses a method that employs different riskfree rates shall disclose the range of riskfree rates used the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods within the contractual life of the option and similar instruments pursuant to asc paragraph  if fully vested nonforfeitable equity instruments are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement for goods or services no specific performance is required by the grantee to retain those equity instruments then because of the elimination of any obligation on the part of the counterparty to earn the equity instruments a measurement date has been reached a grantor shall recognize the equity instruments when they are issued in most cases when the agreement is entered into whether the corresponding cost is an immediate expense or a prepaid asset or whether the debit should be characterized as contraequity under the requirements of paragraph  depends on the specific facts and circumstances pursuant to asc paragraph  a grantor may conclude that an asset other than a note or a receivable has been received in return for fully vested nonforfeitable equity instruments that are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement for goods or services and no specific performance is required by the grantee in order to retain those equity instruments such an asset shall not be displayed as contraequity by the grantor of the equity instruments the transferability or lack thereof of the equity instruments shall not affect the balance sheet display of the asset this guidance is limited to transactions in which equity instruments are transferred to other than employees in exchange for goods or services section  provides guidance on the determination of the measurement date for transactions that are within the scope of this subtopic pursuant to paragraphs  and  an entity may grant fully vested nonforfeitable equity instruments that are exercisable by the grantee only after a specified period of time if the terms of the agreement provide for earlier exercisability if the grantee achieves specified performance conditions any measured cost of the transaction shall be recognized in the same periods and in the same manner as if the entity had paid cash for the goods or services    feb   c  cybernet
