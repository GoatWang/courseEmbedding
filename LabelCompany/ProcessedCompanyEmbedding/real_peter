comebyhui wangon march  format kindle editionverified purchasethis book has been an eye opener for me although i have worked in investment banks for more than  years i have never looked at us economy on a grand scale my gut feeling has been warning me that something really bad happened and is about to happen in us and this book finally said them out loud and showed me what to do the only reason i didnt give a five star is simply because i think the author is too optimistic about chinese economy and downplayed the burden of bad chinese political systems weight on the economy probably because i grew up in china while the author did not overall its excellent book very practical and prophetic i would recommend it to anyone whos willing to be openmindedcomment  people found this helpful was

format hardcoververified purchasean absolute must read schiff is one of the few economists involved in politics who tells the complete and unbiased truth about the us economy and its leaders both the democrats and the republicans are bought and paid for by corporations special interests and government dependents not just welfare recipients but the much larger percentage of medicare social security and government paycheck recipients neither party is willing to prevent a greecelike outcome actually it will be much worse because it would require them to relinquish votes and therefore power only when there is massive unemployment and rioting in the streets will we get serious about real reform by then it may be too late with no one to bail us out we will be in danger of losing the standard of living that has set us apart form the rest of the world for the last  years schiffs book serves as a warning about the impending crisis and gives recommendations about how individuals can save themselves if not their countrycomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products web address belowproduct not found only

of  starsvery well written book and an entertaining readbycinquainon february  format hardcoververified purchasepeter schiff is an incredibly smart individual although he might try to be humble and claim that he is not and his brilliance shows in this book it took me roughly five days to read this book and i have a full time job and off work projects but even with my tight schedule i still found the book easy to read and addictive in summary this book is very educational and entertaining schiff educates the reader in the realms of economics employment regulations banking taxes investments and even history the insights and understandings i gained from this book are enormous it was equivalent to a brain massage as i was reading this book i could hear peters voice speaking in my head because his style of writing is very similar to how he speaks i have to admit this book only spends one chapter covering method of investments however it is important to keep in mind that when it comes to investment advices schiff is limited due to regulations from big government as he ironically mentions in his book as well i highly recommend this book to anyone who is concerned about the economy and deeply interested in understanding how we got there how can we fix it and most importantly what can you do to avoid it and prosper i also hope that schiff continues to fight the good fight and producing good work such as this onecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products web address belowproduct not found

schiffs booksevery politician needs to read this book and every investor should read this bookindeed anyone who is concerned about the welfare of their family or their community needs to heed the warnings that schiff writes about herei have been listening to schiff on his radio program since he began broadcasting i have read all his books in fact i read his fathers books when they first came out back in the seventies the younger schiff had a phenomonal mentor in irwin irwin gave him a solid grounding in what i call common sense economics there is no hocuspocus we can spend our way out of this mess economic theory as propounded by the likes of paul krugman everything peter says is well thought out and grounded in reality and he always returns to base principles and values whenever confronted with sticky situations while he certainly promotes his company on the air and in his books what he promotes politically and economically actually would counter his investment advice if those ideas would be followed i havent a bit of a problem with this selfpromotion as it represents the essence of the freemarket a truly free market as presented by schiff enriches everyone as opposed to socialist theories that makes everyone equal but equally destituteschiff has three broad themes in this book review of what is realy wrong with the world and us economy today how we can fix these problems by returning to common sense base principles even it requires a little bit of compromise to make it acceptable to the masses how to protect yourself financial when the inevitable crash occurs  schiff assumes that no one in power is likely to follow his advicethis is an important book for our time i liken peter schiff to a modern day nathan hale one of the great patriots of our time we need more books like this and we need more peter schiffs if our economy is to surviveso be afraid for our economy and for your financial health but dont be afraid to buy this book as soon as

book on policy but underestimates government corruptionbymichael madisonon september  format hardcoververified purchasei enjoy all of peter schiffs books and love to listen to his blogs and the one voice of reason on a panelpeter schiff and his father have done a great service to our country both warned us of the devastating effects of a monetary policy not based on sound moneythe example of health care prices applied to a grocery store made it very easy to see why health care is so messed up and was an example of how peter outlines these issues so clearlybut i think in this book peter schiff is way too gracious to the government for example most of his policies are based on the premise that the government would like to do the right thing but simply implements incorrect and illogical policies i tend to think that there is a more sinister centralization of power going on that is very deliberateone sentence in the book speaks to this he says on p  todays government may be bad and reasonably corrupt but i doubt it represents the type of threat that would require armed rebellionthis is a government that passed the ndaa staged fast and furious assassinates americans repealed habeas corpus and disappears people what other laws will they pass quietly in the night how long will people do nothing while their fourth amendment is trashed at the airport and now elsewhere i dont know how much more it takes for people to see that we are already in the early stages of tyranny and disarming the public will be a logical next step in this police statemost of the bill of rights have already been repealed either through executive order or just ignoring them and the second amendment will certainly not be exempt from this process so i am not sure where this faith in our government to do the right thing if they just knew what it was comes from the policies he outlines are deliberately ignored by this govt because they want centralized power maybe we can apply peters book when we reinstate the constitutionthe only other thing i take issue with is that our economy if ran correctly and competently has plenty of money to help those in poverty instead the banks received trillions of dollars and then congress debates whether unemployment benefits should be extended it is quite sad really but another example of centralized power that is deliberatesome people remain unemployed because they are educated and qualified and refuse to take crap jobs as one example i have noticed that companies hire outside of cities going nuts with hb visas while the locally unemployed who are more than qualified for these positions are left out in the cold i have seen this policy transform entire cultures and cities and it also acclimates workers to longer hours worse working conditions and the constant threat of being replaced it is not that they cannot find qualified workers locally it is that companies want these conditions in place and work with the government to put them in placeis this the new global economy that we want a properly working government would say no thanks we would like to employ our people already here instead our government actively offshores jobs and replaces local workers with hb visa workers and then cuts off unemployment insurance what exactly are these folks supposed to do i guess they could start a business but we need to be more realistic with what is happening in this economy and how the government actively works against the interests of us taxpayers and workerscomment one person found this helpful was this review

hardcoververified purchasewhile peter schiff is obviously taking advantage of his reputation for accuracy in predicting the housing market crash of  his expertise in predicting a crash of the currency market is somewhat in question his solution is obviously an advertisement for his own commercial interests and brings some degree of suspicion to his analysis he does however raise the significant concern of how far can we go as a nation with a national debt approaching  trillion and remain fiscally sound and trustworthy can the american public trust washington to make the hard decisions to bring us back to fiscal responsibility and what will be the consequences if the government fails to do socomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert

content who is the real peter parker a nerdy analysis of the spiderman films by johnbby on ‎  pm  views in modern cinematic history there have been three big screen spidermans spidermen fine three big screen peter parkers all three actors have their merits and flaws but which one is the best so to answer the question i watched spiderman  and the amazing spiderman  back to back to refresh my memory on tobey maguire’s and andrew garfield’s performances i’ve watched captain america civil war a few times so tom holland’s is already fresh in my mind   my first big revelation spiderman and the amazing spiderman are the same movie not just similar but point for point and beat for beat the same you can rename green goblin as the lizard all you want but they’re still both green uncle ben still dies peter still has momentary passiveaggressive revenge aunt may is still tragic the girl is still out of peter’s league the cgi is still primitive   setting that aside tobey maguire’s peter parker as directed by powerhouse sam raimi is a social outcast check enduring unrequited love check and has to cope with loss check he is a tearful introspective boyman who is suddenly bestowed with exceptional powers but who is so buried in angst that he becomes largely uninteresting maguire has the “cute thing” down pat as well – a quality that i really never ascribed to peter parker especially as a fringer – but seemed too old to be portraying a high school student   andrew garfield’s peter parker as directed by marc webb ha ha ha has some backbone where maguire’s really did not while he is a social outcast check enduring unrequited love check and has to cope with loss check he at least has some moral character to stand up to the bullies before he becomes a mutant garfield is lithe and angular with a killer smile but miles away from “cute” he was more convincing as the class dork than maguire was but still seemed too old for the role   with spiderman’s entry into the marvel cinematic universe it was time to upgrade the actor again enter tom holland as peter parker he is a social outcast sort of check dealing with unrequited love uncheck insert sexy aunty may instead and coping with loss uncheck no martin sheen or cliff robertson uncle ben trope to be found spiderman’s entire origin story is told in a couple of quippy paragraphs holland has the “cute thing” rocks the spiderman angularity and actually seems the right age for high school he also comes with a backbone strong enough to issue a stern warning to selfcentered smartaleck tony stark   while holland has yet to be the featured character in a full film until now that is in spiderman homecoming i have little doubt that he is the best spiderman the theaters have yet seen he’s a technological whiz kid like garfield but unlike maguire whose mutations were entirely biological and therefore laughable who believes that he has the power to do good and is therefore obligated something the prior peter parkers did not adequately demonstrate i have high hopes for spiderman homecoming and am looking forward to catching a matinee on my next day off   speaking of the “cute thing” the funko pop spiderman beats out maguire in cuteness hands down   shop for spiderman on bestbuycom   preorder spiderman homecoming labels andrew garfield funko pop marvel marvel universe spider man spiderman spiderman homecoming
