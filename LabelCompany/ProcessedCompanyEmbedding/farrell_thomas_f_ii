i felt it growing warm i got a certain sense of its hidden power it wasnt a cold piece of metal but it was really a piece of metal that seemed to be working inside then maybe for the first time i began to believe some of the fantastic tales the scientists had told about this nuclear power farrell observed the trinity nuclear test with oppenheimer from the control dugout located  yards  m from the test tower in his report on the test to president truman on  july   farrell stated the effects could well be called unprecedented magnificent beautiful stupendous and terrifying no manmade phenomenon of such tremendous power had ever occurred beforeit lit every peak crevasse and ridge of the nearby mountain range with a clarity and beauty that cannot be described but must be seen to be imagined seconds after the explosion came the air blast pressed hard against the people watching to be followed almost immediately by the strong sustained awesome roar which warned of doomsday and

groves that the little boy bomb would be ready for use on or about  august weather permitting in the space of a week on tinian four bs crashed and burned on the runway parsons became very concerned if a b crashed with a little boy the fire could cook off the explosive and detonate the weapon with catastrophic consequences parsons raised the possibility of arming the bomb in flight with farrell who agreed that it might be a good idea farrell asked parsons if he knew how to do it no sir i dont parsons conceded but ive got all afternoon to learn after the bombing of hiroshima on  august farrell along with generals carl spaatz nathan twining barney giles and james h davies debriefed parsons the aircrews and the observers and sent groves a detailed report farrell brought forward the date for the next attack because good weather was only predicted until  august he signed the fat man bomb to hirohito with love and kisses t f farrell the bomb was loaded on the b bockscar during preflight inspection a fuel pump was found to be faulty meaning that  us gallons  l  imp gal of fuel in the bomb bay tank could not be used although it would have to be carried farrell took the difficult decision to continue the mission in view of the worsening weather this was only the first of a number of problems that faced the mission crews that day but the mission was carried out successfully the surrender of japan on  august precluded further attacks groves had already directed farrell to prepare teams to inspect the effects of the atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki and farrell had begun assembling the required personnel and equipment farrell arrived in hiroshima by air on  september as part of a group equipped with portable geiger counters that was headed by himself and also included

point the us army was about to embark on a national mobilization and it was the task of the construction division of the quartermaster corps to prepare the necessary accommodations and training facilities for the vast army that would be created the enormous construction program had been dogged by bottlenecks shortages delays spiralling costs and poor living conditions at the construction sites newspapers began publishing accounts charging the construction division with incompetence ineptitude and inefficiency farrell and groves worked out new simplified procedures for centralized procurement that provided the flexibility needed to get projects done on time with the accountability that such enormous expenditures demanded he was awarded the legion of merit for his services chinaburmaindiaedit in september  the chief of army service forces lieutenant general brehon b somervell created a special india committee to coordinate activities in the chinaburmaindia theater with

selected the h portable steel highway bridge production of these had been discontinued in favor of the bailey bridge but farrells technical arguments won out and the corps of engineers had to reinstate production of the h in view of these difficulties farrell obtained bailey bridges from british sources in the end all the major bridges beyond the irrawaddy river would be baileys he also made the decision controversial in washington to shift the terminus of the inch  mm oil pipeline from calcutta to chittagong in order to avoid crossing the ganges and brahmaputra rivers and the dangers of concentrating too many vulnerable installations in the calcutta area he was awarded the distinguished service medal manhattan projectedit in december  the secretary of war henry l stimson

choice too site y was the code name for the remote los alamos county new mexico facilities that housed the main group of researchers and was responsible for final assembly of the bombs farrell was briefed on the physics of the atomic bomb by robert oppenheimer and he made several extended tours of the alamogordo bombing and gunnery range which had been chosen as the site for the trinity test on signing a receipt for the plutonium from oak ridge farrell commented i recall that i asked them if i was going to sign for it shouldnt i take it and handle it so i took this heavy ball in my hand and i felt it growing warm i got a certain sense of its hidden power it wasnt a cold piece of metal but it was really a piece of metal that seemed to be working inside then maybe for the first time i began to believe some of the fantastic tales the scientists had told about this nuclear power farrell observed the trinity nuclear test with oppenheimer from the control dugout located  yards  m from the test tower in his report on the test to president truman on  july   farrell stated the effects could well be called unprecedented magnificent beautiful stupendous and terrifying no manmade phenomenon of such tremendous power had ever occurred beforeit lit every peak crevasse and ridge of the nearby mountain range with a clarity and beauty that cannot be described but must be seen to be imagined seconds after the explosion came the air blast pressed hard against the people watching to be followed almost immediately by the strong sustained awesome roar which warned of doomsday and made us feel we puny things were blasphemous to dare tamper with the forces previously reserved for the almighty words are inadequate tools for the job of acquainting those not present with the physical mental and psychological effects it had to be witnessed to be realized  the tinian joint chiefs captain william s parsons left rear admiral william r purnell center and brigadier general thomas f farrell right farrell assumed special responsibility for combat operations he served on the target committee acting as its chairman when groves was absent in july  farrell arrived on guam to

liaison committee and captain william s parsons the commander of project alberta they became informally the tinian joint chiefs with decisionmaking authority over the nuclear mission farrell notified groves that the little boy bomb would be ready for use on or about  august weather permitting in the space of a week on tinian four bs crashed and burned on the runway parsons became very concerned if a b crashed with a little boy the fire could cook off the explosive and detonate the weapon with catastrophic consequences parsons raised the possibility of arming the bomb in flight with farrell who agreed that it might be a good idea farrell asked parsons if he knew how to do it no sir i dont parsons conceded but ive got all afternoon to learn after the bombing of hiroshima on  august farrell along with generals carl spaatz nathan twining barney giles and james h davies debriefed parsons the aircrews and the observers and sent groves a detailed report farrell brought forward the date for the next attack because good weather was only predicted until  august he signed the fat man bomb to hirohito with love and kisses t f farrell the bomb was loaded on the b bockscar during preflight inspection a fuel pump was found to be faulty meaning that  us gallons  l  imp gal of fuel in the bomb bay tank could not be used although it would have to be carried farrell took the difficult decision to continue the mission in view of the worsening weather this was only the first of a number of problems that faced the mission crews that day but the mission was carried out successfully the surrender of japan on  august precluded further attacks groves had already directed farrell to prepare teams to inspect the effects of the atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki and farrell had begun assembling the required personnel and equipment farrell arrived in hiroshima by air on  september as part of a group equipped with portable geiger counters that was headed by himself and also included

disregard for his own safety and complete devotion to duty raised the morale of his battalion to a high pitch and inspired them to acts of great endeavor farrell was also awarded the croix de guerre

regular army in  but remained in the reserves the governor of new york al smith appointed farrell as commissioner of canals and waterway for the state of new york he was head of construction and engineering of the new york state department of public works from  until  he was considered as a possible candidate to replace frederick stuart greene as superintendent of public works but greene did not retire the great depression led to a vast expansion of public works activity both nationally and in new york major projects in new york included the  new york worlds fair and the construction of laguardia airport world war iiedit farrell right and major general leslie r groves jr left in  construction in the united statesedit farrell returned to active duty in february  with the rank of lieutenant colonel to act as thencolonel leslie r groves jrs executive officer in the operations branch of the construction division under the office of the office of the quartermaster general at this point the us army was about to embark on a national mobilization and it was the task of the construction division of the quartermaster corps to prepare the necessary accommodations and training facilities for the vast army that would be created the enormous construction program had been dogged by bottlenecks shortages delays spiralling costs and poor living conditions at the construction sites newspapers began publishing accounts charging the construction division with incompetence ineptitude and inefficiency farrell and groves worked out new simplified procedures for centralized procurement that provided the flexibility needed to get projects done on time with the accountability that such enormous expenditures demanded he was awarded the legion of merit for his services chinaburmaindiaedit in september  the chief of army service forces lieutenant general brehon b somervell created a special india committee to coordinate activities in the chinaburmaindia theater with those of army service forces back home farrell now a colonel was appointed to the committee to oversee construction the creation of a line of communications from india to china would be the largest engineer undertaking of the war a number of new units were trained in the united states specifically for the task in a reorganization later that year farrell became chief engineer of the services of

and six districts he was in charge of the work inside india construction of the ledo road itself was the responsibility of colonel lewis a pick in addition to this work farrell had to support operation matterhorn the deployment of b bombers to china and india which involved the construction and expansion of a series of air bases the bs required runways that were almost twice the size of those for the older bs and he was forced to divert his resources to construct a inch  mm oil pipeline to the matterhorn airfields to bridge the fastfollowing rivers of northern burma pick and farrell selected the h portable steel highway bridge production of these had been discontinued in favor of the bailey bridge but farrells technical arguments won out and the corps of engineers had to reinstate production of the h in view of these difficulties farrell obtained bailey bridges from british sources in the end all the major bridges beyond the irrawaddy river would be baileys he also made the decision controversial in washington to shift the terminus of the inch  mm oil pipeline from calcutta to chittagong in order to avoid crossing the ganges and brahmaputra rivers and the dangers of concentrating too many vulnerable installations in the calcutta area he was awarded the distinguished service medal manhattan projectedit in december  the secretary of war henry l stimson ordered groves now the director of the manhattan project to find a deputy stimson was concerned about what would happen if groves became incapacitated you can have any officer in the army stimson told groves no matter who he is or what duty he is on groves told colonel kenneth nichols the commander of the manhattan district that his first choice would be farrell nichols replied he would be my first choice too site y was the code name for the remote los alamos county new mexico facilities that housed the main group of researchers and was responsible for final assembly of the bombs farrell was briefed on the physics of the atomic bomb by robert oppenheimer and he made several extended tours of the alamogordo bombing and gunnery range which had been chosen as the site for the trinity test on signing a receipt for the plutonium from oak ridge farrell commented i recall that i asked them if i was going to sign for it shouldnt i take it and handle it so i took this heavy ball in my hand and i felt it growing warm i got a certain sense of its hidden power it wasnt a cold piece of metal but it was really a piece of metal that seemed to be working inside then maybe for the first time i began to believe some of the fantastic tales the scientists had told about this nuclear power farrell observed the trinity nuclear test with oppenheimer from the control dugout located  yards  m from the test tower in his report on the test to president truman on  july   farrell stated the effects could well be called unprecedented magnificent beautiful stupendous and terrifying no manmade phenomenon of such tremendous power had ever occurred beforeit lit every peak crevasse and ridge of the nearby mountain range with a clarity and beauty that cannot be described but must be seen to be imagined seconds after the explosion came the air blast pressed hard against the people watching to be followed almost immediately by the strong sustained awesome roar which warned of doomsday and made us feel we puny things were blasphemous to dare tamper with the forces previously reserved for the almighty words are inadequate tools for the job of acquainting those not present with the physical mental and psychological effects it had to be witnessed to be realized  the tinian joint chiefs captain william s parsons left rear admiral william r purnell center and brigadier general thomas f farrell right farrell assumed special responsibility for combat operations he served on the target committee acting as its chairman when groves was absent in july  farrell arrived on guam to

liaison committee and captain william s parsons the commander of project alberta they became informally the tinian joint chiefs with decisionmaking authority over the nuclear mission farrell notified groves that the little boy bomb would be ready for use on or about  august weather permitting in the space of a week on tinian four bs crashed and burned on the runway parsons became very concerned if a b crashed with a little boy the fire could cook off the explosive and detonate the weapon with catastrophic consequences parsons raised the possibility of arming the bomb in flight with farrell who agreed that it might be a good idea farrell asked parsons if he knew how to do it no sir i dont parsons conceded but ive got all afternoon to learn after the bombing of hiroshima on  august farrell along with generals carl spaatz nathan twining barney giles and james h davies debriefed parsons the aircrews and the observers and sent groves a detailed report farrell brought forward the date for the next attack because good weather was only predicted until  august he signed the fat man bomb to hirohito with love and kisses t f farrell the bomb was loaded on the b bockscar during preflight inspection a fuel pump was found to be faulty meaning that  us gallons  l  imp gal of fuel in the bomb bay tank could not be used although it would have to be carried farrell took the difficult decision to continue the mission in view of the worsening weather this was only the first of a number of problems that faced the mission crews that day but the mission was carried out successfully the surrender of japan on  august precluded further attacks groves had already directed farrell to prepare teams to inspect the effects of the atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki and farrell had begun assembling the required personnel and equipment farrell arrived in hiroshima by air on  september as part of a group equipped with portable geiger counters that was headed by himself and also included
