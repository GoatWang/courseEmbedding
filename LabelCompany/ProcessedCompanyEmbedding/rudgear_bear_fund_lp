the bear case from a bull newsfeedbackfoolcom matthew dilallo jul   its no secret that i believe enterprise products partners nyse epd is an excellent company to own for the long term fueling that bullishness is the fact that the pipeline giant has a rocksolid business model and visible growth prospects on the horizon thanks to the  billion of capital projects it has lined up these factors should enable the company to continue to grow its distribution to investors that said just because im bullish on the company doesnt mean i dont pay attention to bearish arguments quite the opposite in fact since i have a growing portion of my net worth invested in the company which is at risk if bears are right thats why i think its a good idea to review their case so that investors know full well the risks involved when investing in enterprise products partnersimage source getty images its access to cheap capital might dry upenterprise products partners is one of the most fiscally conservative master limited partnerships mlps in the sector by keeping its leverage ratio around  times or less the company has earned one of the highest credit ratings among mlps furthermore it also maintains a large margin of safety on its distribution averaging more than  times coverage last year allowing it to retain  million of cash flow to finance growth projects because of that strong financial profile it has never had any issues accessing the money it needs to fund expansionthat said the company typically needs to raise a boatload of outside capital to finance these projects last year for example it spent nearly  billion on capex since it only generated  million in excess cash for the year it needed to issue roughly  billion of debt and equity to bridge the gap while it didnt have any trouble raising that money last year a deep credit market crisis in the future could make it hard for enterprise to obtain the cash it needs to finance growth projects at acceptable ratesthat was the case for several of its rivals during the recent oil market downturn for example oneoks nyse oke former mlp needed to secure  billion in bank financing early last year so it could refinance an upcoming bond maturity after longerterm funding options became prohibitively expensive oneoks affiliate expected that the move would eliminate its need to access the public debt and equity markets until well into  which bought it time while it waited for the capital markets to open back up while enterprise products partners avoided a similar fate last year it did issue twice as much equity to finance growth projects as it usually does to keep its leverage metrics low which shows that its not completely immune to market dislocationsimage source getty imagesopposition to new pipeline projects intensifiesenterprise products partners has a long history of completing its growth projects on time and on budget thats one reason why the company has been able to increase its distribution to investors in each of the last  quarters meanwhile with  billion of capital projects under construction enterprise products partners should be able to keep that streak going for at least the next few years that said enterprise has been one of the lucky ones since it hasnt run into any major issues completing new projects rivals energy transfer partners nyse etp and williams partners nyse wpz on the other hand have run into several unforeseen issues in recent years that have delayed major expansion projects in energy transfer partners case it encountered opposition that tried to block its attempts to finish the  billion bakken pipeline system which ended up delaying its inservice date by more than six months costing it millions in added expenses and cash flow meanwhile williams partners experienced a delay in receiving approval for its  billion atlantic sunrise project and was denied a permit for its nearly  billion constitution pipeline due to opposition to those projectsgiven the increasing worries about climate change opposition to new oil and gas projects will likely continue rising in the years ahead that could eventually impact enterprise products partners growth plans by either causing a lengthy delay of a critical project or even forcing the company to cancel a project due to issues receiving permits a string of costly delays or project cancellations could end up halting the companys distribution growth streak investor takeawaybulls like me love enterprise products partners ability to leverage its vast portfolio of feebased assets and deliver steady income growth over the long term that said for the company to continue growing it needs access to cheap capital and the ability to move forward with its expansion projects without facing any significant delays or unforeseen expenses given the issues its peers have had in the recent past these arent risks that bulls should take lightly however because the company is more conservative than most rivals it does have a greater cushion to withstand a setback thats why i remain confident that it can continue to grow at a healthy rate for years to come   stocks we like
