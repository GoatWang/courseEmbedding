andrew reynolds reviews cash on demand scam or does it live up to the hype  ukdropshopcom ukdropshopcom work from home business reviews what works jobs employment advice and saving money offers andrew reynolds reviews cash on demand scam or does it live up to the hype november   ukd admin uncategorized  comments the name andrew reynolds has been around for many years and reviews are aplenty if you have been looking to generate income from the internet then you will probably have seen the products cash on demand for example is one of reynolds main products does it work we at ukdropshopcom look to dispel the myths surrounding online opportunities and we always offer unbiased information and reviews on what does and does not work so that our members can avoid the obvious scams out there let’s see if we think andrew reynolds and his products can help you who is andrew reynolds and what is cash on demand andrew reynolds is a marketer of products that claim to make money it is that simple whether those products make money is an entirely different question andrew will tell you a story about his humble beginnings and how after not being satisfied with his ‘lot’ decided that he wanted to make some serious money and then jetted off to america to a seminar learned how to make money etc etc the fact is that andrew reynolds managed to obtained the rights to various video courses in which he then went onto sell to customers mainly in the uk under the business manhattan direct the subject matter of the vidoes you guessed it making money does what andrew reynolds teach actually work well anything can work if the right person is trying to gain results can’t they the problem as we see it is that if the actual person who is selling the products to business opportunity seekers have not themselves made some money using the same advice then it kind of becomes the blind leading the blind surely let’s face it everybody wants to make extra money and if you are presented with a professional sales letter written by the people who know how to persuade others to make a payment for goods or service then this becomes a very enticing business to become involved with this is the whole ethos of the majority of ‘bizopp’ marketers they sell what people want to buy and in this instance the product is ‘how to make money’ if the promoter has made their own money using the sames methods suddenly becomes a secondary question which is fast forgotten about in the midst of the professional sales letter what about andrew reynolds and his cash on demand subscription cash on demand cash on demand is about ‘finding a niche and filling it with a product’ the cliche is massive online to the point that although it is so obvious actually taking advantage if it has been forgotten  there have b een countless marketers who have sold similar and will continue to sell similar especially now the internet has blossomed into a marketers dream all cash on demand has done is stretched the principle out to very many modules that are now sold on a monthly subscription similar information can be found for free if the researcher genuinely looked for it sure the principles work but it is nothing new it is similar to the old adage of ‘find a problem then creating the solution and becoming wealthy in the process’ but this does not mean that you will become successful in creating an income on such obvious principles in fact the chances of doing this are minuscule because if you as a human being do not possess the actual acumen to generate a business or have enough desire to make money then no matter how many manuals or modules you read it simply will not happen are you saying cash on demand does not work we are not saying that but we are saying that cash on demand is nothing new and in our experience the chances of you succeeding using the modules will entirely depend on you as a person if you have enough desire in your life to make a sincere decision to make money then you will make it irrelevant of how many ‘golden’ modules you have read from the latest ‘guru’ think about it genuinely if you really had to make money then you could if you had a loved one who absolutely depended on you making a certain amount of money for their welfare or wellbeing then do you feel you would be able to do it of course you would making money is an extremely emotional subject because when you break it all down the level of income you can achieve will directly result in the level of your lifestyle security and the lifestyle of those you love and represent and therefore the next time you read one of the sales letters offering to make you £x per monthyear just sit back and really assess if you have what it takes or if you have enough genuine desire to make it because if you don’t then you won’t – it is that simple would you recommend andrew reynolds and his products we personally feel that although the principles are nothing new and probably do work that they are global principles the same information can be found much cheaper elsewhere maybe not the same modules but the principles of finding a niche and filling it most definitely can be found cheaper than spending a monthly amount to gain and wait for access to a product such as cash on demand     vnf please waitrating   votes castvnf rating  from  votesandrew reynolds reviews cash on

also purchased some of the manuals about cash on demand off ebay for a greatly reduced price if you are interested i would purchase from there instead i never thought they were much benefit to me personally as the content was extremely basic and the internet has moved on somewhat since they were written r vaf please waitrating   votes castvaf rating  from  votes reply ukdropshop admin says

paul walsh says november   at  pm my friend bought andrew reynolds course i looked at the video with him and realized you could get this stuff off the internet for nothing so anyone out there thinking of buying it don’t waste your money paul walsh vaf please waitrating   votes castvaf rating  from  votes reply darren carr says february   at  pm hello paul that is the trouble this stuff seems old hat now and the basics of what is being taught by andrew reynolds in these course are being given away by bloggers for free darren vaf please waitrating   votes castvaf rating  from  votes reply john r says february   at  pm it always raises the question in my mind if these people are making so much money so easily from these schemes they are selling why do they need to make more money selling the ‘how to’ information if it were me i’m afraid i would albeit selfishly perhaps keeping the secret all to myself and making even more money without feeling the need to sell my methods i’m not saying for a moment noone ever has made their fortune from these schemes but i think two sayings should be remembered by anyone thinking of spending their hard earned cash on any of these schemes  “you get nothing for nothing”  “if it seems too easy it probably isn’t” i have lost a considerable amount over the years following these “get rich quick” gurus and have’t yet done much with them except line the guru’s pockets regards john r vaf please waitrating   vote castvaf rating  from  votes reply ukdropshop admin says february   at  pm hi john thanks for your comments and welcome to the website regards admin vnf please waitrating   votes castvnf rating  from  votes reply andrew says march   at  pm these people make money by selling you the “how to” rubbish they wouldn’t make a penny by listening to their own advice complete rubbish see through it folks vaf please waitrating   votes castvaf rating  from  votes reply gary woollard says march   at  am i have taken on board the above comments i must say that i have every confidence in the system i know it works because i have seen andrew live at entrepreneurs boot camp  and i have shook his hand okay it has not made me a fortune yet however that is my own fault because the solutions that you have to find first is obtaining a regular income through the so called employment system first before you embark on any ventures such as andrew’s there are  lessons to be learned here folks belief is the truest word in english dictionary here andrew is a self made millionaire and the first lesson one should learn here is the famous quotation ‘always learn from people who are already successful’ the second and third lesson are all to do with mindset mindset is a very powerful tool and will get you to where you want to be but it does take a daily focus the second lesson i want to share with you is to do with positive and motivational training what you need to do everyday and i mean this everyday is picture in your mind what it would be like if you never had to worry about bills making that heavy thud upon your doormat how would you feel if when you opened those bills you had a bank balance that would take care of them always the third lesson and last but not least is this i currently work as a part time retails sales demonstrator my work is varied one week i can be offering food samples in one of the big  to the public and the next i could be demonstrating mobile phones fridges washing machines or even power tools one day i took an exercise which was totally self invented i was due to food sampling at a very large asda store in bristol and i invented a short formula which was determination  application  success i kept saying that to myself in my mind at least  times consistently in every hour my day changed dramatically my sales figures did too and i the feeling i had was tremendous i hope this has been very useful information for you folks gary woollard vaf please waitrating   vote castvaf rating  from  votes reply td says august   at  pm i did not make a penny using this system what i did create was a large debt which will have to be paid off next year when i will have no option but to cash in my pension to cover it i told andrew reynolds office about this they were not interested with no mention of a refund in fact reynolds continues to send me written literature about new schemes quite audacious i think vaf please waitrating   votes castvaf rating  from  votes reply frank pittal says april   at  pm it’s a week now and i’ve studied the course watched the dvd’s read the manuals it looks appealing but i must admit i still have no idea if it works but one thing i can tell you i’ve learnt a hell of a lot and i mean just scratching the surface i’ve read cash on demand manual cover to cover i’ve read copy this idea i’ve watched the £ challenge dvd as how i pulled in £ million also millionaire secrets it all looks so easy and i await the modules i’ve read the above forum notes is it a scam or not all i can tell you in  week not even started yet i have negotiated permission to have the rights for one project free the second project i have lined up i have bought the domain name and made some positive enquiries for a product to sell exclusively which is a sure fire winner all this in one week even made contact with a local fulfilment house putting things in place and guess what i still have not a clue how it works but for  years i’ve been a dell boy ducker and diver market trader made loads of money selling bullshit dressed up as a quality item with this system i see great potential but let me tell you only time will tell but if i’ve done these  things in under a week what can i achieve when i finished the modules yes it’s a gamble but life is a gamble but let me echo the words of andrew reynolds ‘you have to stack the cards in your favour’ and being a barrow boy all my life it’s time for a change i don’t gamble any more i stopped on horses dogs and casino’s i’m clean for  years it’s been an addiction that cost me a lot i only gamble now in business i’ve taught myself ebay and took advice and its been a sure fire winner it’s put me on another level to the extent that i don’t get up  am anymore to stand in all weathers come home making little or no money after expenses this if handled correctly can be a success the last blog summed it up beautifully it’s all down to the individual and his or her mindset determination application – success a winning formula  in all honesty with an open mind and positive thinking you can make anything work with being positive and all i can say if after this opening week i’ve achieved  things by listening and learning for you see the only way to change something is by doing something different only time will tell if this works or not structure and success is a winning formula but if u don’t try u don’t get my advice give it you’re best shot vaf please waitrating   votes castvaf rating  from  vote reply steven wright says march   at  am i did subscibe to andrew reynolds cash on demand scheme a few years ago now and to be honest although it exposed the basics of internet marketing setting up websites and producing products which would sell to people is a very grey area indeed the costs involved are quite prohibitive for most people when you link some of the costs to the pay per click system for websites and to be frank i’ve have never known anyone who has paid these reported sums for information from the kind of websites andrew reynolds promotes people do not part with two or three thousand pounds for a box of cd’s and a download on how to make money online this is total nonsense and i have some doubts as to whether andrew reynolds has made the fifty million pounds he says he has selling information products online andrew reynolds cash on demand scheme is something he apparently constantly promotes the content hasn’t altered since i foolishly subscribed to it and i see that in the last year he published a book on the subject has anybody actually bought it out there  i’ve been invited on several occasions to the seminars he promotes but to be honest i can think of nothing more boring than attending one of these and certainly see it as a money making exercise for the other people he brings along who sell there cd’s etc to numerous gullable people to sum up if andrew reynolds has made the sums of money he says he has those days are over people have become wiser to information products online and the evidence that andrew reynolds and his colleagues are now scratching around for income is in the amount of sales letters that come through your door every few weeks from him my advice to mr reynolds is that you should be satisfied with your fifty million and retire in luxury somewhere which would then relieve those of us who receive your sales letters from ‘ not receiving them ‘ vaf please waitrating   votes castvaf rating

yet rich  andrew reynolds decries the junk business opportunity manuals written by broke people trying to get you to run an idea which is barely workable  for a start ask any of the people that wrote them to prove their claims  and they wont simply because they cant   they cant show you the profits  they cant show you pictures of their lifestyle  they cant show you their bank statements   etc  so you need to ask andrew reynolds how you are going to overcome the hurdle of you too being unable to show your potential customers the profits show the pictures of your lifestyle show your bank statements etc whilst i have been informed that andrew reynolds cash on demand system teaches you how to overcome such obstacles this is such a fundamental point that i recommend prospective purchasers to discuss it with andrew reynolds as part of their prepurchase research  exclusive licences andrew reynolds advises cash on demand students not to buy an exclusive licence when they find some material to market  but it is conventional business wisdom to try to secure an exclusive deal if you are on to something good to avoid being swamped by competition when other people who see that a licensed product is selling well can then easily obtain a licence for themselves  you need to ask andrew reynolds whether he holds any exclusive licences and to explain how you are going to avoid competition if you buy nonexclusive licences whilst i have received confirmation that licensing is explained in detail on the course the purchase of an exclusive licence could be a substantial expense so again i think that readers who are interested in the cash on demand opportunity should discuss this issue with andrew reynolds before they buy  how to get customers this point concerns the beall and endall of any business how are you going to get your customers  we had the impression that andrew reynolds got his customers by means of boughtin large mailing lists which he then used to send out mass mailshots because board members sent to us for our review mailshots they had received by post from andrew reynolds and of course this is an expensive marketing method  so you need to ask andrew reynolds what method or methods he uses and what method you are supposed to use  although once more we have received confirmation that this information is covered in detail on the course nevertheless it will be the crux of your business so you need to get some outline idea of the main marketing method beforehand so that you can assure yourself that there is a clear and proven recommended method and that it will be workable for you and will be within your budget  review of the andrew reynolds cash on demand system continues total word count   approx  pages long discover the truth about andrew
