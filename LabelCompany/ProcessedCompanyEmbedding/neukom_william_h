board of trustees from  at which time he pledged the initial gift to create the neukom institute for computational science at dartmouth the commitment made in honor of his family is the largest gift

how to try to think critically and write clearly while at dartmouth thanks to attentive faculty and bright classmates and i fell in love with its sense of place in that welcoming and beautiful part of upper new england three of neukoms children have attended dartmouth reflecting on his philanthropy neukom adds the college provided me a priceless liberal arts education and as i continued to learn about the remarkable academic experience it provides for its diverse student body and faculty i wanted to do something significant for dartmouth investing some microsoft equity in computational

philanthropy tech philanthropists january   william h neukom january   tate williams net worth  million  source of wealth microsoft corporation former lead attorney and head of community affairs  funding areas computer science higher education social justice  overview there aren’t many corporate lawyers with the enormous wealth of william “bill” neukom or the level of philanthropy he and his family have taken on but getting on board with a tiny company called microsoft back in the late s and sticking with them through  years and a public offering will do the trick neukom’s tenure landed him a somewhat legendary reputation in both the legal community and the tech world as well as a stint as the ceo of the san francisco giants the bowtieclad whitehaired attorney is fairly leftleaning and not big on accumulating wealth he’s giving much of his fortune away to a combination of higher education science and human rights issues both through his own donating and through a family foundation he runs with his children background bill neukom was an upstart lawyer living in seattle in the late s and with only a small amount of experience first as a clerk and then with a small firm that supported liberal causes his boss at a new firm had a job for him he wanted him to act as counsel for his son’s small computer programming company  the son was bill gates jr and his company had only  employees and just moved from albuquerque to seattle with little fanfare neukom took the job it was the start of a year tenure during which he would become head of the legal department and later community affairs for microsoft corporation during that time he would build up a staff of hundreds of attorneys advise the company as it became the tech force it is today and grow wealthy after the company went public in    in  he left to become a partner at his old firm now kl gates he also served as president of the american bar association trustee at his alma mater dartmouth college and has been a longtime investor and onetime ceo of the san francisco giants  he currently devotes most of his energy toward philanthropic pursuits including an organization he founded called the world justice project  philosophy neukom has always been highly devoted to his educational background citing the experiences he had at dartmouth and stanford as key to his success but also to a life of wellrounded intellectual pursuits he also believes strongly in service and justice and believes attorneys have a responsibility to use their unique skills to better their communities he considers his accumulation of wealth to be mostly circumstantial from the new york times  i believe i was overcompensated for my work said neukom whose political outlook puts him somewhat at odds with many of his fellow giants owners several of whom are republicans i was in a fortunate position but my worth to the company is not equal to the amount of money i received i don’t see it as money i earned i see myself as the steward of the money and that is why i give much of it away some people who worked for microsoft don’t see it the way i do he added but i believe it’s my job to give the money back and to other causes but i’m no saint and i have guilty pleasures and the giants are one of them issues  higher education neukom is perhaps most active in philanthropy as an alumni donor he recently made a donation of  million to dartmouth college’s computer science program to create a cluster of study around the use of big data for applications across academic fields in  he gave  million to establish a computer science institute at the school in his name he’s also given large amounts as a donor to stanford where he earned his law degree neukom gave  million as the lead investment for a new law school building also in his name aside from newsmaking gifts neukom and his family foundation donate sizable chunks of money in general support to both universities  the neukom family foundation has also given to the university of puget sound the ashesi university foundation and columbia university for example  science as mentioned above neukom has been a big supporter of dartmouth’s computer science education and research it’s motivated mainly by the belief that a liberal arts education and faculty should use computation and data and that large data sets show the potential to make transformative changes in other academic fields such as neuroscience but also social and behavioral sciences  justice the primary conduit for this funding is the world justice project an organization that is devoted to promoting the “rule of law” throughout the world including study of government accountability open government regulatory enforcement and basic human rights neukom founded the organization which has offices in dc and seattle and he’s still the ceo and a main funder   but the neukom family foundation also supports groups like the rural development institute the plymouth housing group the national womens law center and the national center for children and families the foundation also gives to some environmental causes primarily on the west coast contact neukom family
