the real estate business selling weed seems like a cash cow but the real money these days is in the real estate that represents the most crucial part of the cannabis business by will yakowicz will yakowicz is an awardwinning journalist and a staff writer and podcaster for inc magazinebefore inc he reported from the west bank and moscow for tablet magazine he covered business crime and local politics for the brooklyn paper and he was the editor of park slope patch he lives in brooklyn new york willyakowicz staff writer incwillyakowicz  comments andy williams cofounder of medicine man scouts land in pueblo colorado for a potential greenhouse grow credit getty images in the unstable and risky marijuana industry anything can happenyour neighbor could wage a racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act suit against you your bank can tell you to move your money to another institution or you could lose your license for a small screwup but in all of this uncertainty and risk pot entrepreneurs are making one safe bet buying real estate with so many obstacles and regulations in our way owning your real estate is the only thing we can control in this industry says sally vander veer cofounder and cfo of denverbased marijuana cultivator and retailer medicine man its essential to longterm success aside from being a simple and timetested investment vander veer says owning your own real estate is also a smart way to safely store your money as long as property values hold or increase and surprisingly property ownership is actually a flack jacket that protects your business from a frequent nightmare scenario in the pot business since  many cannabis entrepreneurs have seen their warehouse rents skyrocket after theyd spend tens of thousands of dollars to convert the space into a marijuana growing operation owning your real estate lets you avoid that financially crippling scenario entirely says patti zanin an independent real estate agent in denver who serves weed clients zanin says buildings zoned as light industrial that have been vacant for years are now the most valuable properties in the area thanks to the marijuana industry properties go so quickly zanin says that a secondary market has blossomedwellheeled companies will buy a property get a license and sell the whole package to smaller businesses after spending over  million to build out the squarefoot warehouse medicine man rented on nome street near the denver airport vander veer and her brothers andy and pete williams decided to buy it the brothers and sister got it for  million in  and its now worth  million they recently sold it credit courtesy of native roots its the green boom here in colorado and real estate is at a premium vander veer says if you own a building that is zoned properly not including any improvements its worth millions medicine man just bought a property in commerce city to build a new dispensary and rent out retail space to a few nonmarijuana tenants part of our overall strategy is to own all of the real estate we are in were looking toward a hard asset mentality she says  the property is also a form of banking in an industry that still has trouble maintaining bank accounts bankers need to do more compliance work for marijuana company customers which makes the accounts expensivesome cannabis entrepreneurs pay  a month in account fees since its expensive to bank cannabis profits and banks wont loan to cannabis entrepreneurs because marijuana is still federally illegal buying real estate with cash profits is an increasingly popular alternative you have to find a safe place to store your money vander veer says where else but real estate  its not the weed business josh ginsberg  cofounder and ceo of native roots says his company has gotten so large that he has a team tasked solely with looking for property to buy or lease native roots has  total employees ginsberg says the real estate team has been key to the companys explosive growth in the past two years from four to  stores the largest building native roots owns is a squarefoot grow facility with more than a hundred employees and tens of thousands of plants shortly the company will open its th location a third gas stationpot dispensary in colorado the company owns half of its buildings and is working on buying more ginsberg says as a marijuana company that is growing as fast it can he does not want to be at the mercy of anyone especially a landlord we put a lot of money into our stores to make them how we want and it doesnt make sense to put this much money into someone elses building ginsberg says  meet the landlords the kalyx a real estate investment trust is trying to be the marijuana industrys honest landlord the company which is based in new york was founded by potter polk a tourism and internet entrepreneur and george stone a founding partner at real estate investment firm the witkoff group which bought the woolworth building in new york city among other properties the company raised  million to buy properties in states where marijuana is legal including three in denver one in auburn washington one in eugene oregon and a sixth in phoenix arizona polk and stone then rent the properties to marijuana businesses with the agreement that rent will increase only  percent a year in an industry where rent can increase by  percent from year to year kalyxs business model is enticing to marijuana entrepreneurs   because the industry is so small you want to be the guy who is fair were building our business along side with these guys not at their expense stone says kalyx owns buildings in denver that are leased to three big weed brandsstrainwise medicine man and dixie elixirs  the sellers market rona hanson a real estate agent who finds homes that accommodate home grows says the cannabis real estate boom is having a knockon effect on the residential market home values have gone up  percent since last year she says and a house under  will typically have  to  offers after an open house and on average sell for  percent of asking price   some cannabis entrepreneurs are even pivoting away from the retail pot business to pursue real estate riches while the getting is good aaron herzberg partner and general counsel at marijuana holding company calcann holdings owns three dispensaries in california including actress roseanne barrs pot shop he says calcann will start to focus on real estate instead of running dispensaries because marijuana properties are a hot commoditya  million piece of land could go for as much as  million if zoned properly he says  they are looking to raise  million in the next three to four months to staff up and start buying more weedfriendly properties eventually they want to become a marijuana investment trust and buy up properties in newly legalized markets  herzberg says his company worked with the city government of adelanto california to pass a city ordinance to allow for cultivation and in the process bought seven parcels of land for  before the public knew about the pot law two months later they sold the land for  million to hopeful marijuana entrepreneurs after going through that deal we came to the realization that running dispensaries is a great business but its a lot of work its not all that profitable and its challenging to work with the regulations herzberg says doing the real estate while it is not easy is just a better business published on apr   real estate and homes for sale  coldwell banker coldwellbankercom sign up sign in buy a home sell
