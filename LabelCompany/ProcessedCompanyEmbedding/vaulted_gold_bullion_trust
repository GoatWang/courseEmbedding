than  people from over  countries use it to buy and own some  billion of gold silver and platinum why bullionvault was set up bullionvault was set up to solve two problems that made it very difficult for private individuals to buy store and sell gold in a simple safe and costeffective way read more the problems private individuals didnt have access to the professional bullion market the best prices for gold and silver are available on the professional bullion market where dealers refiners government agencies and bullion banks trade but this market only deals gold in  oz good delivery bars which cost around  each the silver bars weigh  oz this puts the best prices out of reach of most private individuals private individuals didnt have access to professional vaults good delivery bars are stored in accredited vaults the vaults have a high minimum monthly charge so you would need about  of these  oz gold bars worth around  to make it economic for you to open an account yourself the large starting balance tends to make the system inaccessible to private customers the solution with bullionvault you can access the professional market and buy part of a good delivery bar  or even whole bars youll benefit from the same low costs for buying and storing as the professionals and youll be participating in the deepest pool of physical gold and silver liquidity in the world whether buying or selling you get the best professional bullion market prices all bullionvault gold and silver is good delivery which is the purest and most trusted form of bullion it commands the highest

competition forces everyone  including bullionvault itself  to quote highly competitive prices and you always get the best quoted price from whoever is quoting it lowest costs saving on insurance too avoiding the high cost of currency conversion how do our storage rates compare the cost of ownership for the average bullionvault user who buys gold through our order board and owns it for  years works out at  per annum  which includes all dealing storage and insurance costs the ownership cost for larger users m works out at just  per annum over the same five year period its tempting to think something is only safe when we look after it ourselves but insurers rate privately held gold as very high risk so arranging insurance is both difficult and expensive according to the insurance actuaries who evaluate them the professional bullion vaults are the safest place in the world to store gold so insurance costs much less we include it in your storage fee which saves you money and a great deal of time most banks charge  to  percent when buying or selling foreign currency at bullionvault there is deep gold liquidity in dollars pounds sterling euros and yen this means youll get the

front page at the moment in ounces it’s about sell – buy where do our gold silver and platinum prices come from they come from other bullionvault users just like youbullionvault offers a marketplace exchange in accredited prevaulted privately owned professional market bullion you get to deal directly with another user who wants to sell when you want to buy and viceversa you both save money by cutting out the middleman both when you buy and when you sellit’s easy too youll check the price on a price chart choose your own dealing limit price and enter your orderthe more competitive the price you post the higher your chance of doing a deal and if you offer to pay the price at which somebody is already offering the ‘buy‘ price or ‘best offer‘  here  youll deal straight awaythere is  competition between users to offer each other the best price that’s why bullionvault prices are genuinely ‘competitive’our website makes using an exchange very simple and safe for you and people from all over the world have quickly got the hang of it and empowered themselves to deal gold cheaper open exchanges and competing quotes get you better prices thats why we do it this way but if youre a bit nervous just call us were more than happy to help you through your deal on the telephone how deep is bullionvaults liquidity bullionvault offers you exceptionally reliable and deep liquidity through four complementary channelsthe best price is usually offered by another bullionvault user you deal direct with them cutting out the middleman to your mutual advantage this direct clienttoclient dealing accounts for about  of trading volume on bullionvaulthowever clients arent forced to quote great prices so about  of the time our own price is better for you that means youll trade directly with bullionvault itself – via one of our robotsrobots are computer programs which receive an electronic price feed and use it to quote prices on the bullionvault order board in just the same way as you and other clients do ours manage bullionvaults own  million inventory robots are subject to the same limitations as you which means they can only sell what they already own physically in the vault or buy with their cleared cash balance you buy from them or sell to them just like you would directly with another client but only while they offer a better price its as simple as thatbullionvaults robots usually quote prices in larger quantities than most clients do sufficient to deal m worth instantaneously when world bullion markets are open in normal circumstances they quote prices  and offer the most dependable and instantly accessible mediumsize liquidity of any bullion trading environment anywhere in the worldclients with an interest in computer programming often develop robots for themselves and use them to trade like professional dealers this brings yet more liquidity to the marketplacesometimes like on the day lehman brothers went bust clients acquire all the immediately available stock from our robots although we immediately buy new stock to replace what was sold it takes  hours to be delivered and because the gold is not yet in the vault the robots have no stock to sellat such times you benefit enormously from the access bullionvault gives you to the liquidity of the full depth of the london market you can enter an order to buy or sell at the benchmark prices published by the london bullion market association lbma these prices represent the deepest daily pool of bullion market liquidity in the world – typically restricted just to professionals which is why you access it through uswe allow you to buy or sell as much gold as you want at the daily price and we take onto our own stock the rounded up fraction of a  oz barthe london prices published by the lbma are used widely all around the worldfinally we offer a special service for larger clients they can telephone deal through us directly on the london spot market during the london trading day they can deal whole bars of gold  oz multiples half pallets of silver  oz multiples or a minimum of  kg of platinum at the world market priceyou might not realise how this service for wealthy customers contributes to your liquidity but it doessuppose a wealthy client had  oz of gold in bullionvault already but with heavy demand from buyers there were few offers on the order board the cheapest gold on bullionvault would start to drift above the world market price as bidders bid over the world price but the wealthy client can execute a spot market order to buy at the world market price and offer the gold they already own in the vault to other bullionvault users for a small but easy profitthats natural market forces being used to keep liquidity flowing at fair prices – and it works on bullionvault because anyone who can make settlement to the main market in whole bars can use the main market as a source or sink of bullionwe believe the best way to offer you highly reliable and fairly priced liquidity is to open channels to the largest number of market participants and back it up with access to the deepest markets most of our competitors provide you with a single counterparty – themselves – and this reflects in their pricing so if reliable liquidity at fair prices is what you are looking for then bullionvault sets the standardmain market trades in options  and  incur a two business day settlement delay and have a different fee structure please see the tariff is bullionvault open or closedended bullionvault is openended an inbound or outbound armoured delivery is run whenever there are several bars to collect or deliver usually this is about twice a weekbullionvault itself is the main user of this openended structure which lets us manage our own inventory to act as a buffer between the smaller investment sizes typical of retail investors and the larger settlement quanta of the professional bullion markethowever any bullionvault user who wishes to make or take delivery of  bar of gold  oz a half pallet of silver  oz or a minimum of  kg of platinum can use the same openended nature of the system by settling their professional spot market trades directly into or out of the vault how does bullionvault compare to coinsbars and etfs compared to coins and small barscoins and small bars are normally  more expensive than gold on bullionvault dealers also tend to buy back at a discount of about  bullionvault prices can be compared reliably against the published spot price our gold buying and selling prices are usually well within  of spot and silver and platinum within although storing coins and small bars at home is free it is not usually the wise geopolitical option you will probably need to arrange your own insurance for gold this is likely to be  times as much as bullionvaults combined storage and insurance fee of  for goldcompared to etfs exchangetraded fundswith etfs you never actually own physical gold according to their trust deeds some etfs are not even backed by gold they are designed to track the gold price using complex derivatives at bullionvault we dont make something complex out of something simple you own your goldwith etfs you would pay a storage fee of around  and most etf gold is not insured even within that fee at bullionvault storage and insurance costs just  per annum for goldthe huge majority of etf gold is stored in london and new york the etf manager chooses the jurisdiction – you dont at bullionvault we believe a choice of storage jurisdictions is important – as is the ability to switch we let you choose about  of our users choose zurich in switzerlandetfs are traded on major stock exchanges which tend to be open  hours a day  days a week they settle to your stockbroker in two or three days who then settles with you at bullionvault we are open for dealing  with instantaneous settlement to your bullionvault account a requested withdrawal to your bank

internet bullionvault is a bricksandmortar business which welcomes your visit come to our offices at landmark house th floor blacks road hammersmith london w dp uk you dont need an appointment although it would likely save you some waiting time what would happen if bullionvault failed your ownership and title would not be affected although there would likely be a short delay before you could realise its value while a liquidator was appointeda liquidator could not claim title to your bullion that’s because you are the legal owner of all gold silver and platinum that you buy through bullionvault bullionvault is acting as a custodian which is a status thats very different from your bank and immeasurably safer for youwith a bank account you transfer ownership of your money to the bank when you make a deposit your money then appears on the banks balance sheet and you become its creditor the bank would become insolvent and fail if there were insufficient assets to meet the liabilities owed to all its creditors and that tends to happen to banks periodically because their business is to lend your money for profit not simply keep it in a vaultyou have not made a deposit of gold to bullionvault you are not bullionvaults creditor and do not appear on its balance sheet technically your gold silver and platinum is the subject of a bailment  a legal status through which physical property remains yours while it is in the care of another a liquidator cannot consider it an asset of the company so would have no claim over it and must return it to you in fullbullionvaults finances are very strong very few companies maintain debt free cash and bullion reserves  available at short notice  sufficient to cover the gross costs of running their operation for five years without any revenue the standard equivalent requirement for the banking industry is  months how can i be sure of the quality of the bullion good delivery bars are manufactured by accredited refiners who are regularly subjected to doubleblind tests by independent assayers the bars spend their lives in accredited storage facilities and are transported only by accredited couriersthey are the only form of gold automatically trusted upon receipt by professional buyersonce a year we send in independent specialist assayers who inspect the bullion and report to our auditors who then publish the report on their own website for your inspectionwe are completely confident regarding the quality of the bullion in our care and provide a full permanent  guarantee of its qualitybullionvault gold bars are all of known weight and purity which exceeds  as with the rest of the professional bullion market only the pure gold content gross weight  purity is traded and recorded the gold in your bullionvault account is therefore  puresilver and platinum are different good delivery silver and platinum bars are refined to  purity or better for silver and  purity or better for platinum and traded at gross weight the good delivery silver and platinum in your account is at least  or  pure respectively how can i be sure the gold and silver is in the vault your gold and silver is stored in formally recognised bullion storage facilities managed by specialist vault operators who are leading providers of precious metal vault services and secure transportation around the worldprofessional market vault operators produce what is called a bar list its a bit like a bank statement listing the account holders stock of bars and showing both gold and silver content of each bar and the total amount of bullion held we publish the bar lists produced by the vault operators for bullionvault users gold and silverbullionvault maintains the ownership records of all that bullion each day we publish online our daily register of owners although we hide your identity by listing your holding against your alias we also publish the total and naturally the total matches the total on the bar listno other bullion business provides this daily and independent clientbyclient proof that the right amounts of gold silver and platinum are in the vault is there any counterparty exposure no bullionvault settles immediatelyyour gold silver and platinum are already safely in your chosen vault when you go online to buy you pay the seller immediately with the cleared funds that you previously deposited into the bullionvault client money trust account your money becomes theirs and their gold becomes yours bullionvault guarantees that the deal payment and receipt of gold happen together or not at allwith this speed of settlement you gain enormously in flexibility if ever you need to act quickly  for example to move your property urgently across international borders on bullionvault you can switch your tangible property between vaults in seconds thats much faster than your bank couldnt bullionvaults management suddenly authorise the removal of all the gold no there are powerful controlsfirst there are private protocols we dont publish the details of those but they involve authorisation by several people from multiple companiesthere is also a transparent public protocol for a removal to occur a withdrawal declaration must be published on the bullionvault websites front page  hours before the bullion moves this declaration identifies by alias the holder who is making the withdrawal any user can then check the published register to see that the withdrawing user has at least the quantity of gold which is being declared for withdrawalthe vault operators are not allowed to complete a removal of bullion without confirming the validity of the public declaration for themselvesadditionally under no circumstances can an amount exceeding the larger of  kg or  of the total stored be removed from the operators control on any one day how do i know your website is secure bullionvault uses a highly secure and encrypted system architecture in wide use across industry and government but we all realise these systems are imperfect so bullionvault goes further to protect your property even if someone were to gain access to your account‘burglar alarm’ in the form of an sms message sent to your mobile phone your burglar alarm can be set to sound whenever your account is accessed or an order placed it will always sound when a withdrawal request is entered and before we wire your money a nominal charge of  per sms appliesyour linked bank account when you transfer funds from your bank account to bullionvault the two accounts are linked together outbound funds only go to your linked bank account which can only be changed with a written endorsement from your new banker even if a third party were able to access your bullionvault account they could only sell gold at the market price and send the money back to you what are the tax liabilities we regret we cannot offer tax advice specific to your circumstances the following is generalbullionvault operates from the uk where no taxes apply on the purchase of investment gold silver or platinum bought for storage within the professional vaulting systemdepending upon your tax jurisdiction if you sell your bullion at a profit it is likely that youd be liable to a form of capital gains tax for example if a uk resident made profits exceeding £ on gold in any one tax year  and no matter which jurisdiction they had traded in  they would be liable to a selfdeclared liability of  on profits above the £ allowance many other western countries have similar systems with an allowance and a tax on gains thereafter payable at a flat rateusers often arrange to sell some of their bullion each year but ensure that any profit they make stays within their allowance while prices are rising this has the effect of providing tax free growth do i have to pay vatsales tax on my gold silver or platinum no sales tax is not due on gold silver or platinum purchasesbullionvault gold silver and platinum are all vat sales tax free  for as long as they are held in accredited vaults if you choose to withdraw your gold it remains exempt but  vat will apply if you choose to withdraw your silver or platinum bullion take physical possession of the gold silver or platinum yes  you canthe vast majority of users keep their metal safely in the vault when they sell they receive cash in their bullionvault account which can then be withdrawn back to their bank accountbut you can also withdraw the metal the fees vary according to the circumstanceswhere you cannot reasonably be paid safely by bank transfer we reduce our fee to just  plus transport and insurance costs regardless of the size of your withdrawalwhere the normal bank transfer could be used but you elect a physical withdrawalgoldfor whole standard  oz gold bars the cost is  plus insured shippingsmaller standard g bars cost about   depending on the location they are going to this includes shipping and insurancewe

whole  oz bars of silver bullion the fee is platinumwe only support withdrawal of whole kilograms of platinum the fee is bullionvault gold silver and platinum are all vat sales tax free  for as long as they are held in our vaults upon physical withdrawal gold remains exempt but  vat then applies on silver and platinum hold bullion in an ira or sipp using bullionvault yes see our ira and sipp information pages to learn how get a certificate it is very important that we do not provide you with a certificate why nota formal certificate changes the legal status of what you own from physical gold to a security evidenced by a certificate which purports to be backed by gold suddenly the law has to consider what would happen if there were more certificates in issue than there was gold backing themtitle to bullionvault client gold derives from the register which modern technology the internet allows us to put in the public domainyou will receive a monthly statement which reflects the register you can view the register online whenever you want this evidences your ownership every day with a new electronic advice confirming your register entry its a bit like a certificate which lasts for one day but it is not a true certificate bullionvault is structured for you to own gold not a security choose any vault location yes you can choose whichever you prefer although note that we dont store silver or platinum in every locationwe allow you to spread your holdings across multiple locations and it has no cost implication for you your charges are worked out as if all the bullion was stored in the same placelots of people choose to store their bullion in an overseas jurisdiction because they see this as a wise precaution against the reimposition of capital controls at some stage in the future deposit any amount you can deposit any amount our users have invested between  and you may choose to try the system with a small deposit and purchase before making a larger investmentplease note that we recommend avoiding overall investments below  thats because the minimum monthly storage charge   for gold and  for silver or platinum  may make your investment

credible partners responsiveness and personal accountability we are ready for you to start holding us to account on all these themes we expect to be your cheapest option for investing in gold but it counts for nothing if we are not the right organisation too because your first bullion purchase will start a business relationship which we believe will be one of the most important in your financial life i look forward to introducing you to my board and my team in our faq section below paul tustain × bullionvaults objective is to operate the worlds most costeffective secure and accessible market in professional grade bullion for private investors we do this because we believe there is a deficit of financial responsibility in many modern governments and financial institutions we believe that modern currencies and other paperbased value systems will inhibit savers from retaining their domestic and worldwide purchasing power we believe that using gold to provide protection from this problem is a strategy which has been inaccessible to individuals at a fair price we believe that we are uniquely well qualified to provide that accessibility and to manage the service in a way which maximises security accessibility and value for our customers × good delivery the best bullion prices in the world are available where the liquidity is deepest  on the international physical bullion market centred in london this is where central banks bullion banks investing institutions gold miners and refiners trade what are called good delivery bars these bars are a standard size  ounces  kg for gold  ounces  kg for silver and between  to  kg  to  oz for platinum they are made by accredited refiners and kept in accredited vaults their movement by accredited couriers is carefully documented because these bars entire life is auditable and because they have never been in private hands a professional buyer accepts them as good delivery by the seller so the seller achieves the international spot market price and gets paid quickly and efficiently bullionvault allows private investors access to the professional market and that means you pay the same low costs as the professionals for buying selling and storing large bar gold even though most clients never own anything like a whole bar coins and small bars dont come under the good delivery system so they cannot be sold on the professional market bullionvault only acquires coins and small bars exceptionally to meet the specific withdrawal requests of clients × allocated gold we believe allocated insured overseas storage is your safest way to own gold many people disagree with us and they frequently buy coins to keep at home but we believe history shows them to be making a serious mistake allocated gold is held as your personal property in explicit physical form it is not used to support a lending program or any other financial device it is held away from company balance sheets under a safekeeping or custody program so it could not be accessed by a liquidator in the event of company failure by us or the vault operator because you are the owner not a creditor we like allocated gold because it is very well protected from default allocated gold should be insured because it is yours curiously because it is not yours you do not need to insure unallocated gold because you would not necessarily have suffered a loss if it were stolen you suffer a loss with unallocated gold if your supplier becomes insolvent which is a separate issue we like holding gold overseas because history clearly shows that gold is at its most relevant during currency crises these correlate closely to the imposition of exchange controls which are used by governments to retain gold and currency inside a country in crisis its better to store outside the country before a crisis develops we offer you a choice zurich switzerland london uk new york usa toronto canada and singapore switzerland is the most popular though if you wish you can spread your gold to multiple locations without paying an extra storage charge × at a bank banks generally prefer you to store your gold unallocated so that it becomes formally their property because gold qualifies as a liquid reserve asset which underpins the banks ability to lend what you think of as your gold will actually permit the bank to expand its balance sheet it does this by taking more short term cash deposits and lending them long its the ability of your gold to convert quickly into cash to repay short term depositors in a hurry which allows the bank to do this banks can expand their lending by about eight dollars for every dollar of their reserve so they make a lot more money out of doing this than they do out of renting you vault space thats why they tend to offer you free unallocated storage but very costly allocated storage at something like  times the wholesale rate for vault space of course with unallocated storage it would be your gold technically their gold which would be sold for the benefit of the banks short term creditors during a bank run not many gold owners would elect for that option if they understood it better commercial vaults  including those used by bullionvault  have no banking licence and no motivation to overprice allocated storage × changing your linked bank account linking your bank account with your bullionvault account gives you a very high level of security of course we understand that its not always possible to transfer funds from your bullionvault account to your original bank account for example the original bank may fail or your country of residence may impose restrictions that force you to leave and collect your money independently of your bank account in fact it is for precisely these circumstances that many clients want to buy gold for overseas storage in exceptional circumstances you can link your bullionvault account to a new bank account when doing so we will of course need to go through a strict security process to ensure the safety of your account × please note you are using an outofdate version of internet explorer the bullionvault website may not display properly and some features may not work
