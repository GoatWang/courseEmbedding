gagauz our director will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation competition at the chosen market of printed products is relatively high there exist many large companies offering various ranges of similar products in every geographic market we have picked for operation and expansion such companies will make it difficult for us to develop easily as they will be our direct competitors many of such companies are large enough to provide clients with a wellknown and preferred product assortment at possibly lower price besides they already have best practice in client attraction we may probably lose our business while competing with companies like that terafox corp has not yet entered the market but we have already signed contract with keybievent as of september   and have several more companies ready for cooperation as soon as we start operations well become one of many participants of this business direction some of the competing companies have more finance experience and management skills therefore we appear in competitively unfavorable position as soon as we enter the market with our product which makes it more complicated

the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed the trading price of our common stock when and if we trade at a later date could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment risks associated to our business we are solely dependent upon the funds to be raised in this offering to start our business the proceeds of which may be insufficient to achieve revenues and profitable operations we may need to obtain additional financing which may not be available our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations in the advertising of products and sales we need the proceeds from this offering to commence activities that will allow us to begin seeking financing of our business plan as of september   we had cash in the amount of  and liabilities of  as of this date we have had limited operations and no income the proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations we may need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us  many of the existing copmanies that engage in the sale of printed products business have a greater more establihed database than us there are few barriers of entry in the sale of printed products business and level of competition is extremely high there are many domestic companies offering the same products we will be in direct competition with them many large companies have greater financial capabilities than us and will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential customers many of these companies may have a greater more established customer base than us because we will purchase our raw materials from overseas a disruption in the delivery of imported supplies may have a greater effect on us than on our competitors we will import raw materials for our supplier from china because we keep a minimum stock of raw materials at our shop we believe that disruptions in shipping deliveries may have a greater effect on us than on competitors who keep a greater stock of raw materials andor warehouse supplies in the europe deliveries of our raw materials may be disrupted through factors such as  raw material shortages work stoppages strikes and political unrest  problems with ocean shipping including work stoppages and shipping container shortages  increased inspections of import shipments or other factors causing delays in shipments and  economic crises international disputes and wars most of our competitors warehouse large quantities of raw materials they import from overseas which allows them to continue delivering their products for the near term despite overseas shipping disruptions if our competitors are able to deliver products when we cannot our reputation may be damaged and we may lose customers to our competitors we are a development stage company and have commenced limited operations in our business we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future we were incorporated on february   and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities we have commenced limited business operations accordingly we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new distribution companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake these potential problems include but are not limited to unanticipated problems  relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates prior to production of printed products we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues we expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future we recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming we will not be able to continue business operations there is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks our business will most likely fail we have yet to earn revenue and our ability to sustain our operations is dependent on our ability to raise financing our independent registered public accountant has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern we have accrued net losses of  for the period from our inception on february   to september   and have no revenues as of this date our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations in the manufacturing and distribution of printed products further the finances required to fully develop our plan cannot be predicted with any certainty and may exceed any estimates we set forth we do however anticipate that we will require  over the next  months in order to continue operations these factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern harris  gillespie cpas pllc our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern this opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise if we fail to raise sufficient capital when needed we will not be able to complete our business plan as a result we may have to liquidate our business and you may lose your investment you should consider our independent registered public accountants comments when determining if an investment in terafox corp is suitable we require minimum funding of approximately  to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year if we are not able to raise this amount or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from aleksey gagauz our officer and director who has verbally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses this agreement is filed as an exhibit  after one year we may need additional financing we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing if we are successful in raising the funds from this offering we plan to commence activities to start our operations we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to start our operations the effect of the recent economic crisis may impact our business operating results or financial conditions  the recent global crisis has caused disruption and extreme volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy and has impacted levels of consumer spending these macroeconomic developments may affect our business operating results or financial condition in a number of ways for example our potential customers may never start spending with us may have difficulty paying us or may delay paying us for p a slow or uneven pace of economic recovery would negatively affect our ability to start our manufacture and distribution business and obtain financing further our products are currently procured from a province of china and should there be an interruption in our supply of products we might be unable to continue our operations we operate in a highly competitive environment and if we are unable to compete with our competitors our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects could be materially adversely affected we operate in a highly competitive environment our competition includes large small and midsized companies and many of them may distribute similar products in our markets at competitive prices highly competitive environment could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects because our sole officer and director will own  or more of our outstanding common stock if maximum offering shares are sold they will make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to minority shareholders if maximum offering shares will be sold aleksey gagauz our sole officer and director will own   of the outstanding shares of our common stock accordingly he will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including the election of directors mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control the interests of aleksey gagauz may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders because our current president has other interests he may not be able or willing to devote a sufficient amount of time to our business operations causing our business to fail aleksey gagauz our president currently devotes approximately twenty hours per week providing management services to us while he presently possesses adequate time to attend to our interest it is possible that the demands on his from other obligations could increase with the result that he would no longer be able to devote sufficient time to the management of our business the loss of aleksey gagauz to our company could negatively impact our business development  if aleksey gagauz our president and director should resign or die we will not have a chief executive officer that could result in our operations suspending if that should occur you could lose your investment we extremely depend on the services of our president and director aleksey gagauz for the future success of our business the loss of the services of aleksey gagauz could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if he should resign or die we will not have a chief executive officer if that should occur until we find another person to act as our chief executive officer our operations could be suspended in that event it is possible you could lose your entire investment because companys headquarter and assets are located outside the united states us investors may experience difficulties in attempting to effect service of process and to enforce judgments based upon us federal securities laws against the company and its nonus resident sole officer and director while we are organized under the laws of state of nevada our sole officer and director are nonus resident and our headquarters and assets are located outside the united states consequently it may be difficult for investors to affect service of process on them in the united states and to enforce in the united states judgments obtained in united states courts against them based on the civil liability provisions of the united states securities laws since all our assets will be located outside us it may be difficult or impossible for us investors to collect a judgment against us any additional funding we arrange through the sale of our common stock will result in dilution to existing shareholders we must raise additional capital in order for our business plan to succeed our most likely source of additional capital will be through the sale of additional shares of common stock such stock issuances will cause stockholders interests in our company to be diluted such dilution will negatively affect the value of an investors shares because we have elected to defer compliance with new or revised accounting standards our financial statement disclosure may not be comparable to similar companies we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under section b of the jumpstart our business startups act this allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies as a result of our election our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates  risks associated with this offering our president aleksey gagauz does not have any prior experience conducting a besteffort offering and our best effort offering does not require a mimimum amount to be raised as a result of this we may not be able to raise enough funds to commence and sustain our business and investors may lose their entire investment aleksey gagauz does not have any experience conducting a besteffort offering consequently we may not be able to raise any funds successfully also the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised if we are not able to raise sufficient funds we may not be able to fund our operations as planned and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected our inability to successfully conduct a besteffort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us the trading in our shares will be regulated by the securities and exchange commission rule g which established the definition of a penny stock the shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act and rules of the commission the exchange act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are generally institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding   jointly with spouse or in transactions not recommended by the brokerdealer for transactions covered by the penny stock rules a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and certain associated persons and deliver certain disclosures required by the commission consequently the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all because we are a shell company it will likely be difficult for us to obtain additional financing by way of private offerings of our securities we are a shell company within the meaning of rule  promulgated pursuant to securities act because we have nominal assets and nominal operations accordingly the holders of securities purchased in private offerings of our securities we make to investors will not be able to rely on the safe harbor from being deemed an underwriter under sec rule  in order to resell their securities this will likely make it more difficult for us to attract additional capital through subsequent unregistered offerings because purchasers of securities in such unregistered offerings will not be able to resell their securities in reliance on rule  a safe harbor on which holders of restricted securities usually rely to resell securities  we are selling this offering without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any shares this offering is selfunderwritten that is we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares we intend to sell our shares through our president who will receive no commissions there is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares unless he is successful in selling all of the shares and we receive the proceeds from this offering we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan due to the lack of a trading market for our securities you may have difficulty selling any shares you purchase in this offering we are not registered on any market or public stock exchange there is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the overthecounter bulletin board otcbb the otcbb is a regulated quotation service that displays realtime quotes last sale prices and volume information in overthecounter securities the otcbb is not an issuer listing service market or exchange although the otcbb does not have any listing requirements per se to be eligible for quotation on the otcbb issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec or applicable regulatory authority if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement securities already quoted on the otcbb that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a  to  day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time we cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale as of the date of this filing there have been no discussions or understandings between terafox corp and anyone acting on our behalf with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities if no market is ever developed for our common stock it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering in such a case you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay if at all in addition if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult if not impossible to ever resell your shares resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment we will incur ongoing costs and expenses for sec reporting and compliance without revenue we may not be able to remain in compliance making it difficult for investors to sell their shares if at all the estimated cost of this registration statement is  we will have to utilize funds from aleksey gagauz our officer and director who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process after the effective date of this prospectus we will be required to file annual quarterly and current reports or other information with the sec as provided by the securities exchange act we plan to contact a market maker immediately following  the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board to be eligible for quotation issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec in order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources the costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next  months will be approximately  if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all also if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board our sole officer and director have no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting we have never operated as a public company aleksey gagauz our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as a result we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company even if our operations are successful we plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required for a public company however if we cannot operate successfully as a public company your investment may be materially adversely affected our inability to operate as a public company could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us as an emerging growth company under the jobs act we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements we qualify as an emerging growth company under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to  have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act  comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis  submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as sayonpay and sayonfrequency and  disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executives compensation to median employee compensation  in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period until such time however we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile investors that need to rely on dividend income or liquidity should not purchase shares of our common stock we have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception and we do not anticipate paying any such dividends for the foreseeable future investors that need to rely on dividend income should not invest in our common stock as any income would only come from any rise in the market price of our common stock which is uncertain and unpredictable investors that require liquidity should also not invest in our common stock there is no established trading market and should one develop it will likely be volatile and subject to minimal trading volumes antitakeover effects of certain provisions of nevada state law hinder a potential takeover of us though not now in the future we may become subject to nevadas control share law a corporation is subject to nevadas control share law if it has more than  stockholders at least  of whom are stockholders of record and residents of nevada and it does business in nevada or through an affiliated corporation the law focuses on the acquisition of a controlling interest which means the ownership of outstanding voting shares sufficient but for the control share law to enable the acquiring person to exercise the following proportions of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors i onefifth or more but less than onethird ii onethird or more but less than a majority or iii a majority or more the ability to exercise such voting power may be direct or indirect as well as individual or in association with others  the effect of the control share law is that the acquiring person and those acting in association with it obtains only such voting rights in the control shares as are conferred by a resolution of the stockholders of the corporation approved at a special or annual meeting of stockholders the control share law contemplates that voting rights will be considered only once by the other stockholders thus there is no authority to strip voting rights from the control shares of an acquiring person once those rights have been approved if the stockholders do not grant voting rights to the control shares acquired by an acquiring person those shares do not become permanent nonvoting shares the acquiring person is free to sell its shares to others if the buyers of those shares themselves do not acquire a controlling interest their shares do not become governed by the control share law if control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired control shares with a majority or more of the voting power any stockholder of record other than an acquiring person who has not voted in favor of approval of voting rights is entitled to demand fair value for such stockholders shares nevadas control share law may have the effect of discouraging takeovers of the corporation in addition to the control share law nevada has a business combination law which prohibits certain business combinations between nevada corporations and interested stockholders for three years after the interested stockholder first becomes an interested stockholder unless the corporations board of directors approves the combination in advance for purposes of nevada law an interested stockholder is any person who is i the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation or ii an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time within the three previous years was the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the corporation the definition of the term business combination is sufficiently broad to cover virtually any kind of transaction that would allow a potential acquirer to use the corporations assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests of the corporation and its other stockholders the effect of nevadas business combination law is to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of us from doing so if it cannot obtain the approval of our board of directors forward looking statements this prospectus contains forwardlooking statements that involve risk and uncertainties we use words such as anticipate believe plan expect future intend and similar expressions to identify such forwardlooking statements investors should be aware that all forwardlooking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements for many reasons including the risks faced by us as described in the risk factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus  use of proceeds our offering is being made on a selfunderwritten basis no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed the offering price per share is  the following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of   and  respectively of the securities offered for sale by the company there is no assurance that we will raise the full  as anticipated percentage of shares sold        gross income    number of printing

the above figures represent only estimated costs we will establish a separate bank account and all proceeds will be deposited into that account if necessary aleksey gagauz our president and director has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process also these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the otc electronic bulletin board mr gagauz will not be repaid from the proceeds of this offering there is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by mr gagauz our director will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation determination of offering price the offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us the price does not bear any relationship to our assets book value earnings or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company in determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan accordingly the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities  dilution the price of the current offering is fixed at  per share this price is significantly higher than the price paid by the companys officer for common equity since the companys inception on february   aleksey gagauz the companys president and director paid  per share for the  shares of common stock he purchased from the company as of september   the historical net tangible book value was  or approximately  per share historical net tangible book value per share of common stock is equal to our total tangible assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of september   assuming the completion of the sale of all  shares of common stock in this offering there will be  shares of common stock outstanding the following table illustrates per share of common stock dilution that may be experienced by investors at various funding levels funding

balance is  as of september   we believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time we have been utilizing and may continue to utilize funds from aleksey gagauz our chairman and president who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs filing fees and professional fees mr gagauz however has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company in order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period we require approximately  of additional capital as previously disclosed being a development stage company we have very limited operating history after twelve months period we may need additional financing we do not currently have any arrangements for additional  financing our principal executive offices are located at str lege  sofia bulgaria  our phone number is  we are a development stage company and have generated no revenue to the date long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering will be required to fully implement our business plan the exact amount of funding will depend on the scale of our expansion we have not decided yet on the scale of our expansion and on exact amount of funding needed for our long term financing if we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of  of additional funding to run out business while we reassess our situation and decide on the scale of our future expansion if any our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills this is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development there is no assurance we will ever reach that stage to meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering we believe that we will be able to raise enough money through this offering to start our proposed operations but we cannot guarantee that once we start operations we will stay in business after doing so if we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources at the present time we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash other than through this offering if we need additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely even if we raise  from this offering it will last one year but we may need more funds for business operations in the next year and we will have to revert to obtaining additional money because we generated less than  billion in total annual gross revenues during our most recently completed fiscal year we qualify as an emerging growth company under the jumpstart our business startups jobs act we will lose our emerging growth company status on the earliest occurrence of any of the following events  on the last day of any fiscal year in which we earn at least  billion in total annual gross revenues which amount is adjusted for inflation every five years  on the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement  on the date on which we have during the previous year period issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt or   the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a large accelerated filer as defined in section b of title  code of federal regulations or any successor thereto a large accelerated filer is an issuer that at the end of its fiscal year meets the following conditions  it has an aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and nonvoting common equity held by its nonaffiliates of  million or more as of the last business day of the issuers most recently completed second fiscal quarter  it has been subject to the requirements of section a or d of the act for a period of at least twelve calendar months and  it has filed at least one annual report pursuant to section a or d of the act as an emerging growth company exemptions from the following provisions are available to us  section b of the sarbanesoxley act of  which requires auditor attestation of internal controls  section aa and b of the securities exchange act of  which require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation  section i of the exchange act which has not yet been implemented which requires companies to disclose the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the company  section b of the doddfrank act which has not yet been implemented which requires companies to disclose the ratio between the annual total compensation of the ceo and the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the companies and  the requirement to provide certain other executive compensation disclosure under item  of regulation sk instead an emerging growth company must only comply with the more limited provisions of item  applicable to smaller reporting companies regardless of the issuers size pursuant to section  of the jobs act an emerging growth company may choose to forgo such exemption and instead comply with the requirements that apply to an issuer that is not an emerging growth company we have elected to maintain our status as an emerging growth company and take advantage of the jobs act provisions plan of operations we have no assurance we will

until the date of this filing we have had very limited operating activities our financial statements from inception february   through september   net loss of  our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for terafox corp which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern since inception we have sold  shares of common stock to our sole officer and director for net proceeds of  liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company had  cash and our liabilities were  of which we owe  to our president aleksey gagauz the available capital reserves of the company are not sufficient for the company to remain operational since inception we have sold  shares of common stocks to our sole officer and director at a price of  per share for aggregate proceeds of  we are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operation we will have to utilize funds from aleksey gagauz our

requirement if we are successful any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the use of proceeds section of this prospectus we will attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operation  our auditors have issued a going concern opinion meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital no substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations the other source of cash would be a loan from our president and director aleksey gagauz with whom we have a verbal loan agreement filed as an exhibit  or we will consider selling additional common stock we currently do not have any such agreement in place we must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business the amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting the company anticipates over the next  months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately  we are highly dependent upon the success of the private offerings of equity or debt securities as described herein therefore the failure thereof would result in the need to seek capital from other resources such as taking loans which would likely not even be possible for the company however if such financing were available because we are a development stage company with no operations to date we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate at such time these funds are required management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing if the company cannot raise additional proceeds the company would be required to cease business operations as a result investors would lose all of their investment significant

bulgarian cities from there lease agreement we provide lease agreement summary as follows  terafox corp has signed lease agreement as of  coming into force february   with sergey pelovski sofia bulgaria for  year term the premise allows us to place  industrial flatbed printing machines according to the agreement we lease  square meters of premises on the first floor of the building at

for additional one year term upon written notice from terafox corp a copy of the lease agreement is filed as exhibit  to this registration statement contracts terafox corp has signed sales contract with keybievent we provide contract summary as follows sales contract  was signed on september   between terafox corp and keybievent in the contract keybievent the buyer has agreed to purchase printed products produced by terafox corp the parties have agreed that no party has a minimum of goods required to be sold or purchased from another party printed products will be sold to keybievent with  discount contract comes into force on march   a copy of the lease agreement is filed as exhibit  to this registration statement competition competition at the chosen market of printed products is relatively high there exist many large companies offering various ranges of similar products in every geographic market we have picked for operation and expansion such companies will make it difficult for us to develop easily as they will be our direct competitors many of such companies are large enough to provide clients with a wellknown and preferred product assortment at possibly lower price besides they already have best practice in client attraction we may probably lose our business while competing with companies like that terafox corp has not yet entered the market but we have already signed contract with keybievent as of september   contract copy is filed as exhibit  and have several more companies ready for cooperation as soon as we start operations well become one of many participants of this business direction some of the competing companies have more finance experience and management skills therefore we appear in competitively unfavorable position as soon as we enter the market with our product which makes it more complicated for us to achieve success in printed products market due to that terafox corp may possibly not make its place at the market insurance we do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future as we do not have insurance and if we are made a party of products liability action we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation in that case judgment could be rendered against us which could cause us to cease operations  employees we are a development stage company and currently have no employees other
