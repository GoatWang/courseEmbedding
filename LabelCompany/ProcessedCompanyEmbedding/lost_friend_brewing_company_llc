walked up to the front of the restaurant my wife pointed out to me a sign on the window stating that no firearms were allowed even if a patron possessed a legal permit to carry now normally i dont give my business to onlycriminalsareallowedtocarrygunshere establishments but i had a hungry wife in tow so i took my glock out to my wrangler and returned with an empty holster and feeling somewhat less dressed the upside of this encroachment on my right to defend innocent life was the opportunity to try out the restaurants krauthammer creek german kolsh which was excellent and particularly appropriate since my dinner choice was the equally tasty bratwurst platter well probably return because we both enjoyed the ambience but rest assured ill be wearing a stealthily holster and forego the beer commentscheers or pour out  flag it david paine  i generally have a five star experience at lost province i have yet to find something i didnt like the sandwiches are excellent hearty and delicious the pizzas are among the top two or three contenders in townalthough the glutenfree crust is small and overpriced wonderful beer offerings with frequent seasonal changes and steady standbys
