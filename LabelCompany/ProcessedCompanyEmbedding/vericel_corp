defects in the knee and epicel cultured epidermal autografts a permanent skin replacement for the treatment of patients with deepdermal or fullthickness burns approximately  of total body surface area tbsathe company is developing maci a thirdgeneration autologous chondrocyte implant for the treatment of cartilage defects in the knee and ixmyelocelt a patientspecific multicellular therapy for the treatment of advanced heart failure due to ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy dcm it has a cellmanufacturing facility in cambridge massachusetts which is used for the united states manufacturing and distribution of carticel epicel manufacturing and also manufactured maci for the summit study conducted for approval in europecarticelcarticel is a firstgeneration autologous chondrocyte implantation aci product for the treatment and repair of cartilage defects in the knee carticel is indicated for the repair of symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyle medial lateral or trochlea caused by acute or repetitive trauma in patients who have had an inadequate response to a prior arthroscopic or other surgical repair procedure such as debridement the removal of damaged or defective cartilage microfracture the creation of tiny fractures in the bone to encourage new cartilage development drillingabrasion arthroplasty and osteochondral allograftautograft transferring cartilage from one joint to another carticel is implanted by orthopedic surgeons after obtaining a cartilage biopsy during an initial arthroscopic procedure the patients chondrocytes which are the cells that produce cartilage are isolated and expanded in a manufacturing process compliant with current good manufacturing practices cgmp during a second surgical procedure the cells are implanted in the cartilage defect under a sutured periosteal flap where they produce new hyaline cartilageepicelepicel cultured epidermal autografts is a permanent skin replacement for full thickness burns epicel is the food and drug administration fdaapproved autologous epidermal product available for total surface area burns epicel is produced by isolating and expanding keratinocytes which are the predominant cell type in the epidermis or outer layer of the skin obtained from a small biopsy of a patients healthy skin epicel is a treatment option for patients with severe burns because these patients are generally understood to need a keratinocytebased epithelium and there is very little skin which is the only other source of keratinocytebased epithelium available for autografts for these patients epicel is a cellbased productmacimaci is a thirdgeneration aci product for the treatment of focal chondral cartilage defects in the knee similar to carticel during an initial surgical procedure a surgeon obtains a biopsy of healthy cartilage from the patient and the chondrocytes are isolated expanded and uniformly seeded onto a bioabsorbable type iiii collagen membrane to form the autologous implantation maci

glue and without suturesixmyelocelt technology platformthe companys preapprovalstage portfolio also includes ixmyelocelt a patientspecific multicellular therapy derived from an adult patients own bone marrow which utilizes its automated manufacturing system its cell manufacturing process expands the mesenchymal stromal cells mscs and mlike antiinflammatory macrophages in the patients bone marrow mononuclear cells while retaining many of the hematopoietic cells studies examining the impact of ixmyelocelt on human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro demonstrate the secretion of proangiogenic factors enhanced migration of endothelial cells following injury increased endothelial cell proliferation and branch formation treatment with ixmyelocelt in a rat model of hind limb ischemia in vivo resulted in increased blood flow perfusion and capillary density gene expression and plasma levels of the antiinflammatory cytokine its studies demonstrate that ixmyelocelt brings to bear a combination of angiogenic and antiinflammatory effects which facilitate ischemic tissue repairixmyelocelt clinical development programsthe companys ixmyelocelt clinical development program is focused on addressing chronic ischemic cardiovascular disease it has completed phase iii clinical trials in dcm its phase iib ixcelldcm study which is a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled clinical trial for patients with advanced heart failure due to ischemic dcm ixmyelocelt has been granted a united states orphan drug designation by the fda for the treatment of dcm it also has an ixmyelocelt investigatorinitiated clinical study for the treatment of craniofacial reconstruction and it has conducted clinical studies for the treatment of critical limb ischemia clithe company has conducted two phase iia multicenter randomized openlabel clinical studies in patients with ischemic dcm and nonischemic dcm investigating surgical impactdcm and catheterbased catheterdcm delivery of ixmyelocelt results from these studies demonstrated that ixmyelocelt was welltolerated in patients with dcm in the catheterdcm study and postsurgery in the impactdcm study the incidence of adverse
