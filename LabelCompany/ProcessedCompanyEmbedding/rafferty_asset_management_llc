applicants representations  the trust is an openend management investment company registered under the act and organized as a delaware statutory trust the trust is authorized to offer an unlimited number of series the “funds” the adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  “advisers act” the trust will initially offer thirtytwo series “initial funds” with different types of investment objectives as further described below applicants may offer additional funds in the future “future funds” and included in the term funds each fund will be advised by the adviser the adviser may enter into subadvisory agreements with additional investment advisers to act as subadvisers to the trust and any of the funds any subadviser to the trust or a fund will be registered under the advisers act a brokerdealer registered under the securities exchange act of  “exchange act” will act as the distributor and principal underwriter of each funds creation units of ets “distributor”  the funds will seek daily investment results before fees and expenses that a correspond to the return of particular foreign equity indices “underlying foreign indices” domestic equity indices “underlying domestic indices” or fixed income securities indices “underlying fixed income indices” together with the underlying foreign indices and the underlying domestic indices the “underlying indices”  such funds are referred to as the “conventional funds” b provide up to  of the return of their underlying indices “leveraged funds” or c provide up to  of the inverse performance of their underlying indices “inverse funds”  conventional funds and leveraged funds based on underlying domestic indices will invest at least  and  respectively of their total assets in the equity securities contained in the relevant underlying domestic index conventional funds and leveraged funds based on underlying fixed income indices will invest at least  of their total assets in the securities that comprise the relevant underlying fixed income index conventional funds and leveraged funds based on underlying foreign indices will invest at least  of their total assets in the equity securities contained in the relevant underlying foreign index and depositary receipts representing such securities  additionally the funds may invest in shortterm debt instruments that meet the definition of “eligible security” in rule a under the act “money market instruments” and in futures contracts options equity caps collars and floors swap agreements forward contracts and reverse repurchase agreements collectively “financial instruments” in order to meet their investment objectives the inverse funds will only invest in financial instruments and money market instruments they will not invest in the component securities of their underlying indices  a conventional fund will utilize either a replication or representative sampling strategy a conventional fund using a “replication” strategy will invest in substantially all of the component securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the underlying index a conventional fund using a representative sampling strategy will invest in some but not all of the relevant component securities the adviser will seek to achieve the investment objectives of the leveraged funds and the inverse funds by using a mathematical model that takes into account a variety of specified criteria the most important of which are a the net assets in each funds portfolio at the end of each trading day b the amount of required exposure to the underlying index and c the positions in equity and fixed income securities financial instruments and money market instruments at the beginning of each trading day on each day that a fund is required to be open under section e of the act “business day” the full portfolio holdings of each fund will be disclosed on the website of the trust andor the exchange on which ets are primarily listed “primary listing exchange” the portfolio holdings information disclosed each business day will form the basis for that funds net asset value “nav” calculation as of  pm eastern time that day and will reflect portfolio trades made on the immediately preceding business day intraday values of each underlying domestic index and underlying foreign index will be disseminated every  seconds throughout the trading day the value of underlying fixed income indices will be calculated and published once per day  applicants expect that each conventional fund will have an annual tracking error of less than  over the course of the year excluding the impact of expenses and interest if any to the performance of its underlying index for leveraged funds and inverse funds applicants expect a tracking error of less than  over the course of a year excluding the impact of expenses and interest if any to the specified multiple or inverse multiple respectively of the performance of the relevant underlying index  each fund will issue creation units of approximately  to  ets applicants expect the initial offering price of a creation unit to be a minimum of  million all orders to purchase creation units must be placed on a business day with the distributor by or through a party that has entered into a participant agreement with the distributor an “authorized participant” an authorized participant must be either a a brokerdealer or other participant in the continuous net settlement system of the national securities clearing corporation a clearing agency that is registered with the commission or b a participant in the depository trust company “dtc” system the distributor also will be responsible for delivering the prospectus to those persons purchasing creation units and for maintaining records of the orders start printed page and acknowledgements of acceptance for orders  creation units of conventional and leveraged funds generally will be purchased and redeemed in exchange for an “inkind” transfer of securities “inkind payment” and cash inverse funds will generally be purchased and redeemed entirely for cash because of the limited transferability of financial instruments an investor making an inkind payment will be required to transfer to the trust a “deposit basket” consisting of a a basket of securities consisting of some or all of the securities in the relevant underlying index or other securities selected by the adviser to correspond to the performance of the underlying index the “deposit securities” and b a “balancing amount” the balancing amount will be equal to the differential if any between the total aggregate market value of the deposit securities or in the case of redemptions the redemption securities defined below and the nav per creation unit an investor purchasing or redeeming a creation unit from a fund will be charged a fee “transaction fee” to prevent the dilution of the interests of the remaining shareholders resulting from the fund incurring costs in connection with the purchase and redemption of the creation units the maximum transaction fee and any variations or waivers of the transaction fee will be disclosed in the prospectus for ets “prospectus” and the method of determining the transaction fees will be disclosed in the prospectus andor statement of additional information “sai”  persons purchasing creation units from a fund may hold the ets or sell some or all of them in the secondary market ets of the funds will be listed on an exchange and trade in the secondary market in the same manner as other exchangetraded funds it is expected that one or more exchange member firms will act as a specialist “exchange specialist” or market maker “market maker” and maintain a market on the primary listing exchange for ets the price of ets traded on an exchange will be based on a current bidoffer market the initial trading price for ets of each fund will fall in the range of  to  transactions involving the sale of ets in the secondary market will be subject to customary brokerage commissions and charges  applicants expect that purchasers of creation units will include institutional and retail investors arbitrageurs traders financial advisors portfolio managers and other market participants an exchange specialist or market maker in providing for a fair and orderly secondary market for ets also may purchase or redeem creation units for use in its marketmaking activities applicants expect that the market price of ets will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities created by the ability to purchase or redeem creation units at their nav which should ensure that the market price of ets at or close to  pm stays close to the nav on that business day  ets will not be individually redeemable ets will only be redeemable in creation units through the distributor which will act as the trusts agent for redemption to redeem an investor must accumulate enough ets to constitute a creation unit an investor redeeming a creation unit of a conventional or leveraged fund generally will receive an inkind payment of securities published by the trusts index receipt agent the “redemption securities” the balancing amount in effect on the date a request for redemption is made minus any transaction fee  applicants state that in accepting deposit securities and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities the relevant funds will comply with the federal securities laws including that the deposit securities and fund securities are sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the securities act as a general matter the deposit securities and redemption securities will correspond pro rata to the securities held by each conventional fund and leveraged fund but redemption securities received on redemption may not always be identical to deposit securities deposited in connection with the purchase of creation units for the same day  applicants state that neither the trust nor any fund will be advertised marketed or otherwise held out as a “mutual fund” the term “mutual fund” will not be used in the prospectus except to compare and contrast the trust or a fund with conventional mutual funds in all marketing materials where the features or methods of obtaining buying or selling creation units are described or where there is reference to redeemability applicants will include a prominent statement to the effect that individual ets are not redeemable except in creation units the same approach will be followed in connection with reports and other communications to shareholders as well as any other investor education materials issued or circulated in connection with ets the trust will provide copies of its annual and semiannual shareholder reports to dtc participants for distribution to beneficial holders of ets applicants legal analysis  applicants request an order under section c of the act for an exemption from sections a a d e and d of the act and rule cstart printed page  under the act and under sections c and b of the act for an exemption from sections a and a of the act  section c of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class of persons securities or transactions from any provision of the act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act sections a and a of the act  section a of the act defines an “openend company” as a management investment company that is offering for sale or has outstanding any redeemable security of which it is the issuer section a of the act defines a redeemable security as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of which the owner upon its presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent because ets will not be individually redeemable applicants request an order that would permit the trust to issue ets that are redeemable in creation units only applicants state that investors may purchase ets of a fund in creation units and redeem creation units from the trust applicants further state that because the market price of ets will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities investors should be able to sell ets in the secondary market at or close to  pm on a business day at prices that do not vary substantially from the nav on that business day section d of the act and rule c under the act  section d of the act among other things prohibits a dealer from selling a redeemable security which is currently being offered to the public by or through a principal underwriter except at a current public offering price described in the prospectus rule c under the act generally requires that a dealer selling redeeming or repurchasing a redeemable security do so only at a price based on its nav applicants state that secondary market trading in ets will take place at negotiated prices not at a current offering price described in a funds prospectus as required by section d of the act and not at a price based on nav as required by rule c under the act applicants request an exemption under section c from these provisions  applicants assert that the concerns sought to be addressed by section d of the act and rule c under the act with respect to pricing are equally satisfied by the proposed method of pricing ets applicants maintain that while there is little legislative history regarding section d its provisions as well as those of rule c appear to have been intended to a prevent dilution caused by certain risklesstrading schemes by principal underwriters and contract dealers b prevent unjust discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers and c ensure an orderly distribution of investment company shares by eliminating price competition from dealers offering shares at less than the published sales price and repurchasing shares at more than the published redemption price  applicants believe that none of these purposes will be thwarted by permitting ets to trade in the secondary market at negotiated prices applicants state that a secondary market trading in ets does not directly involve trust assets and b to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day or from day to day such variances occur as a result of thirdparty market forces such as supply and demand not as a result of unjust or discriminatory manipulation therefore applicants assert that secondary market transactions in ets will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers finally applicants contend that the proposed distribution system will be orderly because competitive forces in the marketplace will ensure that the difference between the market price of ets and their nav remains narrow section d of the act  section d of the act provides in relevant part that the prospectus delivery exemption provided to dealer transactions by section  of the securities act does not apply to any transaction in a redeemable security issued by an openend investment company applicants seek relief from section d to permit dealers selling ets in the secondary markets to rely on the prospectus delivery exemption provided by section  of the securities act  applicants state that secondary market investors will regard ets in a manner similar to other securities including closedend fund shares that are listed bought and sold on an exchange applicants note that shares of closedend fund investment companies are sold in the secondary market unaccompanied by a prospectus  applicants contend that ets as a listed security merit a reduction in the compliance costs and regulatory burdens resulting from the imposition of prospectus delivery obligations in the secondary market because ets will be exchangelisted prospective investors will have access to several types of market information about ets applicants state that information regarding market price and volume will be continually available on a realtime basis throughout the day from the relevant exchange automated quotation systems published or other public sources or online information services applicants expect that the previous days closing price and volume information for ets also will be published daily in the financial section of newspapers in addition the trust expects to maintain a website that includes quantitative information updated on a daily basis including for each fund daily trading volume the nav and the reported closing price the website will also include for each fund a calculation of the premium or discount of the reported closing price against nav and data in chart format displaying the frequency distribution of discounts and premiums of the reported closing price against the nav within appropriate ranges for each of the four previous calendar quarters  applicants will make available for distribution to secondary market purchasers of ets a product description “product description” that describes in plain english the trust relevant fund and its ets applicants state that start printed page while not intended as a substitute for a prospectus the product description will contain information about ets that is tailored to meet the needs of investors purchasing ets in the secondary market the product description will also disclose the potential for deviation over time between the return of the leveraged funds or inverse funds and the multiple return of the corresponding underlying index and provide an example of this deviation in returns over time in the same manner as in the prospectus section e  section e of the act generally prohibits a registered investment company from suspending the right of redemption or postponing the date of payment of redemption proceeds for more than seven days after the tender of a security for redemption applicants state that settlement of redemptions for funds based on underlying foreign indices “foreign funds” is contingent not only on the settlement cycle of the united states market but also on delivery cycles in local markets for underlying foreign securities held by the foreign funds applicants state that local market delivery cycles for transferring redemption securities to redeeming investors coupled with local market holiday schedules will under certain circumstances require a delivery process longer than seven calendar days for foreign funds applicants request relief under section c of the act from section e to allow foreign funds to pay redemption proceeds up to  calendar days after the tender of a creation unit for redemption except as disclosed in the relevant foreign funds prospectus product description andor sai applicants expect that each foreign fund will be able to deliver redemption proceeds within seven days with respect to future foreign funds applicants seek the same relief from section e only to the extent that circumstances similar to those described in the application exist  applicants state that section e was designed to prevent unreasonable undisclosed and unforeseen delays in the payment of redemption proceeds applicants assert that the requested relief will not lead to the problems that section e was designed to prevent applicants state that the sai will disclose those local holidays over the period of at least one year following the date of the sai if any that are expected to prevent the delivery of redemption proceeds in seven calendar days and the maximum number of days needed to deliver the proceeds for each foreign fund applicants are not seeking relief from section e with respect to foreign funds that do not effect creations and redemptions of creation units inkind sections a and a of the act  section a of the act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such a person “secondtier affiliate” from selling any security to or purchasing any security from the company section a of the act defines “affiliated person” to include a any person directly or indirectly owning controlling or holding with power to vote  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person b any person  or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned controlled or held with the power to vote by the other person and c any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with the other person section a of the act provides that a control relationship will be presumed where one person owns more than  of another persons voting securities  applicants request an exemption from section a of the act pursuant to sections b and c of the act to permit persons to effectuate inkind purchases and redemptions with a fund when they are affiliated persons of the fund or secondtier affiliates solely by virtue of one or more of the following a holding  or more or more than  of the outstanding ets of one or more funds b having an affiliation with a person with an ownership interest described in a or c holding  or more or more than  of the shares of one or more other registered investment companies or series thereof advised by the adviser or an entity controlling controlled by or under common control with the adviser  section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a of the act if evidence establishes that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company and the general provisions of the act applicants assert that no useful purpose would be served by prohibiting these types of affiliated persons from purchasing or redeeming creation units through “inkind” transactions the deposit procedures for both inkind purchases and inkind redemptions of creation units will be the same for all purchases and redemptions deposit securities and redemption securities will be valued in the same manner as the securities held by the funds therefore applicants state that inkind purchases and redemptions will afford no opportunity for the affiliated persons described above to effect a transaction detrimental to other holders of ets applicants also believe that inkind purchases and redemptions will not result in selfdealing or overreaching of the fund applicants conditions applicants agree that any order of granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  the prospectus and product description will clearly disclose that for purposes of the act ets are issued by the funds and the acquisition of ets by investment companies is subject to the restrictions of section d of the act except as permitted by an exemptive order that permits registered investment companies to invest in a fund beyond the limits in section d subject to certain terms and conditions including that the registered investment company enter into an agreement with the fund regarding the terms of the

management llc “rafferty” the funds’ sponsor due to the funds’ inability to attract sufficient investment assets rafferty believes the funds cannot continue to conduct their business and operations in an economically efficient manner as a result rafferty concluded that liquidating and closing the funds would be in the best interests of the funds and their shareholders shares of the funds will stop trading on the nyse arca inc and will no longer be open to purchase by investors after the close of regular trading on october   shareholders may sell their holdings in the funds prior to october   and those transactions may be subject to customary brokerage charges between october   and october   shareholders may only be able to sell their shares to certain brokerdealers and there is no assurance that there will be a market for the funds during that time period on or about october   the funds will liquidate their assets and distribute cash pro rata to shareholders who have not previously redeemed or exchanged their shares these payments are taxable and will include any accrued capital gains and dividends the funds’ net asset values will reflect the costs of closing the funds as calculated on the liquidation date the funds will close when the distributions are complete the process of closing down and liquidating the funds’ portfolios scheduled to take place between october   and october   will result in the funds not tracking their underlying indexes and experiencing an increase in cash holdings these developments may not be consistent with the funds’ investment
