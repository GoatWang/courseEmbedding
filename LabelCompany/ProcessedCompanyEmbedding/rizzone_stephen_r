critical milestone surrounded energous’ ability to engage with strategic partners as a licensing company engaging with strategic partners who build products for the consumer is absolutely essential to the adoption of our wattup technology our revenue trajectory and ultimately the overall success of the company we laid out what we considered would be a successful  in terms of strategic partnerships we thought we would first be able to first attract early adopters oems and odms from asia who build products and components for the major consumer facing companies and are looking to differentiate from one another we would then engage consumer facing companies directly finally in two to three years we would partner with silicon companies as they are typically slower to react and adopt as we have mentioned on prior calls silicon companies are the key to ubiquity as getting our technology into bluetooth and power management chips that are all already integrated in a number of consumer products it’s a broadest least expensive of way of integrating wattup into these front out coming our priority occurred at ces in january  and after gauging the interest level from the major players of that event our team knew we had something very special in terms of technology which was meeting a market opportunity with the major indiscernible from that point through to today we have been pleasantly surprised by going through our initial expectations and currently have more interest from companies who are interested in incorporating wattup into their products subassemblies silicon then we can support we have over  active partner engagements let me repeat that we have over  active partner engagement with the veritable who’s who in consumer product companies chip manufacturers oem and odm i would now like to turn the call over to george holmes who will provide you with details on the development of our wattup demand ecosystems and our progress on our joint development agreements as well as our progress on the regulatory front george george holmes thank you steve as steve mentioned we laid out our development plan in late  we begin by focusing our reference on smartphone accessories wearables and transmitters as it means of it to ensure the level discipline on our customer engagements we were focused on signing tier  players that we felt had a strategic significance because of their partners channels product focus and those were nimble fast moving early adopters as the right strategy our plan once the initial partners were secured in the technology and market model validated is to focus our efforts on the tier ones in each of these segments our plan for  was  to  jdas in total and segments identified additionally we felt the longterm validation and success of our model will be driven by our engagement with semiconductor companies we felt we should engage early but wouldn’t be interested in partnerships until they have seen market validation and volume growth for at least two years what we witnessed has been a strong market demand from all corners of the mobile and battery power devices market the demand has been impressive and even quite overwhelming when global  players are contacting you directly it confirms that you are doing the right things so let me give you an accounting of what we’ve done up until today in q we announced relationships with router manufacturers hanbit and pocons better manufacturer donghwa in q smartphone accessory engagements with anymode ipowerup and a large asian consumer electronics company wearables engagements with a niche wearables player semiconductor engagements with dialog and a large us power ic company in the battery segment with a company called highpower since october  or the beginning of q we’ve announced engagements with power router companies haier and sk telesys and we will soon be announcing relationship with a wearable company what the agreement signifies is not only we have been able to meet and truly exceed our original objects for strategic partnership engagements like greater than  we’ve also been able to secure relationships with key tier  consumer product companies and semiconductor companies while these agreements in and out of themselves are exciting we still have a very strong funnel and are currently engaged with a variety of different levels with greater than a  companies as steve just mentioned our challenge remains focused in prioritization but we also need to be intelligent and should we don’t miss the next big opportunity to keep our first mover advantage intact let me also give you a brief update on our regulatory progress in q we expanded our regulatory team to include hans mellberg hans joined us from bacl one of the major telecommunications certification bodies tcbs ph where he was the cto he was also responsible for their fcc tcb their it in canada their mic in japan and the ofk in hong kong as well as the ce european agency certifier hans is leading our regulatory team and is assisted by chris harvey one of the leading experts in the field of sec certification in q we conducted tests on our early prototypes which is designed to help us with our test development and planning which was very successful during the course of q we will be back in the labs to continue testing of our solution and expect to be able to obtain certification for our receivers perhaps as early as the end of this year we are very happy with our progress and through our engagements with the regulatory bodies to date we have received no showstoppers that would stand between and us and complete certification in  following the data would be helpful walk you through our case studies show you the steps involved in transition from a jda to a licensing agreement and then through commercialization this will give you an idea of the resources deliverables required from energous since our partners will take the commercialized and the associated timelines indiscernible component partner and even according to the product verticals they are going after the processes is as follows engagement technology validation reference designs evaluated prototypes build licensing agreements negotiated and finalized gotomarket strategies are validated with the channel products are built delivered into the channel and then they’re ready for customer purchase we do this with each customer for each product they intend to integrate with our technology most if not all customers will do this with many products and many skews i’d like to reiterate today we have  jda partners four are major global players now i’d like to turn call over to our interim cfo howard yeaton to provide some details on the financial results for the recently completed third quarter afterwards we’ll turn the call back over to steve for additional comments howard howard yeaton thank you george as you saw at the close of the market yesterday we issued a press release announcing our operating and financial results for the third quarter ended september   our net loss for the third quarter of  was  million and net loss for the nine months ended september   was  million the ninemonth loss included a  million charge for the change in the market value of derivative liabilities and a  million gain on debt extinguishment all related to our q and prior financing events adjusted ebitda was negative  million in the third quarter of  a negative  million in the nine months ended september   we believe adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results to provide some more detail on our expenses we spent  million and  million toward rd for the three and for the nine months ended september  our ga marketing expenses were  million or  million for the same three and ninemonth periods we have been expanding both our senior and development teams of engineers as we aggressively pursue our growth strategy in terms of cash flows during the nine months ended september   net cash used in operating activities was approximately  million net cash used in investing activities was  million and net cash provided by financing activities brought in  million turning to the balance sheet we ended september   with  million in cash and cash equivalent with no debt outstanding we tend to use our cash principally for research and development product certifications and sales and marketing efforts at the end of september  we moved into our new office and lab facility in san jose california as of end of the third quarter we had  employees and  consultants steve let me turn it back over to you now stephen r rizzone thank you howard let me provide you with some additional updates on the company we met our initial objectives for integrating our discrete components used in our second generation demonstration prototype transmitter and receiver into application specific integrated circuits otherwise none asics and we have either tapped out or we are above to tape out our second generation transmitter and receiver asics another major objective for the company was to sell prototypical consumer facing product at ces show in january we are on target to meet this objective i’d like to note that we will be holding an investor night at cef on january   from  to  pm at the hard rock hotel and casino in las vegas we will be featuring the product prototypes and offering the opportunities to meet with senior management this will be a great event we hope you’ll be able to take the time to join us to rsvp please contact our ir firm the mz group leading into ces  we will be focused not only on the execution required to demonstrate the wirefree home of the future at the hard rock in january but you also begin working our priority that will ensure a successful  and  which include commercialization of the current products and completing our regulatory requirements to ensure a successful launch of our reference design to our key partners and support of our yearend  objective to have consumer products in retail as we have often stated the core of our company is its ip and the continuing development of these assets we met our intellectual property objectives for the third quarter by adding  new filings to our previously announced  bringing the total portfolio to  patterns file in addition we have identified over  additional patterns that we plan to file at a rate of about  per month our objective of fillings over  patterns for the wattup technology remains on track we expect our first core patterns which were filed in  to be awarded in  while we admit our operational objectives we are facing a significant challenge and that the interest in the wattup technology has far exceeded our expectations this being the case given our current rate of growth and expense we are at a crossroad to the company we can maintain our current rate of development and strategic partner engagement which means we will have to pass on a number of potentially high profile opportunities we will likely lose a number of potential strategic partners to other wireless solutions or encourage other competitive developments to fill the void as we simply do not have enough resources to meet the demand for the technology or we can choose to accelerate the company to fully capitalize on our firsttomarket opportunity which means we would need to raise additional capital in the coming months to expand our development and support team as well as significantly expand and accelerate our asic integration roadmap after careful consideration of all the variables the board and the management team have decided that we want to take the second option we want to fully capitalize on our firsttomarket opportunity as a result we are considering our options and will likely look to raise additional capital through a registered public offering which will provide sufficient resources to accelerate the company while i’m not able to speak any further on the contemplated offering assuming we move forward along this path once the registration has been filed we will be able to provide all of the details i would also like to mention that management and the board are significant shareholders and as such we’re very careful we care very much about creating value across the enterprise one final comment on the competitive environment we’re well aware of a number of companies who are trying to catch up to energous and participate in the  watts or less power in distance markets you may have read some of the press surrounding recent capital raises for these companies during the past few weeks and months however we as well as our strategic partners believe that we have a significant firsttomarket advantage which we must fully capitalize on this is yet another justification for our decision to explore our options to raise additional capital to accelerate the company in summary we have done what we said we were going to do we are meeting our operational objectives while one of the biggest challenges we face is meeting the demand for our wattup technology we are in a competitive environment but we have a clear firsttomarket advantage which we want to fully capitalize on to do this and to significantly increase our ability to meet the demand for wattup we will likely be seeking to raise additional capital through a registered public offerings the details of which we will provide if and when they become available we remain committed to capitalize on this incredible opportunity and build a relevant predictable business of significance and we are genuinely excited about the future i will now turn the conference over to the operator for any questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you sir operator instructions and we will take our first question from brett conrad from longboard capital brett conrad – longboard capital good morning good morning george b holmes good morning stephen r rizzone hi brett brett conrad – longboard capital hi good morning george good morning steve question on the jdas your pipelines super impressive you got a  people i realize its lot of work congratulations on that your ability to scale seems pretty dependent upon your ability to find quality experienced engineers so i’d imagine your move to san jose is making that easier i’m just interested in how hard it is to find people to scale up and has that move helped things is the word out buzz in the valley that you guys are on to something so you got people contacting you or is that just so competitive there that it’s difficult to find anyone for any project stephen r rizzone well yes i think there are some significant factors that have positively impacted our ability to recruit what we want in terms of a world class team first we moved from what was considered a geographically undesirable place in pleasanton to the heart of the silicon valley we’re on north first street in tasman were right off the light rail and look to – we spend considerable time looking at the geographies of silicon valley and to commute ray – the commute route and a place the corporate headquarters strategically right in the center in a very very effective commute route surrounded by the types of engineers that we are looking to recruit i think second thing that’s positively impacted us is the hiring of our senior vice president of engineering cesar johnston cesar is a beacon he is well experienced in the valley he has great contacts and as a result in a very very short period of time he has been able to bring a number of what we consider to be worldclass people into the company we’ve literally doubled the size of our engineering team since we’ve been here we made four additional offers yesterday and so i think we’re gaining significant traction also the words kind of getting out above the opportunity it’s an exciting opportunity at a very very early stage and engineers that come on board with this now have the ability to really do leading edge work they also have the ability to come in early and contribute on a daily basis and make an impact and finally i think the other big advantage that we have is that while we are a small company we’re also a public company and since we are a public company the rsus that we provide as part of our equity package are liquid when they vest and so this is a very significant recruiting advantage and we found that the momentum has really started to shift in our favor we expect to be able to fill the necessary requisitions for our engineering teams as well as our support teams and our application engineering teams and so again while it was a bit of a slow start we’ve really gained momentum and are very very pleased with the progress that we’ve made and also believe that we have the ability to continue to hire the necessary resources as the requisitions become available brett conrad – longboard capital okay great and then just in terms of timing for actual product releases saying about  months from now given that where you guys are with the asics and the rate of development with these partners what’s your take on that is that still pretty much on schedule given that you will have regulatory clearance as well and is there any – in terms of regulatory clearance globally is there any – do you think there will be any issues in other countries or do you think once the sec files then the other countries are extremely easy after that and only be a few weeks or does that take months or years or just kind of give us a little bit of color on that stephen r rizzone let me – there are two questions there so let me answer the first on the products and then let me turn it over to george to speak to the regulatory issue on products our stated objective is to have consumer products available in the fourth quarter of next year and as i said earlier in the remarks i think we’re on target to do that and then we’ll see those products continue to ramp obviously in  but we want to get this our early products into the hands of the consumer as quickly as possible because as we said all along we believe that once the consumer sees this true wirefree solution and understands the utility of this solution that there is going to aggressively a demand adoption of the technology and again so our objective as i said is the fourth quarter of next year george do you want to touch on the regulatory piece george holmes yes let me do that so on the regulatory front well i mentioned earlier we have a great trajectory and meetings we’ve had with the fcc they’ve gone extremely well so not having any showstoppers from them just really puts us in the high reward category we believe so that really does bode well from a regulatory perspective here in the us but you mentioned overseas each country each market you go into has its own regulatory environment in most cases they heavily rely on the fcc and ul as underpinnings of their own internal specifications but they all have their own so it’s key that you have strategic partners in those markets so for example the announcement of the hire ph in china very very important they are very tightly coupled with the regulatory agencies in china and will basically be in charge driving that through the regulatory process with our support all of our partnerships in korea were clearly were to support us in that market as well sk telesys in particular is very tightly coupled to the regulatory body there and having companies that are in the telecom space that really understand that regulatory process is going to be key so each market has its own requirements the fcc and ul are big anchor points for that but we’ve basically chosen our strategic partners in those new markets we’re trying to address based on their ability to actually help with the certification process and then clearly we have worldwide partners so they can work that those issues in the markets that they’re trying to serve brett conrad – longboard capital okay great and just one… george holmes that helps brett conrad – longboard capital yes that helps a lot one quick last question are you getting interest from laptop and computer makers to embed the transmitters in laptops it seems to make sense to me just the way people are doing george holmes keep in mind there is two pieces of the puzzle here for us transmitters and receivers from a receiver perspective the amount of power we deliver is for devices less than  watts so a laptop is not a target from a receive perspective from a transmit perspective we have and we are working with companies that have expressed an interest in integrating the transmitter into the bezel of the monitor that would be colocated under desk for kind of your personal transmitter space we haven’t started talking about potentially putting it into a laptop for a portable transmitter from that standpoint it’s interesting an application just another example of more people you talk to the more interesting things you find out about but our partners today haven’t expressed in interest in that we’re really focused on the vessels of the monitors is the key placed deliver a portable i mean a personal transmitter in your office stephen r rizzone again our focus is  watts or less the market opportunity that we have with this focus is huge and difficult really to get our arms around and the computers of course are significantly greater in power the other key issue for us is portable versus mobile computer is portable it once you set it down you’ve typically don’t move it and our big advantage is with for mobility and so again the two elements of the market that that we work with and are really focusing on a  watts or less and mobility or the mobile markets brett conrad – longboard capital okay great okay thank you stephen r rizzone you’re welcome thanks for the question operator we go now to quinn goldman with park city capital quinn goldman – park city capital llc hi guys a couple of questions steve can you just talk a little bit about the capital rates and expectations for timing there stephen r rizzone i really can’t i’m precluded from speaking really in anymore details then we give out already the only thing we can do is talk about in all our plans and what we’re considering and any details will have to wait until the registration is filed i can tell you that if we do i like to do this is i said it will be a public offering and we will file a registration statement quinn goldman – park city capital llc okay but what about timing for filings stephen r rizzone i really again i’ve been very specific – i’ve been even very specific instructions and in terms of what i can say and until there is a filing if there is going to be one until there is one i cannot really make any comments that all about timing size anything along those lines quinn goldman – park city capital llc okay fair enough what’s the sound like you trying to be for active here and getting for in a competition so maybe can you just dive a deeper in terms of the opportunities that you see that additional cash can really help you attack stephen r rizzone well as we said we have – i’m sorry quinn goldman – park city capital llc i’ll just say the anything different along the lines what you guys are currently doing i mean what are the other kind of touch points you guys could see the need for this cash for stephen r rizzone well it’s an acceleration of what we’re doing now i mean we’re engaging with partners we have a process a very specific process that we go through the george alluded to that starts with the generation discussions moves to the gva – jda and then we go through the licensing and commercialization so we have a specific process and while there are some common elements especially at the beginning each one of these relationships has unique elements to it and so there are resource requirements from a development perspective there are resource requirements from a support perspective as well as the continued core development of the technology for the commercialization purposes and the regulatory efforts and so really it’s a matter of cycles it’s not so much a matter of invention it’s just purely a matter of how many cycles we have and right now we just do not have enough people and enough cycles to put on the opportunity the money that we’re talking about here would go to expanding our resources and accelerating our asic effort the asics of course are the key to the commercialization and so that’s where we would make the investments and so it’s an acceleration of what we’re doing now we can see as i said also the potential expansion into some new markets we’re very very focused on smartphones and tablets and accessories but the additional capital would also allow us to expand into toys and batteries and some other markets that we’re looking to get into and so it’s an investment strategy to fully capitalize on the opportunity and to maintain our position as a leader i mean the time to do this is now the time to accelerate is now the wirefree charging is getting a lot visibility you’re seeing more and more about it in the press it’s gaining some solid traction major companies are looking at this and so the time to be industry leader and to capitalize on our first market opportunity is now and that’s – again that’s the reasoning behind the intent to consider raising additional capital quinn goldman – park city capital llc okay steve i appreciate that color and maybe lastly would that accelerate revenue – a go forward revenue i know you’ve talked about or the guidance were the kind of backend of next fiscal year or next calendar year… stephen r rizzone no no it would not accelerate revenue it would expand our strategic relationship and accelerate commercialization for second and third generation integration that we’re looking to but it would not – the earliest that we will see revenues is some small amount of revenue at the end of the next year ramping significantly in  george holmes i’ve got another little bit of color here and the real thing from a customer acquisition perspective that is important we announced two weeks ago the relationship with haier wireless this is a great example of an opportunity that we don’t want to have to walk away from this is a company that came in at the end and has been pushing us very very hard to work with them and get engaged i mean we have – we’re  over quarter as it were based on our plan as it relates to customer engagements companies like haier create tremendous opportunity to create the ubiquity that steve has talked about in the past and there these tier  companies like that that we continue to be pursued by that we want to have the ability to execute and deliver on the solution that they are looking for because it will expand the footprint and that’s really what we are trying to do here stephen r rizzone keep in mind where we started from also when we went out on the ip roadshow – ipo roadshow in february and march we talked about standalone transmitters and connecting to battery backpack at the ces show in january you’re going to see transmitters now integrated into the vessel of a television standalone speakers speaker bars we are talking to haier about incorporating transmitters in refrigerators and so as you can see this is just kind of snowball in terms of our original thinking and the opportunity that’s been brought to bear here and so as i said it’s something that if we don’t capitalize on it given the momentum of the market somebody else may well do so and so we want to ensure that that doesn’t happen we want to maintain our position of market leadership and capitalize on these opportunities and establish a very very broadbased acceptance leading to our objective of ubiquitous solution quinn goldman – park city capital llc okay great thanks for the color guys operator we will take our next question from lou basanese with disruptive tech research lou basanese – disruptive tech research hi guys it’s a couple of quick questions you are talking about the reference design for ces can you just give as an idea of how many reference designs do you expect out of those  jdas to be at ces stephen r rizzone to be clear what we’re doing at ces these are validations of the technology with our strategic partners some of them are going to be bringing their own products mostly in the case area many of the companies are coming with industrial design to what future transmitters will look like most of them are using the platforms that we’ve worked on with them and we’re demonstrating that we’re building here for them to demonstrate and use internally so it’s a combination of those different aspects and as steve described we’ve been asked to build four major platforms and those are the ones that we’re focused on for ces and then a multitude of receiverbased technologies so four different manufactures of cases a couple of different manufacturers of wearables we’re doing as well as some other demonstration of wearable designs so it’s a combination of both but it’s lots of activity and a lot of what’s going to be happening here over the course of the next four to six weeks is the collaboration up to ces to make sure that we’ve got story lines and basically demonstrations for each of these companies what’s happening for most of them is they’re actually singing up to bring their customers to our suite over the hard rock so we’ve given time slots to each of our partners and allowing them to book demonstrations for their customers at our suite so they can see the full functionality because in any case even with a given oem or odm partner they have a single point solution what we’re demonstrating at ces is more of a wireless home so a fully integrated solution so that’s really where they want to bring their partners to and their customers to to see the demonstration george holmes one other quick point i’d like to make on that is not only are we going to be demonstrating the prototypical devices we’re going to be demonstrating a very very robust cloudbased software management system this is becoming more and more of a factor with our strategic partners the fact that we’ll have mobile apps available for demonstration purposes at the show to be able to download our interfaces that will be demonstrating a cloud an enterprise cloud capability and the ability to interface with thirdparty management and billing systems and so again not only will this be a demonstration of the prototypical devices themselves and also a significant demonstration of our whole software architecture and capability which is i think a very compelling element of our total package solution lou basanese – disruptive tech research yes so i just wanted a good range across the lot i appreciate that color one other quick question excuse me if i got the line item number wrong here but i think it was about  million in rd spending is the majority of that related to work on the reference to designs and more significantly is that spend being matched by your jda partners are you seeing them invest similar resources any color on that stephen rizzone the bulk of the investment is on our end now because we’re still developing the technology as this begins to rollout and move from the initial prototypical devices to commercialization the burden shifts to our strategic partner so the investments that we’ve made are in two categories one is in the core capability itself which of course is transferrable across the entire range of our opportunities and then the second category is for the prototypical devices themselves and as i said the majority of investment for these is on our end initially and then as we pass ces and move into the commercialization phases in  that burden rests with our strategic – the majority of that burden will then rest with our strategic partners lou basanese – disruptive tech research okay and then one last question we’ve got time probably for george on the regulatory front can you just give us some more color on what’s involved with part  i think there is just some questions about whether its sar ratings versus interference i know you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you’re very confident in complete certification but can you just give us some more color and why you are confident in relation to those george holmes yes it’s a couple of things and let’s say we’re not confuse that you have part  which is the interference back of part  which is a large part safety and then you have sar you also have cec testing so as we go through the process i think as we’ve stated in the past part  is very very predictable there is very welldefined spec we could actually go through and get ourselves certified to be a self certifier of that specification we’ll have what we believe kind of early indication maybe even approval on our receivers for part  this year from a sar testing perspective that’s kind of one of the anchor point for safety it’s the anchor point for cellphones and tablets and other transmitting electronic devices we’ve already done reference sample testing of sar working with the local labs we’ve got a great trajectory on that so when we look at the sar testing have a plan execute a plan we didn’t see anything that would show stoppers when we went through and did our initial testing that testing will take longer it is something that will take a little bit longer to complete and probably happen sometime in the first half of next year because we’ll be doing it with multiple devices and it has to be endtoend and then we’ll also be showing a variety of different applications that we have to get certified on part  it’s developing the use case and the test methodology for the entire endtoend system and so what we did and what you have to do is you clearly – the first thing you do is you can’t throw it over the valve about and just throw your request into the fcc smart money as you go meet them meet with the oet the office of engineering and technology you get all of their key thought leaders in the room which we did you explain to them what your technology is how you’re planning on testing it and what your methodology for testing is they either give a hey we’re really concerned or okay we understand we will like to see you take the next step and move this forward so that we can work with you we got the ladder we have a very collaborative working relationship with the oet i think that’s in large part to the team we have on board and so we’re going through the process i mean we have some work that we have to do as it relates to filing people work with them which we’re going to be doing over the course of the next couple of months once we do that we’ll be meeting with – the likelihood we’ll meet with all the commissioners at ces and give them a real live demonstration and then that will really be the kickoff to the deep intense work that we’ll be doing with them in the first and second quarter which will be to complete our test plan and then conduct testing and so it is a process first things first as you go sit down with them and make sure that there aren’t any gadgets which are really preexisting indications that they’ve made for other technologies and that they want to impose on your technology we got none of those when we met with them and now it’s just a matter of working through the process and we’re going to be publishing a paper on our roadmap for regulatory here in the coming weeks lou basanese – disruptive tech research okay great no i think that’s great i appreciate it stephen r rizzone yes no worries operator and we’ll take our next questions from daniel amir from ladenburg daniel amir – ladenburg yes thanks for taking my call so i had one question here with regarding to the regulatory with jvs that you’re signing how much of these companies have a certain knowledge of the process is this a major concern of theirs with regards to the fcc approval or they just have a high confidence level that this is already approved they’ve done the due diligence and they just think it’s a matter of time given that they’ve signed these agreements with you thanks stephen r rizzone no worries daniel so i mean fundamentally one of the first things we’ve do when we sit down with these jda partners is we talked about our regulatory plan all of these companies being consumer electronics companies themselves have gone through this process included with the big consumer electronics companies this is what they do every day because every product they put in the market as to go through fcc or ul certification and so it’s a process they want to make sure that we understood the process that we had a plan they want to make sure that there weren’t any holes in the plan and basically everybody we’ve met with up to this point has approved our process that we’re going through to they read that they have signed a jda with us so that’s one of the first things they look at it’s one of the first things that they asked us questions about and they know for well that once we get through our process and they integrated this technology into theirs’ they have to go through and capitalize on our approval to get their products approved so i think it’s a good leading economic indicator the fact we’ve have  companies four of which are global power balances ph that have looked at this technology understood our roadmap understood our regulatory plan and know that once we get through with that they are going to go through and do the exact same thing and they feel confident about it daniel amir – ladenburg okay great thanks thanks for the clarification there i appreciate it operator and we’ll take our next question from indiscernible emc unidentified analyst hello yes my quick question really is more around the installation of the product often seem that there is a few difference from competitors out there developing similar product such as indiscernible you all are aware of that i just want to know what are your differentiation strategies coming up and what would you plan to do if they are planning on releasing their product stephen r rizzone well hi clarins ph thanks for the question first and foremost i think we want to start off by saying we’re very excited that we’re seeing folks like coda and ubeam and others enter the uncoupled wireless power market because it’s for their validation that that is a segment that is really what consumers are looking for having the ability to move around and charge we do believe this going to be fundamental to getting real deep consumer adoption but i here’s the thing we had at this for about two years now we have a product that is very close to begin fully commercialized its small its compact it does what it’s targeted to do we look at that comparatively to our competitors specifically the two that you mentioned and they are great companies and they’ve got a opportunity ahead of them but they’ve got a long way to go to catch up to where we are i mean if you look at the transmitters that they demonstrate either on their youtube videos or in person they are much larger they are a long way from commercialization they’ve got some challenges ahead of them and just like every company they’ve got a lot of work to do to get from where they are to where they want to be i think for us we are very mindful of these companies we watch their behaviors in the marketplace most importantly we watch with our customers and to see if they are looking at those technologies and comparing us to those technologies and so far every jda that we’ve signed they’ve evaluated the other competitors both indiscernible and at this juncture the jdas have been signed with us we’ve got to do – as steve said we’ve got to do everything we can do to keep our first to market advantage and to keep pressing this technology forward aggressively and quickly because that was in the details and it’s not what you know it’s what you don’t know they get you and we’re always looking of our shoulder and making sure we understand what our competitors are doing but today i think we have a clear market advantage and from a technology implementation perspective i think we deliver on the promise of true mobility while charging better than anybody in this space at this point steve any comment matt hayden no i just think that this is again reaffirmation of the – our intents to accelerate the company we do have – and this doesn’t come from us this comes from our strategic partners and also from the potential strategic partners that we engage with it’s their job to understand the market to understand the status of technology and the space that we occupy and they’ve made it very clear to us that we are the only real technology that’s ready for prime time from a commercialization perspective we’re just an awful a lot of do from – moving from an experimental stage when you’re demonstrating a technology to positioning it from a integration and a cost and a testing and validation and replication perspective and commercializing it and so we understand full well firsthand all of the issues and problems associated with that and so our strategic partners and potential strategic partners have told us that we have the clear lead and this is something as i said that we really want to capitalize on we believe that a first move in market advance this year is very very significant to lay the groundwork for the ubiquitous solution that we want to move forward into a combination of a wifi router and power router in the not too distant future and again to work with silicon companies to provide the technology in the form of chips that are integrated in all sorts of devices so again a lots to do but we’ve got a clear advantage where we’re ahead in the marketplace and we intend to maintain that advantage does that answer your question unidentified analyst yes thank you very much i appreciate it operator we’ll go now to john shaw a private investor unidentified analyst good morning can you give me a little bit more detail to drill down on the partners roll and financing the development when you talked about burden shifting next year somewhere between january and full commercialization but what is that actually look like when does that actually start to begin and do your jda partners – is there any exclusivity provision in those agreements stephen r rizzone none of the agreements at this juncture have any exclusivity to them nor do they have any claims on the technology part of the reason we have chosen to fund the development of the technologies we complete the technologies we don’t want to have any overwriting – overbearing rights given to any of our partners so we are carrying the load on completing the development they are investing in their own products as they will integrate the technology into we have some partners that are further ahead in that and you’ll see them demonstrating either a proof of concepts or actual real product at ces we have some customers that are waiting on the demonstration at ces to make the full blown investment to move forward so there are different stages of the engagements but clearly if we look at the different partners that we have and the amount of funding that will be required for them to go develop products in and around our technology will be significant and we expect that to start in q and in q of next year unidentified analyst thank you operator and we’ll take our final question from indiscernible unidentified analyst hi guys how are you doing stephen r rizzone good unidentified analyst hello… stephen r rizzone yes we’re hearing go head unidentified analyst i want to go back to part  do you guys feel right now that your complaint with part  or that you’re going to be have to ask some sort modifications waver or something for part  stephen r rizzone no we do not expect to have that’s for waver on part  unidentified analyst i don’t mean to waver of the entire indiscernible but i mean some of sort of modification do you think your existing technology as you guys are developing it right now you think it meets all of the standards of part  stephen r rizzone there isn’t in all of the standards of part  part  is a very loosely defined set of standards so what you do when you go through and go to get certification under part  you can ask for a rule change which is a long run out process we don’t want to ask for a rule change and the commissioners that we met with at the oet don’t believe a rule change would be required they believe kdb would be required and that’s what they’ve asked us to participate in that’s the standard process by which you get approved under it part  is submitting a kdb which defines your use case defines how your products will be used and how you intend to deliver them to consumer and that’s what we’re working on right now in collaboration with the oet unidentified analyst okay great now i assume that before any product comes to market obviously you’d have to have all regulatory approvals and assuming the part  is not received until – i think you mentioned it could be as late as sort of the second half of next year is it reasonable to have products sort of ready for christmas the lead times and so forth if part  wasn’t received until sort of late in the quarter second quarter of next year george holmes well i can tell you that history is kind of on our side in that regard if you look at all of the major consumer electronics companies they tend to go back and forth with the oet up until the time of shipment and product hitting the shelves you’ll only have to have part  certification by the time the product is on the shelf we do believe we’ll have it sooner than that but keep in mind our job is to get our references certified and we intend to have that done in the first half of next year and when it comes to integration with our partners’ products they have tremendous amount of additional resources and they tend to have people onsite with these different regulatory agencies so their ability to get through the process is much faster than our ability to get through the process which is why in some cases we’re partnering with them to get the regulatory approvals in the different markets that we’re going after unidentified analyst okay great thank you gentlemen george holmes yes no worries operator and this concludes today’s questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to steve rizzone for any additional comments or closing remarks stephen r rizzone thank you very much for your attention today again as i said we believe that we have a tremendous opportunity here a significant firsttomarket advantage with a market that has a tremendous tamp to it and so we’re looking to capitalize on this market we thank you for your support we’ll continue to provide information as it becomes available in terms of our financing plans and again we look forward to reporting favorable results at the end of next quarter finally i hope that if it’s at all possible if you are it’s going to be attending ces that you’ll let us know we very much like as many of our investors as possible to see firsthand the home of the future so thank you very much we appreciate your attention and we’ll talk to you again soon operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today’s conference and we do thank you for your participation copyright
