senior official at swedish state railways the company was established along with andre o wallenberg johan w arnberg carl g cervin and fredrik didro in its inauguration phase atlas dealt with the manufacturing purchasing and selling of all types of material for railroad construction and operations after the hard hit of the recession in the s and the decline in railroad construction atlas diversified its undertakings and branched off into locomotives central heating and tool machinery in  atlas began developing their first air compressors and established itself as a compressor manufacturer as older production branches started phasing out atlas teamed up with diesel motors in  and the new company of atlas diesel emerged with two primary divisions diesel engines and compressor air products wartime developmentedit the atlas diesel merger experienced significant growth during the first world war and towards the end of the war export dominated –  of production the depression years caused significant losses for the company which led to several financial reconstructions in the s and s the economy began recovering demand started growing again in the mids and atlas diesel experienced a boom in sales where compressed air operations was the most expansive areathe second world war remained an active period for the firm and a time when strategic planning for development played a principal role manufacturing capabilities were embellished and the purchasing along with the acquisition of manufacturing subsidiaries in sweden and other countries was a key component to atlas diesels continued growth after wwii the swedish method was another war period strategy that strongly influenced the firms pneumatic program consisting of lightweight rock drills and drill bits with carbide tips in  the company terminated its diesel manufacturing and the name atlas diesel was no longer pertinent the name atlas copco became official in  and was inspired by the belgian subsidiary compagnie pneumatique postwar international expansionedit the swedish method that was founded during the war period laid the foundation for the international expansion atlas copco engaged in starting in the s the purchasing of the belgian compressor company arpic engineering in  was the firms first major international acquisition eventually arpics plants carried out a majority of atlas copcos compressor production in  another important acquisition was made with the purchasing of craelius in the s international expansion accelerated dramatically due to various structural reforms and efficiency measures brought on by weakened economic conditions and increased production costs these conditions meant that atlas copco had to accelerate and brake simultaneously in order to keep profitability up a number of strategic acquisitions were therefore made including the french compressor manufacturer mauguière in order to strengthen their position in the united states several strategic acquisitions were made in the airpower business including the key purchase of worthington compressors in the early s atlas copco was the world leader in rock drilling and pneumatics seeing the potential in industrial tools they purchased chicago pneumatic tools in  which opened up the important american french and british markets atlas copco then became one of the worlds largest manufacturers of pneumatic tools and monitoring systems at the end of the s the companys geographical foothold grew and assortments expanded due to several acquisitions including the french company ets georges renault that manufactured pneumatic power tools the british company desoutter brothers plc that supplied industrial tools and monitoring systems was purchased in  in  aeg elektrowerkzeuge was purchased and in  milwaukee electric tool was acquired which further strengthened the companys reach in  atlas copco made its biggest and most important acquisition with the purchasing of the

founded by edvard fränckel who was a swedish industrialist politician and senior official at swedish state railways the company was established along with andre o wallenberg johan w arnberg carl g cervin and fredrik didro in its inauguration phase atlas dealt with the manufacturing purchasing and selling of all types of material for railroad construction and operations after the hard hit of the recession in the s and the decline in railroad construction atlas diversified its undertakings and branched off into locomotives central heating and tool machinery in  atlas began developing their first air compressors and established itself as a compressor manufacturer as older production branches started phasing out atlas teamed up with diesel motors in  and the new company of atlas diesel emerged with two primary divisions diesel engines and compressor air products wartime developmentedit the atlas diesel merger experienced significant growth during the first world war and towards the end of the war export dominated –  of production the depression years caused significant losses for the company which led to several financial reconstructions in the s and s the economy began recovering demand started growing again in the mids and atlas diesel experienced a boom in sales where compressed air operations was the most expansive areathe second world war remained an active period for the firm and a time when strategic planning for development played a principal role manufacturing capabilities were embellished and the purchasing along with the acquisition of manufacturing subsidiaries in sweden and other countries was a key component to atlas diesels continued growth after wwii the swedish method was another war period strategy that strongly influenced the firms pneumatic program consisting of lightweight rock drills and drill bits with carbide tips in  the company terminated its diesel manufacturing and the name atlas diesel was no longer pertinent the name atlas copco became official in  and was inspired by the belgian subsidiary compagnie pneumatique postwar international expansionedit the swedish method that was founded during the war period laid the foundation for the international expansion atlas copco engaged in starting in the s the purchasing of the belgian compressor company arpic engineering in  was the firms first major international acquisition eventually arpics plants carried out a majority of atlas copcos compressor production in  another important acquisition was made with the purchasing of craelius in the s international expansion accelerated dramatically due to various structural reforms and efficiency measures brought on by weakened economic conditions and increased production costs these conditions meant that atlas copco had to accelerate and brake simultaneously in order to keep profitability up a number of strategic acquisitions were therefore made including the french compressor manufacturer mauguière in order to strengthen their position in the united states several strategic acquisitions were made in the airpower business including the key purchase of worthington compressors in the early s atlas copco was the world leader in rock drilling and pneumatics seeing the potential in industrial tools they purchased chicago pneumatic tools in  which opened up the important american french and british markets atlas copco then became one of the worlds largest manufacturers of pneumatic tools and monitoring systems at the end of the s the companys geographical foothold grew and assortments expanded due to several acquisitions including the french company ets georges renault that manufactured pneumatic power tools the british company desoutter brothers plc that supplied industrial tools and monitoring systems was purchased in  in  aeg elektrowerkzeuge was purchased and in  milwaukee electric tool was acquired which further strengthened the companys reach in  atlas copco made its biggest and most important acquisition with the purchasing of the prime service corporation which was the largest machine leasing company in the united states the north american rental

recession in the s and the decline in railroad construction atlas diversified its undertakings and branched off into locomotives central heating and tool machinery in  atlas began developing their first air compressors and established itself as a compressor manufacturer as older production branches started phasing out atlas teamed up with diesel motors in  and the new company of atlas diesel
