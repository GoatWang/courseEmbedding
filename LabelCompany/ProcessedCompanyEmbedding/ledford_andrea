international human resources compensation and benefits and leadership development with storage technology united international holdings and synergen ledford holds an executive mba from insead university in fontainebleau france and a bachelor’s degree in accounting from the university of colorado company briefheadquartered in duluth georgia ncr corporation wwwncrcom is a global technology company leading in how the world connects interacts and transacts with business ncr’s assisted and selfservice solutions and comprehensive support services address the needs of retail financial travel health care hospitality entertainment gaming public sector telecom carrier and equipment organizations in more than  countries how has the hr role evolved and how do you define the role the hr role has evolved  percent there are some companies that might still do old world hr i’m lucky to be working with bill nuti chairman ceo and president and his leadership team in that i’m working with people who value hr and understand the value of the hr organization as it relates to the business strategy the hr organization is truly in partnership with the business to achieve its strategic initiatives and it has a more important role than just traditional hiring and payroll that were the focus of the old world of hr in hr now it’s hiring training and developing and it’s retaining rewarding and recognizing people through their entire career as the world becomes smaller and businesses and technology are more competitive the role of hr is to develop the workforce plan and strategy defining where you want to be and what competencies and skills you need to have to be more competitive in the future your company cannot remain stagnant or you will lose to the competition as you vie for talent also learning has evolved it is critical to teach people how to use new technologies in order to remain competitive helping them stay uptodate on the products and the tools and how to market them to the right customers it isn’t just classroom training it’s using the technology and ncr’s selfservice methodology that provide videos on your phone or a resource on your ipad so our employees can work on training daytoday as your workforce evolves you end up with people that are longer tenured as well as a new generation coming onboard people’s requirements in terms of benefits and compensation vary globally as different people and cultures have different priorities so it requires designing programs that are going to retain and motivate people in their work is it tough to put metrics in place to make sure you’re having the right impact employee engagement is a key metric there are many studies that have shown that improved employee engagement improves the bottom line i’ve always frowned upon employees who focus only on what the company can do for them i take the employee metrics from the engagement survey and try to turn it back to the employees i go over the results and then ask them for their ideas about what they can do to improve their role and surroundings we support their initiatives within reason but i want that engagement to come from within the organization it emphasizes that we’re listening to them but we are also looking to them for where we need to focus next while reminding individuals that they have the power to change – just as leadership has the power to support that change with such a broad global focus how have you put the communication mechanism in place to keep the messaging consistent for the whole company it’s important that we communicate constantly to the level of what we call mindnumbing consistency you can never communicate enough and you want everyone to feel comfortable communicating the same message we’re continually addressing the need to give our managers the confidence that wherever they’re located they can spread the corporate message and address issues talk about challenges and tie the strategy of the company to their specific region and to the specific individual that may be repairing an atm for instance are we going to see a different type of workforce in the future we need workers who are starting to think differently and driving disruptive innovation across all industries for example it is important for any company to assemble a great team of skilled engineers who are thinking innovatively about how to make that next product or how to use more cost effective resources our challenge as a company is to always be more productive we’re challenging our people to make our products less expensively and more efficiently but still with high quality to do that you have to have an innovative workforce that includes top engineering talent how critical is diversity and inclusiveness within ncr’s culture and how do you define those two inclusion is a better word than diversity we’re in  countries and with our partners we’re in  countries – and we have  employees so when i hear about diversity particularly as it pertains to us companies they always focus on race and gender but diversity can be so much broader than that be it age religion culture or being physically challenged inclusion is something we’re looking at broadly in terms of how to provide for people are young people today interested in working for companies that have a strong focus on corporate responsibility we have to market and rebrand ourselves as a company around our innovation and where we’re going the current generation is looking for innovative and exciting jobs but they also evaluate your culture in terms of your global social responsibility for instance they like to see companies operating in a green environment which we’re doing in our columbus georgia manufacturing plant it is the only leed and greencertified retrofitted building in the us employees are also looking at what companies are doing for others and so they pay attention to things like what we’re doing through our ncr foundation with microbanking for women in india and our red cross disaster relief employee matching grant• click here to download a pdf of an interview with andrea

company leading in how the world connects interacts and transacts with business ncr’s assisted and selfservice solutions and comprehensive support services address the needs of retail financial travel health care hospitality entertainment gaming public sector telecom carrier and equipment organizations in more than  countries how has the hr role evolved and how do you define the role the hr role has evolved  percent there are some companies that might still do old world hr i’m lucky to be working with bill nuti chairman ceo and president and his leadership team in that i’m working with people who value hr and understand the value of the hr organization as it relates to the business strategy the hr organization is truly in partnership with the business to achieve its strategic initiatives and it has a more important role than just traditional hiring and payroll that were the focus of the old world of hr in hr now it’s hiring training and developing and it’s retaining rewarding and recognizing people through their entire career as the world becomes smaller and businesses and technology are more competitive the role of hr is to develop the workforce plan and strategy defining where you want to be and what competencies and skills you need to have to be more competitive in the future your company cannot remain stagnant or you will lose to the competition as you vie for talent also learning has evolved it is critical to teach people how to use new technologies in order to remain competitive helping them stay uptodate on the products and the tools and how to market them to the right customers it isn’t just classroom training it’s using the technology and ncr’s selfservice methodology that provide videos on your phone or a resource on your ipad so our employees can work on training daytoday as your workforce evolves you end up with people that are longer tenured as well as a new generation coming onboard people’s requirements in terms of benefits and compensation vary globally as different people and cultures have different priorities so it requires designing programs that are going to retain and motivate people in their work is it tough to put metrics in place to make sure you’re having the right impact employee engagement is a key metric there are many studies that have shown that improved employee engagement improves the bottom line i’ve always frowned upon employees who focus only on what the company can do for them i take the employee metrics from the engagement survey and try to turn it back to the employees i go over the results and then ask them for their ideas about what they can do to improve their role and surroundings we support their initiatives within reason but i want that engagement to come from within the organization it emphasizes that we’re listening to them but we are also looking to them for where we need to focus next while reminding individuals that they have the power to change – just as leadership has the power to support that change with such a broad global focus how have you put the communication mechanism in place to keep the messaging consistent for the whole company it’s important that we communicate constantly to the level of what we call mindnumbing consistency you can never communicate enough and you want everyone to feel comfortable communicating the same message we’re continually addressing the need to give our managers the confidence that wherever they’re located they can spread the corporate message and address issues talk about challenges and tie the strategy of the company to their specific region and to the specific individual that may be repairing an atm for instance are we going to see a different type of workforce in the future we need workers who are starting to think differently and driving disruptive innovation across all industries for example it is important for any company to assemble a great team of skilled engineers who are thinking innovatively about how to make that next product or how to use more cost effective resources our challenge as a company is to always be more productive we’re challenging our people to make our products less expensively and more efficiently but still with high quality to do that you have to have an innovative workforce that includes top engineering talent how critical is diversity and inclusiveness within ncr’s culture and how do you define those two inclusion is a better word than diversity we’re in  countries and with our partners we’re in  countries – and we have  employees so when i hear about diversity particularly as it pertains to us companies they always focus on race and gender but diversity can be so much broader than that be it age religion culture or being physically challenged inclusion is something we’re looking at broadly in terms of how to provide for people are young people today interested in working for companies that have a strong focus on corporate responsibility we have to market and rebrand ourselves as a company around our innovation and where we’re going the current generation is looking for innovative and exciting jobs but they also evaluate your culture in terms of your global social responsibility for instance they like to see companies operating in a green environment which we’re doing in our columbus georgia manufacturing plant it is the only leed and greencertified retrofitted building in the us employees are also looking at what companies are doing for others and so they pay attention to things like what we’re doing through our ncr foundation with microbanking for women in india and our red cross disaster relief employee matching grant• click here to download a pdf of an interview with andrea
