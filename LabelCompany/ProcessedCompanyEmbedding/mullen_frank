about much more than just payroll in fact it’s actually a company that’s about building a better happier and more efficient workplace and adp does this because it understands every company’s greatest asset its people this reality led to the new tag line “a more human resource” along with a  launch web video that celebrates the human element in the workplace as told through the eyes of a young

playing field — in your favor small batch x small batch small batch beer company had a vision to brew unique and creative beers using only a onebarrel system since small batch beers are brewed only  gallons at a time they sell out fast so we developed a website that would in real time display exactly how much of each specialty beer was on tap csx the intermodals x csx the intermodals csx’s intermodal business unit has become an increasingly important part of driving csx sales and profit we were tasked with creating social content that educated key logistics industry influencers and

intermodal shipping facility the stories were human funny and insightful nc education lottery x nc education lottery the north carolina education lottery recently introduced ultimate millions a

engaging activation to date with their secondlargest selling season right around the corner the time felt right to engage with an already active social following we kicked the campaign off with a video that asked civilians on the street “when was the last time you told your mom she was beautiful” that simple question led to a much larger conversation in the social space around mybeautifulmom inviting viewers to finally tell their mom she was beautiful food lion best day ever x food lion best day ever food lion is a grocery store chain in the mid and south atlantic states with a history of being an integral part of people’s lives in an effort to create a more emotional connection with shoppers we wanted to portray how food lion makes life better beyond helping you save money on

problems are people problems x pep boys car problems are people problems due to years of heavy promotional support pep boys stood for nothing more than a discount so we wanted to reestablish why an authentic brand like pep boys exists — to make sure car owners lives run as smoothly as humanly possible to shed light on this in an unexpected and memorable way we showed people in everyday situations whose appearance and actions mirror the way their failing vehicles act we then demonstrated how pep boys gets these people and their vehicles back to functioning normally after all car problems don’t just affect your vehicle — they affect your life american signature lebron james x american signature lebron james lebron james is known the world over for his unearthly basketball skills when presented with creating a line of children’s furniture from american signature it was an opportunity for mullenlowe to expand lebron’s brand beyond athletics combining research and parental intuition we determined that there is one room in the house where a child calls all the shots — his bedroom and lebron james regardless of his superstar status will have to earn his way into
