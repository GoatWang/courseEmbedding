and chief executive officer said “we continue to leverage our expertise in human genetics and ion channel targets to advance our neurologyfocused product candidates and identify potential new therapeutic assets in addition to our two partnered programs in pain and our proprietary xen epilepsy program we recently expanded our ion channel neurologyfocused pipeline to include xen a kv potassium channel opener for the treatment of epilepsy”   dr pimstone added “we are positioned to see a number of key events in the coming months including topline data expected midyear from the phase b clinical trial of tv in postherpetic neuralgia being conducted by our collaborator teva we anticipate genentech will advance gdc into a phase  clinical trial this year within our proprietary programs we anticipate that xen will be in a phase  clinical trial in the fourth quarter of  in addition we look forward to filing an ind or ind equivalent application for xen in the fourth quarter of this year”   achievements and anticipated milestones   proprietary pipeline     • xen is a nextgeneration kv potassium channel opener for the treatment of epilepsy preclinically xen has demonstrated improved pharmacokinetics selectivity potency and efficacy over firstgeneration potassium channel modulators such as ezogabine xenon anticipates filing an investigational new drug ind or ind equivalent application to initiate a phase  firstinman clinical trial in the fourth quarter of      • xen is a potent selective nav sodium channel inhibitor for the treatment of rare infantile epileptic encephalopathies and other forms of epilepsy xen has demonstrated efficacy against seizures in an animal model of nav gainoffunction scna epilepsy as well as models that support the treatment of adult partial onset epilepsy xenon expects to file an ind or ind equivalent application in the fourth quarter of    partnered programs     • tv is a topical sodium channel inhibitor being developed in collaboration with xenon’s partner teva pharmaceutical industries ltd for the treatment of neuropathic pain teva is currently conducting a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled phase b clinical trial of tv in patients with postherpetic neuralgia enrollment is complete with topline results expected in mid   • xenons collaborator genentech a member of the roche group has completed a phase  clinical trial for gdc which is an oral selective nav smallmolecule inhibitor pending a full assessment of the phase  clinical results and ongoing in vivo studies genentech anticipates initiating a phase  clinical trial in  for the potential treatment of pain       first quarter  financial results   cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of march   were  million compared to  million as of december   there were  common shares outstanding as of march     for the quarter ended march   xenon reported total revenue of  million compared to  million for the same period in  the decrease of  million was primarily attributable to revenue recognized related to the upfront payment from the march  genetics collaborative agreement with genentech which was fully recognized by march  the remaining decrease was due to less full time equivalent funding from collaborative partners as resources were shifted from supporting collaborations to xenon’s proprietary programs   research and development expenses for the quarter ended march   were  million compared to  million for the same period in  the increase of  million was primarily attributable to increased spending on xen and xen product candidates as well as internal preclinical and discovery programs partially offset by a decrease in collaboration expenses   general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended march   were  million compared to  million for the same period in  the increase of  million was primarily attributable to increased costs for business development and salaries and benefits partially offset by the fair value adjustment on liability classified stock options   other income for the quarter ended march   was  million compared to  million for the same period in  the decrease of  million was primarily driven by a decrease in unrealized foreign exchange gains arising from the translation of canadian denominated balances to us dollars   net loss for the quarter ended march   was  million compared to  million for the same period in  the change was primarily attributable to lower revenue higher research and development and general and administrative expenses and lower unrealized foreign exchange gains   conference call information   xenon will host a conference call and live audio webcast today at  pm eastern time  pm pacific time to discuss its first
