im also joined by other members of qorvos management team and with that ill hand the call over to bob robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director thanks doug good afternoon everyone and welcome to qorvos fiscal  first quarter earnings call revenue for the june quarter increased  yearoveryear and  sequentially to approximately  million revenue was above our quarterly guidance provided may  reflecting strength in mobile in china a large customer smartphone ramp and growth in idps broad markets during the quarter we saw customer demand coming strong than expected well within lead times and we worked hard to keep up with the demand our customers called on us and the qorvo delivered gross margin was  reflecting lowband pad business exceeding expectations with higher than expected costs also lesser than impact but in the mix early yields on high volume quadplexers for china were below plan in both examples these were high volume products operating margin was  and operating expenses were approximately  million the sequential increase in opex reflected higher rd expense increased variable compensation expense and the addition of greenpeak technologies the companys higher rd expense reflects increased investment in the designers of highperformance filters saw and baw process engineers and associated material costs for prototypes during the june quarter we completed our  million asr retiring an additional  shares qorvos june financial performance and september guidance provide context for two major initiatives underway one leveraging our baw filter assets and two establishing filter independence we expect these initiatives to support margin expansion early next year as new customer programs ramp qorvo today is number one or number two in the majority of our growth markets and we are investing to extend our leadership were building a technology moat to maintain leadership where were number one and where were number two were investing to advance from a challenger to the leader how will we do this first we will leverage our baw filters the vast majority of our customers from newcomers to market leaders are requesting more highly integrated solutions with even greater capabilities including receive diversity modules with integrated lnas rf flex modules with quadplexers rf fusion modules with hexaplexers wifi fems with baw filters and multichip modules to support massive mimo an increasing number of these solutions contain baw filters and baw filters rank first among our growth drivers baw filters will also deliver the highest incremental margin for qorvo and baw filters are a primary driver of our longterm operating model to keep pace with customer demand were staffing up our engineering teams to complete the up fit of our richardson fab from inch to inch were also bringing up an inch line in a recently acquired fab in farmers branch texas today our baw filter utilization is below optimal but we expect that to reverse as new programs ramp next year demand for our first quadplexers has been robust and we continue to enjoy large customer interest in our bawbased hexaplexer prototypes more importantly we have delivered hexaplexer solutions utilizing our recently released nextgeneration baw process and customer feedback indicates we are very competitive for the premium tier we are integrating bawbased hexaplexers into rf fusion and in the performance tier we are integrating bawbased quadplexers second we will achieve filter independence we believe qorvos growth will rely increasingly on filters and filterbased products and we are adding high performance filter designers and saw and baw process engineers to insource all filters to improve our cost accelerate time to market and deliver higher value solutions today our largest revenue product which is growing significantly this quarter contains thirdparty saw filters by comparison our rf flex modules next year will integrate high performance and lower cost internallysourced qorvo filters for the first time this will significantly enhance our product margins while creating a new competitive barrier to entry to ensure we achieve filter independence we are increasing from inch to inch baw in richardson and were increasing from inch to inch saw in tempcomp saw in florida in greensboro were converting our inch gas capacity to tempcomp saw and adding a new power metal process for saw which is another qorvo first of note qorvos power metal process for saw is the final process needed in our toolbox if you will clearing the path for us to achieve filter independence were also moving our gas capacity from north carolina to our oregon fab and transitioning our north carolina gan products to texas in china were bringing up our second packaged assembly and test facility even as these efforts add to cogs and rd today we expect them contributing to revenue and margin expansion related to large customer opportunities slated for  and  looking at our june quarterly performance by segment mobile products revenue was approximately flat yearoveryear and increased  sequentially to  million qorvo helped launch a number of premium and performance tier smartphones and we benefited in china from a strong market and the migration from threemode to fullmode smartphones for domestic and export markets we saw strong demand for our recently launched quadplexers and for our secondgeneration rf flex modules which launched last year in wifi for handsets we enjoyed  growth sequentially as we ramped our highly integrated rf fusion for mobile wifi outside of handsets mobile products grew  versus last quarter across all of mobile products customer order activity strengthened throughout the june quarter with many orders placed well within lead times through the month of july order activity in mobile remained very strong its clear to us the demand for broadband data continues to increase with the effect amplified for rf suppliers as content per device experience we believe the expanding market requirements for carrier aggregation and g among others will favor our unique competitive strengths and we expect this to support strong longerterm dynamics and improving visibility into our growth drivers only qorvo delivers a comprehensive portfolio of filters switches amplifiers pmics lnas and tuners with the scale integration capabilities and system level expertise to supply an expanding variety of highly integrated solutions in idp revenue grew  yearoveryear and  sequentially to  million we are very pleased with the performance of idp particularly the revenue and margin performance the addition of a great franchise in greenpeak technologies and the achievement of another strong design win quarter greenpeak is growing at a rapid clip and we expect this acquisition to be accretive by the end of the year idp continues to reposition their product portfolio to support high growth markets and today they are highly diversified business in a  billion serviceable market idp currently forecasts the markets they serve will grow at a compound annual rate of  which nearly doubles their market by  to  billion in our infrastructure unit we continue to see a stabilization in the china base station market and strong customer activity especially in gan we enjoyed robust demand for our  gigahertz gan pas during the quarter and we supplied duplexers lnas and pas for small cell solutions at multiple base station oem customers on the design front our gan pas were selected by a major infrastructure provider for a massive mimo active antenna system two global wireless infrastructure manufacturers selected our  gigahertz g base station gan pas and a major infrastructure provider selected our  gigahertz pa lna and switch for preg mimo deployment in connectivity we saw strong momentum in cpe wifi particularly gigahertz and we layered in greenpeak technologies during the quarter greenpeak is a recognized industry leader in ultra lowpower shortrange rf communication and they expand our customer offering very nicely to include highly integrated rf systems on a chip for the connected home and internet of things the markets we are targeting are growing faster than  in transport we began the production ramp of a quad linear g optical driver for a tier  telecom equipment provider we also reached record revenue levels for our catv hybrid products driven by the industry leaders both support the buildout of infrastructure to keep pace with the ever increasing demand for data in defense our business is up  yearoveryear most of this growth has been driven by domestic active electronically scanned array radar programs and the proliferation of gallium nitride especially for international markets in the defense market alone we anticipate greater than  million of potential opportunities for qorvos gan products so from a high level whether youre looking at idp or mobile products qorvo is delivering breakthrough rf solutions that accelerate the delivery of broadband data and create value for our customers and our customers customers in idp were introducing breakthrough products using highly differentiated internally developed technologies that enable our customers to introduce products at record speed and with higher levels of functionality in mobile were leveraging the industrys most complete product and technology portfolio with our broad scale integration capabilities and system level expertise to offer highperformance rf solutions with unprecedented levels of integration in summary qorvo saw customer order activity accelerate as the june quarter progressed and the entire qorvo team ran hard to satisfy that demand in the september quarter we continue to see strong demand and support of this years most popular devices and were rapidly expanding our capabilities to develop new highly integrated solutions for large customer opportunities launching in  and  with that ill turn the call over to mark mark j murphy  chief financial officer thanks bob qorvos nongaap revenue increased  sequentially for the june quarter to  million mobile products revenue increased  sequentially to  million and infrastructure and defense products increased  sequentially to  million qorvo had three  customers the largest at approximately  of revenue representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer our other  customers during the quarter were huawei and samsung gross margin was  impacted by lowband pad business exceeding expectations with higher than expected costs upon transition to more integrated modules with qorvoproduced filters and completion of our fab conversions we expect gross margin to expand operating expenses increased to  million on higher rd expenses to support ongoing development programs in premium filters higher variable compensation expense and the addition of our greenpeak acquisition in the september quarter we expect to achieve our opex goal of approximately  of sales and we expect to sustain that performance through the december quarter operating income for the june quarter was  million or  of revenue net income was  million and earnings per share was  turning to the balance sheet total cash and short term investments was  million cash flow from operations was  million reflecting the working capital build associated with higher first quarter sales and our september quarter outlook capital expenditures increased to  million primarily to address growing premium filter demand during the june quarter we completed our  million asr retiring an additional  shares  million remains available under the  billion program authorized last november we continue to make progress on opportunities to improve our growth and profitability in the quarter we acquired greenpeak a producer of lowpower rf devices expanded our capabilities to serve iot markets our baw products are closing in on stateoftheart performance and were on a measured pace to add capacity needed to meet expected customer demand for premium filters as bob mentioned a large number of productivity projects are underway including conversion to inch baw wafers in our texas fab and inch saw on our florida fab conversion of our north carolina fab to tcsaw and saw consolidation of our gas capacity in oregon migration of gan from north carolina to texas an additional mobile products assembling and test capacity in china we expect these new product capabilities capacity additions and productivity initiatives to help us sustain above market growth and drive margin expansion now lets turn to our business outlook qorvo currently believes customer demand supports the following nongaap expectations for the september quarter quarterly revenue between  million and  million gross margin of approximately  diluted eps between  and  a tax rate of approximately  our september quarter guidance reflects strong broadbased demand we expect gross margins to remain near the second quarter level through the year on lowband product mix and while our fab conversions are underway we expect opex to trend down through the back half of the year we project capex to remain elevated as we align capacity additions with stronger customer demand for premium filters and our integrated modules with that well open up the call to your questions questionandanswer session operator well take our first question from harsh kumar with stephens please go ahead harsh v kumar  stephens inc yeah hey first of all let me ask for clarification on the september guide should we think that most of your growth is coming again from mobile like almost all of it in the september guide robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director harsh thats correct most of the growth we are seeing is in mobile there will be some growth in idp but i think most of the growth is coming from mobile harsh v kumar  stephens inc okay so you are expecting idp to grow as well a little bit robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director yes harsh v kumar  stephens inc okay thank you and then i wanted to ask about gross margins weve already started to get questions on that quite a bit so i think the as people say in this business the high watermark was somewhere around   bob were at  now and youve got a bunch of initiatives going and i think you mentioned in your script that it will start the reverse and go up next year will you be going up from a base of   where you are at or are you thinking you can possibly start to climb up from the s and then move up from there robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director yeah harsh thanks for the question i just want to clarify weve got a lot of initiatives and we are working on them we have a one product if you will problem today that weve got to reverse and well continue to work hard to drive that and it all comes down to how much of that product we sell can influence the gross margin percentage as you can well imagine so its got a lot of content that is not internally in our fabs we dont see the benefits of it from a contribution margin so that does play into it when we have our analyst day well outline and quantify a lot of those activities to help you model next year where we can get to on the gross margin operator and well go next to vivek arya with bank of america please go ahead vivek arya  bank of america merrill lynch thank you for taking my question so bob maybe just to follow up on that gross margin i just want to clarify the lower gross margins that you are seeing is just because you are outsourcing a certain component so this is really a nearterm company specific issue that can be corrected this is not the sign of some industrywide pricing dynamic right i just want to get that clarified explicitly robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director sure sure vivek so let me start with idp is doing very well their margins held in there no problem there the majority of erics business did very well youre right we have one product i will be candid with you its also not yielding fantastic but for the most part youre correct it is a product related not an industry structure issue i would agree with your assessment vivek vivek arya  bank of america merrill lynch okay very good and then as my follow up when i look at the september quarter outlook i sort of fell out of my chair when i saw the upside versus some of the street expectations but im curious is there a pull forward of demand just because we are reminded of last year when the industry went through a lot of turbulence so youre nearly  million above street expectations first how much is greenpeak out of that and then do you think there is any pull forward of demand and the last part of that is how to think about december quarter season now given that youre having such a strong september quarter robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director yeah number one greenpeaks in that  million  million a quarter so thats not driving all the growth like we said most of the growth is coming out of erics business i dont think were seeing the pull forward weve talked a lot about that we still have a lot of demand that were running hard to keep up with given the guide we even gave as far as december goes let me put it another way vivek i think the growth that were seeing this quarter as well as into december will be how well marquee phones sell i think our own view is china were tempering our outlook for the second half of the calendar year so as we look into december depends on to your question how much of the demand is pulled in that we might be able to capture because were all out right now we ran very hard in the june quarter were running pretty hard still staying through this quarter so as we look at things today were not seeing a pull forward and as we look at our customer forecast and our own expectations for in particular china market we could see december up operator thank you were going next to ambrish srivastava with bmo capital markets kulin patel  bmo capital markets united states hi thanks for taking my question this is kulin patel for ambrish my first question is on the increasing rd spending particularly for filter designers what drove the increase in opex for rd given that you already have what seems like a mature baw and saw product robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director eric do you want to take what drives filter designer and steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products yeah we have talked many times about that portfolio shifting towards more filter based products and we do continue to see that trend and in fact if anything accelerating through all tiers of the market now customers asking us to integrate at a higher level and include more filters and bob mentioned our drive towards filter independence and making sure that we have the ability to design and manufacture at least the lions share if not all of those filters internally so that includes regular saw as well as tcsaw and baw and so we will continue to need more rd bandwidth to develop the processes but then also to develop the products and integrate them into our portfolio kulin patel  bmo capital markets united states right thanks and for my followup how much growth do you see for china for your mobile business in the quarter steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products in the june quarter it was pretty strong and in the september quarter we see it continuing as of now the market is quite healthy and we are returning back to our kind of normal share that we should have been at earlier in the year already so were kind of seeing that compound effect probably and then added to the fact that the dollar content overall continues to grow as we see more and more fivemode and sixmode g phones being shipped into the market operator thank you well go next to cody acree with drexel hamilton please go ahead cody acree  drexel hamilton llc thanks guys for taking my questions and congrats on the progress maybe mark if you could give a little bit of stratification on some of those initiatives the gross margin drivers that you guys have layered initiatives in in the past and been able to make pretty significant and sometimes rapid progress especially when it came to yield so i guess can you just maybe talk about the timing of some of those major buckets of initiatives mark j murphy  chief financial officer yeah i think cody look right now well give more specifics at the november investor day but we see a path to above  gross margin with both the trends in the business specifically a move to more baw mix in the future and then also all the initiatives underway which you heard about were in the early innings in the number of those initiatives so within the next several quarters those will be completed and we expect as you know wafer conversions inch to inch and inch to inch provides a significant benefit on throughput and then well be over some of the yield issues that were having cody acree  drexel hamilton llc and maybe the followup then on yields bob said that those just werent trending where you had expected i guess whats the opportunity to improve those in the current spends and how quickly can those yields improve steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products hey cody this is eric its a little tough to answer that they can improve tremendously the rate depends upon exactly how we get from here to there part of the nature of these products is that they ramp into very high volumes very rapidly and so sometimes by the time you realize there is a yield issue you already have an awful lot of product in the pipeline thats why we are here so we can improve them over the course of several quarters is probably the best way to answer that operator thank you well go next to mike burton with brean capital please go ahead mike a burton  brean capital llc hey guys and thanks for taking my questions congrats on a strong top line and bottom line youve obviously got a growth coming from a bunch of products with wifi and as well as the multiplexers but im just curious if you could break out for us or give us a sense how big those businesses are now where do you believe they can grow to and then the effect on gross margins and operating margins for both of those products obviously multiplexers you talked about having some yield issues but just kind of overall at a steady run rate what kind of gross margin profile do we expect robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director yes mike on the multiplexers the quadplexers in particular for china id be embarrassed to actually quote the gross margins and we expect those to be significantly above the corporate average and wifi is in family with the corporate average we do fairly well there in general and then obviously ones where we build the rf flex for the wifi that does have a better than company average margin mike a burton  brean capital llc okay and then also – sorry if i missed this but you talked about some more rd spend just kind of thoughts of opex trending forward during this fiscal year mark j murphy  chief financial officer yes what youll see mike youll see opex in the second quarter on a dollar basis about in line with what you saw in the first quarter but on a percent basis will be down towards our longterm target which is  of sales and then youll see opex on a dollar basis begin to drop off through the second half as some spending we know falls off and productivity programs continue operator and well go next to toshiya hari with goldman sachs please go ahead toshiya hari  goldman sachs  co hey good afternoon and thanks for taking my question i also wanted to ask about gross margins just to make sure i understand you guys correctly so in the quarter what were some of the surprises that drove the miss in gross margins and whats causing the leg down in the september quarter despite the huge ramp in revenue robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director you want to take that or you want me to steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products well again its primarily a single product problem and its a lowband pad problem where we have significant outsourced filter content and that was a large volume product in the first quarter and it actually becomes larger in the second quarter as another lowband pad family product comes on so thats the effect youre seeing in first quarter and second quarter robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director so toshiya we expected better costs as well as our yields didnt hit where we expected to be at this point in time toshiya hari  goldman sachs  co okay great and as my followup i wanted to ask about baw you talked in your prepared remarks about utilization rates in your baw business being suboptimal today could you maybe provide a bit more granularity here and also comment on when you expect utilization rates to be at or above optimal levels in baw thank you robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director sure thanks toshiya what i said was we were not at optimal levels today and weve added capacity and were continuing to add capacity as we expand from inch to inch and adding inch in the farmers branch and quite honestly its going to be the timing of new marquee phones that were launching in in calendar year  mark j murphy  chief financial officer and ill just add that were going to pace that investment as we get clarity on customer demand we feel very good about the customer demand and the quality of our product so were comfortable making early commitments but the actual construction spend pace will be determined by our clarity on wins operator and well take our next question from craig hettenbach with morgan stanley please go ahead craig m hettenbach  morgan stanley  co llc yes thank you just a question on the yield issue and as it relates to gross margin you talked about gross margin staying here through the year do you have line of sight as to just the cost issue part of this or any other color you can have in terms of how you maybe deem conservative or not as to kind of the recovery from this robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director yes again its a little hard to tell the rate and pace of recovery there are certain things that could move the needle actually relatively quickly were planning on it being a longer haul as i said a couple quarters to fix the issue again primarily because theres a lot of volume in the line early part of the ramp so i think were now well in in terms of the number of parts produced we understand the yield issue quite well and so i dont think there is a lot of uncertainty from this point forward other than how rapidly we can implement the changes and get it through the pipeline craig m hettenbach  morgan stanley  co llc got it and then as my followup in terms of capital allocation you did greenpeak which is kind of tuckin youve been fairly aggressive buying back stock so big picture how you view best use of cash here in terms of your own stock versus attempts to diversify the business robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director mark you want to take that mark j murphy  chief financial officer yes its a good question i guess ill start with buyback weve repurchased  billion of shares in the last five quarters and we have  million remaining on our  billion authorization ill add that we currently expect to continue buying our shares under that authorization were interested obviously in a thoughtful capital allocation framework that will consider organic growth opportunities including capex needs which we just talked about on baw those are very highreturn projects relatively low risk from a project execution standpoint so those would be early priority on spend were always looking at acquisition opportunities that would fit well with qorvo but ill add that were not capacity constrained from a balance sheet standpoint to doing those but theres a very high bar on return requirements for allocation of capital to those opportunities and then we plan to be regular steady buyers of our shares as part of this thoughtful capital allocation framework and thats what weve done operator our next question is from ed snyder with charter equity research please go ahead edward f snyder  charter equity research inc thanks a lot eric you said you were surprised by that gross margin on the lowband pad coming in here and the several comments that intimated both there was a cost and a yield issue yield i get i suppose because you can always get surprised but can you explain what happened on cost it was at the saw filters did they raise prices to you was it not baw pricing what changed from the time that you did the prototype and you bid the part and won the part to the time you started producing the part that smacked margins as hard as they were and then as a followup youve got a gazillion programs going on here youre moving to inch in baw in richardson are you starting an inch in farmers branch are you ramping an inch meaning is it already up and running moving to inch you have inch in tc in florida youre launching im assuming a inch tc and a saw in north carolina moving gan to texas moving gaas to oregon and a new pad facility in china maybe you could take a few minutes to just walk through what the impact of some or all of these are on the margin issues maybe none maybe some and whether its utilization whatever because as im sure most of the other guys on this call were getting flooded with gross margin questions even before the call started so any help would be appreciated robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director all right ill take the easiest one were starting out in farmers branch on inch so we will start with what we believe will be our lowest cost there and again well qualify the line in  and be ready for production in  as far as whats going on in the packaging assembly and test facility again thats one of the largest premerger synergies that we talked about is because a lot of the legacy work is outside assembly houses and in fact given the volume were running right now we have a lot of work on the outside and thats why theyre bringing up and we had our grand opening in dezhou just a few weeks ago and as we insource that that is a significant cost savings for us as far as yes in greensboro were starting in inch with standard saw and tempcomp saw and its a significant margin improvement over what were paying outside ill say it that way but it will take time to get those into the market and designed into current product so again much more of a  story than a  story and as far as you know the diameters and you can do the math on what the savings is from inch to inch and well give you a lot more color on the timing of that at the analyst day but again most of these things really take hold in  i know you had a question for eric as well steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products yes we probably cant say much about the outsourced content to your question other than to say that its a source thats clearly not a longterm viable candidate theres not much flexibility in the nearterm in terms of pricing and what we can do with that supplier internally though the yields are related to some specifications at the end product level but also to your point this is the first volume to ramp very hard in the new inch tc line and were definitely working out a lot of issues in there as well thats contributing certainly to the issue operator thank you well go next to steve smigie with raymond james j steven smigie  raymond james  associates inc great thanks a lot guys i was wondering if you could comment on what you think your total dollar content gains were for premium phones say this year versus last year – and i know there are tons of skus and stuff but a rough assessment for the flagship phones robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director what i do feel confident in is we grew our dollar content clearly at one of our customers you guys know we grew significantly more dollar content as they released phones throughout the year if i look at our top three customers weve expanded our dollar contents and to your point it really gets down to mix on skus but i think in aggregate weve definitely increased our share as well as our dollar content j steven smigie  raymond james  associates inc okay great and i just wanted to followup on viveks question a little bit around seasonality so you talked about growing in december does that growth suggest anything about how it might look into march typically you have a pretty steep dip and so im just wondering if this is being pull forward somewhat does that suggest a more shallow march or would that trend more normally robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director so to be clear i dont believe i acknowledged theres any pull forward i said if there was then it could impact december but right now we dont view it as demand being pulled forward i think if you look at what happened last year and i think its pretty widely known that some of the marquee phones didnt quite sell as well into the december quarter which impacted december and slightly in the march so i think it all does come down to if youre asking what december and march are going to look like as we said china we seem to be getting back to our normal share levels there so thats where the strength in the china market that we see we see it continues to migrate from mode to mode and mode so thats dollar content we think that china market is doing well but we have a conservative view in my comments for december and to your point typically march is down seasonally and i dont think thats going to change from any other year operator thank you well go next to chris caso with cla sic clsa  christopher caso  clsa americas llc thank you just a followup question with regard to china and the comments and i think youve talked about tempering your expectations yet the revenue growth is strong so if maybe you could clarify more specifically what your expectations would be for china as you go into the september quarter how much of that is dialed into your growth expectations and then perhaps into the december quarter as well steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products so we do have growth in china dialed in thats based on actually very strong backlog at this time in order activity and visibility into the dollar content expansions that our customers are asking for these phones however the majority of the growth is not driven by china this quarter its driven by other large customers in marquee phone ramps christopher caso  clsa americas llc okay great and as a followup weve heard i guess different commentary from different folks with regard to inventory levels at customers now as youre going into the seasonally stronger period of the year i guess two questions on that one is although you took a hit from some inventory reductions back starting in last december quarter do you think those still persisted in the june quarter such that youre shipping below customer consumption and at this point as we go into the september quarter do you think those inventory reductions are now complete robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director yeah id rather just make this comment at a very high level typically we ship into our customers well before they start selling because they build up their inventory to go so typically in june we would typically be under shipping what theyre selling so what i can say is specifically about our business we saw what was coming we took actions in december a little bit in march but we were pretty much clean starting in june mark j murphy  chief financial officer yeah and chris ill add that our turns did increase about  and then our inventory levels did go up about  million but that was as you can see now to prepare for the september and followon quarter operator and our next question comes from timothy arcuri with cowen  co wayne loeb  cowen  co llc hello this is wayne loeb for tim it appears that some major smartphone markers are now second sourcing their modems can you comment on your relative rf share when attached to an intel versus qualcomm high ended modem robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director sorry we are not going to be able to comment wayne loeb  cowen  co llc okay i will try one more thing then on envelope trackers are you seeing some traction there it seems like some other nonqualcomm modems do not yet have an envelope tracker are you seeing some traction or any attachment to that robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director i think eric would love to talk about et pmics steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products yeah weve been in production for several generations now we do continue to see increased traction really across all tiers in the market and with several baseband manufacturers operator thank you well go next to atif malik with citigroup atif malik  citigroup global markets inc broker hi thanks for taking my question i have a question on gross margins as well your peer skyworks guided flat margins on revenue growth in september you guys are guiding down gross margins i understand theres no structural change in the pricing environment but can you comment on maybe parts of the market like lowband pads which are more commoditized and if you can also help me understand why you would be chasing lowband pads if you have been stronger in the midband and highband historically robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director go ahead eric steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products yeah sure i want to say quite clearly that this is not a pricing issue i also actually take issue in saying lowband pad is a commoditized business i dont think thats the case at all especially these high performance lowband pads with temperaturecompensated saw filters in them these are very high performance products very few people can manufacture them its not commoditized and theres not a pricing issue going on here at all because theyre incredibly hard to manufacture were having some yield ramping a new one and associated with again our new wafer line in it so why were in the lowband pad business its actually a premium product category and we see a lot of customers now asking us and giving us the opportunity to do the entire rf frontend you need to have lowband midband and highband all the switching and power management so forth to be able to do that so its an important part of the portfolio its going to be a very powerful part of the portfolio as well going forward atif malik  citigroup global markets inc broker great and as a follow up mark can you talk about the full fiscal  capex expectations for the year mark j murphy  chief financial officer yeah were going to be about if i recall about  of sales for the year if we maintain our pace of spend just to be clear i mentioned that if we dont have the clarity well certainly slow down the spend so id say i dont expect it to be any worse than about  operator thank you our next question comes from quinn bolton with needham  co quinn bolton  needham  co llc thank you i just wanted to follow up on that baw capacity question you mentioned a couple of times on the call that youre not at optimal levels im just wondering are you referring to the fact youre underutilized currently or you guys are running full out and you need to add capacity in the nearterm to meet demand and then ive got a followup question robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director quinn we are not running at capacity or nowhere close to that so i would tell you were under loaded than from optimum quinn bolton  needham  co llc got it okay great and then just coming back to the gross margin obviously you talked a lot about the lowband pad i was wondering if you could make any comments about sort of the china product gross margin especially as you ramp the quadplexers hexaplexers is the mobile product going into china carrying sort of corporate or at least mobile product average gross margins is there anything you can distinguish in terms of gross margin contribution from china versus some of the premium customers robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director so theres really not a large difference theres a wide – not a wide range – but theres a range of gross margins for the different product types that sell into china in general the portfolio especially the newer products are basically in line with the average mobile portfolio margins operator thank you our next question comes from ian ing with mkm partners ian l ing  mkm partners llc yes thank you just wondering here on the revenue guidance has a range of  million versus in the past you gave us specific targets whats some of the sensitivity there what percent booked are you to get to the midpoint robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director we have a great new cfo who thought that maybe we ought to be able to provide you guys with more of a range because of his experience and looking at our past performance that its probably more prudent to do that and i think you also noticed one of our competitors also gave a range who typically gave a point so we just thought it would be good to give you the clarity there in the range and as far as booked for the quarter between our backlog customer forecast things like that were in good shape ian l ing  mkm partners llc good shape okay great and then just a clarification on gross margins lowband pads impacted by the sourcing of filters sounds like youve got multiple products multiple models i mean can seasonality in the coming quarters ever cause a more favorable mix shift later this fiscal year or are we really waiting for the fiscal  manufacturing efficiencies and filters that come online robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director this part as you said seasonality or sellthrough of the end customers products can definitely impact our percentage of gross margin absolutely operator our next question is from blayne curtis with barclays please go ahead blayne curtis  barclays capital inc hey guys thanks for taking my question sorry for another gross margin one just wanted to clarify so the gross margin was weaker in june and then in september its down a little bit more it sounds like two issues you have an issue on multiplexers and then you had this lowband pad i was just trying to understand what the impact was in both quarters did you quantify it and then just understand whats the bigger driver between those two robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director yeah blayne the quadplexers had a larger impact in the june quarter than the lowband pad and the lowband pad has a bigger impact much bigger impact this quarter and the quadplexers weve taken some actions and made some progress blayne curtis  barclays capital inc got you and then just a followup in terms of the yield issues has that impacted any delivery dates or whats your lead times and then in terms of fixing these issues do these require redesigns of any of these parts which then need to be requalified on phones or is it something you can you do on the fly in a given model steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products pretty detailed question yeah so i would say yield issues of course were working through those and assuring a continuation of the supply organization is working really really hard to do that in terms of redesign not expected at all potentially test program changes and so forth that of course we coordinate with our customers but these are things that can happen relatively quickly robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director right and holding up any phone shipments steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products right no robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director none operator thank you our next question is from vijay rakesh with mizuho please go ahead vijay r rakesh  mizuho securities usa inc yeah hi guys good guide here just going back on the gross margin question again as you guys  for the fiscal  i guess but as you look at pulling the filters in house i know one of your peers is sitting on a lot filter inventory and then obviously the japanese oems all have a lot of filter exposure filter supply there does that create more filter pricing pressure whats your thoughts there robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director im not sure i fully understood the question on vijay r rakesh  mizuho securities usa inc im just wondering as you pull your filters inhouse and there is obviously more excess filters in the supply chain does that increase pricing pressure on the filter side steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products yeah im sorry i guess were having a hard time following why pulling the filter products inside would create excess inventory of filters and create pricing pressure it would go the opposite way i think in robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director in discrete vijay r rakesh  mizuho securities usa inc yeah yeah steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products yeah discrete filters are becoming a very small part of the market the trend is that the filters are being integrated into higher level functionality such as our fusion modules and so forth robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director and then when theyre integrated just to be clear theyre wafer level packaged opposed to packaged in a ceramic package which is the way a discrete filters sold vijay r rakesh  mizuho securities usa inc got it and you talked about inch and inch transition here what do you expect your mix of inch and inch by the end of calendar  if you can give us some idea there thanks robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director yeah as far as inch baw filters go its going to be a very low percentage thats what were converting to this year and again as ive said bringing up in farmers branch and in saw filters as we continue to expand in florida as well as bringing up the north carolina facility that mix will start to move to inch a much larger percentage dont have the percentage off the top of my head again well give you that at analyst day but it will be a larger percentage inch operator thank you we have a follow up from harsh kumar please go ahead harsh v kumar  stephens inc yeah hey guys thanks for the followup i promise no gross margin question here i was curious mark if you ever gave china as a percentage of sales for either june or what your expectation is for september mark j murphy  chief financial officer i dont think we did provide that robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director hold on a second harsh give us a minute well go through it hold on harsh v kumar  stephens inc okay then let me ask something else while you guys are looking at it mark and then i think you mentioned that opex will fall as the back half approaches can i ask you to clarify if it will fall as a percentage of sales or will it fall in absolute dollars from here mark j murphy  chief financial officer yeah what i said harsh was that itll be about flat on a dollar basis in the second quarter the september quarter and will drop as a percent of sales basis to about  in the subsequent quarters we expect it to drop on a dollar basis harsh v kumar  stephens inc so next year it could drop on a dollar basis got it thanks and then whenever you guys mark j murphy  chief financial officer just to be clear drop in the second half of this fiscal year on a dollar basis robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director and harsh excluding huawei who is a corporate  customer as you know the china business is about a third of the mobile business in the june quarter and a bit less than the third in the september quarter harsh v kumar  stephens inc thanks guys operator and well also take a followup from ed snyder please go ahead edward f snyder  charter equity research inc thanks you mentioned gaas moving to oregon bob are you consolidating all gaas fab in oregon or will you still be split between oregon and north carolina and then triquint started tcsaw it was the first one to actually produce that filters years ago and i know that one of your competitors kind of leapfrogged you in modules to your largest customer and so they are large in tcsaw but im a little surprised you guys are having yield problems with tcsaw is it a new process a new part given your legacy and how long youve been in this technology whats changed there that made this more difficult part just the filtered stuff forget the module thanks robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director so ed we are transitioning over time our greensboro gallium arsenide as well as gan and they will be focused on filters and as far as the tempcomp saw steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products yeah i think you hit on it earlier were doing a lot right now including adding factories in florida and greensboro and also going from inch to inch and managing issues of wafer breakage as well as parameter distributions and as you really run more and more and more wafers to the new inch line you begin to see the full distribution also i think the requirements at the end module are tougher generation regeneration the requirements are getting harder so dialing in these specifications at a very fine level is the issue edward f snyder  charter equity research inc and i know you mentioned it bob but to buy parts from the outside market like youre doing now because everybody outsources saw at this point even your competitors youre buying a packaged part from them which is large and more expensive et cetera when you go internally it will be a wafer scale packaging shouldnt we expect and i dont know what the mix is but im expecting youre using quite a bit of that product in some of your modules lowband pad maybe diversity module shouldnt we expect to see a significant improvement in gross margin given the fact that one youre producing and two its going to be smaller more efficient part than what you could buy on the outside market already and just if you could maybe give us some idea of the timing of when you think youll be independent in saw robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director so maybe big picture ed certainly youre on the right track we absolutely expect that when we can insource these filter ourselves in our new larger factories that are well utilized we will definitely see improvements in gross margin and this is a multigenerational thing this cannot happen overnight to completely eliminate outsourcing of the filters were starting on it were adding new capacity adding the filter designers to be able to do it it will take two or three product cycles to get there operator and ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our qa portion of the call i will turn it to management for closing remarks robert a bruggeworth  president chief executive officer  director as always we thank you for joining us

officer thanks doug good afternoon everyone welcome to our fiscal  fourth quarter earnings call revenue for the march quarter totaled  million exceeding our quarterly guidance reflecting increased demand for our highlyintegrated solutions and a return to growth in idp broad target markets gross margin was  up  basis points sequentially reflecting crisp execution by the qorvo team operating margin was  with operating expenses of approximately  million reflecting reduced variable compensation expense on february  we announced an accelerated share repurchase program and during the march quarter we were able to repurchase  million shares of common stock we expect to repurchase an estimated  share in the june quarter as part of the asr and we have  million that remain authorized for future repurchases in mobile products revenue was  million on the strength of content gains and smartphone program ramps during the quarter we launched an increasing number of highlyintegrated highperformance solutions that leveraged the breadth of our industryleading portfolio of products and technologies we enjoyed strong demand for our highlyintegrated solutions led by products incorporating our premium filters we expect these highlyintegrated solutions will continue to drive our growth qorvos expanding family of rf fusion solutions stands out as an example these tightlyintegrated compact solutions leverage our baw and tempcomp saw filters our lowloss high throwcount soi switches and our highperformance lownoise amplifiers to deliver performance thats unmatched by competitive solutions in the china market the deployment of carrier aggregation and the migration to full mode devices is increasing the demand for our rf flex solutions our bawbased quadplexers and a broad variety of our antenna control solutions looking into calendar  our customers in china are asking us to integrate our premium filters into rf flex to reduce complexity and enhance smartphone performance as carrier aggregation proliferates and bands and modes are added again this strongly favors our broad product portfolio and integration capabilities in idp revenue grew  sequentially to approximately  million reflecting a return to growth in idps broad target market we indicated last quarter that idp had repositioned its diverse portfolio of businesses to accelerate growth and weve begun to see the benefit of that sharpened focus in automotive idp secured a significant design win with a tier  automotive supplier meaningfully expanding our opportunity in automotive infotainment systems at several european car manufacturers elsewhere in connectivity idp leveraged the superior performance of our integrated solutions in efficiency thermal dissipation range and a number of other key metrics to secure the lead position on quantennas qsrg wifi solution this solution enables the industryfirst g wave  solution through a true x mimo configuration for ghz networks and a x mimo configuration for ghz networks in wireless infrastructure revenue grew by more than  sequentially and we returned to more historic levels in our base station business and again we enjoyed increasing demand for qorvos highfrequency and highpower solutions across both infrastructure deployments and advanced defense application across all our markets its increasingly clear that qorvos industryleading portfolio of rf products and technologies represents a significant competitive advantage qorvos offering our customers a combination of performance and integration

opportunities for ma to supplement growth in idp since our earnings conference call last quarter we repurchased more than  million shares of common stock we made an acquisition to expand into the internet of things we commenced production of inch tempcomp saw in florida and inch saw in greensboro to support a marquee smartphone this calendar year and were in the final days of qualifying our inch baw process in texas our bawbased hexaplexer prototypes are demonstrating excellent performance and weve begun to sample a highlyintegrated rf fusion that incorporates our hexaplexers we see strong growth and increasing customer pull for these types of solutions in the coming years we recently acquired clean room space near our richardson campus to support customer demand for baw filters whether they be in discrete implementations quadplexers pentaplexers hexaplexers diversity receive modules or other highlyintegrated rf solutions the facility is already fully operational and its our goal to incrementally convert the facility to baw in the back half of next calendar year to support customer program as the industrys leading supplier of saw tempcomp saw and baw devices we are adding capacity to keep pace with the increasing customer demand for our high mid and lowband products in fact qorvo will soon be in production with lowband pads midband pads and highband pads all in premium tier marquee lte smartphones before handing off the call to steve i want to say a quick word about our acquisition of greenpeak technologies which just recently closed greenpeak is a recognized leader in ultralow power shortrange rf solutions with an expanding business and customers all over the globe a great number of who are already purchasing highpower solutions from qorvo greenpeak will become a part of idp and will be run by cees links their founder and ceo cees links is a recognized industry leader who was instrumental in the development and adoption of wifi technology we expect greenpeaks ultralow power rf solutions and socs for the connected home and internet of things to nicely complement idps industryleading portfolio of highpower solutions we have not included any revenue from greenpeak technologies in our june guidance in the september quarter well have a full quarter of greenpeak revenue and well begin to include it in our guidance then and with that ill hand the call over to steve for a more detailed look at our financials steven j buhaly  chief financial officer thanks bob qorvos revenue for the march quarter was  million much better than typical seasonality relative to the december quarter mobile products revenue declined  to  million while idp showed continued strength as revenue grew  to  million content gains in the samsung galaxy were the largest driver of the healthy sequential performance in mobile qorvo had three  customers the largest at approximately  of revenue representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer our other  customers during the quarter were samsung and huawei gross margin was  up sequentially from  reflecting the absence of a couple of yield issues experienced in the prior quarter operating expenses remained relatively low at  million driven by reduced variable compensation expense operating income was  million or just over  of revenue net income for the march quarter was  million or  per diluted share based on  million shares outstanding turning to the balance sheet total cash and investments was  million and cash flow from operations totaled  million capital expenditures were  million primarily to address growth and demand for our premium filters the company repurchased approximately  million shares during the march quarter under our  million accelerated share repurchase program as the actual purchase occurred about halfway through the quarter the impact on the march quarter share count was about five million shares we expect to repurchase an estimated  shares this quarter as the asr program is completed the asr is part of our previously announced  billion share repurchase program approved in november of  after giving effect to the asr approximately  million remain authorized under this program for future repurchases we made good progress last quarter on significant longterm opportunities to improve our growth and profitability we acquired a highly respected iot firm improving our sam and growth prospects we continue to improve both the fundamental performance capabilities of our smr baw process and the capacity to produce to growing customer demand our acquisition of a former maxim plant just a few miles from our existing operation in richardson will provide lowcost clean room capacity for the next leg of baw growth we saw strong progress on large costreduction initiatives inch baw wafers inch tcsaw wafers and the insourcing of mobile assembly and test into our chinese plants its an exciting time in rf and at qorvo now lets turn to our business outlook qorvo currently believes the demand environment in its end markets supports the following nongaap expectations for the quarter ending july   quarterly revenue of about  million gross margin of about  net interest expense of approximately  million a tax rate at approximately  and diluted earnings per share of approximately  based on approximately  million shares outstanding our june revenue expectations indicate healthy  sequential growth reflecting our strong book of business actual quarterly results may differ from these expectations and as such differences may be material we currently expect to report june quarter results on august   with that id like to welcome your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you the first question comes from toshiya hari from goldman sachs please go ahead toshiya hari  goldman sachs japan co ltd hi good afternoon and thank you for taking my question and congrats on a very strong quarter my first question is regarding your revenue performance both in the march quarter and in the june quarter you seem to be clearly outperforming the overall industry you talked to content gains in the samsung galaxy but were there any other things that led to this outperformance robert a bruggeworth  president  chief executive officer thanks for your comments toshi and clearly idp had strong growth as we touched on in the infrastructure business as long as the connectivity business in the march quarter for pretty good performance also as you pointed out we saw good strength from one of our  customers i think it would be good – as we look at the june guidance we are expecting both businesses to grow in june but i will tell you the majority of the growth is going to be coming from the mobile business so ill let eric talk a little bit about the growth steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products thanks bob yeah i think in the june quarter we are expecting to be up significantly outside of our largest customer in particular and thats driven primarily by just the continued content growth in china i think were back on track with the nextgeneration solutions weve announced rf flex gen is already ramping into highvolume production thats helping to carry some of the sequential growth toshiya hari  goldman sachs japan co ltd okay thank you and my followup is on the inventory situation when i look at your balance sheet i think inventory was up about  million on a yearoveryear basis while revenues were down about  million should we be concerned about your inventory level or do your current booking status support significant revenue growth so that we shouldnt be concerned here thank you steven j buhaly  chief financial officer yeah i dont think you should be too concerned but two things to think about here one is we are doing some advanced building in anticipation of growth later this year and then secondly i think our inventory levels are a little heavy and we can improve our turns performance and we expect to do so i dont have a concern about excess and obsolete type risks we monitor that closely we just went through a quarterly review and i dont have concerns there but i think that is an area where we can improve and will do so operator thank you the next question comes from mike burton from brean capital please go ahead mike a burton  brean capital llc hey guys and my congratulations as well on the strong results especially in this environment just following up on that second question first steve if you could talk us through the puts and takes on gross margin with revenues heading up in the june quarter and then your thoughts about it going forward steven j buhaly  chief financial officer yeah so relative to the june quarter were back to expectations of  as you might remember thats pretty much where weve been running the last several quarters last quarter we had a yield issue on a couple parts that knocked us down to just under  in the absence of that were kind of back to where we have been at and relative to the fullyear ill offer a couple of things since you ask one is we continue to believe our market is growing at a  to  rate and we believe well grow consistent with that second i think we have with that growth rate a good opportunity to see fiscal year  earnings per share getting pretty close to  a share if all goes well we might hit that  but i would say if i were modeling id say well get up into the neighborhood well get pretty close to  and beyond that im going to – gross margin and opex that mix will depend on the type of business and opportunities we have as we go through the year mike a burton  brean capital llc okay steven j buhaly  chief financial officer and ill add i think tax rate should be about  and next quarter we expect shares to be about  million and well see what we do from there on mike a burton  brean capital llc great and then also eric it sounds like the china is picking up for you guys in q i wonder if youre already starting to see some progress that you were planning on making at mediatek and then just also if you could just clarify i know you said that growing in q but was china up or down for you guys in q as well steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products yeah thanks mike no question were much happier with our position in mediatek now than we were six months to nine months ago we announced at barcelona the rf flex gen solutions which are aligned with both mediatek and qualcomm frankly and seeing a pretty good uptake we saw – exiting the march quarter we began to see china really take off so they were okay in march but they werent really the factor that helped offset seasonality as much as samsung was robert a bruggeworth  president  chief executive officer mike i would also point out as we touched on last quarter weve got to let you guys know that we felt that the antenna tuners and a lot of those solutions because of the metal cases starting to proliferate in our chinese customers designs thats a great opportunity for growth for us so its not just the power amplifiers its also our highperformance baw filters as well as some of our antenna tuners operator thank you the next question comes from harsh kumar from stephens please go ahead harsh v kumar  stephens inc hey guys congratulations from me as well fantastic numbers question bob for you as you look in the back half of the quarter youve given the june guide – steves kind of talked about the eps for the year as you look on the back half of the calendar year how do you see the market and then ive got a followup robert a bruggeworth  president  chief executive officer yeah as far as the market goes were modeling pretty much flat handset growth were expecting people to continue to migrate up into the performance phones and as well as the marquee phones and driving the dollar content will continue to increase so we still expect the rf tam for the mobile business to grow  to  weve repositioned james business to start to get in the doubledigit growth rates so coming back to the infrastructure we are expecting a pretty solid year as we go forward steven j buhaly  chief financial officer i just wanted to add one of the exciting things in our business is the migration of the idp business from a kind of a high singledigits growth rate to a midteens growth very comparable to what we see in the mobile space and this acquisition of greenpeak is one more step in that direction harsh v kumar  stephens inc got it and then – hey steve i think you touched on it just very briefly i think you were supposed to have a major event with your cost reduction strategy with your move to china i was wondering if we could get a small update on that as it relates to whats going on there steven j buhaly  chief financial officer sure happy to most of the action is in the second half of the calendar year as we cant really move parts that are in production our customers require us to start new parts in the location of manufacture and so that means were intersecting with major product launches as is typical to happen in the back half of the calendar year so thats when well start to see the flow of savings at the level we expect so youll see a little bit of the benefit this calendar year and youll see all of the benefit next calendar year and we are on track for the second  million installment of our synergy expectations operator thank you the next question comes from edward snyder from charter equity research please go ahead edward f snyder  charter equity research inc thanks eric there was a long list of product groups that are now using baw everything from diversity modules to allinones like fusion is that impact steven j buhaly  chief financial officer could you speak up a little bit ed its hard to hear you edward f snyder  charter equity research inc sorry steven j buhaly  chief financial officer i know its hard to believe but we edward f snyder  charter equity research inc i could let me speak in a normal voice now check can you hear me now you asked for it okay so eric so theres a long list of product groups now using baw everything from diversity to allinones like fusion did that impact your mix enough in mobile to drive growth in operating margins and do you expect that to occur or accelerate as we move through the year and then steve you touched on there the pad facility in china has much or any of triquint product lines – i guess its mostly new qorvo product lines because you cant move old ones back there – what percentage are you in terms of moving to the pad facility at this stage and i have one for james steven j buhaly  chief financial officer ill answer yours first id say were under  right now and maybe closer to  so its a relatively modest portion just because of the lead times to equip the factory start the prototypes intersect with customer product launches so the vast majority of it will be second half of the calendar year steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products to the first part a b and c of your question the baw product portfolio has filled out very nicely as you said and we are shipping in addition to the diversity receive modules now with baw in it several rf fusion modules with baw and as you know we released our first quadplexer for the chinaca market also bawbased and traction in all of those has been very strong in march and continuing on into june and certainly driving part of our growth and as weve talked about the gross margins on those are above our average so that supports the expansion in gross margin but of course the growth being driven by that also helps the operating margin to your point edward f snyder  charter equity research inc okay and then james most of – there was a nice uptick in your business this quarter was that most all g base stations and was that spread evenly across your customers did you see more of a pocket of strength in certain areas james l klein  presidentinfrastructure  defense products we had good growth in the wireless infrastructure our base station business and also in connectivity as far as the base station side it was really broadbased across the regions and across all of our toptier customers in the space operator thank you the next question comes from quinn bolton from needham please go ahead quinn bolton  needham  co llc hi guys let me add my congratulations bob wondering if you could just comment about inventory levels at your largest customer it seems like theyve obviously seen lowerthanexpected demand and im just wondering do you think that that supply channel here as you come out of march looking into june is fairly clean or do you think that theres excess component inventory that you may have shipped in previous quarters that still needs to be worked off and then ive got a followup for eric robert a bruggeworth  president  chief executive officer well i dont think youre going to like my answer much i think things are fine were in pretty good shape there so not really much to add things look fine to us quinn bolton  needham  co llc the channel looks pretty clean from your perspective it sounds like robert a bruggeworth  president  chief executive officer yes steven j buhaly  chief financial officer yeah and you know and im sure you remember we kind of took the medicine in the december quarter in terms of lowered expectations for that particular customer  quinn bolton  needham  co llc right right okay great and then for eric just obviously very strong growth in china here looking into the june quarter wondering if youd give us some sense obviously youre ramping gen of rf flex but you also shipped some of the premium filters can you give us some sense is it fairly well balanced between rf flex and filters or is one of those businesses much larger than the other and then sort of a followon question to that is last year you guys saw a massive june quarter in china and it ended up leading to some inventory accumulation effective in september to december as you look forward right now do you think that that strength in china continues in the back half of the year or is it hard to have visibility that far out right now steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products yeah thanks for the question for the portfolio thats growing in june in china in particular is very very diverse in addition to all the rf flex and quadplexers and discrete filters and so forth that were growing with most of the china suppliers when we look at huawei thats a completely different set of dynamic we also see them growing strongly in june but based more on the rf fusion portfolio some of the more premium solutions in power management and so forth so really i think its fair to say our entire product portfolio is involved in one way or the other with various tiers and manufacturers throughout china you have to remember of course even below huawei the other suppliers there the leading suppliers like oppo vivo and xiaomi we have very good longterm relationships with these guys and theyre looking to expand beyond just domestic consumption and export more which is driving a need for more premium filters and more bands in their phones so that just plays right into where were investing regarding your second point yeah very good point last year we also had a very strong start to june i think that has caused us to be pretty cautious we are being just as careful as we can to make sure were looking at the total demand and watching for customers that might be doubleordering or chasing the same slots and so forth so were watching that really carefully i think another big part of last year was the mediatek phase  generation where we were frankly behind by one or two quarters and it was hard to catch up once we got there so this transition this time with phase  and then looking into phase  and phase  at this time we look very very wellaligned with mediatek as well as the end customers operator thank you the next question comes from cody acree from drexel please go ahead cody acree  drexel hamilton llc thanks for taking my questions and congratulations guys guys on the baw filter capacity with skyworks now pretty openly talking about having baw filters in  and of course with them expanding their tcsaw capacity how do you see them changing the competitive landscape and especially with all the expansion and filter capacity youve done yourself robert a bruggeworth  president  chief executive officer as far as baw filters go i dont believe we see that changing the dynamic there i think theyre underestimating what its going to take i think the amount of ip the capacity its going to take were moving to inch the performance keeps improving generation over generation quite honestly im not sure where theyre getting the technology or where they even have a factory to produce it we currently do know of suppliers out there that are limited in their ability to use baw filters coupled with a saw filter and you pick either you want the baw and transmit or receive so were certainly familiar with those things but just dont see it and as far as tempcomp saw goes highperformance filters whether theyre baw or tempcomp saw continue to expand and grow they are bigger than qorvo in tempcomp saw we are expanding capacity for programs that weve already won like i said we migrated to inch we talked in the february call about how we qualified the inch process and were the first in the industry to do that this quarter – in my opening comments i talked about how were ramping tempcomp saw in florida and again thats for programs weve already won but we feel pretty good about the capacity were putting in place in baw as well as in saw so when i talked about saw filters in greensboro thats really to insource filters that were buying outside that over time that will be a margin improvement as well cody acree  drexel hamilton llc thanks bob and one for eric eric when you talk about major drivers like carrier aggregation or diversity receive can you talk about where we are in some of those adoption curves how much of the dollar content story are those kind of major applications driving the content story and how much of that curve do we have left to go steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products yeah thats a good question i would say generally were still in pretty early innings overall in addition to the transition to ca which – you know half lets say of the g phones overall this year will have ca and eventually im confident theyll all have it over the next three years to five years in china alone as well we think somewhere like a quarter to a third of even the chinese g phones will have carrier aggregation in the downlink this year so i think overall were still in fairly early innings remember i think we talked about this at analyst day its a compounding effect of those with the reduced number of skus in the handset manufacturers pipeline that drives the complexity up dramatically and so that overall trend as well we definitely see our number two and number three customer in particular driving towards more of a global sku like our largest customer does and that also is still in the early innings of development operator thank you the next question comes from ian ing from mkm partners please go ahead ian l ing  mkm partners llc yes congrats again on outperforming other smartphone suppliers you talked about reference design exposure in china places like mediatek what about trends towards captive basebands xiaomei and huawei are there any implications here on rf flex and rf fusion thanks james l klein  presidentinfrastructure  defense products sure generally speaking when you look at the value chain the more basebands the better from an rf guys perspective right and so we like that and in general were able to – we take common – to make the products that were developing relatively common in terms of platforms and then we can make relatively minor adjustments to customize for each individual baseband platform or end customer we dont see any of the vertical baseband guys looking to develop a completely new rf architecture for example right and were already addressing those architectures that our customers fundamentally want so now its only a matter of interfacing to those individual basebands relatively straightforward thing to do and were happy to do it doing very very well with all the internal vertical suppliers ian l ing  mkm partners llc okay so a bit of a neutral thanks and then my followup is you know really nice june quarter guidance  million of new revenues flat gross margins just wondering about the earnings fallthrough i mean is it really variable compensation coming back or are there some other factors getting to the eps guidance thanks steven j buhaly  chief financial officer yeah good question we do expect variable comp to come back that will lead to opex in the lows million kind of range maybe in the mids million depending on the magnitude its unusual that we did not pay over the last sixmonth period and so you do see kind of a contrast there and i want to make it clear to folks to expect that otherwise we did improve gross margins sequentially a lot of that was due to yield differences and then you have a bit more mobile in the mix typically in the june quarter so all that leads to a guide of  gross margin operator thank you the next question comes from blayne curtis from barclays please go ahead blayne curtis  barclays capital inc hey guys thanks for taking my question you talked a lot about your china customers up in june maybe you could just talk about trends at your two largest customers what youre embedding into that june guidance and then steve i just wanted to followup on the opex you said put greenpeak in september whats the visibility to the close date i think you said within the quarter and any guidance as to what to add in the september quarter or would you rather just leave it out steven j buhaly  chief financial officer yeah so with respect to greenpeak it just closed a few days ago so well have some fractional impact in the quarter and well report that when we report the results of this quarter but from an earnings perspective consider it de minimis either way and then youre right i would prefer to talk about greenpeak financially when we guide the september quarter robert a bruggeworth  president  chief executive officer and blayne as far as our two largest customers im not sure you know who they are i know you clearly know who the largest one is so i want to be careful were kind of splitting hairs maybe on this but clearly our largest customer were being conservative in our guidance we do believe its down to maybe flat well just see theyve got some pretty good selling products that weve got nice dollar content in so down to flat for our largest – second largest depending on which one of those you pick ones going to be down slightly and ones going to be up so i gave you the top three hows that blayne curtis  barclays capital inc i appreciate it i guess the two largest in march obviously it changes but yes thank you operator thank you the next question comes from tim arcuri from cowen and company please go ahead timothy arcuri  cowen  co llc thanks a lot i guess the first question is can you give us some sense in fiscal  maybe what the percentage of your mobile revenues came from chinese oems steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products over the last year in total – are you including huawei as a chinese oem or do you consider that global timothy arcuri  cowen  co llc include them steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products yeah so on the range of – mobile business on the range of  probably including huawei timothy arcuri  cowen  co llc okay great and then second question is on the share repo you bought back  million shares in march i know that some of thats going to spill over into june from kind of how it flows through the pl but you said that youre only going to buy back  shares in june which is down a lot and thats still not even working through the  million that you have left on the repo so im wondering why youre cranking down the repo so much in june is that related to the stock price or is there something else happening there thanks steven j buhaly  chief financial officer yeah so a couple things the asr that we initiated was initiated midquarter of the march quarter and so we paid bank of america  million they tendered about  million shares to us and since share count for a quarter is based on the average for that quarter we get about half credit this quarter half credit next quarter now the next point the asr is not finished yet our partner bank of america is completing that program this quarter and exact share count tender will depend on the average share price that we end up with so our estimate is well pick up another half million shares or so as that program comes to completion once that program is complete our board will evaluate whether to proceed with a subsequent buyback utilizing the remaining  million previously authorized operator thank you the next question comes from atif malik from citigroup please go ahead atif malik  citigroup global markets inc broker hi thanks for taking my question and good job on the execution in the march quarter both questions for steve on the gross margin youre guiding flat gross margins on  sequential revenue growth how should we think about your longterm target model of  has anything changed on that and then i have a followup for eric steven j buhaly  chief financial officer yeah so i think the big drivers for us getting from where were at which is roughly  to our longterm model of  are really those big movers in the gross margin line we referred to earlier moving baw filters from inch wafers to inch wafers saw and tcsaw from inch to inch both of those have an effect of taking roughly a third of the costs out of the die for baw filters and saw and tcsaw filters very significant reductions well be consolidating our gas production into a single foundry over the next year and a half insourcing assembling tests for part of our mobile business the part that used to be – belonged to triquint and each of these have a significant impact which is largely going to be felt in fy  these will occur throughout the year but the financial impact will be mostly in fy  and then we also simply have the scale benefits of the kind of growth i referenced earlier we have a fair amount of fixed costs and we will see scale benefits as we continue to grow to the market at what we expect will be a  to  rate so im actually – shortterm i think were going to fluctuate around depending on the particulars of the quarter but longterm these are big substantial items that dont involve new laws of physics this is stuff we can do were well underway and i think we are on track to get to the target model over time atif malik  citigroup global markets inc broker okay and then a followup for eric eric is it possible for you to quantify what percentage of the bands that are getting aggregated globally are using baw or fbar type filters steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products well thats a pretty tough thing to do actually other than to say its growing as a percentage of the total its substantial and growing but that would be a really hard thing to do looking at all the different band combinations that were addressing across so many different platforms but obviously its meaningful today you can tell that by the investments and whats happening in the industry and its continuing to grow robert a bruggeworth  president  chief executive officer and theres no question its probably the highest growth rate area of our business right now are the high frequency premium filters were doing very very well steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products yeah and even if you look at our wifi growth which is – we havent talked about that today at all but were also seeing very strong growth in our fusion module for wifi and thats primarily coming from customers that were doing chiponboard implementations where they were using our baw filter but maybe somebody elses fem and weve integrated all that together so when you look at what the tam or the addressable market effect is of the baw filters it can be quite big operator thank you the next question comes from steve smigie from raymond james please go ahead vincent celentano  raymond james  associates inc thanks this is vince celentano on for steve i was hoping if you could elaborate a little bit more on your new gan design win does it relate at all to the power amplifier market for base station and overall when do you expect revenue for these wins to start kicking in and overall what do you see as the potential revenue opportunity james l klein  presidentinfrastructure  defense products so several questions in there again but good design wins in both the commercial and defense business both power amplifiers and yes on the commercial side it is towards the base station not just design wins but we have production orders in the books and we are shipping into both of those markets today overall size of the market i think the way i would say it is that market we model it growing at about  yearoveryear were the market leader there today and i think well continue to grow at that rate and potentially even a little bit higher vincent celentano  raymond james  associates inc okay thanks and in the past youve said your idp division is roughly an even split between defense connectivity transport and wireless infrastructure is that still the case and do you guys have any insight as to the relative growth rates of each of these subsegments james l klein  presidentinfrastructure  defense products so yeah again this is james the relative size i think thats still a good estimate that its broken into those four areas and relatively the same size and the growth rates as weve talked about before probably singledigits or so highsingledigits in defense our connectivity business or wifi business we see growing close to that  range thats what the markets doing and those are really probably the big drivers in the business i will say that with moving our portfolio around weve repositioned into really some significant high growth areas weve moved about  of the business into what we consider above average growth markets and those are markets that are growing in the  kind of range the addition of greenpeak really substantially helps that greenpeaks markets targeted to grow at about  between now and  and so very high growth as we move into the connected home and really start to see iot take off operator thank you the next question come from edward snyder from charter equity research please go ahead edward f snyder  charter equity research inc thanks a lot eric samsung came in a bit better than expected this quarter i know you guys gained content but they broke through the  barrier here was that better content than you expected a better mix of sku sales for them or just higher units overall and then how do you see things trending at samsung not so much on the gs but do you expect to continue gaining content above and beyond what you saw in the gs in the second half or  with samsung robert a bruggeworth  president  chief executive officer hey this is bob as far as samsung in the quarter they played out just exactly how we expected it so we expected to gain the content we talked about it in last quarters conference call and it pretty much played out as far as things go in the future ill let eric address that steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products yeah thanks robert a bruggeworth  president  chief executive officer mine was easy it was already done steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products samsung is really not unlike the rest of our customers ed we have the same opportunities there working across multiple baseband solutions in their portfolio to really optimize the rf frontends to cover more and more capabilities going forward so when you look at the unique things were bringing from a tuning and advanced envelope tracking power management the full suite of baw filters and so forth the ability to integrate all of those into really highly compact solutions i think samsung is really just like all the other customers from the midtier all up to the highest tiers marquee smartphones where we have the opportunities to help them really do a lot more with higher performance in smaller space so yeah we think our opportunities there continue to get better edward f snyder  charter equity research inc yeah but on the highly integrated module skyworks offers that too and theyve had some success so what im trying to get to here is how much of what youve just experienced at samsung is due to their sku reduction moving to these high density modules from more of a regional discrete architecture versus say gaining traction because youve got baw youve got nearly every technology that anybody could want versus either avago or skyworks and it may lead to just straight up content gains im trying to get a feel for where that falls on the current performance and then what youre seeing – because you see the roadmap out for at least a year now – how does that look for the next two phone steven eric creviston  presidentmobile products yeah thats what i was trying to address i think we are well familiar with the content gains that were seeing thats driving the overall industry to  to  growth because of the sku consolidation cmos and soforth so i tried to highlight at the beginning the things that we are maybe differentiated in where were bringing something in addition to that tuning is a big area across our entire customer portfolio now where we really see that growing and weve got a lot of leadership there in bringing new solutions and envelope tracking power management as well were the only openmarket solution for that and were seeing a lot of traction driving there so in addition to those fundamental drivers we think qorvo does bring a lot of unique things as well that really helps us operator thank you so that concludes todays questionandanswer session id like to send the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks robert a bruggeworth  president  chief executive officer wed like to thank each of you for joining us tonight were launching an increasing number of highlyintegrated rf solutions were seeing a return to growth in many of idps broad markets and were excited about the longterm
