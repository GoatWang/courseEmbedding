degree peer reviews and rewarding team members for working well together  expand risk management seeing all angles risk factors into every investment decision we make because limiting losses in volatile markets is just as critical as maximizing returns on the upside we have a riskaware culture in which every member of our investment team is responsible for assessing risk embedded in our investment process risk management is always on and we conduct rigorous reviews regularly at the portfolio security and firm levels in market downturns and during periods of market volatility our
