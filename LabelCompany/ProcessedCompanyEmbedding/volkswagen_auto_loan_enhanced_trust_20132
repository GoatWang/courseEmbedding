rating drivers strong collateral quality the weighted average wa fico of  is consistent with recently issued valet transactions and combined with the strong internal credit tier distribution indicates a strong borrower however the pool contains a higher concentration of extended term loans which have experienced greater losses historically sufficient credit enhancement ce  incorporates a sequentialpay structure initial ce is 0 of the initial adjusted pool balance growing to  of the initial securitization value annual excess spread is expected to be  ce is sufficient to cover fitchs aaasf stressed loss expectation strong portfoliosecuritization performance losses and delinquency levels on vcis portfolio and prior securitizations have improved dramatically from peak levels in  and  and stabilized at lower levels unstable economic outlook a slower recovery and potential for volatility could affect delinquencies and losses fitchs analysis accounts for this risk by including poorer performing vintages from the recent recession in the base case loss analysis legal structure integrity the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of vci would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities stable originationunderwritingservicing fitch believes vci to be a capable originator underwriter and servicer these capabilities are further evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and securitization performance rating sensitivity unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to valet  to increased credit losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses showing a potential downgrade of one category under fitchs moderate x base case loss scenario the notes could experience downgrades of up to three rating categories although still remaining investment grade under fitchs severe x base case loss scenario the presale report is available to all investors on fitchs website at wwwfitchratingscom for more information about fitchs comprehensive subscription service fitchresearch which
