williamsburg lane chico ca 96  9  6 mastering the art of aging gracefully your custom text here oncology skin care cancer aware skincarerecognizing  working safely within a framework of clinical considerationi am an oncology trained aesthetician through the institute of integrative oncology my primary objective in providing skin care treatments for oncology clients in active treatment or recent recovery is to soothe sensitivity replenish hydration strengthen barrier function and to protect  i am well trained in the ability to work with an implanted port neuropathy lymphedema and compromised lymph nodes keeping the skin as hydrated as possible during cancer treatment is of the utmost importance to also keep the skin feeling good and to prevent cracking and chapping which can lead to infection risk of infection is higher due to the suppressed immune system from the anticancer therapies  additionally many studies show that the power of touch such as through a facial or massage can help reduce pain improve mood and reduce fatigue in cancer patients rest assured i go by the tracy walton pressure scale therefore anyone in active treatment or recently completed treatment can still receive massage by means of stationary weightless or still touch often times a recipient of a facial or massage can go home and report flulike symptoms in the days following the skin care or body work session it may be an indication that the therapist used too much pressure an overly vigorous pace or products practices and methods that were too demanding note flulike symptoms can also be a side effect of the anti cancer therapies not all aestheticians have the proper training on how to work with a client who is in active treatment or who has recently completed treatment make sure when you go to make your next appointment with an aesthetician go to a provider who has been trained from a reputable educator in oncology aesthetics check out these websites for more information  wwwiioncologyorg wwwgreetthedayorg wwwotioncologytrainingcomin my practice i use osmosis a skincare line that has vast array of products specifically designed for people who are in treatment or who have just completed treatment  you want to be very careful about which products you do use just because they’re organic unscented all natural or dermatologist tested doesn’t guarantee the product is anymore safe or effective using a specifically designed product that is oncology friendly is the safest way to go  i have a true passion for helping those with skin concerns affected by cancer or who are immune suppressed  i realize that most days you are being poked and prodded left feeling depleted i have created a space to wrap you up in a cocoon of pure bliss letting go of any worry and relaxing with the confidence that i have the knowledge to properly provide you with a healthful safe and blissful treatment  skincure oncology llc credit report products contacts florida
