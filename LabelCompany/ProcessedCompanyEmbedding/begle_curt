 °f broken clouds home  evansville business  issue archive  december  january   plastics powerhouse plastics powerhouse already the largest private company in indiana berry plastics keeps growing from acquisitions bringing new products to expansions bringing new employees the  billion company fills your house — and car — with plastic by louis la plante and trisha weber  photos by jordan barclay share inside the newly renovated berry plastics building adam unfried and curt begle show off one of the company’s many display roomsinside the newly renovated berry plastics headquarters is a mini cooper the red convertible was lifted into the squarefoot building during the construction phase that finished in february  the car has never been started it doesn’t have gas in the tank it doesn’t run its purpose for sitting two stories above the pavement inside the largest private company in indiana to serve as a prop in a faux garage “prop” seems appropriate curt begle the footinch president of berry’s rigid closed top division jokes that his outstretched frame is longer than the tiny car as he stands next to it along with notmuchshorter colleague adam unfried president of the rigid open top division the car nearly seems like a toy yet the mini cooper is real it shines in one of berry plastic’s display rooms and represents a big concept nearly one year ago berry plastics unveiled the garage along with other exhibition rooms including a kitchen bathroom bedroom and outdoor patio — all stocked with the proper household products just as a home would be these rooms designed by hafer associates demonstrate to berry’s clients what their products would look like in cabinets on shelves in the shower or in their cars the mini cooper’s interior showcases two thermoform drink cups — the kind served at fast food joints — a pack of gum and an unopened box of snack crackers each is packaged in plastic the concept is from former ceo ira boots featured in the februarymarch  issue of evansville business the now retired boots helped berry grow from  million in annual net sales to more than  billion he acquired  companies along the way “under ira’s leadership” says jon rich berry’s current ceo “berry grew from a small evansvillebased plastic molding company to a national leader in the packaging industry” although rich’s plans for berry focus on continuing that growth to mimic boots’ prosperity is a tall order “no matter what i do i’m not going to duplicate ira’s success” rich said at the september meeting for the growth alliance for greater evansville a business incubator he’d have to make berry a  trillion company still early in his position of heading berry plastics rich has made the company bigger again in the early fall of  company officials announced the acquisition of linpac packaging filmco for  million the ohio company which was a subsidiary of a united kingdom plastics giant championed packer processing film think of the plastic wrap surrounding meat sold in groceries but the best proof of berry’s growth resides on the corner of west franklin and oakley streets where the squarefoot expansion is a part of the world headquarters employees barely had time to sit down in their new offices by the time rich announced in june  that berry plastics would soon look for  new hires over the next three years the customer service finance and general administration positions would add to berry’s  employees worldwide the corporation says rich is “a classic american success story” from laundry detergent containers near the washer to lip balm tubes on nightstands the number of berry plastics products has grown exponentially since  originally imperial plastics the company received a name change when floridabased citrus grower jack berry sr bought it in  it since has developed into a leading manufacturer of injectionmolded plastic packaging thermoformed products flexible films and tapes and coatings and has earned an extremely diverse clientele berry plastics’ largest client constitutes only  percent of the business additional clients have created the need for more employees that job announcement in june includes careers beginning with salaries between  plus benefits this declaration followed the  expansion of the thermoforming operations which brought  productionrelated jobs to evansville berry already had been leading the way with thermoforming since acquiring chicagobased landis plastics in  that acquisition says unfried brought “stateoftheart technologies which has allowed us to drive our organic growth while improving our financial performance it is one of the fastest growing technologies and product lines in the country” thermoforming a manufacturing process using heat to mold a plastic sheet into a desired shape allows berry to create a supersized cup designed to fit into any vehicle’s cup holders such as a mini cooper’s thus berry plastics ended what randy hobson the executive vice president of commercial development says was the no  complaint the fast food industry had against drink cups easy spillage the redesigned commodity costs fast food giants more to make but it increased sales because supersized cups universally fit — without spilling “we are the largest supplier in that business today” hobson says “a lot of the expansion in berry has been in the thermoforming area a big part of that was drink cups” berry plastics has made acquisitions that have led to national attention take for example the kerr group the pennsylvaniabased company had just landed a new client target the superstore with nearly  locations in  states and in june  target executives pitched the idea to revamp the cylindrical prescription bottles almost universally used in pharmacies their new bottle came from deborah adler a onetime senior designer for famed new yorkbased design studio milton glaser she recently had witnessed her grandmother suffer from an avoidable illness she accidentally confused her pills with her husband’s medicine — and poor labeling and design were the culprits in her confusion adler’s new bottles known as clearrx showed promise and once on the market in may  her design earned praise news outlets such as new york magazine dedicated pages to the new look consumer attention soon followed they flocked to a prescription system consisting of a wide flat label six colorcoded id rings for each family member purple is the most popular color a patient information card and a label magnifier one month after clearrx’s debut berry plastics acquired kerr group for  million the purchase gave berry nine more domestic facilities and a much bigger product line “they brought with them a broad portfolio of products and customers” says begle “that berry had not been producing prior to that acquisition” from closures to tubes he says the kerr group brought more than clearrx prescription bottles even so it was that bottle that took the spotlight when after five years on the market it received the design of the decade award from the industrial designers society of america growth also comes from berry plastics’ team of designers dedicated to improving the function and aesthetics of plastic products they generate ideas test the potential products with focus groups and review the results in a theater room filled with couches chairs tables and a screen that movie theater owners would envy there they view tapes of consumers trying new products the hope is to create an item ready for the market — and for berry’s display rooms the design team’s work is why evansville fourthgrade students who take field trips to the manufacturing plant downtown scour their household kitchens for items made by berry plastics to find a plastic product made by a different company is a rarity and their efforts lead to continued growth in our  story berry had  employees ranked no  of top private companies in the united states and reached  billion in annual revenue today the company has a workforce of  ranks no  of top private companies and boasted  billion in sales in  each year rich says berry has seen a  percent growth in sales and earnings and in the past year of his leadership two more companies rexam sbc and filmco have been added to the list of acquisitions these moves “not only enhance our reach from a customer and product standpoint” hobson says “but they also bring expertise people and technologies to the company” rich agrees “the key to innovation” he says “is people” « previous  next » section features  topic business and industry log
