tempo bank         proceeds used for loan to employee stock ownership plan         proceeds remaining for new sugar creek             we initially intend to invest the proceeds retained from the offering at new sugar creek in shortterm investments such as us treasury and government agency securities and cash and cash equivalents the actual amounts to be invested in different instruments will depend on the interest rate environment and new sugar creek’s liquidity requirements in the future new sugar creek may liquidate its investments and use those funds  to repurchase shares of its common stock subject to regulatory restrictions  to pay dividends to shareholders subject to regulatory restrictions  to finance the possible acquisition of other financial institutions or other businesses that are related to banking although we currently have no plans arrangements or understandings regarding potential acquisition opportunities and  for general corporate purposes including contributing additional capital to tempo bank under current federal reserve board regulations we may not repurchase shares of our common stock during the first year following completion of the conversion and offering except to fund equity benefit plans other than stock options or with prior regulatory approval when extraordinary circumstances exist tempo bank initially intends to invest the proceeds it receives from the offering which is shown in the table above as the amount contributed to tempo bank in shortterm investments over time tempo bank may use the proceeds that it receives from the offering  to fund new loans  to finance the possible expansion of its business and  for general corporate purposes we currently do not have any specific plans for any expansion or diversification activities that would require funds from this offering consequently we currently anticipate that the proceeds of the offering contributed to tempo bank will be used to fund new loans we expect that much of the loan growth will occur in our one to fourfamily residential mortgage portfolio but we have not allocated specific dollar amounts to any particular area of our portfolio the amount of time that it will take to deploy the proceeds of the offering into loans will depend primarily on the level of loan demand except as described above we have no specific plans for the investment of the proceeds of the offering and have not allocated a specific portion of the proceeds to any particular use we face significant competition for the attraction of deposits and origination of loans our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the many financial institutions operating in our market area and to a lesser extent from other financial service companies such as brokerage firms credit unions and insurance companies several large holding companies operate banks in our market area including bank of america us bancorp and pnc financial services group these institutions are significantly larger than us and therefore have significantly greater resources we also face competition for investors’ funds from money market funds mutual funds and other corporate and government securities at june   which is the most recent date for which data is available from the federal deposit insurance corporation we held  of the deposits in clinton county illinois which was the fifth largest market share out of  institutions having office locations within clinton county our competition for loans comes primarily from financial institutions in our market area and to a lesser extent from other financial service providers such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers competition for loans also comes from the increasing number of nondepository financial service companies entering the mortgage market such as insurance companies securities companies and specialty finance companies we expect competition to remain intense in the future as a result of legislative regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry technological advances for example have lowered barriers to entry allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks changes in federal law permit affiliation among banks securities firms and insurance companies which promotes a competitive environment in the financial services industry competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our growth in the future company description new sugar creek financial corp the shares being offered will be issued by new sugar creek a maryland corporation upon

that are subject to change we are under no duty to and do not take any obligation to update any forwardlooking statements after the date of this form q except as may be required under applicable law

materially different from the results indicated by these forwardlooking statements overviewgeneral our principal business is to acquire deposits from individuals and businesses in the communities surrounding our offices and to use these deposits to fund loans we focus on providing our products and services to two segments of customers income our primary source of income is net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments and interest expense which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income a secondary source of income is noninterest income which is revenue that we receive from providing products and services the majority of our noninterest income generally comes from loan service charges and service charges on deposit accounts expenses the noninterest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of compensation and benefits expenses occupancy expenses equipment and data processing expenses fdic premiums costs from operation of foreclosed real estate professional and regulatory fees and other miscellaneous expenses legal and accounting fees and expenses of stockholder communications and meetings our largest noninterest expense is compensation and benefits which consist primarily of salaries and wages paid to our employees payroll taxes expenses for health insurance retirement plans and other employee benefits including employee stock ownership plan allocations critical accounting policy in the preparation of our financial statements we have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of us gaap our significant accounting policies are described in note  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by us that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities we consider these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies the judgments and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates under different conditions resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations sugar creek financial corp and subsidiary allowance for loan losses we consider the allowance for loan losses to be our critical accounting policy the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses which is charged to operations determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are comparison of financial condition at september   and march   cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents decreased  million to  million at september   from  million at march   primarily as a result of increased loan originations since march   loans the largest segment of our loan portfolio is singlefamily owner occupied residential real estate loans at september   singlefamily owner occupied residential real estate loans totaled  million or  of total loans compared to  million or  of total loans at march   the increase in singlefamily owner occupied residential real estate loans is the result of new originations exceeding repayments singlefamily nonowner occupied residential real estate loans the second largest segment of our loan portfolio totaled  million or  of total loans at september   compared to  million or  of total loans at march   singlefamily nonowner occupied residential real estate loan balances increased due to new originations exceeding repayments multifamily and commercial real estate loans totaled  million or  of total loans at september   compared to  million or  of total loans at march   reductions in these loan segments were a result of repayments by borrowers largely as a result of the competitive environment for financing these types of mortgage loans consumer loan balances totaled  million or  of total loans at september   compared to  million or  of total loans at march   the reduction in consumer loans was a primary result of repayments by borrowers and to a lesser extent by competitive dealer financing offers sugar creek financial corp and subsidiary land loan balances totaled  or  of total loans at september   compared to  million or  of total loans at march   the reduction in this segment of the portfolio is a result of payments and prepayments net of new originations since march   at september   fixedrate loans balloon loans and adjustablerate loans totaled  million  million and  respectively a balloon mortgage is a mortgage that does not fully amortize over the term of the loan and therefore a large portion of the principal balance is repaid with a single payment at the end of its term loan originations for the three months ended september   increased  million to  million from  million for the three months ended september   the

reductions in membership and borrowing activity requirements other assetsother assets totaled  at september   a decrease of  from march   the decrease over the period was due primarily to a lower prepaid multiemployer plan benefit expense and the timing of other prepaid items deposits deposits totaled  million at september   a decrease of  million from march   this decrease in balances

increase is due primarily to higher interest income on loans receivable sugar creek financial corp and subsidiary provision for loan losses we establish provisions for loan losses which are charged to operations at a level we believe to be appropriate to our credit risk profile these provisions represent managements best estimate of probable loan losses in the portfolio in evaluating the allowance
