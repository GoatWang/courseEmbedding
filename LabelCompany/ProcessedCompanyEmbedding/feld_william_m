theory of constraints bob sproull november      recognizing the need to implement quality and eliminate waste companies embrace lean six sigma or a combination of the two typically taking a broad approach that seeks to remediate every process critical or not when this happens efforts become distracted improvements indefinitely delayed and results mediocre at best the ultimate improvement cycle uic integrates lean six sigma and the theory of constraints into a combined strategy that will help you immediately focus your efforts on those areas that will make the greatest difference the book presents basic laws of factory physics that show why the uic delivers significant bottomline improvement while other initiatives so often fail it explains to you why focusing your efforts on apparent problems rather than systemic concerns is wasted effort focus on key areas and take improvement to the next level the ultimate improvement cycle maximizing profits through the integration of lean six sigma and the theory of constraints show you how to draw the best from lean and six sigma by employing principles drawn from the theory of constraints this approach will ensure that your effort is focused in the right place at the right time using the right tools and the right amount of resources this multipronged approach addresses cost accounting variation waste and performance measurements but most importantly it focuses your organization on the right areas to optimize applying years of handson work in many environments bob sproull has developed a unique proven method that capitalizes on a timerelease formula for evoking the key tools that improvement requires he shows you how to take advantage of the cyclical nature of improvement to implement change that is perpetually effective and his approach does not require more resources than you have on hand although originally developed in manufacturing the uic works equally well in any environment whether it be manufacturing or

remove this template message cellular manufacturing is a process of manufacturing which is a subsection of justintime manufacturing and lean manufacturing encompassing group technology the goal of cellular manufacturing is to move as quickly as possible make a wide variety of similar products while making as little waste as possible cellular manufacturing involves the use of multiple cells in an assembly line fashion each of these cells is composed of one or multiple different machines which accomplish a certain task the product moves from one cell to the next each station completing part of the manufacturing process often the cells are arranged in a ushape design because this allows for the overseer to move less and have the ability to more readily watch over the entire process one of the biggest advantages of cellular manufacturing is the amount of flexibility that it has since most of the machines are automatic simple changes can be made very rapidly this allows for a variety of scaling for a product minor changes to the overall design and in extreme cases entirely changing the overall design these changes although tedious can be accomplished extremely quickly and precisely a cell is created by consolidating the processes required to create a specific output such as a part or a set of instructions these cells allow for the reduction of extraneous steps in the process of creating the specific output and facilitate quick identification of problems and encourage communication of employees within the cell in order to resolve issues that arise quickly once implemented cellular manufacturing has been said to reliably create massive gains in productivity and quality while simultaneously reducing the amount of inventory space and lead time required to create a product it is for this reason that the onepieceflow cell has been called the ultimate in lean production contents  history  cell design  implementation process  difficulties in creating flow  benefits and costs  see also  references  further reading historyedit cellular manufacturing is derivative of principles of group technology which were proposed by flanders in  and adopted in russia by mitrofanov in  whose book was translated into english in  burbidge actively promoted group technology in the s apparently japanese firms began implementing cellular manufacturing sometime in the s and in the s cells migrated to the united states as an element of justintime jit production one of the first englishlanguage books to discuss cellular manufacturing that of hall in  referred to a cell as a “uline” for the common or ideal ushaped configuration of a cell—ideal because that shape puts all cell processes and operatives into a cluster affording high visibility and contact by  cells had come to be treated as foundation practices in jit manufacturing so much so that harmon and peterson in their book reinventing the factory included a section entitled cell fundamental factory of the future cellular manufacturing was carried forward in the s when justintime was renamed lean manufacturing finally when jitlean became widely attractive in the service sector cellular concepts found their way into that realm for example hyer and wemmerlöv’s final chapter is devoted to office cells cell designedit cells are created in a workplace to facilitate flow this is accomplished by bringing together operations or machines or people involved in a processing sequence of a products natural flow and grouping them close to one another distinct from other groups this grouping is called a cell these cells are used to improve many factors in a manufacturing setting by allowing onepiece flow to occur an example of onepiece flow would be in the production of a metallic case part that arrives at the factory from the vendor in separate pieces requiring assembly first the pieces would be moved from storage to the cell where they would be welded together then polished then coated and finally packaged all of these steps would be completed in a single cell so as to minimize various factors called nonvalueadded processessteps such as time required to transport materials between steps some common formats of single cells are the ushape good for communication and quick movement of workers the straight line or the lshape the number of workers inside these formations depend on current demand and can be modulated to increase or decrease production for example if a cell is normally occupied by two workers and demand is doubled four workers should be placed in the cell similarly if demand halves one worker will occupy the cell since cells have a variety of differing equipment it is therefore a requirement that any employee is skilled at multiple processes this figure from the toyota way shows the design of a ushaped cell graphing the paths of two employees through it while there exist many advantages to forming cells there are some obvious benefits it is quickly evident from observation of cells where inefficiencies lie such as when an employee is too busy or relatively inactive resolving these inefficiencies can increase production and productivity by up to and above  in many cases in addition to this formation of cells consistently frees up floor space in the manufacturingassembly environment by having inventory only where it is absolutely required improves safety in the work environment due to smaller quantities of productinventory being handled improves morale by imparting feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction in employees reduces cost of inventory and reducing inventory obsolescence when formation of a cell would be too difficult a simple principle is applied in order to improve efficiencies and flow that is to perform processes in a specific location and gather materials to that point at a rate dictated by an average of customer demand this rate is called the takt time this is referred to as the pacemaker process despite the advantages of designing for onepieceflow the formation of a cell must be carefully considered before implementation use of costly and complex equipment that tends to break down can cause massive delays in the production and will ruin output until they can be brought back online a cell is a small organizational unitdesigned to exploit similarities in how you process information make products and serve customers manufacturing cells closely locate people and equipment required for processing families of like products prior to cellularization parts may have traveled miles to visit all the equipment and labor needed for their fabrication after reorganization families of similar parts are produced together within the physical confines of cells that house most or all of the required resourcesfacilitating the rapid flow and efficient processing of material and information furthermore cell operators can be crosstrained in several machines engage in job rotation and assume responsibilities for tasks that previously belonged to supervisors and support staff including activities such as planning and scheduling quality control troubleshooting parts ordering interfacing with customers and suppliers and recordkeeping the short travel distances within cells serve to quicken the flows moreover the compactness of a cell minimizes space that might allow buildups of inventory between cell stations to formalize that advantage cells often have designedin rules or physical devices that limit the amount of inventory between stations such a rule is known in jitlean parlance as kanban from the japanese which establishes a maximum number of units allowable between a providing and a using work station discussion and illustrations of cells in combinations with kanban are found in the simplest form kanban squares are marked areas on floors or tables between work stations the rule applied to the producing station if all squares are full stop if not fill them up an office cell applies the same ideas clusters of broadly trained cellteam members that in concert quickly handle all of the processing for a family of services or customers a virtual cell is a variation in which all cell resources are not brought together in a physical space in a virtual cell as in the standard model team members and their equipment are dedicated to a family of products or services although people and equipment are physically dispersed as in a job shop their narrow product focus aims for and achieves quick throughput with all its advantages just as if the equipment were moved into a cellular cluster lacking the visibility of physical cells virtual cells may employ the discipline of kanban rules in order to tightly link the flows from process to process a simple but rather complete description of cell implementation comes from a  booklet of  pages by kone corp in finland producer of elevators escalators and the like excerpts follow the first step involved creating cells in the assembly electrical and chemical testing departments in april  six cells identified by different colors were established all devices manufactured in cells are identified by the cells color and all feedback from quality control is directed straight to the workers of the cell concerned the second step in summer  was to cellularize manufacture of the analyzer subassemblies that are needed in the analyzer cells and to test them if necessary production of the five subassembly cells consists exclusively of certain analyzer subunits the parts and materials are located in the cells material control between the cells is based on the pull system and actual demand in the analyzer cells there is a buffer consisting of two pieces for each roughly  different subunit when one piece is taken into assembly a new one is ordered from the corresponding unitcell the order is made using a magnetic kanban button which identifies the ordering cell by color unit by code and order date when the manufacturing cell has completed the order the unit is taken with the kanban button to its place on the ordering cell shelf orders from the unit cells to the subcells are based on the same principle the only difference is that the buffer size is six subunits this procedure was implemented in august  implementation processedit in order to implement cellular manufacturing a number of steps must be performed first the parts to be made must be grouped by similarity in design or manufacturing requirements into families then a systematic analysis of each family must be performed typically in the form of production flow analysis pfa for manufacturing families or in the examination of designproduct data for design families this analysis can be time consuming and costly but is important because a cell needs to be created for each family of parts there are also a number of mathematical models and algorithms to aid in planning a cellular manufacturing center which take into account a variety of important variables such as multiple plant locations multimarket allocations with production planning and various part mix once these variables are determined with a given level of uncertainty optimizations can be performed to minimize factors such as total cost of holding intercell material handling external transportation fixed cost for producing each part in each plant machine and labor salaries difficulties in creating flowedit the key to creating flow is continuous improvement to production processes upon implementation of cellular manufacturing management commonly encounters strong resistance from production workers it will be beneficial to allow the change to cellular manufacturing to happen gradually it is also difficult to fight the desire to have some inventory on hand it is tempting since it would be easier to recover from an employee suddenly having to take sick leave unfortunately in cellular manufacturing it is important to remember the main tenants you sink or swim together as a unit and that inventory hides problems and inefficiencies if the problems are not identified and subsequently resolved the process will not improve another common set of problems stems from the need to transfer materials between operations these problems include exceptional elements number of voids machine distances bottleneck machines and parts machine location and relocation part routing cell load variation inter and intracellular material transferring cell reconfiguring dynamic part demands and operation and completion times these difficulties need to be considered and addressed to create efficient flow in cellular manufacturing benefits and costsedit cellular manufacturing brings scattered processes together to form short focused paths in concentrated physical space so constructed by logic a cell reduces flow time flow distance floor space inventory handling scheduling transactions and scrap and rework the latter because of quick discovery of nonconformities moreover cells lead to simplified higher validity costing since the costs of producing items are contained within the cell rather scattered in distance and the passage of reporting time cellular manufacturing facilitates both production and quality control cells that are underperforming in either volume or quality can be easily isolated and targeted for improvement the segmentation of the production process allows problems to be easily located and it is more clear which parts are affected by the problem there are also a number of benefits for employees working in cellular manufacturing the small cell structure improves group cohesiveness and scales the manufacturing process down to a more manageable level for the workers workers can more easily see problems or possible improvements within their own cells and tend to be more selfmotivated to propose changes additionally these improvements that are instigated by the workers themselves cause less and less need for management so over time overhead costs can be reduced furthermore the workers often are able to rotate between tasks within their cell which offers variety in their work this can further increase efficiency because work monotony has been linked to absenteeism and reduced production quality case studies in justintime and lean manufacturing are replete with impressive quantitative measures along those lines for example bae systems platform solutions fort wayne ind producing aircraft engine monitors and controls implemented cells for  percent of production reducing customer lead time  percent workinprocess inventory  percent space for one product family from  square feet to  square feet while increasing product reliability  percent multiskilling the unionshop work force and being designated an industry week best plant for the year  by five years later rework and scrap had been cut  percent new product introduction cycles  percent and transactions  percent while also increasing inventory turns threefold and service turn times  percent and being awarded a shingo prize for the year  it appears to be difficult to isolate how much of those benefits accrue from cellular organization itself among many case studies researched for this article few include attempts at isolating the benefits one exception is the contention at steward inc chattanooga tenn producing nickel zinc ferrite parts for electromagnetic interference suppression according to case study authors cells resulted in reductions of cycle time from  to  days workinprocess inventories by  percent finished inventories by  percent lateness by  percent and space by  percent another cellular case study includes quantitative estimates of the extent to which cells contributed to overall benefits at hughes

machines or people involved in a processing sequence of a products natural flow and grouping them close to one another distinct from other groups this grouping is called a cell these cells are used to improve many factors in a manufacturing setting by allowing onepiece flow to occur an example of onepiece flow would be in the production of a metallic case part that arrives at the factory from the vendor in separate pieces requiring assembly first the pieces would be moved from storage to the cell where they would be welded together then polished then coated and finally packaged all of these steps would be completed in a single cell so as to minimize various factors called nonvalueadded processessteps such as time required to transport materials between steps some common formats of single cells are the ushape good for communication and quick movement of workers the straight line or the lshape the number of workers inside these formations depend on current demand and can be modulated to increase or decrease production for example if a cell is normally occupied by two workers and demand is doubled four workers should be placed in the cell similarly if demand halves one worker will occupy the cell since cells have a variety of differing equipment it is therefore a requirement that any employee is skilled at multiple processes this figure from the toyota way shows the design of a ushaped cell graphing the paths of two employees through it while there exist many advantages to forming cells there are some obvious benefits it is quickly evident from observation of cells where inefficiencies lie such as when an employee is too busy or relatively inactive resolving these inefficiencies can increase production and productivity by up to and above  in many cases in addition to

to smaller quantities of productinventory being handled improves morale by imparting feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction in employees reduces cost of inventory and reducing inventory obsolescence when formation of a cell would be too difficult a simple principle is applied in order to improve efficiencies and flow that is to perform processes in a specific location and gather materials to that point at a rate dictated by an average of customer demand this rate is called the takt time this is referred to as the pacemaker process despite the advantages of designing for onepieceflow the formation of a cell must be carefully considered before implementation use of costly and complex equipment that tends to break down can cause massive delays in the production and will ruin output until they can be brought back online a cell is a small organizational unitdesigned to exploit similarities in how you process information make products and serve customers manufacturing cells closely locate people and equipment required for processing families of like products prior to cellularization parts may have traveled miles to visit all the equipment and labor needed for their

belonged to supervisors and support staff including activities such as planning and scheduling quality control troubleshooting parts ordering interfacing with customers and suppliers and recordkeeping the short travel distances within cells serve to quicken the flows moreover the compactness of a cell minimizes space that might allow buildups of inventory between cell stations to formalize that advantage cells often have designedin rules or physical devices that limit the amount of inventory between stations such a rule is known in jitlean parlance as kanban from the japanese which establishes a maximum number of units allowable between a providing and a using work station discussion and illustrations of cells in combinations with kanban are found in the simplest form kanban squares are marked areas on floors or tables between work stations the rule applied to the producing station if all squares are full stop if not fill them up an office cell applies the same ideas clusters of broadly trained cellteam members that in concert quickly handle all of the processing for a family of services or customers a virtual cell is a variation in which all cell resources are not brought together in a physical space in a virtual cell as in the standard model team members and their equipment are dedicated to a family of products or services although people and equipment are physically dispersed as in a job shop their narrow product focus aims for and achieves quick throughput with all its advantages just as if the equipment were moved into a cellular cluster lacking the visibility of physical cells virtual cells may employ the discipline of kanban rules in order to tightly link the flows from process to process a simple but rather complete description of cell implementation comes from a  booklet of  pages by kone corp in finland producer of elevators escalators and the like excerpts follow the first step involved creating cells in the assembly electrical and chemical testing departments in april  six cells identified by different colors were established all devices manufactured in cells are identified by the cells color and all feedback from quality control is directed straight to the workers of the cell concerned the second step in summer  was to cellularize manufacture of the analyzer subassemblies that are needed in the analyzer cells and to test them if necessary production of the five subassembly cells consists exclusively of certain analyzer subunits the parts and materials are located in the cells material control between the cells is based on the pull system and actual demand in the analyzer cells there is a buffer consisting of two pieces for each roughly  different subunit when one piece is taken into assembly a new one is ordered from the corresponding unitcell the order is made using a magnetic kanban button which identifies the ordering cell by color unit by code and order date when the manufacturing cell has completed the order the unit is taken with the kanban button to its place on the ordering cell shelf orders from the unit cells to the subcells are based on the same principle the only difference is that the buffer size is six subunits this procedure was implemented in august  implementation processedit in order to implement cellular manufacturing a number of steps must be performed first the parts to be made must be grouped by similarity in design or manufacturing requirements into families then a systematic analysis of each family must be performed typically in the form of production flow analysis pfa for manufacturing families or in the examination of designproduct data for design families this analysis can be time consuming and costly but is important because a cell needs to be created for each family of parts there are also a number of mathematical models and algorithms to aid in planning a cellular manufacturing center which take into account a variety of important variables such as multiple plant locations multimarket allocations with production planning and various part mix once these variables are determined with a given level of uncertainty optimizations can be performed to minimize factors such as total cost of holding intercell material handling external transportation fixed cost for producing each part in each plant machine and labor salaries difficulties in creating flowedit the key to creating flow is continuous improvement to production processes upon implementation of cellular manufacturing management commonly encounters strong resistance from production workers it will be beneficial to allow the change to cellular manufacturing to happen gradually it is also difficult to fight the desire to have some inventory on hand it is tempting since it would be easier to recover from an employee suddenly having to take sick leave unfortunately in cellular manufacturing it is important to remember the main tenants you sink or swim together as a unit and that inventory hides problems and inefficiencies if the problems are not identified and subsequently resolved the process will not improve another common set of problems stems from the need to transfer materials between operations these problems include exceptional elements number of voids machine distances bottleneck machines and parts machine location and relocation part routing cell load variation inter and intracellular material transferring cell reconfiguring dynamic part demands and operation and completion times these difficulties need to be considered and addressed to create efficient flow in cellular manufacturing benefits and costsedit cellular manufacturing brings scattered processes together to form short focused paths in concentrated physical space so constructed by logic a cell reduces flow time flow distance floor space inventory handling scheduling transactions and scrap and rework the latter because of quick discovery of nonconformities moreover cells lead to simplified higher validity costing since the costs of producing items are contained within the cell rather scattered in distance and the passage of reporting time cellular manufacturing facilitates both production and quality control cells that are underperforming in either volume or quality can be easily isolated and targeted for improvement the segmentation of the production process allows problems to be easily located and it is more clear which parts are affected by the problem there are also a number of benefits for employees working in cellular manufacturing the small cell structure improves group cohesiveness and scales the manufacturing process down to a more manageable level for the workers workers can more easily see problems or possible improvements within their own cells and tend to be more selfmotivated to propose changes additionally these improvements that are instigated by the workers themselves cause less and less need for management so over time overhead costs can be reduced furthermore the workers often are able to rotate between tasks within their cell which offers variety in their work this can further increase efficiency because work monotony has been linked to absenteeism and reduced production quality case studies in justintime and lean manufacturing are replete with impressive quantitative measures along those lines for example bae systems platform solutions fort wayne ind producing aircraft engine monitors and controls implemented cells for  percent of production reducing customer lead time  percent workinprocess inventory  percent space for one product family from  square feet to  square feet while increasing product reliability  percent multiskilling the unionshop work force and being designated an industry week best plant for the year  by five years later rework and scrap had been cut  percent new product introduction cycles  percent and transactions  percent while also increasing inventory turns threefold and service turn times  percent and being awarded a shingo prize for the year  it appears to be difficult to isolate how much of those benefits accrue from cellular organization itself among many case studies researched for this article few include attempts at isolating the benefits one exception is the contention at steward inc chattanooga tenn producing nickel zinc ferrite parts for electromagnetic interference suppression according to case study authors cells resulted in reductions of cycle time from  to  days workinprocess inventories by  percent finished inventories by  percent lateness by  percent and space by  percent another cellular case study includes quantitative estimates of the extent to which cells contributed to overall benefits at hughes

difficulties in creating flowedit the key to creating flow is continuous improvement to production processes upon implementation of cellular manufacturing management commonly encounters strong resistance from production workers it will be beneficial to allow the change to cellular manufacturing to happen gradually it is also difficult to fight the desire to have some inventory on hand it is

for management so over time overhead costs can be reduced furthermore the workers often are able to rotate between tasks within their cell which offers variety in their work this can further increase

message cellular manufacturing is a process of manufacturing which is a subsection of justintime manufacturing and lean manufacturing encompassing group technology the goal of cellular manufacturing is to move as quickly as possible make a wide variety of similar products while making as little waste as possible cellular manufacturing involves the use of multiple cells in an assembly line fashion each of these cells is composed of one or multiple different machines which accomplish a certain task the product moves from one cell to the next each station completing part of the manufacturing process often the cells are arranged in a ushape design because this allows for the overseer to move less and have the ability to more readily watch over the entire process one of the biggest advantages of cellular manufacturing is the amount of flexibility that it has since most of the machines are automatic simple changes can be made very rapidly this allows for a variety of scaling for a product minor changes to the overall design and in extreme cases entirely changing the overall design these changes although tedious can be accomplished extremely quickly and precisely a cell is created by consolidating the processes required to create a specific output such as a part or a set of instructions these cells allow for the reduction of extraneous steps in the process of creating the specific output and facilitate quick identification of problems and encourage communication of employees within the cell in order to resolve issues that arise quickly once implemented cellular manufacturing has been said to reliably create massive gains in productivity and quality while simultaneously reducing the amount of inventory space and lead time required to create a product it is for this reason that the onepieceflow cell has been called the ultimate in lean production contents  history  cell design  implementation process  difficulties in creating flow  benefits and costs  see also  references  further reading historyedit cellular manufacturing is derivative of principles of group technology which were proposed by flanders in  and adopted in russia by mitrofanov in  whose book was translated into english in  burbidge actively promoted group technology in the s apparently japanese firms began implementing cellular manufacturing sometime in the s and in the s cells migrated to the united states as an element of justintime jit production one of the first englishlanguage books to discuss cellular manufacturing that of hall in  referred to a cell as a “uline” for the common or ideal ushaped configuration of a cell—ideal because that shape puts all cell processes and operatives into a cluster affording high visibility and contact by  cells had come to be treated as foundation practices in jit manufacturing so much so that harmon and peterson in their book reinventing the factory included a section entitled cell fundamental factory of the future cellular manufacturing was carried forward in the s when justintime was renamed lean manufacturing finally when jitlean became widely attractive in the service sector cellular concepts found their way into that realm for example hyer and wemmerlöv’s final chapter is devoted to office cells cell designedit cells are created in a workplace to facilitate flow this is accomplished by bringing together operations or machines or people involved in a processing sequence of a products natural flow and grouping them close to one another distinct from other groups this grouping is called a cell these cells are used to improve many factors in a manufacturing setting by allowing onepiece flow to occur an example of onepiece flow would be in the production of a metallic case part that arrives at the factory from the vendor in separate pieces requiring assembly first the pieces would be moved from storage to the cell where they would be welded together then polished then coated and finally packaged all of these steps would be completed in a single cell so as to minimize various factors called nonvalueadded processessteps such as time required to transport materials between steps some common formats of single cells are the ushape good for communication and quick movement of workers the straight line or the lshape the number of workers inside these formations depend on current demand and can be modulated to increase or decrease production for example if a cell is normally occupied by two workers and demand is doubled four workers should be placed in the cell similarly if demand halves one worker will occupy the cell since cells have a variety of differing equipment it is therefore a requirement that any employee is skilled at multiple processes this figure from the toyota way shows the design of a ushaped cell graphing the paths of two employees through it while there exist many advantages to forming cells there are some obvious benefits it is quickly evident from observation of cells where inefficiencies lie such as when an employee is too busy or relatively inactive resolving these inefficiencies can increase production and productivity by up to and above  in many cases in addition to this formation of cells consistently frees up floor space in the manufacturingassembly environment by having inventory only where it is absolutely required improves safety in the work environment due to smaller quantities of productinventory being handled improves morale by imparting feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction in employees reduces cost of inventory and reducing inventory obsolescence when formation of a cell would be too difficult a simple principle is applied in order to improve efficiencies and flow that is to perform processes in a specific location and gather materials to that point at a rate dictated by an average of customer demand this rate is called the takt time this is referred to as the pacemaker process despite the advantages of designing for onepieceflow the formation of a cell must be carefully considered before implementation use of costly and complex equipment that tends to break down can cause massive delays in the production and will ruin output until they can be brought back online a cell is a small organizational unitdesigned to exploit similarities in how you process information make products and serve customers manufacturing cells closely locate people and equipment required for processing families of like products prior to cellularization parts may have traveled miles to visit all the equipment and labor needed for their fabrication after reorganization families of similar parts are produced together within the physical confines of cells that house most or all of the required resourcesfacilitating the rapid flow and efficient processing of material and information furthermore cell operators can be crosstrained in several machines engage in job rotation and assume responsibilities for tasks that previously belonged to supervisors and support staff including activities such as planning and scheduling quality control troubleshooting parts ordering interfacing with customers and suppliers and recordkeeping the short travel distances within cells serve to quicken the flows moreover the compactness of a cell minimizes space that might allow buildups of inventory between cell stations to formalize that advantage cells often have designedin rules or physical devices that limit the amount of inventory between stations such a rule is known in jitlean parlance as kanban from the japanese which establishes a maximum number of units allowable between a providing and a using work station discussion and illustrations of cells in combinations with kanban are found in the simplest form kanban squares are marked areas on floors or tables between work stations the rule applied to the producing station if all squares are full stop if not fill them up an office cell applies the same ideas clusters of broadly trained cellteam members that in concert quickly handle all of the processing for a family of services or customers a virtual cell is a variation in which all cell resources are not brought together in a physical space in a virtual cell as in the standard model team members and their equipment are dedicated to a family of products or services although people and equipment are physically dispersed as in a job shop their narrow product focus aims for and achieves quick throughput with all its advantages just as if the equipment were moved into a cellular cluster lacking the visibility of physical cells virtual cells may employ the discipline of kanban rules in order to tightly link the flows from process to process a simple but rather complete description of cell implementation comes from a  booklet of  pages by kone corp in finland producer of elevators escalators and the like excerpts follow the first step involved creating cells in the assembly electrical and chemical testing departments in april  six cells identified by different colors were established all devices manufactured in cells are identified by the cells color and all feedback from quality control is directed straight to the workers of the cell concerned the second step in summer  was to cellularize manufacture of the analyzer subassemblies that are needed in the analyzer cells and to test them if necessary production of the five subassembly cells consists exclusively of certain analyzer subunits the parts and materials are located in the cells material control between the cells is based on the pull system and actual demand in the analyzer cells there is a buffer consisting of two pieces for each roughly  different subunit when one piece is taken into assembly a new one is ordered from the corresponding unitcell the order is made using a magnetic kanban button which identifies the ordering cell by color unit by code and order date when the manufacturing cell has completed the order the unit is taken with the kanban button to its place on the ordering cell shelf orders from the unit cells to the subcells are based on the same principle the only difference is that the buffer size is six subunits this procedure was implemented in august  implementation processedit in order to implement cellular manufacturing a number of steps must be performed first the parts to be made must be grouped by similarity in design or manufacturing requirements into families then a systematic analysis of each family must be performed typically in the form of production flow analysis pfa for manufacturing families or in the examination of designproduct data for design families this analysis can be time consuming and costly but is important because a cell needs to be created for each family of parts there are also a number of mathematical models and algorithms to aid in planning a cellular manufacturing center which take into

to the overall design and in extreme cases entirely changing the overall design these changes although tedious can be accomplished extremely quickly and precisely a cell is created by consolidating the processes required to create a specific output such as a part or a set of instructions these cells allow for the reduction of extraneous steps in the process of creating the specific output and facilitate quick identification of problems and encourage communication of employees within the cell in order to resolve issues that arise quickly once implemented cellular manufacturing has been said to reliably create massive gains in productivity and quality while simultaneously reducing the amount of inventory space and lead time required to create a product it is for this reason that the onepieceflow cell has been called the ultimate in lean production contents  history  cell design  implementation process  difficulties in creating flow  benefits and costs  see also  references  further reading historyedit cellular manufacturing is derivative of principles of group technology which were proposed by flanders in  and adopted in russia by mitrofanov in  whose book was translated into english in  burbidge actively promoted group technology in the s apparently japanese firms began implementing cellular manufacturing sometime in the s and in the s cells migrated to the united states as an element of justintime jit production one of the first englishlanguage books to discuss cellular manufacturing that of hall in  referred to a cell as a “uline” for the common or ideal ushaped configuration of a cell—ideal because that shape puts all cell processes and operatives into a cluster affording high visibility and contact by  cells had come to be treated as foundation practices in jit manufacturing so much so that harmon and peterson in their book reinventing the factory included a section entitled cell fundamental factory of the future cellular manufacturing was carried forward in the s when justintime was renamed lean manufacturing finally when jitlean became widely attractive in the service sector cellular concepts found their way into that realm for example hyer and wemmerlöv’s final chapter is devoted to office cells cell designedit cells are created in a workplace to facilitate flow this is accomplished by bringing together operations or machines or people involved in a processing sequence of a products natural flow and grouping them close to one another distinct from other groups this grouping is called a cell these cells are used to improve many factors in a manufacturing setting by allowing onepiece flow to occur an example of onepiece flow would be in the production of a metallic case part that arrives at the factory from the vendor in separate pieces requiring assembly first the pieces would be moved from storage to the cell where they would be welded together then polished then coated and finally packaged all of these steps would be completed in a single cell so as to minimize various factors called nonvalueadded processessteps such as time required to transport materials between steps some common formats of single cells are the ushape good for communication and quick movement of workers the straight line or the lshape the number of workers inside these formations depend on current demand and can be modulated to increase or decrease production for example if a cell is normally occupied by two workers and demand is doubled four workers should be placed in the cell similarly if demand halves one worker will occupy the cell since cells have a variety of differing equipment it is therefore a requirement that any employee is skilled at multiple processes this figure from the toyota way shows the design of a ushaped cell graphing the paths of two employees through it while there exist many advantages to forming cells there are some obvious benefits it is quickly evident from observation of cells where inefficiencies lie such as when an employee is too busy or relatively inactive resolving these inefficiencies can increase production and productivity by up to and above  in many cases in addition to this formation of cells consistently frees up floor space in the manufacturingassembly environment by having inventory only where it is absolutely required improves safety in the work environment due to smaller quantities of productinventory being handled improves morale by imparting feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction in employees reduces cost of inventory and reducing inventory obsolescence when formation of a cell would be too difficult a simple principle is applied in order to improve efficiencies and flow that is to perform processes in a specific location and gather materials to that point at a rate dictated by an average of customer demand this rate is called the takt time this is referred to as the pacemaker process despite the advantages of designing for onepieceflow the formation of a cell must be carefully considered before implementation use of costly and complex equipment that tends to break down can cause massive delays in the production and will ruin output until they can be brought back online a cell is a small organizational unitdesigned to exploit similarities in how you process information make products and serve customers manufacturing cells closely locate people and equipment required for processing families of like products prior to cellularization parts may have traveled miles to visit all the equipment and labor needed for their fabrication after reorganization families of similar parts are produced together within the physical confines of cells that house most or all of the required resourcesfacilitating the rapid flow and efficient processing of material and information furthermore cell operators can be crosstrained in several machines engage in job rotation and assume responsibilities for tasks that previously belonged to supervisors and support staff including activities such as planning and scheduling quality control troubleshooting parts ordering interfacing with customers and suppliers and recordkeeping the short travel distances within cells serve to quicken the flows moreover the compactness of a cell minimizes space that might allow buildups of inventory between cell stations to formalize that advantage cells often have designedin rules or physical devices that limit the amount of inventory between stations such a rule is known in jitlean parlance as kanban from the japanese which establishes a maximum number of units allowable between a providing and a using work station discussion and illustrations of cells in combinations with kanban are found in the simplest form kanban squares are marked areas on floors or tables between work stations the rule applied to the producing station if all squares are full stop if not fill them up an office cell applies the same ideas clusters of broadly trained cellteam members that in concert quickly handle all of the processing for a family of services or customers a virtual cell is a variation in which all cell resources are not brought together in a physical space in a virtual cell as in the standard model team members and their equipment are dedicated to a family of products or services although people and equipment are physically dispersed as in a job shop their narrow product focus aims for and achieves quick throughput with all its advantages just as if the equipment were moved into a cellular cluster lacking the visibility of physical cells virtual cells may employ the discipline of kanban rules in order to tightly link the flows from process to process a simple but rather complete description of cell implementation comes from a  booklet of  pages by kone corp in finland producer of elevators escalators and the like excerpts follow the first step involved creating cells in the assembly electrical and chemical testing departments in april  six cells identified by different colors were established all devices manufactured in cells are identified by the cells color and all feedback from quality control is directed straight to the workers of the cell concerned the second step in summer  was to cellularize manufacture of the analyzer subassemblies that are needed in the analyzer cells and to test them if necessary production of the five subassembly cells consists exclusively of certain analyzer subunits the parts and materials are located in the cells material control between the cells is based on the pull system and actual demand in the analyzer cells there is a buffer consisting of two pieces for each roughly  different subunit when one piece is taken into assembly a new one is ordered from the corresponding unitcell the order is made using a magnetic kanban button which identifies the ordering cell by color unit by code and order date when the manufacturing cell has completed the order the unit is taken with the kanban button to its place on the ordering cell shelf orders from the unit cells to the subcells are based on the same principle the only difference is that the buffer size is six subunits this procedure was implemented in august  implementation processedit in order to implement cellular manufacturing a number of steps must be performed first the parts to be made must be grouped by similarity in design or manufacturing requirements into families then a systematic analysis of each family must be performed typically in the form of production flow analysis pfa for manufacturing families or in the examination of designproduct data for design families this analysis can be time consuming and costly but is important because a cell needs to be created for each family of parts there are also a number of mathematical models and algorithms to aid in planning a cellular manufacturing center which take into account a variety of important variables such as multiple plant locations multimarket allocations with production planning and various part mix once these variables are determined with a given level of uncertainty optimizations can be performed to minimize factors such as total cost of holding intercell material handling external transportation fixed cost for producing each part in each plant machine and labor salaries difficulties in creating flowedit the key to creating flow is continuous improvement to production processes upon implementation of cellular manufacturing management commonly encounters strong resistance from production workers it will be beneficial to allow the change to cellular manufacturing to happen gradually it is also difficult to fight the desire to have some inventory on hand it is tempting since it would be easier to recover from an employee suddenly having to take sick leave unfortunately in cellular manufacturing it is important to remember the main tenants you sink or swim together as a unit and that inventory hides problems and inefficiencies if the problems are not identified and subsequently resolved the process will not improve another common set of problems stems from the need to transfer materials between operations these problems include exceptional elements number of voids machine distances bottleneck machines and parts machine location and relocation part routing cell load variation inter and intracellular material transferring cell reconfiguring dynamic part demands and operation and completion times these difficulties need to be considered and addressed to create efficient flow in cellular manufacturing benefits and costsedit cellular manufacturing brings scattered processes together to form short focused paths in concentrated physical space so constructed by logic a cell reduces flow time flow distance floor space inventory handling scheduling transactions and scrap and rework the latter because of quick discovery of nonconformities moreover cells lead to simplified higher validity costing since the costs of producing items are contained within the cell rather scattered in distance and the passage of reporting time cellular manufacturing facilitates both production and quality control cells that are underperforming in either volume or quality can be easily isolated and targeted for improvement the segmentation of the production process allows problems to be easily located and it is more clear which parts are affected by the problem there are also a number of benefits for employees working in cellular manufacturing the small cell structure improves group cohesiveness and scales the manufacturing process down to a more manageable level for the workers workers can more easily see problems or possible improvements within their own cells and tend to be more selfmotivated to propose changes additionally these improvements that are instigated by the workers themselves cause less and less need for management so over time overhead costs can be reduced furthermore the workers often are able to rotate between tasks within their cell which offers variety in their work this can further increase efficiency because work monotony has been linked to absenteeism and reduced production quality case studies in justintime and lean manufacturing are replete with impressive quantitative measures along those lines for example bae systems platform solutions fort wayne ind producing aircraft engine monitors and controls implemented cells for  percent of production reducing customer lead time  percent workinprocess inventory  percent space for one product family from  square feet to  square feet while increasing product reliability  percent multiskilling the unionshop work force and being designated an industry week best plant for the year  by five years later rework and scrap had been cut  percent new product introduction cycles  percent and transactions  percent while also increasing inventory turns threefold and service turn times  percent and being awarded a shingo prize for the year  it appears to be difficult to isolate how much of those benefits accrue from cellular organization itself among many case studies researched for this article few include attempts at isolating the benefits one exception is the contention at steward inc chattanooga tenn producing nickel zinc ferrite parts for electromagnetic interference suppression according to case study authors cells resulted in reductions of cycle time from  to  days workinprocess inventories by  percent finished inventories by  percent lateness by  percent and space by  percent another cellular case study includes quantitative estimates of the extent to which cells contributed to overall benefits at hughes ground systems group fullerton calif producing circuit cards for defense equipment the first cell which began as a pilot project with  volunteers was launched in  one month later a second cell began and by  all production employees numbering about  had been integrated into seven cells prior to cells circuit card cycle time from kit release to shipment to the customer had been  weeks after the cells had taken over the full production sequence mechanical assembly wave solder thermal cycle and conformal coat cycle time had fallen to  weeks of which production manager john reiss attributed  weeks to use of a wip chart system by the cell teams and the other  weeks to the cellular organization itself later when it seemed that the cells were overly large and cumbersome cell sizes were shrunk by twothirds resulting in “micro cells” that cut cycle time by another  weeks finally by adopting certain other improvements cycle times had decreased to four weeks other improvements included reducing workinprocess inventory from  or  days to one day and percent defective from  to  switching from a functional jobshop layout to cells often costs has a minus net cost inasmuch as the cell reduces costs of transport workinprocess and finished inventory transactions and rework when large heavy expensive pieces of equipment sometimes called “monuments” in lean lingo must be moved however the initial costs can be high to the point where cells are not feasible there are a number of possible limitations to implementing cellular manufacturing some argue that cellular manufacturing can lead to a decrease in production flexibility cells are typically designed to maintain a specific flow volume of parts being produced should the demand or necessary quantity decrease the cells may have to be realigned to match the new requirements which is a costly operation and one not typically required in other manufacturing setups see alsoedit crosstraining business world class manufacturing

work feld explores why an integrated approach is so much more beneficial in securing sustained improvement he focuses on the interdependency of the five primary elements organization metrics logistics manufacturing flow and process control he describes a proven applied approach to creating a lean program using these elements to keep up globally and even locally your manufacturing operation must be responsive flexible predictable and consistent you must continually improve manufacturing operations and cultivate a self directed work force driven by output based customer performance criteria by
