preventing pressure sores regarding the roho family of products the high profile  cells line of products are going to offer the most immersion sinking in into the cushion this greater immersion will increase the force weight redistribution of the client thus decreasing peek pressures and improving comfort decreasing pain and preventing pressure ulcers through this immersion you are better able to redistribute equalize the weight force of the client onto their thighs greater trochanters hips and the ischial tuberosities buttocks through immersion into the  cells a roho cushion aims to reduce the extrinsic risk factors of peak pressures shear and friction and microclimate in pressure ulcer development however it is important to assess the client individually for other risk factors including but not limited to nutrition circulation and previous history of pressure ulcers which no cushion is able to affectively address can i place an incontinence pad towel drawl sheet or hoyer lift sling over top a roho cushion andor a roho mattress unfortunately anything that you place over a roho cushion or mattress actually any cushion or mattress can interfere with the effectiveness a roho cushionmattress works by increasing the contact area of the individual when they immerse sink into the product thus redistributing the force so there is limited peek pressures at one specific landmark when anything is placed between an individual and the cushionmattress surface tension is increased and thus they have a more difficult time immersing sinking into the cushionmattress effectively however since each and every individual needs to be treated individually and a plan of care needs to be considered based upon that individual’s specific circumstances we also realize that other needs like incontinence safety during transfers etc need to be considered a licensed healthcare professional should weigh the risks of placing a pad towel or hoyer lift sling thus reducing the effectiveness of the cushionmattress versus the risk of not placing these items if an incontinence pad or drawl sheet is required while the individual is sitting on the cushion or lying on the mattress it is our recommendation that the least amount of layers are used and these padssheets are put overtop the cushionmattress in a fashion where they are very loose and not tight if the removal of a hoyer lift sling from underneath a patient who was transferred onto the cushion is going to cause increased shear and friction which may be detrimental to an individual’s skin a licensed healthcare professional should weigh the risks of keeping the client on the cushion with the sling in place versus removing the sling can i use my roho cushion without the cover it is true that anything that you place over a roho cushion actually any cushion can interfere with the effectiveness a roho cushion works by increasing the contact area of the individual when they immerse sink into the product thus redistributing the force so there is limited peek pressures at one specific landmark when anything is placed between an individual and the cushion even a roho cover surface tension is increased and thus they have a more difficult time immersing sinking into the cushion effectively however roho has gone to great lengths to provide a cover which still allows immersion with the least amount of surface tension created mr graebe the inventor of the roho cushion from a scientific standpoint would recommend a roho cushion actually be used without the cover as previously stated our covers are made to be used so that there is little if any interference with pressure distribution when they are being used when other things are used instead of our stretchable breathable cover like a pillowcase a sheet a quilted chuck or another wheelchair cushion cover there is less effectiveness of the cushion due to increase tension bottom line the person has less immersion and envelopment of the body thus reducing the pressure redistribution characteristics so bottom line    can a roho cushion be used without the cover absolutely particularly if there is no risk that the cells may become caught in something should the cushion be used with something other than the cover it comes with no it will significantly reduce the benefits of the cushion how can i choose the right cushion seek the assistance of a clinical professional who can assess your clinical requirements in many countries occupational and physiotherapists have the expertise however your personal physician can advise and offer referrals how often should the roho dry floatation cushion be checked for proper inflation the hand check should be performed daily with the patients adls activities of daily living the entire adjustment procedure needs only to be done when necessary it only takes a few seconds if i currently have pressure ulcers can i sit on my roho dry floatation cushion yes it is appropriate for individuals with a stage   or  ulcer to sit directly on a roho dry floatation cushion provided they or their caregiver monitor the wound frequently in conjunction with proper care and nutrition it is proven that an ulcer can heal on a roho cushion due to our unique ability to redistribute pressure enhance blood flow and decrease edema we are thereby able to enhance healing a stage  ulcer usually requires surgery and presents numerous complications for the client does neoprene rubber promote heat buildup no the roho dry floatation cushions are air filled air has a very low specific heat making it a poor conductor of heat less transfer of heat than with water or gel less transfer of heat from patient to cushion results in increased energy levels of the endusers i need a very stable cushion which one should i choose we have a variety of models which offer positioning and stability examples include the select family line which includes the quadtro® select® and the contour select™ cushion the nexus® spirit® cushion and the new harmony™ cushion a clinician trained in seating can assist you in choosing the appropriate model for your needs how can i get literature on the roho product line to receive literature on the roho product line in the us or canada please call  or fax at  or to receive literature outside the us and canada call   or fax  we would be glad to send you information on the various company programs products or distributors nearest you click here to send an email to the help desk how long does a roho dry floatation cushion last on average three to five years the amount of wear and tear an individual user subjects their cushion to will effect the life of the cushion using the cover supplied with the cushion will extend the life of your cushion roho inc offers a twoyear limited warranty on the roho dry floatation cushion product line and a threeyear limited warranty on the select cushion product line in addition each cushion is supplied with a patchkit what makes the roho dry floatation cushions better than other cushions durability optimal reduction of shear and friction on the clients skin adjustability light weight proven performance over time click here for additional details on roho dry floatation technology do the roho cushions only prevent pressure ulcers or can the patient actually have an existing pressure ulcer the range of roho dry floatation cushions were designed to either prevent or heal both cushions and mattresses can and should be used in conjunction with proper care and nutrition to enhance the healing process over a period of time a clinician should assess the intrinsic and extrinsic factors of skin breakdown particular to you to determine what effect a roho cushion might have what do you mean by handle your roho dry floatation cushion with care in other words what are the dos and do nots for a roho dry floatation cushion owner do not pull or attempt to carry the cushion by the cells valve or isoflo® memory control™ valve expose the cushion to petroleum based solutions eg lanolin sit on cushion with sharp items in your pockets do follow the operating and cleaning instructions if using a roho cushion can i sit longer than two hours or do i still need to have some movement anyway pressure reliefs yes many users increase their sitting times dramatically eg  hours roho suggests you follow the routine of pressure relief procedures recommended to you by your clinician by consistently monitoring your skin you may be able to determine what period of time must pass before you begin to experience redness what is the weight limit of the roho dry floatation cushion only the cushion size will cause a limit therefore it is imperative that each individual receive the proper size for his or her stature and chair custom cushions are also available do you offer custom cushions and how do i order one yes we do offer custom cushions the advice of a rehab specialist would be most helpful in designing a specific custom cushion our customer service department also has a staff available to assist you in custom orders simply call fax or email roho with your questions do i need a rigid base underneath the cushion or is a sling seat okay to use with the roho cushion roho suggests all of our seating products be used with a solid seat insert unless the wheelchair sling is designed not to hammock or sag over time roho offers two types of solid inserts which can be inserted between the cushion and cover for convenient transportation can i tie down cells to create a no pressure area in the past there have been many proponents of tying down cells to create no pressure areas under the seated surface however unless medically necessary we recommend not tying down cells as the cushion performs best when distributing pressure over the entire contact area when a no contact area is incorporated into a cushion a high pressure perimeter surrounding the no contact area is created this variance in pressure between the perimeter and no contact area tends to cause shear deformity and trauma to the tissue thus increasing risk of ischemia in addition there is the possibility for pooling of interstitial fluids edema at the no contact area reducing efficient cellular nutrient transfer enhancing blood flow and nutrient transfer is essential and the dry floatation® cushion allows for this healing process to occur if you tie down cells you run the risk of delaying healing or actually increasing the size of a wound what about cushion toxicity when people ask or talk about latex toxicity what they are really asking or talking about is a severe allergic reaction to proteins found in natural rubber natural rubber comes from the sap a white milky fluid latex of the hevea brasilienis or rubber tree the proteins are mother nature’s way of keeping the sap from coagulating as it moves through the tree carrying moisture and nutrients from roots to leaves and back all products made from natural rubber contain some amount of these proteins the amount depends on how the latex was processed and how well the products made from it were leached and washed not only are rubber like products gloves condoms catheters and tubing made from natural rubber but also adhesives and sponge foams almost everybody will have some kind of a reaction to these proteins depending on the number of times exposed and the duration of the exposure the reaction can be anything from a mild dermatological rash to anaphylactic shock certain groups of people appear to be more susceptible to developing anaphylaxis healthcare workers for example may develop severe dermatological reactions because of the daily repeated exposure and myelodysplasia spina bifida patients seem to be particularly at risk especially under anesthesia roho incorporated products are manufactured from manmade materials the cushions themselves are made of neoprene a synthetic rubber material that contains no protein the covers are made of nylon lycra polyurethane and polyvinyl chloride and pumps are made of polypropylene when discussing specific allergy problems with healthcare workers we should be careful not to forget that a very small percentage of the population will have a reaction to contact with our cushions people develop hypersensitivity to all sorts of things some people develop hives and severe itching when they come into contact with wool clothing others develop reactions to detergents and soaps or citrus fruits because the cushion is made from a chemical polymer and contains other chemicals used to produce a cure and render it resistive to uv light and the effects of ozone etc means that a few rare individuals will have a dermatological allergy reaction to our product this can be a serious problem but it should not be confused with the protein toxicity associated with natural rubber can i return my roho cushion yes you can return the cushion within  days if it is in new condition due to hygenic reasons a roho cushion cannot be returned if it is used to ensure that you ordered the correct size we recommend that you first try the cushion without taking the cover out of the sealed package if the cover package is broken this will incur a  charge if it is the wrong the size please let our customer service team know immediately and we will do an exchange note exchanges incur actual freight charges which is the shipping charge to ship the cushion back to us and then the shipping cost to resend the correct size depending on where you live the actual shipping charges are usually around a total of  also for non standard sizes non standard cushions there will be a restocking fee of at least  the posturelite upon order is not returnable or refundable also any custom cushion is non ruturnable and non refundable my cushion has developed a leak and it is still under warranty how do i get it serviced if you have a roho cushion that is in need of service call the warranty service department at  ext  or email warrantytherohogroupcom information needed when calling in cushions serial number where am i date of purchase description of the defect once you call in a warranty service representative will walk you through the process of getting your product serviced whats the difference between between high low and mid profile cushions roho manufactures  heights of cushions a high profile which has ” tall air cells a mid profile cushion with ” tall air cells and a low profile that has ” tall air cells the purpose of a roho cushion is to decrease the amount of pressure on the sitting area through a patented technology of interconnected neoprene air cells that increase and decrease in air volume to match an individual’s contours this dry flotation technology facilitates blood flow to the sitting area and assists in the healing of ischemic ulcers pressure sores i generally recommend high profile cushions for first time users or for individuals with current pressure sores or a history of pressure sores due to its ability to maintain proper pressure relief even if slightly underinflated this gives the client or caregiver more room for error without compromising the client’s skin integrity by “bottoming out” in the cushion the drawback to the high profile cushion is that its ” tall air cells could make you feel like you are sitting up too high therefore giving you a sense of instability the low profile cushion with its ” tall air cells offers a lower center of gravity than the high profile cushion which provides an increased sense of stability the low profile cushion is appropriate for active users that would be frequently transferring on and off of the cushion the lower cell heights also allow easier transferring and propulsion if being used on a manual wheelchair the drawback is decreased room for error in regards to maintaining proper inflation simply put you must have the ability monitor how much air is in their cushion to prevent “bottoming out” the mid profile cushion is halfway between a high and low profile the mid offers you an option for both moderate protection and stability whats the difference between a quadtro select cushion and a single compartment the basic difference between a quadtro select and a standard roho is an extra valve located on the front of the quadtro cushion that splits the cushion into four equal compartments the valve can either be opened to allow airflow throughout the entire cushion or it can be closed to control airflow to the four specific quadrants this allows the client to customize the amount of air in each chamber when the valve is open air flows freely between quadrants and performs like a standard roho the drawback is having an extra metal and plastic valve on the front of the cushion that some customers find to be cumbersome it is an excellent cushion if you require the ability to adjust air volume in each quadrant for positioning needs and contouring to your body different needs require different heights and styles but assessing your specific uses and abilities will help guide you to the proper selection navigation home about us contact us frequently

addition each cushion is supplied with a patchkit what makes the roho dry floatation cushions better than other cushions durability optimal reduction of shear and friction on the clients skin adjustability light weight proven performance over time click here for additional details on roho dry floatation technology do the roho cushions only prevent pressure ulcers or can the patient actually have an existing pressure ulcer the range of roho dry floatation cushions were designed to either prevent or heal both cushions and mattresses can and should be used in conjunction with proper care and nutrition to enhance the healing process over a period of time a clinician should assess the intrinsic and extrinsic factors of skin breakdown particular to you to determine what effect a roho cushion might have what do you mean by handle your roho dry floatation cushion with care in other words what are the dos and do nots for a roho dry floatation cushion owner do not pull or attempt to carry the cushion by the cells valve or isoflo® memory control™ valve expose the cushion to petroleum based solutions eg lanolin sit on cushion with sharp items in your pockets do follow the operating and cleaning instructions if using a roho cushion can i sit longer than two hours or do i still need to have some movement anyway pressure reliefs yes many users increase their sitting times dramatically eg  hours roho suggests you follow the routine of pressure relief procedures recommended to you by your clinician by consistently monitoring your skin you may be able to determine what period of time must pass before you begin to experience redness what is the weight limit of the roho dry floatation cushion only the cushion size will cause a limit therefore it is imperative that each individual receive the proper size for his or her stature and chair custom cushions are also available do you offer custom cushions and how do i order one yes we do offer custom cushions the advice of a rehab specialist would be most helpful in designing a specific custom cushion our customer service department also has a staff available to assist you in custom orders simply call fax or email roho with your questions do i need a rigid base underneath the cushion or is a sling seat okay to use with the roho cushion roho suggests all of our seating products be used with a solid seat insert unless the wheelchair sling is designed not to hammock or sag over time roho offers two types of solid inserts which can be inserted between the cushion and cover for convenient transportation can i tie down cells to create a no pressure area in the past there have been many proponents of tying down cells to create no pressure areas under the seated surface however unless medically necessary we recommend not tying down cells as the cushion performs best when distributing pressure over the entire contact area when a no contact area is incorporated into a cushion a high pressure perimeter surrounding the no contact area is created this variance in pressure between the perimeter and no contact area tends to cause shear deformity and trauma to the tissue thus increasing risk of ischemia in addition there is the possibility for pooling of interstitial fluids edema at the no contact area reducing efficient cellular nutrient transfer enhancing blood flow and nutrient transfer is essential and the dry floatation® cushion allows for this healing process to occur if you tie down cells you run the risk of delaying healing or actually increasing the size of a wound what about cushion toxicity when people ask or talk about latex toxicity what they are really asking or talking about is a severe allergic reaction to proteins found in natural rubber natural rubber comes from the sap a white milky fluid latex of the hevea brasilienis or rubber tree the proteins are mother nature’s way of keeping the sap from coagulating as it moves through the tree carrying moisture and nutrients from roots to leaves and back all products made from natural rubber contain some amount of these proteins the amount depends on how the latex was processed and how well the products made from it were leached and washed not only are rubber like products gloves condoms catheters and tubing made from natural rubber but also adhesives and sponge foams almost everybody will have some kind of a reaction to these proteins depending on the number of times exposed and the duration of the exposure the reaction can be anything from a mild dermatological rash to anaphylactic shock certain groups of people appear to be more susceptible to developing anaphylaxis healthcare workers for example may develop severe dermatological reactions because of the daily repeated exposure and myelodysplasia spina bifida patients seem to be particularly at risk especially under anesthesia roho incorporated products are manufactured from manmade materials the cushions themselves are made of neoprene a synthetic rubber material that contains no protein the covers are made of nylon lycra polyurethane and polyvinyl chloride and pumps are made of polypropylene when discussing specific allergy problems with healthcare workers we should be careful not to forget that a very small percentage of the population will have a reaction to contact with our cushions people develop hypersensitivity to all sorts of things some people develop hives and severe itching when they come into contact with wool clothing others develop reactions to detergents and soaps or citrus fruits because the cushion is made from a chemical polymer and contains other chemicals used to produce a cure and render it resistive to uv light and the effects of ozone etc means that a few rare individuals will have a dermatological allergy reaction to our product this can be a serious problem but it should not be confused with the protein toxicity associated with natural rubber can i return my roho cushion yes you can return the cushion within  days if it is in new condition due to hygenic reasons a roho cushion cannot be returned if it is used to ensure that you ordered the correct size we recommend that you first try the cushion without taking the cover out of the sealed package if the cover package is broken this will incur a  charge if it is the wrong the size please let our customer service team know immediately and we will do an exchange note exchanges incur actual freight charges which is the shipping charge to ship the cushion back to us and then the shipping cost to resend the correct size depending on where you live the actual shipping charges are usually around a total of  also for non standard sizes non standard cushions there will be a restocking fee of at least  the posturelite upon order is not returnable or refundable also any custom cushion is non ruturnable and non refundable my cushion has developed a leak and it is still under warranty how do i get it serviced if you have a roho cushion that is in need of service call the warranty service department at  ext  or email warrantytherohogroupcom information needed when calling in cushions serial number where am i date of purchase description of the defect once you call in a warranty service representative will walk you through the process of getting your product serviced whats the difference between between high low and mid profile cushions roho manufactures  heights of cushions a high profile which has ” tall air cells a mid profile cushion with ” tall air cells and a low profile that has ” tall air cells the purpose of a roho cushion is to decrease the amount of pressure on the sitting area through a patented technology of interconnected neoprene air cells that increase and decrease in air volume to match an individual’s contours this dry flotation technology facilitates blood flow to the sitting area and assists in the healing of ischemic ulcers pressure sores i generally recommend high profile cushions for first time users or for individuals with current pressure sores or a history of pressure sores due to its ability to maintain proper pressure relief even if slightly underinflated this gives the client or caregiver more room for error without compromising the client’s skin integrity by “bottoming out” in the cushion the drawback to the high profile cushion is that its ” tall air cells could make you feel like you are sitting up too high therefore giving you a sense of instability the low profile cushion with its ” tall air cells offers a lower center of gravity than the high profile cushion which provides an increased sense of stability the low profile cushion is appropriate for active users that would be frequently transferring on and off of the cushion the lower cell heights also allow easier transferring and propulsion if being used on a manual wheelchair the drawback is decreased room for error in regards to maintaining proper inflation simply put you must have the ability monitor how much air is in their cushion to prevent “bottoming out” the mid profile cushion is halfway between a high and low profile the mid offers you an option for both moderate protection and stability whats the difference between a quadtro select cushion and a single compartment the basic difference between a quadtro select and a standard roho is an extra valve located on the front of the quadtro cushion that splits the cushion into four equal compartments the valve can either be opened to allow airflow throughout the entire cushion or it can be closed to control airflow to the four specific quadrants this allows the client to customize the amount of air in each chamber when the valve is open air flows freely between quadrants and performs like a standard roho the drawback is having an extra metal and plastic valve on the front of the cushion that some customers find to be cumbersome it is an excellent cushion if you require the ability to adjust air volume in each quadrant for positioning needs and contouring to your body different needs require different heights and styles but assessing your specific uses and abilities will help

pressure ulcers can i sit on my roho dry floatation cushion yes it is appropriate for individuals with a stage   or  ulcer to sit directly on a roho dry floatation cushion provided they or their caregiver monitor the wound frequently in conjunction with proper care and nutrition it is proven that an ulcer can heal on a roho cushion due to our unique ability to redistribute pressure enhance blood flow and decrease edema we are thereby able to enhance healing a stage  ulcer usually requires surgery and presents numerous complications for the client whats the difference between between high low and mid profile cushions roho manufactures  heights of cushions a high profile which has ” tall air cells a mid profile cushion with ” tall air cells and a low profile that has ” tall air cells the purpose of a roho cushion is to decrease the amount of pressure on the sitting area through a patented technology of interconnected neoprene air cells that increase and decrease in air volume to match an individual’s contours this dry flotation technology facilitates blood flow to the sitting area and assists in the healing of ischemic ulcers pressure sores i generally recommend high profile cushions for first time users or for individuals with current pressure sores or a history of pressure sores due to its ability to maintain proper pressure relief even if slightly underinflated this gives the client or caregiver more room for error without compromising the client’s skin integrity by “bottoming out” in the cushion the drawback to the high profile cushion is that its ” tall air cells could make you feel like you are sitting up too high therefore giving you a sense of instability the low profile cushion with its ” tall air cells offers a lower center of gravity than the high profile cushion which provides an increased sense of stability the low profile cushion is appropriate for active users that would be frequently transferring on and off of the cushion the lower cell heights also allow easier transferring and propulsion if being used on a manual wheelchair the drawback is decreased room for error in regards to maintaining proper inflation simply put you must have the ability monitor how much air is in their cushion to prevent “bottoming out” the mid profile cushion is halfway between a high and low profile the mid offers you an option for both moderate protection and stability whats the difference between a quadtro select cushion and a single compartment the basic difference between a quadtro select and a standard roho is an extra valve located on the front of the quadtro cushion that splits the cushion into four equal compartments the valve can either be opened to allow airflow throughout the entire cushion or it can be closed to control airflow to the four specific quadrants this allows the client to customize the amount of air in each chamber when the valve is open air flows freely between quadrants and performs like a standard roho the drawback is having an extra metal and plastic valve on the front of the cushion that some customers find to be cumbersome it is an excellent cushion if you require the ability to adjust air volume in each quadrant for positioning needs and contouring to your body different needs require different heights and styles but assessing your specific uses and abilities will help guide you to the proper selection if using a roho cushion can i sit longer than two hours yes many users increase their sitting times dramatically eg  hours roho suggests you follow the routine of pressure relief procedures recommended to you by your clinician by consistently monitoring your skin you may be able to determine what period of time must pass before you begin to experience redness roho
