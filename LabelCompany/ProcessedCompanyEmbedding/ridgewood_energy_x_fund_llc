   organization and summary of significant accounting policies   organization the ridgewood energy x fund llc the “fund” a delaware limited liability company was formed on august   and operates pursuant to a limited liability company agreement the “llc agreement” dated as of january   by and among ridgewood energy corporation the “manager” and the shareholders of the fund which addresses matters such as the authority and voting rights of the manager and shareholders capitalization transferability of membership interests participation in costs and revenues distribution of assets and dissolution and winding up  the fund was organized to primarily acquire interests in oil and gas properties located in the united states offshore waters of texas louisiana and alabama in the gulf of mexico   the manager has direct and exclusive control over the management of the fund’s operations  with respect to project investments the manager locates potential projects conducts due diligence and negotiates and completes the transactions  the manager performs or arranges for the performance of the management advisory and administrative services required for fund operations  such services

provides office space equipment and facilities and other services necessary for fund operations  the manager also engages and manages the contractual relations with unaffiliated custodians depositories accountants attorneys brokerdealers corporate fiduciaries insurers banks and others as required see notes  and    basis of presentation these unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared by the fund’s management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” and in the opinion of management contain all adjustments consisting of only normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the fund’s financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented  certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap have been omitted in these unaudited interim condensed financial statements  the results of operations financial position and cash flows for the periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of future financial results  these unaudited interim condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the fund’s december   financial statements and notes thereto included in the fund’s annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission “sec”  the yearend condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements for the year ended december   but does not include all disclosures required by gaap   use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period on an ongoing basis the manager reviews its estimates including those related to the fair value of financial instruments depletion and amortization determination of proved reserves impairment of longlived assets and asset retirement obligations actual results may differ from those estimates   fair value measurements the fair value measurement guidance provides a hierarchy that prioritizes and defines the types of inputs used to measure fair value the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to level  inputs which consists of unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets level  inputs consist of quoted prices for similar instruments  level  inputs are unobservable inputs and include situations where there is little if any market activity for the instrument hence these inputs have the lowest priority   cash and cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with maturities when purchased of three months or less are considered cash equivalents  these balances as well as cash on hand are included in “cash and cash equivalents” on the balance sheet as of september   the fund had no cash equivalents at times deposits may be in excess of federally insured limits which are  thousand per insured financial institution  as of september   the fund’s bank balances were maintained in uninsured bank accounts at wells fargo bank na      table of contents   salvage fund the fund deposits in a separate interestbearing account or salvage fund cash to provide for the dismantling and removal of production platforms and facilities and plugging and abandoning its wells at the end of their useful lives in accordance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations interest earned on the account will become part of the salvage fund there are no restrictions on withdrawals from the salvage fund   investment in delta house the fund has investments in delta house oil and gas lateral llc and delta house fps llc collectively “delta house” legal entities that own interests in a deepwater floating production system operated by llog exploration company  the fund accounts for its investment in delta house using the cost method of accounting for investments as it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over such investment  under the cost method the fund recognizes an investment in the equity of an investee at cost   the fund recognizes as income dividends received that are distributed from net accumulated earnings of the investee since the date of acquisition by the fund  dividends received in excess of earnings subsequent to the date of investment are considered a return of investment and are recorded as reductions of cost of the investment  the fund reviews its cost method investment for impairment at each reporting period and when an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment losses on cost method investments including impairments that are deemed to be other than temporary are classified as nonoperating losses in the fund’s statements of operations   as of september   the fund invested a total of  million in delta house and has received and recorded dividends totaling  million during third quarter  the fund received an offer from a third party for the purchase of a portion of its investment in delta house for  million in cash the transaction closed pursuant to a unit purchase agreement with dday offshore holdings llc dated october   certain other funds managed by the manager were also parties to the agreement the fund adjusted the carrying value of its investment in delta house as of september   to fair value which was determined based on the third party offer and recorded a loss on investment for the quarter ended september   such adjustment amounting to  million was included on the fund’s statement of operations within “loss on investment in delta house” inputs used to estimate fair value of the investment in delta house are categorized as level  in the fair value hierarchy  after the sale the fund will have received cash from its investment in delta house totaling  million of which  million relates to cash proceeds from the sale and  million relates to dividends and will have a remaining carrying value for the investment in delta house of  million   oil and gas properties the fund invests in oil and gas properties which are operated by unaffiliated entities that are responsible for drilling administering and producing activities pursuant to the terms of the applicable operating agreements with working interest owners the fund’s portion of exploration drilling operating and capital equipment expenditures is billed by operators   exploration development and acquisition costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and natural gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized costs of drilling and equipping productive wells and related production facilities are capitalized  the costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found  if proved commercial reserves are not found exploratory well costs are expensed as dryhole costs  at times the fund receives adjustments to certain wells from their respective operators upon review and audit of the wells’ costs  annual lease rentals and exploration expenses are expensed as incurred  all costs related to production activity transportation expense and workover efforts are expensed as incurred   once a well has been determined to be fully depleted or upon the sale retirement or abandonment of a property the cost and related accumulated depletion and amortization if any is eliminated from the property accounts and the resultant gain or loss is recognized   as of september   and december   amounts recorded in due to operators totaling  thousand related to capital expenditures for oil and gas properties   advances to operators for working interests and expenditures the fund may be required to advance its share of the estimated succeeding month’s expenditures to the operator for its oil and gas properties as the costs are incurred the advances are reclassified to proved properties      table of contents   asset retirement obligations for oil and gas properties there are obligations to perform removal and remediation activities when the properties are retired upon the determination of a property to be either proved or dry a retirement obligation is incurred the fund recognizes the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period incurred  plug and abandonment costs associated with unsuccessful projects are expensed as dryhole costs  as indicated above the fund maintains a salvage fund to provide for the funding of asset retirement obligations   syndication costs syndication costs are direct costs incurred by the fund in connection with the offering of the fund’s shares including professional fees selling expenses and administrative costs payable to the manager an affiliate of the manager and unaffiliated brokerdealers which are reflected on the fund’s balance sheet as a reduction of shareholders’ capital   revenue recognition and imbalances oil and gas revenues are recognized when oil and gas is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price when delivery has occurred and title has transferred and collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured  the fund uses the sales method of accounting for gas production imbalances  the volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes to which the fund is entitled based on its interests in the properties  these differences create imbalances that are recognized as a liability only when the properties’ estimated remaining reserves net to the fund will not be sufficient to enable the underproduced owner to recoup its entitled share through production  the fund’s recorded liability if any would be reflected in other liabilities  no receivables are recorded for those wells where the fund has taken less than its share of production   impairment of longlived assets the fund reviews the carrying value of its oil and gas properties annually and when management determines that events and circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of properties may not be recoverable  impairments are determined by comparing estimated future net undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value at the time of the review  if the carrying value exceeds the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows the carrying value of the asset is written down to fair value which is determined using estimated future net discounted cash flows from the asset  the fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to change  different pricing assumptions reserve estimates or discount rates could result in a different calculated impairment  given the volatility of oil and natural gas prices it is reasonably possible that the fund’s estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves could change in the near term   significant declines in oil and natural gas prices since fourth quarter  have impacted the fair value of the fund’s oil and gas properties if oil and natural gas prices continue to decline even if only for a short period of time it is possible that impairments of oil and gas properties will occur   depletion and amortization depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties are calculated using the unitsofproduction method  proved developed reserves are used as the base for depleting capitalized costs associated with successful exploratory well costs development costs and related facilities the sum of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves is used as the base for depleting or amortizing leasehold acquisition costs  during the nine months ended september   the fund recorded  million of depletion expense related to adjustments to asset retirement obligations for fully depleted properties   income taxes no provision is made for income taxes in the financial statements  the fund is a limited liability company and as such the fund’s income or loss is passed through and included in the tax returns of the fund’s shareholders  the fund files us federal and state tax returns and the  through  tax returns remain open for examination by tax authorities   income and expense allocation profits and losses are allocated to shareholders and the manager in accordance with the llc agreement   distributions distributions to shareholders are allocated in proportion to the number of shares held  the manager determines whether available cash from operations as defined in the llc agreement will be distributed such distributions are allocated  to the shareholders and  to the manager as required by the llc agreement      table of contents   available cash from dispositions as defined in the llc agreement will be paid  to shareholders and  to the manager until the shareholders have received total distributions equal to their capital contributions  after shareholders have received distributions equal to their capital contributions  of available cash from dispositions will be distributed to shareholders and  to the manager   recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting guidance that requires among other things companies to measure investments in other entities except those accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless an election is made to record the investment at cost less impairment and plus or minus subsequent adjustments for observable price changes with change in basis reported in current earnings this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption not permitted the fund is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its financial statements   in  the fasb issued accounting guidance on revenue recognition which provides for a single fivestep model to be applied to all revenue contracts with customers in  the fasb issued a deferral of the effective date of the guidance to  with early adoption permitted in  in may  the fasb issued final amendments which provided narrow scope improvements and practical expedients related to the implementation of the guidance the fund is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its financial statements    related parties   pursuant to the terms of the llc agreement the manager renders management administrative and advisory services to the fund  for such services the manager is entitled to an annual management fee payable monthly of  of total capital contributions net of cumulative dryhole and related well costs incurred by the fund  in addition pursuant to the terms of the llc agreement the manager is also permitted to waive the management fee at its own discretion such fee may be temporarily waived to accommodate the fund’s shortterm capital commitments management fees during each of the three and nine months ended september   and  were  million and  million respectively   the manager is entitled to receive a  interest in cash distributions from operations made by the fund distributions paid to the manager during each of the three and nine months ended september   were  million distributions paid to the manager during the three and nine months ended september   were  thousand and  million respectively   none of the amounts paid to the manager have been derived as a result of arm’s length negotiations   in february  delta house sales  transport llc “delta house st” a whollyowned subsidiary of the manager was formed to act as an aggregator to and as an accommodation for the fund and other funds managed by the manager the “ridgewood delta house funds” to facilitate the transportation and sale of oil and gas produced from the diller and marmalard projects on april   the ridgewood delta house funds entered into a master agreement the “agreement” with delta house st in which delta house st will purchase from ridgewood delta house funds all of their interests in oil and gas produced at the diller and marmalard projects and sell such volumes to unrelated third party purchasers delta house st is a passthrough entity such that it receives no benefit or compensation for the services provided under the agreement or under any other agreements it enters into with regards to the oil and gas acquired from the ridgewood delta house funds   the ridgewood delta house funds indemnify defend and hold harmless delta house st from and against all claims liabilities losses causes of action costs and expenses asserted against as a result of or arising from any act or omission breach and claims for losses or damages arising out of delta house st’s dealing with third parties with respect to the transportation processing or sale of oil and gas from the diller and marmalard projects the revenues from the sale of oil and gas to third party purchasers are recorded as oil and gas revenue in the statements of operations and expenses are recorded as operating expenses in the statements of operations   at times shortterm payables and receivables which do not bear interest arise from transactions with affiliates in the ordinary course of business   the fund has working interest ownership in certain projects to acquire and develop oil and natural gas projects with other entities that are likewise managed by the manager      table of contents               commitments and contingencies   capital commitments the fund has entered into multiple agreements for the acquisition drilling and development of its oil and gas properties the estimated capital expenditures associated with these agreements vary depending on the stage of development on a propertybyproperty basis   as of september   the fund’s estimated capital commitments related to its oil and gas properties were  million which include asset retirement obligations for the fund’s projects of  million of which  million is expected to be spent during the next twelve months   based upon its current cash position and its current reserve estimates the fund expects cash flow from operations to be sufficient to cover its commitments as well as ongoing operations reserve estimates are projections based on engineering data that cannot be measured with precision require substantial judgment and are subject to frequent revision   environmental considerations the exploration for and development of oil and natural gas involves the extraction production and transportation of materials which under certain conditions can be hazardous or cause environmental pollution problems  the manager and operators of the fund’s properties are continually taking action they believe appropriate to satisfy applicable federal state and local environmental regulations and do not currently anticipate that compliance with federal state and local environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect upon capital expenditures results of operations or the competitive position of the fund in the oil and gas industry  however due to the significant public and governmental interest in environmental matters related to those activities the manager cannot predict the effects of possible future legislation rule changes or governmental or private claims  as of september   and december   there were no known environmental contingencies that required adjustment to or disclosure in the fund’s financial statements   during the past several years the united states congress as well as certain regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over the fund’s business have considered or proposed legislation or regulation relating to the upstream oil and gas industry both onshore and offshore  if any such proposals were to be enacted or adopted they could potentially materially impact the fund’s operations  it is not possible at this time to predict whether such legislation or regulation if proposed will be adopted as initially written if at all or how legislation or new regulation that may be adopted would impact the fund’s business any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions which could have a material adverse effect on the fund’s operating results and cash flows   insurance coverage the fund is subject to all risks inherent in the exploration for and development of oil and natural gas insurance coverage as is customary for entities engaged in similar operations is maintained but losses may occur from uninsurable risks or amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage  the occurrence of an event that is not insured or not fully insured could have a material adverse impact upon earnings and financial position  moreover insurance is obtained as a package covering all of the funds managed by the manager  claims made by other funds managed by the manager can reduce or eliminate insurance for the fund      table of contents    item
