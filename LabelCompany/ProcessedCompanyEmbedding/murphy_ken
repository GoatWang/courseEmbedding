fair not sure hair red other other eyes brown after getting a  week blow dry i had to use a sulfate free shampoo i tried a ton of them and this and the matching conditioner were by far the best i trailed the travel size which was great and meant i didnt waste money and wasnt left with a full bottle of shampoo if it didnt work out i also found out of all the sulfate free shampoos i tried this lathered the most ive gone through nearly one full bottle of shampoo and will purchase the supersize too report abuse  of  people found this helpful di on 0  pm more reviews by di age   over skin dry medium not sure hair brown other other eyes blue im on a trial size bottle of this awesome stuff im in my late 0s with natural salt  pepper hair with a few foils this shampoo and matching conditioner feels wonderful going on and my hair is soft and silky afterwards hair washing has become a luxurious experience rather than a chore report abuse  of  people found this helpful amn on 0  am more reviews by amn age 0 skin combination fair not sure hair other other other eyes other as far as i remember i tried this one years ago first use my hair was shiny and smooth but i noticed that the more i used it the more my hair became waxy heavy sticky and dry not recommended at all even the conditioner which was way too heavy and weighed my hair down report abuse agibeault on 00  am more reviews by agibeault age 0 skin sensitive fairmedium neutral hair brunette wavy medium eyes brown i had such high hopes for this shampoo but it didnt work for me at all i used a small amount massaged my scalp really well repeated the shampoo is very concentrated and had a nice feel in itself however i could tell my hair was not getting moisturized and started to feel like straw right away i normally use abba shampoo which has no cones or sulfates but still leaves my hair feeling conditioned anyway i used my regular conditioner and it brought some softness back to my hair but it was definitely more tangled when i took my hair out of the towel i noticed i immediately had flakes and very dry scalp i styled my hair normally and within an hour my scalp was feeling tight over the course of the night and next day my scalp was coming off in big flakes i returned the shampoo to the salon and wont try this brand again report abuse stoof on 0 0 pm more reviews by stoof age  skin combination fair cool hair brown wavy medium eyes brown very expensive and leaves a waxy film on my hair smells good though report abuse ccarlino on 0  pm more reviews by ccarlino age   over skin dry fairmedium cool hair silver other medium eyes hazel i purchased this shampoo in the  fl oz travel size for  at a high end salon i have a short layered bob cut and will get at least  to 0 shampoos from this tiny bottle for reference i have dry coarse natural silver hair and no longer color or highlight this is a luxury thick shampoo with a nice fragrance somewhat similar but less offensive than pureologys hydrate shampoo once applied to wet hair the lather morphs into a luxurious plum spice fragrance this shampoo softens and moisturizes my kinky fine hair and works well with the kenra blowdry styling products i useam sorry to see the few negative lippies this shampoo may work best on natural hair without color or highlights but could see it performing well on color and highlights too guess it depends on the hair type conditioner and styling products report abuse  of  people found this helpful ditavee on 0 0 pm more reviews by ditavee age  skin sensitive fairmedium neutral hair brunette straight fine eyes blue very nice shampoo with a subtle delicate scent that does stay around but isnt offensive i find that this doesnt work as well if you have harder water so had to stop using this after moving but would definitely purchase again if not for thisnice ingredients excellent packaging makes your hair shiny and healthy looking the only downside is the price and i feel like it does build up a little although any build up goes away nicely with a good deep clean report abuse  of  people found this helpful impossiblebeauty on 0 0 pm more reviews by impossiblebeauty age  skin combination fairmedium not sure hair brunette other medium eyes blue my hg moisturizing sulphate free shampoo dont even need conditioner after this i have long very thick and both straight and partly slightly wavy hair report abuse mranda on 0  am more reviews by mranda age  skin acneprone medium cool hair blond straight medium eyes brown as a hair care addict i was initially reluctant to try this range i like my hair to feel clean and i wasnt sure that i would like a sulfate free shampoo  i was most definitely wrong after two shampoos my hair felt luxuriously clean i was skeptical about the consistency of the conditioner kinda felt like mayonnaise and i am used to a thicker formula but it was extremely nourishing i noticed an immediate difference after using these products and received quite a few compliments my hair was shiny lustrous moisturised and full of body my hair was not greasy the next day the fragrance is average but after a few weeks the shampoo and conditioner left my hair in the best condition its been for a while my blonde foiled hair was strong hardly any breakage and it felt silky shift without being weighed down take it from a skeptic and try this one its unlikely youll be disappointed expensive but worth it report abuse  of  people found this helpful chaniebeline on 0  pm more reviews by chaniebeline age  skin combination fair warm hair blond other other eyes hazel this is definately my hg shampoo and i also have to have exstras around it cleanses gently and is the first shampoo i find really moisturises to and ive tried a hell of a lot the smell is kind a special not bad or anything but very unlike others the price is up there so i always find it on sale i do not really mind theese thing because the shampoo makes my hair so soft and
