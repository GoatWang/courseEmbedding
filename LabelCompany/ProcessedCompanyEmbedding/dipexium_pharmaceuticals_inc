within our control description of business dipexium pharmaceuticals inc the company or dipexium a delaware corporation formerly dipexium pharmaceuticals llc is a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of locilexr pexiganan cream  the company was formed on january   on october   the company announced that its lead and sole product candidate locilexr failed to meet the primary clinical endpoint or secondary endpoints in its onestep and onestep phase  clinical trials dipexiums scientific team has evaluated the data from the onestep clinical trials but has found no clear signal that locilexr would be a strong product candidate for other possible clinical indications accordingly dipexium has explored strategic alternatives with its professional advisors and entered into a merger agreement with plx pharma inc plx on december   proposed merger pursuant to which plx is expected to take control over dipexium and dipexiums stockholders are expected to maintain approximately  of the combined ownership upon completion of the merger subject to certain adjustments set forth in the merger agreement the merger is expected to close in the second quarter of  the company or plx may be required to pay a termination fee of  or  respectively if the proposed merger is terminated under certain circumstances plan of operation under the proposed merger the combined company will initially be focused on completion of manufacturing scaleup and label finalization for the previously conditionally approved aspertectm  mg aspirin dosage form thereby satisfying the open conditional items and filing of a supplemental new drug application snda for aspertec  mg maintenance dose form aspertec is being developed to provide highrisk cardiovascular and neurology patients with more reliable and predictable antiplatelet efficacy as compared to enteric coated aspirin while also reducing the adverse gastric events common in an acute setting opportunities challenges and risks if the proposed merger is not consummated our business and ability to execute our business strategy are subject to a number of risks and challenges including without limitation the following �we are heavily dependent on attaining regulatory approval for and if approved successfully commercializing locilexr locilexr is our only product candidate as such all of our resources and efforts have been and are expected for the foreseeable future to be dedicated to the development and commercialization of locilexr which recently failed to meet the primary and secondary endpoints in our onestep and onestep clinical trials if our efforts fail to develop an appropriate regulatory strategy for locilex this will have a negative and substantial impact on the companys viability unless we are able to develop or acquire other product candidates �the regulatory pathway for locilex if any has yet to be identified review of the comprehensive data from the onestep clinical trials is ongoing the company has no clear clinical or regulatory pathway forward for locilexr the sole product of the company and no assurance can be given that an appropriate clinical and regulatory pathway exists this process is inherently unpredictable and if we are ultimately unable to identify an appropriate regulatory pathway forward for locilexr our business will be substantially harmed table of contents �manufacturing issues may prevent locilexr from receiving regulatory approval although we believe that we have successfully resolved the manufacturing issues encountered by locilexrs prior sponsor and previously identified by the fda to the extent that such issues are not resolved or to the extent new issues arise regulatory approval for locilexr may be delayed or withheld and we may not be able to meet the developmental milestones necessary to continue our business results of operations three months ended march   compared to the three months ended march   summary table the

million for the three months ended march   and  million for the three months ended march   a decrease of  million this was due primarily to a decrease of  million in compensation related expenses due

anticipated close of the merger including the closing condition under the merger agreement to have at least  million of cash as defined in the merger agreement available upon the closing of the merger if the merger is not completed dipexium will need to reevaluate its strategic alternatives which may include continuing to operate its business as an independent standalone company a sale of the company liquidation of the company or other strategic transaction dipexiums liquidity position will be dependent upon the strategic alternative selected however assuming dipexium does not enter into another strategic transaction dipexium expects its cash as of march   will be sufficient to meet its liquidity requirements through at least april   additional financing would be required should dipexium decide to commence a new clinical program for locilexr in a new clinical indication cash needs to pursue a new clinical indication cannot even be estimated until a promising new indication
