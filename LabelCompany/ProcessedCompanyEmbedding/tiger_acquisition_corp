archiveround tablesmicrosites ipo of de tiger dt asia limiteds ceo stephen cannon talks us through de tiger holdings initial public offering of the nasdaqlisted acquisition vehicle the dealde tiger group “de tiger” was founded by the ng family of hong kong and is focused on private investments in asia with a specific emphasis on greater china  on september   de tiger successfully completed the flotation of dt asia investments limited “dt asia” on nasdaq with a us million ipo nasdaq cadtu  dt asia has  months to complete the acquisition of an operating business in china or asia via effectively a “reverse merger”  dt asia is headed by mr stephen cannon a wall street veteran with deep china and spac experience and is bolstered by a dozen board members with lengthy and successful investment track records in china  earlybirdcapital inc was the lead underwriter for the us ipo which priced on september   mr cannon dt asia’s ceo  board member stated  “dt asia is currently searching for a private chinese company with more than us million of  earning audited to a certain degree with an ‘offshore’ holding company in need of approximately us million of cash and interested in a reversemerger to become publiclylisted on nasdaq in the us  we are not limited by any specific industries except those that are restricted from foreign ownership  we are interested most in quality management teams with high growth businesses that are building strong domestic and international brands and a strategic benefit from a us public listing  we are happy to speak to anyone with such interests and can be reached at email protected ” what are spacsdt asia is an investment company commonly referred to as a special purpose acquisition company or “spac”  spacs are formed for the sole purpose of doing an ipo to raise capital and then “acquiring” an operating business by either a cash purchase of assets or more commonly a share exchange reversemerger  institutional investors are attracted to spacs because their ipo purchase price plus additional cash from the sponsor are placed into a trust that invests solely in riskfree us treasuries  once the acquisition target is announced then investors have the option to i retain their equity ownership in the postmerger publiclylisted company or instead ii receive their proportionate cash in the trust  some investors consider their investment in the spac ipo as an “alternative to holding cash” because they can receive the us treasuries yield earned by the trust plus the extra funds from the sponsorprior to the global financial crisis in  spacs had grown popular as an alternative method for private companies to become public via a reversemerger with a spac and avoid market uncertainties of a traditional ipo  several highprofile global financial leaders including private equity firms and investment banks raised spacs for this purpose  spacs grew in number and size with several hundred spacs raised and up to almost  billion in proceedsprior to the global financial crisis approximately a dozen chinafocused spacs were raised between  to   dt asia’s successful  ipo was effectively the first true chinafocused spac in the last  years and reopened this market  prior to dt asia mr cannon was a cofounder of one of the last chinafocused spacs raised prior to the global financial crisis hambrecht asia acquisition corp or “haac”  haac successfully completed its reversemerger acquisition during the difficult postglobal financial crisis period in early  with the target sgoco group nasdaq  sgocdt asia’s board member dr foelan wong commented“spacs provide excellent opportunities for private companies to transform into publicly listed companies with greater certainty and control over the process  spacs can offer a variety of solutions for target companies from raising needed capital to possible monetization for earlier investors to increasing their industry stature by becoming publicly traded company with a public acquisition currency  our experience is that larger chinese companies in terms of preipo valuations have had greater access to public listings overseas  in addition companies in hightech and capitalintensive industries namely technology financials and biotechnology are among those chinese industries better represented by overseas listings  we have also found that stock markets which value businesses more fully and fairly based on their individual historical success and future outlooks are more desired by chinese managements and owners  these higher quality companies seek to avoid capital markets without these characteristics and which correlate with greater underpricing of ipos  in this regard we believe the spac can provide a fair platform for high quality companies and we are happy to speak to anyone with such interests” dt asia’s ipo termsdt asia sold  units including first closing and overallotment exercise to the public at an ipo price of us per unit  in addition de tiger the “sponsor” along with the underwriter earlybirdcapital completed an additional us of concurrent private placement purchases from the company  the spac then placed  per unit into a trust – consisting of the us of ipo proceeds plus an additional us from the private placements  the remainder of the private placement was used for formation offering expenses and working capitalthe unit sold in the ipo consists of i one  ordinary share ii one right to receive onetenth  of an ordinary share and iii one warrant to acquire onehalf  of an ordinary share the units ordinary shares warrants and rights all trade separately on nasdaq under the symbols “cadtu” cadt cadtw and cadtr respectivelyprior to the ipo and the concurrent private placements the spac initially issued founder shares to the sponsor management and board members equal in amount to  assuming the ipo shares equalled  of the company thus excluding the private placement securities in the calculation   the origin of this structure was designed for the spac to mimic the carriedinterest incentive structure of traditional private equity fundsdt asia’s board member mr jason wong commented“the spac is a unique form of listing first the spac is created by a team of senior private equity managers and investment bankers to complete an initial public offering becoming a “pure cash” listed company  next the spac team searches for companies to acquire through a reverse merger after which the target company receives the cash previously raised in the spac’s ipo  overall the target company is able to achieve a lower cost for both the public listing and raising capital as well as certainty for existing shareholders to immediately enjoying the benefits of conversion of their private ownership into that of a listed company spacs should be regarded as an equity fund that is already listed on a stock market this is different from a general private equity fund in that the spac has already solved in advance the issues of raising lowercost public capital and providing existing investors with an exit strategy moreover a spac can offer a greater variety of options and opportunities for overseas listings of chinese companies we look forward to having the opportunity to assist redchip chinese companies in particular those with outstanding management teams high profitability and growth potentials in their overseas listingsprofessional teamearlybirdcapital inc acted as sole bookrunning manager for the offering and aegis capital corp and ibankers securities inc acted as comanagers for the offering  earlybirdcapital is widely credited as the investors of the current spac structure and the market leader in spac ipos in the usellenoff grossman  schole llp acted as us legal counsel which ogier acted as british virgin islands legal counsel to the company and graubard miller acted as counsel to the underwritersde tiger’s ceo vincent ng commented  “de tiger is very excited about the prospects of the spac structure to address limitations that private chinese companies face in attempting to expand internationally including public listings overseas  we are confident that we have assembled the best team possible and have the support the leading professional firms in the spac market”dt asia management  selected board members includemr stephen
