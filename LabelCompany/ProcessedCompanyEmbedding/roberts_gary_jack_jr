remained this low for this long i bought my st home in the s with  interest rate and thought that was great   i refied my st condo in w  its a bird its a plane nope its just a drone  comments i read a good article this week   httpwwwinmancomnextdronetechnologyhelpsagentssellhouses   about the use of drones for real estate photography   currently in the us the faa does not allow the use of drones for commercial purposes  our neighbor to the north canada  does allow t  most expensive home sold in dc last month  comments so what was the most expensive home sold in dc last month  this nw dc gem located in cleveland parkit sold for   it was listed for  mil and sold for cash in  days  impressive       property sold by marc fleisher of long  foster real estate inc    why should a home seller care about coming soon  comments one of the new and popular and somewhat controversial trends in todays real estate is the promoting of properties before they are ready to officially hit the market  this coming soon idea comes in many forms  good idea  bad idea     real estate is not nor will it ever be onesize fits   getting ready for your homes inspection  comments home buyer’s most always ask for a home inspection as part of the buying process inspections typically take about an hour for a condo or  for a single family home we would like to share the top items that inspectors often find

most home buyers today start their research and h  the cost of walking away  comments so you are under contract and you are negotiating those home inspection items and the seller just refuses to

chocolate molten delight with creme anglaise is a simple yet elegant makeahead dessert chief justice john g roberts jr delivered eight opinions and two dissents in the justconcluded supreme court term but none probably meant as much as the statement he handed down on a rainy early june morning in a small new hampshire town it was the ninthgrade commencement address for the cardigan mountain school an elite boarding school for boys grades six through nine sitting up front under a large white tent as john glover roberts jr took the stage was graduating student john glover roberts iii in canaan new hampshire head of school christopher day said the th chief justice of the united states would always be known as the dad of our cardigan cougar jack you may remember jack roberts from his own moment on the national stage  years ago when his father was chosen for the supreme court as president george w bush revealed his choice in a formal white house ceremony john and jane roberts struggled to simultaneously ignore and control the rambunctious boy in the shortpants icecream suit his father later said jack was pretending he was spiderman shooting webs from his hands roberts commencement address was not publicized in advance but it was recorded by the school uploaded to youtube and is slowly gaining attention several readers emailed the link to me one person wrote im a democrat and i cant stand the guys views but i was in tears there is nothing about the supreme court or the law in the short speech although each graduating cougar received an autographed pocketsize constitution along with his certificate instead the address was personal understated and popular probably because it touches on universal themes such as a parents worry about whether he or she is making the right decisions for their child driving through the gates after leaving a student at cardigan roberts said parents travel a trail of tears to an emptier and lonelier house roberts is considered one of the supreme courts better writers whose public addresses show a quick wit and professional timing he first asked the cardigan students to turn and applaud their parents and others who had guided them he joked that he would later be able to report that his speech was interrupted by applause success he reminded them comes to those who are unafraid to fail and if you did fail you got up and tried again and if you failed again you got up and tried again and if you failed again  it might be time to think about doing something else roberts said commencement addresses customarily wish graduates success he thought it better for them to experience challenges from time to time in the years to come i hope you will be treated unfairly roberts said so that you will come to learn the value of justice betrayal will teach you the importance of loyalty loneliness will instruct dont take friends for granted pain will cause someone to learn compassion i wish you bad luck  again from time to time  so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life roberts said and understand that your success is not completely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either a commencement speech is supposed to offer grand advice roberts said so his first was to recognize the exalted perch from which they started  a school with a to studentteacher ratio where students dine in jackets and ties and tuition and board cost about  through his son roberts had come to know many of the students he said and i know you are good guys but you are also privileged young men and if you werent privileged when you came here youre privileged now because you have been here roberts said my advice is dont act like it at their next school he urged them introduce themselves to the people raking the leaves shoveling the snow or emptying the trash learn their names smile and call them by name the worst thing that will happen is you will become known as the young man who smiles and says hello he said another thing youve been at a school with just boys most of you will be going to a school with girls roberts said long pause i have no advice for you in his speech roberts quoted socrates and not surprisingly he ended it with the words of the great american philosopher bob dylan roberts has quoted dylan in judicial opinions and hes not alone the new york times a few years ago noted a study that found dylan the most quoted songwriter in judicial opinions and said roberts had opened the floodgates by quoting the bard of minnesota in a  dissent the song he quoted at the commencement speech of course was forever young roberts is an unusual parent now  he and jane married rather late in life their contemporaries are welcoming grandchildren while they have two
