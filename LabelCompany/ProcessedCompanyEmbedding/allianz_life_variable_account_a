at least  on the account in the  years we have had these  to  our money has gone backwards from what we put into it the fees they charged actually take out more than the account makes over a year of course we are locked into this for  years or we will get a penalty so if we take it out now we will lose the fees for the last  years and also the penalty and they win if we leave it in they will continue not to make us any money and take fees and they win we are so sorry we listened to our advisor she made a terrible mistake we worked so hard for this money to save towards retirement and now it is going backwardshelpfulyesnojack of brookside nj on jan  satisfaction ratingi bought an annuity from allianz and i am oh so sorry that i did that it has been a complete fiasco since the annuity was purchased the salesman came to my home sat at my dining room table and outright lied to me and my wife about the annuity he was attempting to sell me he told me the annuity was a  year annuity that paid  interest per year thus doubling my money in the  year period come to find out that the man lied to me because the annuity was actually a  year  interest annuity for the final  years of the annuity allianz will pay me zero interest and i will only be able to access  of the total amount of money each year for  yearswhen i contacted allianz corp headquarters i was treated horribly and was told basically too bad you bought it so you own it they totally didnt want to hear anything about my problem and they certainly didnt try to help my dilemma in any way they were condescending rude and totally not interested in helping one of their customers if you were thinking of purchasing an allianz product you should do some research first and be aware that they have had several classaction lawsuits that represented over half  million dissatisfied customersthis is not a company that you want to do any business with or put your hard earned money into an account where once they have it you will be lucky if you ever get back what they promise you do your due diligence do your research and then run away from this unscrupulous company as fast as you can they are not nice people or a customer oriented business organizationhelpfulyesnocasey of coatesville pa on nov  satisfaction ratingi dealt with the customer service on a monthly basis i had to take partial withdrawals and it was very easy to call in and get what i wanted the customer service is polite and understanding there are many options with allianz partial withdrawals are easy to just call in and they are processed within  hours they also have programs to take distributions on an automatic monthly basis i took a full withdrawal a few years after nine eleven it was a simple process of writing in a letter with my signature guaranteed i mailed it to the process center and within  hours i had it wired into my account with was highly efficient and easy there are many different funding options i opened my annuity moving it from a previous ira it was very easy and the paperwork was userfriendly and simplistic to go over with my financial officerhelpfulyesnospencer of fayetteville wv on oct  satisfaction ratingwhat a great experience i have had with allianz my grandmother has an annuity with them and needed to take a withdrawal to do some repairs to her home both her agent and the customer service people made everything so easy we just had to fill out a form with our agent and about a week later we received a check in the mail thank you allianzhelpfulyesnojeremiah of canton oh on sept  satisfaction ratingin the past couple of months ive had some questions about my statement i was able to talk to a live person who was able to give me the answers i needed i had several available based on my needs they were also very clear about any applicable penalties that might be incurred all the options were favorable the options were great ranging from check to direct deposit or even to reinvest the withdraw into other investment options i liked having the various options this was nice i could set it up to have funds put into my account from my paycheck this way i could fund my account without worrying about missing a deposithelpfulyesnokaren of winfield il on sept  satisfaction ratingafter the death of our father this past january  we learned our parents had purchased three annuities my siblings and i chose our method and timing of disbursement late january or early february approximately may th  we received a letter from allianz with header of complaint determination justified the letter contained a lot of legalese but stated because the complaint has been determined to be justified you are being offered a single cash payment of a full refund of your share of the funds paid into the abovementioned annuity less any funds removed the amount offered was approximately  of each of our portion of our annuitization value in bold print the second paragraph began you are not required to accept this relief accepting this relief award would result in your receiving an additional cash payment if you do not wish to accept this payment you should do nothing and not accept the relief offerconfused we had our attorney draft a letter for clarification response stated our father had logged the complaint our father had not even written a check my sister handled all his business affairs after our mother passed away in  we were advised by our attorney that accepting our justified cash payment would result in the surrender of the balance of our policies considering an allianz annuity form your own opinion and bewarehelpfulyesnolori of chapala jalisco other on aug  satisfaction ratingallianz life insurance company of north america holds an annuity we purchased some  ago the fund performed very poorly however we kept it because it had a guaranteed death benefit of  after my husband turned about  allianz kept trying to put it into annuitization we kept declining this in  we notified them that we wanted the maturity date postponed to the  year age limit which now they conveniently have no record of on july   our broker received a letter and form to be signed by husband and i to postpone annuitization the form was filled out dated and signed and returned however it was a couple days late as the requested response date was  july as we were out of the country in the meantime our broker also received a letter on july  stating the annuity had gone into a nonrevocable annuitization which was six days prior to the requested response date of july th a few days later the first check arrived and was dated august  which we have not cashed we tried many times to reach out and communicate with allianz and explain that we had indeed filed the paper to postpone the maturity date to the  year age limit in  as well as via our broker in  we finally were able to speak with a supervisor jamie who advised us our case would be reviewed by the accommodation committee after several phone calls they finally returned a call to us they stated that they would not revoke the decision and return it to annuity status because i could not prove we had signed and returned the form which extended the maturity date to the  year age limit as it was sent via regular mail allianz states they had sent a request prior to the forced annuitization which we did not receive they did not mention the same form to postpone the annuity to the  year age limit which was faxed to them by our investment broker july  seems to us they had already made their decision july  as no life insur co wants to pay out the death benefit which is much greater than the market value of annuity upon further review nowhere on said form does it state the form needs to be returned via registered mail however jamie at alliance indicated that because it wasnt we had no recourse we have also reviewed our original contract no where do we see anything that states allianz has the right to put the annuity into forced annuitization without our specific consent to begin receiving monthly payments as neither of us have reached the  year age limitwe have requested that allianz provide us a copy of the contract and specifically indicate where it states we must begin annuitization prior to age  which they have not done so yet we have discovered allianz has a bad reputation for trying to take advantage of the elderly seems they intimidate and distort facts to confuse people into accepting allianzs decision this imposes a hardship on the elderly who rely on the death benefit to cover their final expenses bad company bewarehelpfulyesnodeborah of newberry fl on july  satisfaction ratingmy father has had an annuitylife insurance policy with allianz since  he has never taken any income from the annuity as of this time he is in an assisted living facility and is not mentally or physically capable of managing his own finances in june  i received a letter stating that there had been an address change for his policy i checked the property tax records for the new address and found that the house belonged to someone with the same name considering the fact that you have to provide the account number previous address and last  of social prior to conducting any business with allianz it is inconceivable how this could happeni then logged onto his account online and the account was there but the money was gone i then called the automated customer service number and when i entered his last  the computer said there was no record of that number then i had to drive  hours to have him sitting next to me while he gave them permission to talk with me about the account he lives by my sister now but she has a business to run when we gave the human on the phone his last  she said that  was not associated with the account after going round and round about the situation her conclusion was that he was receiving statements on an account that was not hisi believe we have it straightened out now after about a week had he been childless without an advocate he would not have found out that he was broke for at least a year by then they would have written him off as a senile old man he would have been kicked out of the asl facility and placed in a run down governmentmedicare approved facility where they pack them in like sardines and the paint is peeling off the walls ive seen those facilities when he went in for rehabit is absolutely mind blowing how this could have happened the employee responsible should have been fired immediately if not put in jail i reported their actions to florida elder abuse hotline just to get it on record and to florida dept of financial services and submitted a complaint again to get it on record if it happened to him its happened to othersit will haunt me for years when i remember an old lady in a nursing home my dad had stayed in for rehab she told me the court assigned someone an attorney i think to handle her affairs she told me they took all my money now they just move me from one nursing home to another her room was barren of personal items except  photos a lifetime of memorabilia was gone i wrote her off as being senile now it saddens me immensely that she may have been telling the truth so not only does the policy pay an absolute minimal amount of interest no matter what the broker says but their handling of customers retirement savings is reprehensible the stress they caused my family is inexcusablehelpfulyesnokatherine of converse tx on june  consumer increased ratingmy savings has finally been returned to me and no overnight delivery fees were applied glad to hopefully have this bad experience over will deposit the check into my credit co account and wait for an additional  days so my adviser is assured that their dollars are good now all i can say isallianz what a mess this has been katherine of converse tx on june  original reviewstarted with a ira account that i presume will be doing well then proceeded to add another acct a investment acct with nonqualified funds allianz people added these  to my ira already started that i understood was a wrong thing to do i caught this when i checked on my accts through computer the rep at allianz immediately moved to a different investment acct  days later but too late i lost trust that this company is knowledgeable regarding other peoples money minenow  weeks later and way too many hands touching my funds and way too many calls to whoever answers the phone for  weeks all theyre keep saying these were ira funds and now a whole bunch of paperwork is required allianz made these  an ira finally someone named greta in customer relations was finally allowing my  to be mailed to me the owner of my savings but that did not happen today just got off the phone with another rep and he told me funds are allocated to be mailed out on mon  a week later than promised by greta this time i stated that i want overnight delivery now am worried that this  rated co will charge for the service as noted in another critical review even though they have caused this whole adventure from hell all i can say is be very careful before considering allianz and i must also add anyone promoting this outfithelpfulyesnoanthony of dothan al on june  satisfaction ratingkenmore is a good company i have used them before and will always use themhelpfulyesnoneal of clover sc on june  satisfaction ratingi needed to take a partial surrender from my retirement account for an emergency i called on two separate occasions and spoke with two different reps to verify the information i was given was correct i was given the same answer from two different people so i was certain at this point that i could move forward with the withdrawal without going into great detail the information i was given was in fact wrong and the transaction did not go the way it was planned or the way i was told it would go due to incorrect info given to me twice my account now has a balance of over k less than should be this has now created a legal situation on my end due to the incompetence of allianz and their support team just to verify their incompetence once i received the money and knew what was going on i called to express my concerns and ask how we could reach a resolution but before that i decided to ask for a third time what the procedure wasonce i was told yet again about their procedure in detail i proceeded to tell the guy how it actually happened his response umm i actually just told you wrong thats not how it actually goes we actually do this after i brought him up to speed on everything he assured me a manager would be in touch within  hrs over a week later and i had to call them back and ask what the problem was it wasnt until then they realized my whole situation was reported to the wrong department i was again assure someone would definitely be in contact with me again within  hrs “guaranteed” he saidafter  days i had to call them back yet again to this moment still no resolution i am now transferring every dime of my remaining retirement monies from this company and placing it with someone capable of communicating accurate information and will do what they say no way i want these idiots handling my retirement there are far too many choices out there so if youre considering allianz i recommend you go the other wayhelpfulyesnocynthia of antioch ca on march  satisfaction ratingthe rep gave me a detailed scenario for fixed  variable annuities  what outcome would occur upon receipt  how the fluctuation of the market affects them the repayment of the funds and early withdrawal penalties were explained in detail she was very patient as i asked many questions in my attempt to understand more fully she was very clear of the timeline for payment any withdrawal penalties prior to that time and how their protocol of having that if the need arises helpfulyesnol of jacksonville beach fl on feb  satisfaction ratingi have had an annuity with allianz for over  years i put the money in i got a bonus it grew and didnt lose money all was good until i requested a penaltyfree withdrawal when they received my request they immediately deducted the amount from my balance and they claim they sent me a check which i never received just sent it regular mail  no tracking no insurance no signature required they said i should allow  business days for the check to process through us mail it didnt show up they offer to stop payment and issue another check  which will take  more days  and send the new check the same way regular mail with no tracking etc if i want special handling it will cost extra if i want the money deposited directly into my bank account it will cost extra and of course they will not credit the amount of the missing check back to my account dont most checks get subtracted when they are cashed not with allianz so the withdrawal was deducted from my account but i still dont have the money and probably wont for who knows how long allianz gets the benefit of my money and any interest it earns for a month or more i will get all my money out of this company as soon as possible and i recommend you find another place to put yourshelpfulyesnoangelo of lawrenceville ga on feb  satisfaction ratingi received a r from allianz for tax year  that was incorrect many attempts via email phone and us mail have been ignored a promised response from a supervisor in the policyholder service department was never forthcoming it has been more than three weeks since i

satisfaction ratingin general my annuity experience is positive the one aspect of the allianz annuity i do not like is the way it credits increases it is based on the sp  like many annuities this one resets each year on the anniversary date which is fine what i do not like is how the increased is figured each month on the monthly anniversary date the increase or decrease in the market is noted decreases have no limit when the market is down increases are limited to this year  of the market in an up and down economy like we have now one months loss can take  months to recoup if the market

about todays consumer products and serviceswhat features matter most top expensesannuities have a reputation for becoming accompanied by hefty fees while certain costs are to be expected consumers should clearly understand them before purchasesurrender fees be sure to understand the surrender fee that will be paid if the money is taken out of the annuity before the contract time period is up commissions similar to investment products annuities are bought and sold on the market and an advisor or agent makes a commission from the sale this charge is paid by the consumer monthly fees annuity monies are invested often in mutual funds these funds usually incur fund management fees and the costs are passed on to the consumer funding optionsthe initial funds used to purchase an annuity can come from many sources there are also ways to add to an annuity once it has been createdsingle payment the simplest option for consumers who have a lump sum of money and want to put it into an annuity is to write a check or wire the money to the company series of payments some annuities allow consumers to initially fund the account with a small amount of money and then add to the principle periodically this is a form of saving while growing money for retirement social security consumers can choose to reduce their social security benefits in the near term and use the savings for an annuity for the long term consumers should carefully consult a financial advisor regarding this option investment optionsannuity funds are invested in various markets depending on the type of annuity consumers can have more or less control over the underlying investment optionsimmediate annuities an immediate annuity offers as the name implies immediate results you make a lump sum payment and immediately or almost immediately begin to get a guaranteed monthly payment immediate annuities generally are paid out for the rest of your life but they can also be paid out over another set period of time that you specify fixed annuities when you buy a fixed annuity your rate is locked in for a guaranteed amount of time ranging from one to ten years your rate might still fluctuate but it will never go below the amount you set with your fixed annuity this type of annuity is good for people who want a lowrisk insurance plan and aren’t concerned about growing their annuity variable annuities a variable annuity is spread out over several investment accounts making it similar to a mutual fund generally variable annuities are not advised since the return on the account is based on the performance of these funds and not on a fixed amount however it does make sense in certain situations especially if you are open to risky investments for the potential of a high return and you already have a vibrant investment portfolio equity indexed annuity an equityindexed annuity combines the best of fixed and variable annuities by offering a fixed rate and payments while tying your money to an index to allow for a higher growth potential than a regular fixed annuity payout optionswhen purchasing an annuity the consumer can choose how the future payments will be madeguaranteed period this option provides a guaranteed number of payments upon death the payments continue to a beneficiary for a set period of time lifetime payments the guaranteed payment in this case is for the lifetime of the annuity holder only this option provides no survivor benefits lifetime payments may be appropriate for those with no beneficiaries survivor payments popular with married couples this type of payment will continue for the life of the holder and upon death will then continue for the life of the beneficiary as well withdrawal optionsthere are several ways to withdraw money from an annuity

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not
