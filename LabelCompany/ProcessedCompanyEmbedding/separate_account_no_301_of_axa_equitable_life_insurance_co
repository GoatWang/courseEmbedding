substantially identical investment objectives strategies and policies as those of the hudson river trust portfolios they would replace the assets of any portfolio of the hudson river trust underlying

we control each trust eq advisors trust shares are sold only to our separate accounts and an affiliated qualified plan trust the hudson river trust shares are held by other separate accounts of ours

maintain a tsa plan also referred to as a b plan program or arrangement for its employees may make contributions to an annuity contract purchased for the benefit of the employee these contributions if properly made will not be currently taxable compensation to the employee moreover the employee will not be taxed on the earnings in the annuity contract until heshe takes distributions two different types of employers are eligible to maintain b plans public schools and specified taxexempt organizations under section c of the code contributions to tsas annual contributions to tsas annual contributions to tsas made through the employers payroll are limited taxfree transfer or taxdeferred rollover contributions from another b arrangement are not subject to these annual contribution limits commonly some or all of the contributions to the tsa are made under a salary reduction agreement between the employee and the employer these contributions are called salary reduction or elective deferral contributions however a tsa can also be wholly or partially funded through nonelective employer contributions or aftertax employee contributions to determine the permissible annual contribution to the participants tsa a participant generally must calculate tentative annual contributions under several formulas generally this contribution limit is the lowest of the following o the annual maximum exclusion allowance for the employee in section b of the code o the annual limit under section  of the code on employer contributions to defined contribution plans and o the annual limit on all elective deferrals if contributions to a tsa exceed the applicable limit in any year the excess will be taxable to the employee as ordinary income in certain situations we may distribute excess contributions to avoid tax penalties sai pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th  the annual maximum exclusion allowance for the employee under section b of the code is  of includable compensation times years of service minus previous contributions to all qualified plans b plans and section  plans the participant participates with this employer the annual limit under section  of the code on employer contributions to defined contribution plans is the lesser of  or  of compensation disregarding compensation over  in  in  the annual limit on all salary reduction or elective deferral contributions for an employee under all plans of any employer is generally  note however that the maximum salary reduction contribution by an employee who participates in both a tsa arrangement and a section  plan is the lower maximum allowed under section  of the code in  this maximum is  any excess deferral contributions not withdrawn by april  after the year of the deferral

exception applies amounts distributed from tsas are includible as ordinary income if you have made aftertax contributions you will have a tax basis in your certificate which will be recovered taxfree you may have a tax basis in the certificate if the employer made contributions that were included in your gross income in the year of the employers contribution for example the amount of any partial distribution from a tsa before the annuity starting date is generally taxable as ordinary income to you except to the extent the distribution is a withdrawal of your basis distributions are generally pro rata withdrawals of tax basis and earnings on that tax basis if you elect an annuity distribution the nontaxable portion of each payment is  your tax basis in the contract divided by  an expected return determined under irs tables the balance of each payment is taxable the entire amount of the payments you receive after you recover your tax basis is taxable if you die before recovering your tax basis and the annuity has a refund feature the beneficiary of the refund may recover the remaining tax basis as payments are made if you and your beneficiary under a joint and survivor annuity die before recovering the entire basis of the annuity a deduction is allowed on your or your beneficiarys final tax return early distribution penalty tax distributions from a tsa will be subject to an

take the first required minimum distribution the minimum distribution rules force tsa participants to start computing and taking annual distributions from their tsas by a required date when minimum distributions must begin depends on among other things your age and retirement status generally you must take the first required minimum distribution with respect to the calendar year in which you turn age   you may be entitled to delay commencement of required minimum distributions for all or part of your account balance until after age   these exceptions apply to the following individuals o for tsa participants who have not retired from service with the employer who provided the funds for the tsa by the calendar year the participant turns age   the required beginning date for minimum

have to take the first required minimum distribution the first required minimum distribution is for the calendar year in which you turn age   you have the choice to take this first required minimum distribution during the calendar year you actually reach age   or to delay taking it until the first threemonth period in the next calendar year january   april  distributions must start no later than your required beginning date which is april st of the calendar year after the calendar year in which you turn age   if you choose to delay taking the first annual minimum distribution then you will have to take two minimum distributions in that year the delayed one for the first year and the actual one for that year once minimum distributions begin they must be made at some time each year how you can calculate required minimum distributions there are two approaches to taking required minimum distributions accountbased or annuitybased if you choose an accountbased method you divide the value of your regular ira as of december st of the past calendar year by a life expectancy factor from irs tables this gives you the required minimum distribution amount for that particular ira for that year if you choose an accountbased method the required minimum distribution amount will vary each year as the account value and your life expectancy factors change if you choose an annuitybased method you do not have to do annual calculations you apply the account value to an annuity payout for your life or the joint lives of you and a designated beneficiary or for a period certain not extending beyond applicable life expectancies if you pick an accountbased method you have a choice of life expectancy factors depending on whether you choose a method based only on your life expectancy or the joint life expectancies of you and another individual you can decide to recalculate your life expectancy every year by using your current life expectancy factor you can decide instead to use the term certain method where you reduce your life expectancy by one every year after the initial year if your spouse is your designated beneficiary for figuring out annual accountbased required minimum distributions you can also annually recalculate your spouses life expectancy if you want if you choose someone who is not your spouse as your sai pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th  designated beneficiary for the purpose of figuring out annual accountbased required minimum distributions you have to use the term certain method of calculating that persons life expectancy if you pick a nonspouse designated beneficiary you may also have to do another special calculation if you pick an accountbased method you can later apply your regular ira funds to a life annuitybased payout you can only do this if you already chose to recalculate your life expectancy annually and your spouses life expectancy if you select a spousal joint annuity for example if you anticipate selecting a form of life annuity payout after you are age   you must have elected to recalculate life expectancies whether you have to pick the same method to calculate your required minimum distributions for all of your regular iras and other retirement plans you can choose a different method and a different beneficiary for each of your regular iras and other retirement plans for example you can choose an annuity payout from one ira a different annuity payout from a qualified plan and an accountbased annual withdrawal from another ira if you take more than you need to for any year the correct required minimum distribution amount for your regular iras is calculated on a yearbyyear basis there are no carryback or carryforward provisions also you cannot apply required minimum distribution amounts you take from your qualified plans to the amounts you have to take from your regular iras and viceversa however the irs will let you figure out the required minimum distribution for each regular ira that you maintain using the method that you picked for that particular ira you can add these required minimum distribution amount calculations together as long as the total amount you take out every year satisfies your overall regular ira required minimum distribution amount you may choose to take your annual required minimum distribution from any one or more regular iras that you own if you take less than you need to for any year your ira could be disqualified and you could have to pay tax on the entire value even if your ira is not disqualified you could have to pay a  penalty tax on the shortfall required amount for regular iras less amount actually taken it is your responsibility to meet the required minimum distribution rules we will remind you when our records show that your age   is approaching if you do not select a method with us we will assume you are taking your required minimum distribution from another regular ira that you own required minimum distribution payments after you die if you die after either  the start of annuity payments or  your required beginning date your beneficiary must receive payment of the remaining values in the certificate at least as rapidly as under the distribution method before your death in some circumstances your surviving spouse may elect to become the owner of the regular ira and halt distributions until he or she reaches age   if you are using the recalculation method for determining life expectancy the payments to a beneficiary may accelerate after your death if you die before your required beginning date and before annuity payments begin federal tax rules require complete distribution of your entire value in the certificate within five years after your death payments to a designated beneficiary over the beneficiarys life or over a period certain that does not extend beyond the beneficiarys life expectancy are also permitted if these payments start within one year of your death a surviving spouse beneficiary can also  delay starting any payments until you would have attained   or  roll over your regular ira into his or her own regular ira sai

are determined at the end of each business day the unit value of any fund for any business day is equal to the unit value for the preceding business day multiplied by the net investment factor for that fund on that business day a net investment factor for each fund is determined every business day as follows o first we take the value of the shares held by the fund in the corresponding portfolio of the hudson river trust or eq advisors trust at the close of business that day before giving effect to any amounts allocated to or withdrawn from the fund for that day for this purpose we use the share value reported to us by the portfolio o then we divide this amount by the value of the amounts in the fund at the close of business on the preceding business day after giving effect to any amounts allocated or withdrawn for that day o finally we subtract any daily charge for fees or expenses payable by the fund illustration of changes in unit values generally if on a particular business day investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized capital losses and any expense charges the unit value would be greater than the value for the previous period for example assume that at the close of trading on a monday the value of a funds assets is  and the unit value is  if on the next business day tuesday the investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized losses by  and the daily accrual for expenses charged to the trust is  the unit value for that day would be calculated as follows

sevenday periods the sevenday current yield calculation is based on a hypothetical account balance with one unit at the beginning of the period to determine the sevenday rate of return the net change in the unit value is computed by subtracting the unit value at the beginning of the period from a unit value exclusive of capital changes at the end of the period the net change will be reduced by the

return by  to produce an annualized sevenday current yield figure that we carry to the nearest onehundredth of one percent the actual dollar amount of the participant service charge that we deduct from the alliance money market fund will vary for each participant depending upon how the participant allocates the account balance among the investment options to determine the effect of the participant service charge on the yield we start with the total dollar amount of the charges deducted from the fund on the last day of the prior quarter this amount is multiplied by  to produce an average participant service charge factor which is used in all weekly yield computations for the ensuing quarter the average administrative charge is then divided by the number of alliance money market fund units as of the end of the prior calendar quarter and we deduct the resulting quotient from the net change in unit value for the sevenday period the effective yield is obtained by modifying the current yield to give effect to the compounding nature of the alliance money market funds investments as follows compounding the unannualized adjusted base period return by adding one to the adjusted base period return raising the sum to a power equal to  divided by  and subtracting one from the result ie effective yield  base period return      the alliance money market fund yields will fluctuate daily accordingly yields for any given period are not necessarily representative of future results in addition the value of units of the alliance money market fund will fluctuate and not remain constant the alliance money market fund yields reflect charges that are not normally reflected in the yields of other investments and therefore may be lower when compared with yields of other investments you should not compare alliance money market fund yields to the return on fixed rate investments that guarantee rates of interest for specified periods such as the guaranteed rate accounts or bank deposits you should not compare the yield to the yield of money market funds made available to the general public those yields usually are calculated on the basis of a constant  price per share and those funds pay out earnings in dividends that accrue on a daily basis the sevenday current yield for the alliance money market fund was  for the period ended december   the effective yield for that period was  because these yields reflect the deduction of separate account no  expenses including the participant service charge they are lower than the corresponding yield figures for

instruments the company defines fair value as the quoted market prices for those instruments that are actively traded in financial markets in cases where quoted market prices are not available fair values are estimated using present value or other valuation techniques the fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on available market information and judgments about the financial instrument including estimates of the timing and amount of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of counterparties such estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the companys entire holdings of a particular financial instrument nor do they consider the tax impact of the realization of unrealized gains or losses

rates fair values for longterm debt are determined using published market values where available or contractual cash flows discounted at market interest rates the estimated fair values for nonrecourse

applicable see charges and expenses later in this prospectus we refer to the amount of the account balance attributable to the gras as their cash value the cash value of a gra guarantee period reflects a withdrawal charge where applicable as described below your account balance in the funds your contributions to one or more of the funds are in turn invested in shares of a corresponding portfolio the value of your interest in each fund is measured by units that are purchased with your contributions your units will increase or decrease in value as though you had invested in the corresponding portfolios shares directly your account balance however will decrease by the amount of the fees and charges that we deduct under the certificate your account balance will also decrease by the dollar amount of any withdrawals that you make we determine the number of units of a fund you purchase by dividing the amount of your contribution by the funds unit value for the business day on which we receive your contribution on any day the value of your interest in a fund equals the number of units credited to your certificate under that fund multiplied by the value for one unit the

may be subject to a withdrawal charge please see allocating your contributions in certificate features for more information about your role in managing your allocations disruptive transfer activity you should note that the contract is not designed for professional market timing organizations or other organizations or individuals engaging in a market timing strategy the contract is not designed to accommodate programmed transfers frequent transfers or transfers that are large in relation to the total assets of the underlying portfolio frequent transfers including market timing and other program trading or shortterm trading strategies may be disruptive to the underlying portfolios in which the variable investment options invest disruptive transfer activity may adversely affect performance and the interests of longterm investors by requiring a portfolio to maintain larger amounts of cash or to liquidate portfolio holdings at a disadvantageous time or price for example when market timing occurs a portfolio may have to sell its holdings to have the cash necessary to redeem the market timers investment this can happen when it is not advantageous to sell any securities so the portfolios performance may be hurt when large dollar amounts are involved market timing can also make it difficult to use longterm investment strategies because a portfolio cannot predict how much cash it will have to invest in addition disruptive transfers or purchases and redemptions of portfolio investments may impede efficient portfolio management and impose increased transaction costs such as brokerage costs by requiring the portfolio manager to effect more frequent purchases and sales of portfolio securities similarly a portfolio may bear increased administrative costs as a result of the asset level and investment volatility that accompanies patterns of excessive or shortterm trading portfolios that invest a significant portion of their assets in foreign securities or the securities of small and midcapitalization companies tend to be subject to the risks associated with market timing and shortterm trading strategies to a greater extent than portfolios that do not securities trading in overseas markets present time zone arbitrage opportunities when events affecting portfolio securities values occur after the close of the overseas market but prior to the close of the us markets securities of small and midcapitalization companies present arbitrage opportunities because the market for such securities may be less liquid than the market for securities of larger companies which could result in pricing inefficiencies please see the prospectuses for the underlying portfolios for more information on how portfolio shares are priced we currently use the procedures described below to discourage disruptive transfer activity you should understand however that these procedures are subject to the following limitations  they primarily rely on the policies and procedures implemented by the underlying portfolios  they do not eliminate the possibility that disruptive transfer activity including market timing will occur or that portfolio performance will be affected by such activity and  the design of market timing procedures involves inherently subjective judgments which we seek to make in a fair and reasonable manner consistent with the interests of all policy and contract owners we offer investment options with underlying portfolios that are part of axa premier vip trust and eq advisors trust together the trusts the trusts have adopted policies and procedures regarding disruptive transfer activity they discourage frequent purchases and redemptions of portfolio shares and will not make special arrangements to accommodate such transactions they aggregate inflows and outflows for each portfolio on a daily basis on any day when a portfolios net inflows or outflows exceed an established monitoring threshold the trust obtains from us owner trading activity the trusts currently consider transfers into and out of or vice versa the same variable investment option within a five business day period as potentially disruptive transfer activity each trust reserves the right to reject a transfer that it believes in its sole discretion is disruptive or potentially disruptive to the management of one of its portfolios please see the prospectuses for the trusts for more information when a contract owner is identified as having engaged in a potentially disruptive transfer under the contract for the first time a letter is sent to the contract owner explaining that there is a policy against disruptive transfer activity and that if such activity continues certain transfer transferring your money among investment options

contract we currently prohibit the use of voice fax and automated transaction services we currently apply such action for the remaining life of each affected contract we or a trust may change the definition of potentially disruptive transfer activity the monitoring procedures and thresholds any notification procedures and the procedures to restrict this activity any new or revised policies and procedures will apply to all contract owners uniformly we do not permit exceptions to our policies restricting disruptive transfer activity it is possible that the trusts may impose a redemption fee designed to discourage frequent or disruptive trading by contract owners as of the date of this prospectus the trusts had not implemented such a fee if a redemption fee is implemented by a trust that fee like any other trust fee will be borne by the contract owner contract owners should note that it is not always possible for us and the underlying trusts to identify and prevent disruptive transfer activity our ability to monitor potentially disruptive transfer activity is limited in particular with respect to certain group contracts group annuity contracts may be owned by retirement plans that provide transfer instructions on an omnibus aggregate basis which may mask the disruptive transfer activity of individual plan participants andor interfere with our ability to restrict communication services in addition because we do not monitor for all frequent trading at the separate account level contract owners may engage in frequent trading which may not be detected for example due to low net inflows or outflows on the particular days therefore no assurance can be given that we or the trusts will successfully impose restrictions on all potentially disruptive transfers because there is no guarantee that disruptive trading will be stopped some contract owners may be treated differently than others resulting in the risk that some contract owners may be able to engage in frequent transfer activity while others will bear the effect of that frequent transfer activity the potential effects of frequent transfer activity are discussed above  transferring your money among investment

which the department of labor dol administers these rules may change without notice we cannot predict whether when or how these rules could change any change could affect certificates purchased before

for salary reduction contributions to certain plans or a regular ira or roth ira you may be eligible for a nonrefundable income tax credit for salary reduction contributions you make to a b tsa simple

contribution of  your savers credit may also be reduced if you take or have taken a taxable distribution from any plan eligible for a savers credit contribution  even if you make a contribution to one plan and take the distribution from another plan  during the testing period the testing period begins two years before the year for which you make the contribution and ends when your tax return is due for the year for which you make the contribution tax sheltered annuity contracts tsas general special employer rules the following discussion reflects our current understanding of some of the special federal income tax rules applicable to annuity contracts used to fund employer plans under section b of the internal revenue code we refer to these contracts as b annuity contracts or tax sheltered annuity contracts tsas final regulations under section b the irs and the treasury department recently published final treasury regulations under section b of the code  regulations as a result there are significant revisions to the establishment and operation of plans and arrangements under section b of the code and the contracts issued to fund such plans these rules become fully effective on january   but various transition rules apply beginning in  there are a number of uncertainties regarding the application of these rules the  regulations raise a number of questions as to the effect of the  regulations on b tsa contracts issued prior to the effective date of the  regulations the irs has issued guidance intended to clarify some of these questions and may issue further guidance in future years an employer eligible to maintain a b plan for its employees may make contributions to purchase a b funding vehicle for the benefit of the employee these contributions if properly made will not be currently taxable compensation to the employee moreover the employee will not be taxed on the earnings in the b funding vehicle until heshe takes distributions generally there are two types of funding vehicles available to fund b plans an annuity contract under section b of the code or a custodial account that invests only in mutual funds and which is treated as an annuity contract under section b of the code both types of b arrangements qualify for tax deferral two different types of employers are eligible to maintain b plans public schools and specified taxexempt organizations under section c of the code  pbposrd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd employer plan requirement the thrust of the  regulations is to eliminate informal section b arrangements with minimal or diffuse employer oversight and to require employers purchasing annuity contracts for their employees under section b of the code to conform to other taxfavored employerbased retirement plans with salary reduction contributions such as section k plans and governmental employer section b plans as of january   employers sponsoring b plans must have a written plan designating administrative responsibilities for various functions under the plan and the plan in operation must conform to the plan terms as part of this process the sponsoring employer must also designate the insurance companies or mutual fund companies to which it will make contributions to purchase b annuity contracts or b custodial accounts under its b plan these companies are typically referred to as approved providers or approved vendors under the employers b plan although such terms are not used in the  regulations if axa equitable is not an approved provider under an employers b plan active participants in that employers plan may have to transfer funds from their axa equitable tsa contracts to another b plan funding vehicle in a contract exchange under the same plan in order to retain b status for those funds contributions to tsas annual contributions to tsas made through the employers payroll annual contributions to tsas made through the employers payroll are limited if permitted by the plan plantoplan direct transfer contributions from another b plan contract exchanges under the same plan and rollover contributions from another eligible retirement plan are not subject to these annual contribution limits commonly some or all of the contributions to a tsa are made under a salary reduction agreement between the employee and the employer these contributions are called salary reduction or elective deferral contributions and are generally made on a pretax basis however a tsa can also be wholly or partially funded through nonelective employer contributions or contributions treated as aftertax employee contributions if the employers plan permits a participant may designate some or all of salary reduction contributions as designated roth contributions which are made on an aftertax basis we do not accept designated roth contributions to this contract the permissible annual contribution to the participants tsa is calculated the same way as contributions to a k plan o the annual limit on employer and employee contributions to defined contribution plans is the lesser of  after adjustment for cost of living changes for  or  of compensation compensation over  for  is disregarded o the annual limit on all salary reduction or elective deferral contributions under all employer plans you participate in is generally limited to  for  these limits may be further adjusted for cost of living charges in future years special provisions may allow certain participants with at least  years of service to make catchup contributions to compensate for smaller contributions made in previous years in addition if the plan permits an individual who is at least age  at any time during  can make up to  additional salary reduction contributions for  if contributions to a tsa exceed the applicable limit in any year the excess will be taxable to the employee as ordinary income in certain situations we may distribute excess contributions to avoid tax penalties any excess deferral contributions not withdrawn by april  after the year of the deferral may cause the contract to fail tsa rules rollover contributions to tsas rollover contributions federal tax law permits rollover contributions to be made to a tsa contract from these sources qualified plans governmental employer b plans and traditional iras as well as other b plan funding vehicles the recipient b plan must allow such contributions to be made generally funds may be rolled over when a plan participant has a distributable event from an eligible retirement plan as a result of o termination of employment with the employer who provided the funds for the plan or o reaching age  even if still employed or o disability special federal income tax definition if your plan permits any aftertax contributions you have made to a qualified plan or tsa may be directly rolled over to another qualified plan or tsa which agrees to do required separate accounting this can only be done in a direct rollover not a rollover you do yourself aftertax contributions in a regular ira cannot be rolled over from the regular ira into a tsa if the aftertax contributions are in a designated roth contribution account under a b plan or k plan which permits designated roth elective deferral contributions to be made they can be rolled into another designated roth contribution account under another b plan or k plan they cannot be rolled into a nonroth aftertax contribution account before you decide to roll over your payment to another employer plan you should check with the administrator of that plan about whether the plan accepts rollovers and if so the types of distributions it accepts you should also check with the administrator of the receiving plan about any documents required to be completed before it will accept a rollover you should discuss with your tax advisor whether you should consider rolling over funds from one type of taxqualified retirement plan to another because the funds will generally be subject to the rules of the recipient plan for example funds in a governmental employer b plan are not subject to the additional  federal income tax penalty for premature distributions but they may become subject to this penalty if you roll the funds to a nongovernmental employer b plan such as a tsa and subsequently take a premature distribution further in light of the restrictions on the ability to take distributions or loans from a b contract without plan or employer approval under the  regulations a plan participant should consider carefully whether

ruling  rev rul  effective january   prior to the  regulations rev rul  had permitted individualinitiated taxfree direct transfers of funds from one b contract to another without reportable taxable income to the individual under transitional rules in the  regulations and other irs published guidance direct transfers made after september   may still be permitted with plan or employer approval as described below direct transfer contributions a taxfree direct transfer occurs when changing the b plan funding vehicle even if there is no distributable event under a direct transfer a plan participant does not receive a distribution the  regulations provide for two types of direct transfers between b funding vehicles plantoplan transfers and contract exchanges within the same b plan b plans do not have to offer these options a plantoplan transfer must meet the following conditions i both the source b plan and the recipient b plan permit plantoplan transfers ii the transfer from one b plan to another b plan is made for a participant or beneficiary of a deceased participant who is an employee or former employee of the employer sponsoring the recipient b plan iii immediately after the transfer the accumulated benefit of the participant or beneficiary whose assets are being transferred is at least equal to the participants or beneficiarys accumulated benefit immediately before the transfer iv the recipient b plan imposes distribution restrictions on transferred amounts at least as stringent as those imposed under the source b plan and v if the plantoplan transfer is not a complete transfer of the participants or beneficiarys interest in the source b plan the recipient b plan treats the amount transferred as a continuation of a pro rata portion of the participants or beneficiarys interest in the source b plan for example with respect to the participants interest in any aftertax employee contributions a contract exchange within the same b plan must meet the following conditions i the b plan under which the contract is issued must permit contract exchanges ii immediately after the exchange the accumulated benefit of the participant or beneficiary of a deceased participant is at least equal to the participants or beneficiarys accumulated benefit immediately before the exchange taking into account the accumulated benefit of that participant or beneficiary under both section b contracts immediately before the exchange iii the contract issued in the exchange is subject to distribution restrictions with respect to the participant that are not less stringent than those imposed on the contract being exchanged and iv the employer sponsoring the b plan and the issuer of the contract issued in the exchange agree to provide each other with

be subject to additional tax penalties if you have made aftertax contributions you will have a tax basis in your certificate which will be recovered taxfree you may have a tax basis in the certificate if the employer made contributions that were included in your gross income in the year of the employers contribution for example unless we have been provided acceptable documentation for the amounts of any aftertax contributions to your tsa we assume that all amounts distributed from your tsa are pretax and we withhold tax and report accordingly if certain timing and distribution event requirements are satisfied distributions from a designated roth contribution account under a b plan will be taxfree the earliest a qualified distribution from a designated roth contribution account could be made is  therefore earnings attributable to a distribution from a designated roth account may be includible in income the amount of any partial distribution from a tsa before the annuity starting date is generally taxable as ordinary income to you except to the extent the distribution is a withdrawal of your basis distributions are generally pro rata withdrawals of tax basis and earnings on that tax basis on a total surrender of your certificate the amount received in excess of your tax basis if any is taxable if you elect an annuity distribution the nontaxable portion of each payment is  your tax basis in the contract divided by  an expected return determined under irs tables the balance of each payment is taxable the entire amount of the payments you receive after you recover your tax basis is taxable if you die before recovering your tax basis and the annuity has a refund feature the beneficiary of the refund may recover the remaining tax basis as payments are made if you and your beneficiary under a joint and survivor annuity die before recovering the entire basis of the annuity a deduction is allowed on your or your beneficiarys final tax return early

plan or a roth ira  pbposth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th before you decide to roll over your payment to another employer plan you should check with the administrator of that plan about whether the plan accepts rollovers and if so the types of distributions it accepts you should also check with the administrator of the receiving plan about any documents required to be completed before it will accept a rollover generally the funds are subject to the rules of the recipient plan if the recipient plan separately accounts for funds rolled over from another eligible retirement plan the irs has ruled that an exception is available in certain situations to withdrawal restrictions that would otherwise apply to the rollover contribution funds in the recipient plan however distributions from a governmental employer b plan are generally not subject to the additional  federal income tax penalty for preage  distributions which applies to other types of retirement plans if you roll over funds from an eligible retirement plan which is not a governmental employer b plan into a governmental employer b plan and you later take a distribution from the recipient governmental

minimum distributions apply to tsas with this difference when you have to take the first required minimum distribution the minimum distribution rules force tsa participants to start computing and taking annual distributions from their tsas by a required date when minimum distributions must begin depends on among other things your age and retirement status generally you must take the first required minimum distribution with respect to the calendar year in which you turn age  you may be entitled to delay commencement of required minimum distributions for all or part of your account

retirement arrangement and the two basic types of such arrangements individual retirement accounts and individual retirement annuities in an individual retirement account a trustee or custodian holds the assets funding the account for the benefit of the ira owner the assets typically include mutual funds andor individual stocks and securities in a custodial account and bank certificates of deposit in a trusteed account in an individual retirement annuity an insurance company issues an annuity contract that serves as the ira there are two basic types of iras as follows o regular iras typically funded on a pretax basis including sepiras and simple iras issued and funded in connection with employersponsored retirement plans and o roth iras funded on an aftertax basis regardless of the type of ira your ownership interest in the ira cannot be forfeited you or your beneficiaries who survive you are the only ones who can receive the iras benefits or payments all types of iras qualify for tax deferral regardless of the funding vehicle selected you can hold your ira assets in as many different accounts and annuities as you would like as long as you meet the rules for setting up and making contributions to iras however if you own multiple iras you may be required to aggregate ira values or contributions for tax purposes for further information about individual retirement arrangements you can read internal revenue service publication  individual retirement arrangements iras this publication is usually updated annually and can be obtained from any irs district office or the irs website wwwirsgov the axa equitable  series iras are designed to qualify as individual retirement annuities under section b of the internal revenue code this sai and the prospectus contain the

individual retirement annuities regular iras contributions to regular iras individuals may make three different types of contributions to purchase a regular ira or as subsequent contributions to an existing ira o regular contributions out of earned income or compensation o taxfree rollover contributions or o direct custodiantocustodian transfers from other regular iras direct transfers limits on contributions the maximum regular contribution amount for any taxable year is the most that can be contributed to all of your iras regular and roth as regular contributions for the particular taxable year the maximum regular contribution amount depends on age earnings and year among other things generally  is the maximum amount of regular contributions that you may make to all iras including roth iras when your earnings are below  your earned income or compensation for the year is the most you can contribute this limit does not apply to rollover contributions or direct custodiantocustodian transfers into a regular ira you have to stop making regular ira contributions for the taxable year in which you reach age  and any taxable year after that if you are at least age  at any time during the taxable year for which you are making a regular contribution to your ira you may be eligible to make additional catchup contributions of up to  to your regular ira special rules for spouses if you are married and file a joint income tax return you and your spouse may combine your compensation to determine the permissible amount of regular contributions to regular iras and roth iras discussed below even if one spouse has no compensation or compensation under  married individuals filing jointly can contribute up to  for  to any combination of regular iras and roth iras any contributions to

working spouse age  or over can contribute up to the lesser of  or  of earned income to a regular ira for a nonworking spouse until the year in which the nonworking spouse reaches age  catchup contributions may be made as described above for spouses who are at least age  but under age  at any time during taxable year for which the contribution is being made deductibility of contributions the amount of regular contributions to a regular ira that you can deduct for a taxable year depends on whether you are covered by an employersponsored taxfavored retirement plan as defined under special federal income tax rules your form w will indicate whether or not you are covered by such a retirement plan if you are not covered by a retirement plan during any part of the year you can make fully deductible contributions to your regular iras for the taxable year up to the maximum amount discussed earlier in this section under limits on contributions that is for  your fully deductible contribution can be up to  or if less your earned income the dollar limit is  for people eligible to make age  catchup contributions if you are covered by a retirement plan during any part of the year and your adjusted gross income agi is below the lower dollar figure in a phaseout range you can make fully deductible contributions to your regular iras if you are covered by a retirement plan during any part of the year and your agi falls within a phaseout range you can make partially deductible contributions to your regular iras if you are covered by a retirement plan during any part of the year and your agi falls above the higher figure in the phaseout range you may not deduct any of your contribution to your regular iras cost of living indexing adjustments apply to the income limits to deductible contributions if you are single and covered by a retirement plan during any part of the taxable year the deduction for traditional ira contributions phases out with agi between  and  for

this deductible contribution calculation generally the active participation in an employersponsored retirement plan of an individual is determined independently for each spouse where spouses have married filing jointly status however the maximum deductible traditional ira contribution for an individual who is not an active participant but whose spouse is an active participant is phased out for taxpayers with an agi between  and  for  agi between  and  after adjustment to determine the deductible amount of the contribution for  for example you determine agi and subtract  if you are single or

regular contributions if you are not eligible to deduct part or all of the regular ira contribution you may still make nondeductible contributions on which earnings will accumulate on a taxdeferred basis the combined deductible and nondeductible contributions to your regular ira or the nonworking spouses regular ira may not however exceed the  maximum per person limit for the applicable taxable year the dollar limit is  for people eligible to make age  catchup contributions see excess contributions below you must keep your own records of deductible and nondeductible contributions in order to prevent double taxation on the distribution of previously taxed amounts see withdrawals payments and transfer of funds out of regular iras below if you are making nondeductible contributions in any taxable year or you have made nondeductible contributions to a regular ira in prior years and are receiving distributions from any regular ira you must file the required information with the irs moreover if you are making nondeductible regular ira contributions you must retain all income tax returns and records pertaining to such contributions until interests in all regular iras are fully distributed when you can make regular contributions if you file your tax returns on a calendar year basis like most taxpayers you have until the april  return filing deadline without extensions of the following calendar year to make your regular ira contributions for a tax year rollover and transfer contributions to regular iras rollover contributions may be made to a regular ira from these eligible retirement plans o qualified plans o governmental employer b plans o b plans and o other regular iras direct transfer contributions may only be made directly from one regular ira to another any amount contributed to a regular ira after you attain age  must be net of your required minimum distribution for the year in which the rollover or direct transfer contribution is made rollovers from eligible retirement plans other than regular iras your plan administrator will tell you whether or not your distributions are eligible to be rolled over spousal beneficiaries and spousal alternate payees under qualified domestic relations orders may roll over funds on the same basis as the plan participant a nonspousal death beneficiary may also be able to make a direct rollover to an inherited traditional ira under certain circumstances there are two ways to do rollovers o do it yourself you actually receive a distribution that can be rolled over and you roll it over to a regular ira within  days after the date you receive the funds the distribution from your eligible retirement plan will be net of  mandatory federal income tax withholding if you want you can replace the withheld funds yourself and roll over the full amount o direct rollover you tell the trustee or custodian of the eligible retirement plan to send the distribution directly to your regular ira issuer direct rollovers are not subject to mandatory federal income tax withholding all distributions from a qualified plan b plan or governmental employer b plan are eligible rollover distributions unless the distribution is o a required minimum distribution after age  or retirement from service with the employer o one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made at least annually for your life or life expectancy or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of you and your designated beneficiary o one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made for a specified period of  years or more o a hardship withdrawal o if you have contributed too much a corrective distribution which fits specified technical tax rules o a loan that is treated as a deemed distribution o a death benefit payment to a beneficiary who is not your surviving spouse and o a qualified domestic relations order distribution to a beneficiary who is not your current spouse or former spouse you should discuss with your tax advisor whether you should consider rolling over funds from one type of tax qualified retirement plan to another because the funds will generally be subject to the rules of the recipient plan for example funds in a governmental employer b plan are not subject to the additional  federal income tax penalty for early distributions but they may become subject to this penalty if you roll the funds to a nongovernmental employer b plan such as a regular ira and subsequently take an early distribution rollovers of aftertax contributions from eligible retirement plans other than regular iras any nonroth aftertax contributions you have made to a qualified plan or b plan but not a governmental employer b plan may be rolled over to a regular ira either in a direct rollover or a

regular ira to one or more of your other regular iras if you complete the transaction within  days after you receive the funds you may make such a rollover only once in every month period for the same funds trusteetotrustee or custodiantocustodian direct transfers are not rollover transactions you can make these more frequently than once in every month period spousal rollovers and divorcerelated transfers the surviving spouse beneficiary of a deceased individual can roll over funds from or directly transfer funds from an inherited regular ira to one or more other regular iras a nonspousal death beneficiary may also be able to make a direct rollover to an inherited traditional ira under certain circumstances also in some cases regular iras can be transferred on a taxfree basis between spouses or former spouses as a result of a courtordered divorce or separation decree excess contributions excess contributions to regular iras are subject to a  excise tax for the year in which made and for each year after until withdrawn the following are excess contributions to regular iras o regular contributions of more than the maximum regular contribution amount for the applicable taxable year or o regular contributions to a regular ira made after you reach age  and o rollover contributions of amounts that are not eligible to be rolled over for example minimum distributions required to be made after age  you can avoid the excise tax by withdrawing an excess contribution rollover or regular before the due date including extensions for filing your federal income tax return for the year if it is an excess regular regular ira contribution you cannot take a tax deduction for the amount withdrawn the excess contribution withdrawn is not includable in income and is not subject to the  additional penalty tax on early distributions discussed below under early distribution penalty tax you do have to withdraw any earnings attributable to the excess contribution the withdrawn earnings would be includable in your gross income and could be subject to the  penalty tax even after the due date for filing your return you may withdraw an excess rollover contribution without income inclusion or  penalty if  the rollover was from an eligible retirement plan to a regular ira  the excess contribution was due to incorrect information that the plan provided and  you took no tax deduction for the excess contribution recharacterizations amounts that have been contributed as regular ira funds may subsequently be treated as roth ira funds special federal income tax rules allow you to change your mind again and have amounts that are subsequently treated as roth ira funds once again treated as regular ira funds you do this by using the forms or documentation we prescribe this is referred to as having recharacterized your contribution withdrawals payments and transfers of funds out of regular iras no federal income tax law restrictions on withdrawals you can withdraw any or all of your funds from a regular ira at any time you do not need to wait for a special event like retirement taxation of payments earnings in regular iras are not taxable until you or your beneficiary receive them taxable payments or distributions include withdrawals from your certificate surrender of your certificate and annuity payments from your certificate death benefits are also taxable except as discussed below the amount of any distribution from a regular ira must be included in your gross income as ordinary income we report all payments from regular ira contracts on irs form r as fully taxable if you have ever made nondeductible ira contributions to any regular ira it does not have to be to this particular regular ira certificate those contributions are recovered tax free when you get distributions from any regular ira it is your responsibility to keep permanent tax records of all of your nondeductible contributions to regular iras so that you can correctly report the taxable amount of any distribution on your own tax return at the end of any year in which you have received a distribution from any regular ira you compute the nontaxable portion of the distribution as follows o divide  your total nondeductible regular ira contributions less any amounts previously withdrawn tax free by  the total account balances of all regular iras you own at the end of the year plus all regular ira distributions made during the year o multiply this amount by all distributions from the regular ira during the year a distribution from a regular ira is not taxable if o the amount received is a withdrawal of excess contributions as described under excess contributions above o the entire amount received is rolled over to another regular ira or other eligible retirement plan which agrees to accept the funds see rollovers from eligible retirement plans other than regular iras under rollover and transfer contributions to regular iras above the following are eligible to receive rollovers of distributions from a regular ira a qualified plan a b plan or a governmental employer b plan aftertax contributions in a regular ira cannot be rolled from your regular ira into or back into a qualified plan b plan or governmental employer b plan before you decide to roll over a distribution from a regular ira to another eligible retirement plan you should check with the administrator of that plan about  pbposth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th whether the plan accepts rollovers and if so the types it accepts you should also check with the administrator of the receiving plan about any documents required to be completed before it will accept a rollover distributions from a regular ira are not eligible for favorable tenyear averaging and longterm capital gain treatment available under limited circumstances for certain distributions from qualified plans if you might be eligible for such tax treatment from your qualified plan you may be able to preserve such tax treatment even though an eligible rollover from a qualified plan is temporarily rolled into a conduit ira before being rolled back into a qualified plan see your tax advisor required minimum distributions distributions must be made from regular iras according to rules contained in the code and treasury regulations certain provisions of the treasury regulations require that the actuarial present value of additional annuity contract benefits must be added to the dollar amount credited for purposes of calculating certain types of required minimum distributions from individual retirement annuity contracts for this purpose additional annuity contract benefits may include but are not limited to guaranteed minimum income benefits and enhanced death benefits this could increase the amount required to be distributed from these contracts currently we believe that these provisions would not apply to axa equitable  series certificates because of the type of benefits provided under the certificates however if you take annual withdrawals instead of annuitizing please consult your tax adviser concerning applicability of these complex rules to your situation lifetime required minimum distributions you must start taking annual distributions from your regular iras for the year in which you turn age  when you have to take the first lifetime required minimum distribution the first required minimum distribution is for the calendar year in which you turn age  you have the choice to take this first required minimum distribution during the calendar year you actually reach age  or to delay taking it until the first threemonth period in the next calendar year january   april  distributions must start no later than your required beginning date which is april st of the calendar year after the calendar year in which you turn age  if you choose to delay taking the first annual minimum distribution then you will have to take two minimum distributions in that year the delayed one for the first year and the actual one for that year once minimum distributions begin they must be made at some time each year how you can calculate required minimum distributions there are two approaches to taking required minimum distributions accountbased or annuitybased accountbased method if you choose an accountbased method you divide the value of your regular ira as of december st of the past calendar year by a number corresponding to your age from an irs table this gives you the required minimum distribution amount for that particular ira for that year if your spouse is your sole beneficiary and more than  years younger than you the dividing number you use may be from another irs table and may produce a smaller lifetime required minimum distribution amount regardless of the table used the required minimum distribution amount will vary each year as the account value the actuarial present value of additional annuity contract benefits if applicable and the divisor change if you initially choose an accountbased method you may later apply your regular ira funds to a life annuitybased payout with any certain period not exceeding remaining life expectancy determined in accordance with irs tables the irs will let you figure out the accountbased required minimum distribution for each regular ira that you maintain using the method that you picked for that particular ira you can add these required minimum distribution amount calculations together as long as the total amount you take out every year satisfies your overall regular ira required minimum distribution amount you may choose to take your annual required minimum distribution from any one or more regular iras that you own annuitybased method if you choose an annuitybased method you do not have to do annual calculations you apply the account value to an annuity payout for your life or the joint lives of you and a designated beneficiary or for a period certain not extending beyond applicable life expectancies determined in accordance with irs tables whether you have to pick the same method to calculate your required minimum distributions for all of your regular iras and other retirement plans you can choose a different method for each of your regular iras and other retirement plans for example you can choose an annuity payout from one ira a different annuity payout from a qualified plan and an accountbased annual withdrawal from another ira if you take more than you need to for any year the correct required minimum distribution amount for your regular iras is calculated on a yearbyyear basis there are no carryback or carryforward provisions also you cannot apply required minimum distribution amounts you take from your qualified plans to the amounts you have to take from your regular iras and vice versa if you take less than you need to for any year your ira could be disqualified and you could have to pay tax on the entire value even if your ira is not disqualified you could have to pay a  penalty tax on the shortfall required amount for regular iras less amount actually taken it is your responsibility to meet the required minimum distribution rules we will remind you when our records show that you are within the age group which must take lifetime required minimum distributions if you do not select a method  pbposst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st with us we will assume you are taking your required minimum distribution from another regular ira that you own required minimum distribution payments after you die these could vary depending on whether you die before or after your required beginning date for lifetime required minimum distribution payments and the status of your beneficiary the following assumes that you have not yet elected an annuitybased payout at the time of your death if you elect an annuitybased payout payments if any after your death must be made at least as rapidly as when you were alive individual beneficiary regardless of whether your death occurs before or after your required beginning date an individual death beneficiary calculates annual postdeath required minimum distribution payments based on the beneficiarys life expectancy using the term certain method that is he or she determines his or her life expectancy using the irsprovided life expectancy tables as of the calendar year after the owners death and reduces that number by one each subsequent year if you die before your required beginning date the rules permit any individual beneficiary including a spousal beneficiary to elect instead to apply the year rule under this rule instead of annual payments having to be made beginning with the first in the year following the owners death the entire account must be distributed by the end of the calendar year which contains the fifth anniversary of the owners death no distribution is required before that fifth year spousal beneficiary if you die after your required beginning date and your death beneficiary is your surviving spouse your spouse has a number of choices postdeath distributions may be made over your spouses single life expectancy any amounts distributed after that surviving spouses death are made over the spouses life expectancy calculated in the year of hisher death reduced by one for each subsequent year in some circumstances your surviving spouse may elect to become the owner of the regular ira and halt distributions until he or she reaches age  or roll over amounts from your regular ira into hisher own regular ira or other eligible retirement plan if you die before your required beginning date and the death beneficiary is your surviving spouse the rules permit the spouse to delay starting payments over hisher life expectancy until the year in which you would have attained age  nonindividual beneficiary if you die after your required beginning date and your death beneficiary is a nonindividual such as the estate the rules permit the beneficiary to calculate postdeath required minimum distribution amounts based on the owners life expectancy in the year of death however note that we need an individual annuitant to keep an annuity certificate in force if the beneficiary is not an individual we must distribute amounts remaining in the annuity contract after the death of the original participant if you die before your required beginning date and the death beneficiary is a nonindividual such as the estate the rules continue to apply the year rule discussed above under individual beneficiary please note that we need an individual annuitant to keep an annuity certificate in force if the beneficiary is not an individual we must distribute amounts remaining in the annuity contract after the death of the original participant payments to a beneficiary after your death regular ira death benefits are taxed the same as regular ira distributions borrowing and loans are prohibited transactions you cannot get loans from a regular ira you cannot use a regular ira as collateral for a loan or other obligation if you borrow against your ira or use it as collateral its taxfavored status will be lost as of the first day of the tax year in which this prohibited event occurs if this happens you must include in federal gross income for that year an amount equal to the fair market value of the regular ira certificate as of the first day of that tax year less the amount of any nondeductible contributions not previously recovered also the early distribution penalty tax of  may apply if you have not reached age  before the first day of that tax year early distribution penalty tax a penalty tax of  of the taxable portion of a distribution applies to distributions

another in a direct transfer transaction you never take possession of the funds but direct the first roth ira custodian trustee or issuer to transfer the first roth ira funds directly to the recipient roth ira custodian trustee or issuer you can make direct transfer transactions only between identical plan types for example roth ira to roth ira you can also make rollover transactions between identical plan types however you can only make rollover transactions between different plan types for example traditional ira to roth ira you may make rollover contributions to a roth ira from these

your modified adjusted gross income exceeds  for this purpose your modified adjusted gross income is computed without the gross income stemming from the conversion rollover modified adjusted gross income for this purpose excludes any lifetime required minimum distribution from a regular ira or other eligible retirement plan you also cannot make conversion contributions to a roth ira for any taxable year in which your federal income tax filing status is married filing separately you cannot make conversion contributions to a roth ira to the extent that the funds in your regular ira or other eligible retirement plan are subject to the lifetime annual required minimum distribution rules you cannot convert and reconvert an amount during the same taxable year or if later during the day period following a recharacterization if you reconvert during either of these periods it will be a failed roth ira conversion the irs and treasury have recently issued proposed and temporary treasury regulations addressing the valuation of annuity contracts funding regular iras in the conversion to roth iras although these regulations are not clear they could require an individuals gross income on the conversion of a regular ira to roth ira to be measured using various actuarial methods and not as if the annuity contract funding the regular ira had been surrendered at the time of conversion this could increase the amount reported as includible in certain circumstances recharacterizations you may be able to treat a contribution made to one type of ira as having been made to a different type of ira this is called recharacterizing the contribution how to recharacterize to recharacterize a contribution you generally must have the contribution transferred from the first ira the one to which it was made to the second ira in a deemed trusteetotrustee transfer if the transfer is made by the due date including extensions for your tax return for the year during which the contribution was made you can elect to treat the contribution as having been originally made to the second ira instead of to the first ira it will be treated as having been made to the second ira on the same date that it was actually made to the first ira you must report the recharacterization and must treat the contribution as having been made to second ira instead of the first ira on your tax return for the year during which the contribution was made the contribution will not be treated as having been made to the second ira unless the transfer includes any net income allocable to the contribution you can take into account any loss on the contribution while it was in the ira when calculating the amount that must be transferred if there was a loss the net income you must transfer may be a negative amount no deduction is allowed for the contribution to the first ira and any net income transferred with the recharacterized contribution is treated as earned in the second ira the contribution will not be treated as having been made to the second ira to the extent any deduction was allowed with respect to the contribution to the first ira for recharacterization purposes a distribution from a regular ira that is received in one tax year and rolled over into a roth ira in the next year but still within  days of the distribution from the regular ira is treated as a contribution to the roth ira in the year of the distribution from the regular ira roth ira conversion contributions from a sepira or simple ira can be recharacterized to a sepira or simple ira including the original sepira or

roth ira at any time without restriction you do not need to wait for a special event like retirement distributions from roth iras distributions include withdrawals from your certificate surrender of your certificate and annuity payments from your certificate death benefits are also distributions you must keep your own records of regular and conversion contributions to all roth iras to assure appropriate taxation you may have to file information on your contributions to and distributions from any roth ira on your tax return you may have to retain all income tax returns and records

a distribution part of it may be taxable for purposes of determining the correct tax treatment of distributions other than the withdrawal of excess contributions and the earnings on them there is a set order in which contributions including conversion contributions and earnings are considered to be distributed from your roth ira the order of distributions is as follows  regular contributions  conversion contributions on a firstinfirstout basis generally total conversions from the earliest year first these conversion contributions are taken into account as follows a taxable portion the amount required to be included in gross income because of conversion first and then the b nontaxable portion  earnings on contributions rollover contributions from other roth iras are disregarded for this purpose to determine the taxable amount distributed distributions and contributions are aggregated or grouped together as follows  all distributions made during the year from all roth iras you maintainwith any custodian or issuerare added together  all regular contributions made during and for the year contri butions made after the close of the year but before the due date of your return are added together this total is added to the total undistributed regular contributions made in prior years  all conversion contributions made during the year are added together for purposes of the ordering rules in the case of any conversion in which the conversion distribution is made in  and the conversion contribution is made in  the conversion contribution is treated as contributed prior to other conversion contributions made in  any recharacterized contributions that end up in a roth ira are added to the appropriate contribution group for the year that the original contribution would have been taken into account if it had been made directly to the roth ira any recharacterized contribution that ends up in an ira other than a roth ira is disregarded for the purpose of grouping both contributions and distributions any amount withdrawn to correct an excess contribution including the earnings withdrawn is also disregarded for this purpose required minimum distributions during life lifetime required minimum distributions do not apply required minimum distributions at death same as regular ira under required minimum distribution payments after you die assuming death before the

contracts you may be able to elect out of this income tax withholding in some cases generally we do not have to withhold if your distributions are not taxable the rate of withholding will depend on the type of distribution and in certain cases the amount of your distribution any income tax withheld is a credit against your income tax liability if you do not have sufficient income tax withheld or do not make sufficient estimated income tax payments you may incur penalties under the estimated income tax rules you must file your request not to withhold in writing before the payment or distribution is made our processing office will provide forms for this purpose you cannot elect out of withholding unless you provide us with your correct taxpayer identification number and a united states residence address you cannot elect out of withholding if we are sending the payment out of the united states you should note the following special situations o we might have to withhold andor report on amounts we pay under a free look or cancellation o we are generally required to withhold on conversion rollovers of regular iras to roth iras as the deemed withdrawal from the regular ira is taxable o we may be required to withhold on the gross amount of a distribution from a roth ira to the extent it is reasonable for us to believe that a distribution is includable in your gross income this may result in tax being withheld even though the roth ira distribution is ultimately not taxable you can elect out of withholding as described below special withholding rules apply to foreign recipients and united states citizens residing outside the united states we do not discuss these rules here in detail however we may require additional documentation in the case of payments made to nonunited states persons and united states persons living abroad prior to processing any requested transaction certain states have indicated that state income tax withholding will also apply to payments from the certificates made to residents in some states you may elect out of state withholding even if federal withholding applies generally we will consider an election out of federal

business day the unit value of any fund for any business day is equal to the unit value for the preceding business day multiplied by the net investment factor for that fund on that business day a net investment factor for each fund is determined every business day as follows o first we take the value of the shares held by the fund in the corresponding portfolio of the trusts at the close of business that day before giving effect to any amounts allocated to or withdrawn from the fund for that day for this purpose we use the share value reported to us by the portfolio o then we divide this amount by the value of the amounts in the fund at the close of business on the preceding business day after giving effect to any amounts allocated or withdrawn for that day o finally we subtract any daily charge for fees or expenses payable by the fund illustration of changes in unit values generally if on a particular business day investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized capital losses and any expense charges the unit value would be greater than the value for the previous period for example assume that at the close of trading on a monday the value of a funds assets is  and the unit value is  if on the next business day tuesday the investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized losses by  and the daily accrual for expenses charged to the trust is  the unit value for that day would be calculated as follows   unit value for monday     value of assets at close of business on monday     excess of investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains over realized and unrealized losses     daily accrual for expenses administration charges and certain expenses borne directly by the funds charged to the investment fund     value of assets less charge for expenses at close of business day on tuesday          net investment factor  divided by     unit value for tuesday  x      if on the other hand the realized and unrealized losses exceeded investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains on that day by  the unit value for tuesday would have been  custodian and

uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation that clarifies the recognition criteria and measurement of the economic benefits associated with tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return under fin  a tax benefit is recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based on the technical merits of the position assuming examination by the taxing authority and is required to be measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than  likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement taking into consideration the amounts and probabilities of potential settlement outcomes fin  also addresses subsequent derecognition of tax positions changes in the measurement of recognized tax positions accrual and classification of interest and penalties and accounting in interim periods in addition annual disclosures with respect to income taxes have been expanded by fin  and require the inclusion of a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of

a plan is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation for pension plans or the benefit obligation for any other postretirement plan sfas no  did not change the determination of net periodic benefit cost or its presentation in the statement of earnings however its requirements represent a significant change to previous accounting guidance that generally delayed recognition of certain changes in plan assets and benefit obligations in the balance sheet and only required disclosure of the complete funded status of the plans in the notes to the financial statements as required by sfas no  the  million impact of initial adoption net of income tax and minority interest was reported as an adjustment to the december   balance of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the consequent recognition of the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans at december   reduced total assets by approximately  million due to the reduction of prepaid pension cost and decreased total liabilities by approximately  million the change in liabilities resulted from the  million decrease in income taxes payable partially offset by an increase of  million in benefit plan liabilities see note  of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information sfas no  imposes an additional requirement effective for fiscal years ending after december   to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers yearend balance sheet
