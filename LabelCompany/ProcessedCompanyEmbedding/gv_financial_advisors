the process took  weeks i interviewed at gv financial atlanta ga in september interviewi had a phone screen with the hr assistant he was pleasantthey then requested a facetoface interview which they ask for one to schedule a two hour slot in this interview i met again with the hr assistant answered questions and took a test he stated that i would still need to meet with the hiring manager but she had already left for the day he also stated i would have one more facetoface interview with multiple management members after both facetoface interviews they would then make a decision on whether or not to make a job offeralthough i wasnt particularly looking for employment opportunities i talked to a recruiter at a school event on a friday and was reached by the same recruiter on monday requesting a phone screen i was then called within a few days after the phone screen to schedule the facetoface interview i was not selected for the position but did wish to receive some feedback on what skills they found i could attain or improve i am a finance major and being that it is a financial company i was interested in knowing what i could improve on unfortunately they did not respond after i was sent notice of not being selected its not a big deal but after a lengthy interview process i hoped they couldve at least provided some sort of feedback along with the decisioninterview questions they asked basic questions over skill sets and level of expertise they also asked questions like what are three areas of your skill set that need improvement i found their questions were formed to find out more of ones weak points rather than discussing strong attributes and skills i   answer question gv financial   pdt see all  interviews gv financial awards  accolades add awards top
