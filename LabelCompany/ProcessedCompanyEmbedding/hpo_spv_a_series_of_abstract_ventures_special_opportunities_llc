name for financial certificates also commonly referred to as sharia compliant bonds sukuk are defined by the aaoifi accounting and auditing organization for islamic financial institutions as securities of equal denomination representing individual ownership interests in a portfolio of eligible existing or future assetsnote  the fiqh academy of the oic legitimized the use of sukuk in february  sukuk were developed as an alternative to conventional bonds which are not considered permissible by many muslims as they pay interest and may finance businesses involved in nonshariacompliant activities gambling alcohol pork etc sukuk securities are structured to comply with sharia by paying profit not interest  generally by involving a tangible asset in the investment for example sukuk securities may have partial ownership of a property built by the investment company and held in a special purpose vehicle so that sukuk holders can collect the propertys profit as rent which is allowed under islamic law because they represent ownership of real assets and at least in theory do not guarantee repayment of initial investment sukuk resemble equity instruments but like a bond and unlike equity regular payments cease upon their expiration however most sukuk are assetbased rather than assetbacked  their assets are not truly owned by their special purpose vehicle and their holders have recourse to the originator if there is a shortfall in payments different types of sukuk are based on different structures of islamic contracts murabaha ijara istisna musharaka istithmar etc depending on the project the sukuk is financing according to the state of the global islamic economy report  of the  trillion of assets being managed in a sharia compliant manner in

classical period of islam sakk sukuk meant any document representing a contract or conveyance of rights obligations or monies done in conformity with the shariahcitation needed the term was used to refer to forms of papers representing financial obligations originating from trade and other commercial activities in the islamic premodern period according to camille paldi the first sukuk transaction took place in damascus in its great mosque in the th century ad muslim traders are known to have used the cheque or ṣakk system since the time of harun alrashid th century of the abbasid caliphate  the modern western word “cheque” appears to have been derived from “sakk” singular of sukuk note  which during the middle ages referred to a written agreement to pay for goods when they were delivered and was used to avoid money having to be transported across dangerous terrain modern answering a need to provide short and medium term instruments so that balance sheets of islamic financial institutions could be more liquid the fiqh academy of the oic organization of islamic countries legitimized the use of sukuk in february  in  one of the first contemporary sukuk—worth rm

indoiii saudi electricity co soq sukuk a qsc about  of the sukuk market is domestic not international most sukuk are not investment grade however and as of  there were  sukuk issues in total including local currency denominated nonglobal market sukuk according to thomson reuters  dinar standard according to the malaysian international islamic financial centre as of  the biggest issuers of sukuk were governments  and the second largest were power and utility companies  secondary marketedit sukuk securities tend to be bought and held as a result few securities enter the secondary market to be traded furthermore only public sukuk are able to enter this market as they are listed on stock exchanges the secondary market—whilst developing—remains a niche segment with virtually all of the trading done at the institution level the size of the secondary market remains unknown though lmc bahrain states they traded  million of sukuk in  as of july  sukukcom listed fifteen sukuk on the secondary market for gulf sukuk principlesedit ali arsalan tariq states that islamic finance—including sukuk—is based on a set of several prohibitions transactions in unethical goods and services earning returns from a loan contract ribainterest compensationbased restructuring of debts excessive uncertainty in contracts gharar gambling and chancebased games qimar trading in debt contracts at discount and forward foreign exchange transactions as shari’ah considers money to be a measuring tool for value and not an asset in itself it requires that one should not receive income from money or anything that has the genus of money alone as this simplistically interest is riba and forbidden from a sharia perspective certificates of debt are not tradable except at their par value although a different view is held by many in malaysiacitation needed while a bond is a contractual debt obligation of the issuer to pay to bondholders on certain specified dates interest and principal a sukuk is a certificate giving sukuk holders an undivided beneficial ownership in the underlying assets consequently sukuk holders are entitled to share in the revenues generated by the sukuk assets as well as being entitled to share in the proceeds of the realization of the sukuk assets similarities with bondsedit sukuk and bonds are sold to investors who receive a stream of paymentsnote  until the date of the maturity of the sukuk or bond at which time they get their original investment in the case of sukuk a full payment is not guaranteed back sukuk and bonds are intended to provide investment with less risk than equities such as shares of stock and so are often used to balance a portfolio of investment instruments both sukuk and bonds must issue a disclosure document known as a prospectus to describe the security they are sellilng to give investors an idea of how much risk is involved in particular sukukbonds rating agencies rate the credit worthiness of the issuers of the sukukbond both sukuk and bonds are initially sold by their issuers after that they or some sukuk and bonds may be bought and sold by brokers and agents mostly on the overthecounter otc market but are also available on some stock exchanges around the world differences from bondsedit ownership sukuk should indicate partial ownership of an asset bonds indicate a debt obligation compliance the assets that back sukuk should be compliant with shariah bonds need only comply with laws of countrylocality they are issued in pricing the face value of a sukuk is priced according to the value of the assets backing them bond pricing is based on credit rating ie the issuers credit worthiness rewards and risks sukuk can increase in value when the assets increase in value returns from bonds correspond to fixed interest because most bonds interest rates are fixed most increase in value when the market interest rates fall sales when you sell sukuk you are selling ownership in the assets backing them in instances where the certificate represents a debt to the holder the certificate will not be tradable on the secondary market and instead should be held until maturity the sale of bonds is the sale of debt principal sukuk investors in theory share the risk of the underlying asset and may not get all their initial investment the face value of the sukuk back the value payable to the sukukholder on maturity should be the current market value of the assets or enterprise and not the principal originally invested according to taqi usamani bond investors are guaranteed the return of their initial investmentprincipal in practice some sukuk are issued with repurchase guarantees conventional bonds are issued with underwriters sukuk may underwriters do not usually conduct the issuance and may not be required sukuk use special purpose vehicles to be the trusteeissuer of the sukuk definitions structure and characteristicsedit definitions the aaoifi accounting and auditing organization for islamic financial institutions the body which issues standards on accounting auditing governance ethical and sharia standards defines sukuk as securities of equal denomination representing individual ownership interests in a portfolio of eligible existing or future assetsnote  or ‘certificates of equal value representing undivided shares in the ownership of tangible assets usufructs and services or in the ownership of the assets of particular projects or special investment activity’ the islamic financial services board defines sukuk as certificates with each sakk representing a proportional undivided ownership right in tangible assets or a pool of predominantly tangible assets or a business venture these assets may be in a specific project or investment activity in accordance with sharia rules and principles the securities commission of malaysia defined sukuk as a document or certificate which represents the value of an asset need sharia forbids both the trading of shortterm debt instruments except at face value and the drawing upon the established interbank money markets both being seen as transactions involve interest and excessive uncertainty gharar as a consequence prior to the development of the sukuk market the balance sheets of islamic financial institutions tended to be highly illiquid and lacking in short and medium term investment opportunities for their current assets structure and characteristics sukuk are structured in several different ways the aaoifi has laid down  different types of sukuk while a conventional bond is a promise to repay a loan sukuk constitute partial ownership in a debt asset project business or investment debt sukuk murabaha these sukuk are not common because their payments to investors represent debt and are therefore not tradable or negotiable according to sharia if diluted with other nonmurahaha sukuk in a mixed portfolio they may be traded asset sukuk al ijara these are essentially rental or lease contracts or conventional leaserevenue bonds with these sukuk the borrowers tangible asset is sold to the financier and then leased back to the borrowers the borrowers then make regular payments back to the financiers from the income stream generated by the asset they are the most common type of sukuk as of  and have been described by faleel jamaldeen as wellknown because of there simplicity tradability and ability to provide a fixed flow of income asset at a future date sukuk alsalam in this sukuk the spv does not buy an asset but agrees to buy one at a future date in exchange for advance payments the asset is then sold in the future for its cost plus a profit by an agent on or before the date agreed to in the contract the seller delivers the asset to the agent who sells the asset who passes the proceeds minus expensesfees on to the spv which distributes the proceeds to the sukuk holders sukuk alsalam are at least usually used to support a companys short term liquidity requirements holders receive payment not with a regular flow of income but at maturity—similar to a zerocoupon bond an example of this kind of sukuk are  day cbb sukuk alsalam issued by central bank of bahrain project sukuk al istisna these sukuk are complex and cannot be traded in the secondary market or sold to a third party for less than its face value business sukuk al musharaka these sukuk holders are also the owners of the originator issuing the sukuk and participate in the decisionmaking these sukuk can be traded in the secondary market or investment sukuk al istithmar the most commonly used sukuk structures replicate the cash flows of conventional bonds such structures are listed on exchanges commonly the luxembourg stock exchange and london stock exchange in europe and made tradable through conventional organisations like euroclear or clearstream a key technique to achieve capital protection without amounting to a loan is a binding promise to repurchase certain assets eg in the case of sukuk al ijara by the issuer in the meantime a rent is being paid which is often benchmarked to an interest rate libor is the most common though its use is criticized by some sharia scholars the most accepted structure which is tradable is thereafter the sukuk al ijara debt certificates can only be bought before the finance occurs and then held to maturity from an islamic perspective this is critical for debt trading at market value without incurring the prohibited riba interest on moneycitation needed issuing and payment processedit stepbystep process of issuing a sukuk based on an asset the originator—a business firm requiring capital—creates a special purpose vehicle spv an independent entity and structures the spv protects the sukuk assets from creditors if the originator has financial troubles it specifies what asset or activity the sukuk will support how large the issuance of sukuk will be their face amounts interest rates maturity date spv are often located in taxefficient jurisdictions such as bahrain luxembourg or the cayman islands the spv issues the sukuk offering it for sale to investors with an agreement spelling out the relationship between obligator and sukuk holders depending on the type of sukuk this can be lessor and lessee partner etc with the money from the sale of sukuk certificates the spv passes offering to the originator who makes the sharia compliant asset purchase lease joint venture etc again depending on the type of sukuk the spv purchases assets such as land building machinery from the originator the sale proceeds are paid to the originatordebtor as the price of the assets the spv acting as a trustee on behalf of the sukukholders arranges to lease the assets back to the originator who pays the sukukholders the lease income the originator buys back the asset from the spv at a nominal price on termination of the lease in this type of sukuk fixed interest of a conventional bond is replaced by fixed lease income islamic economist muhammad akram khan complains that sukuk are different from conventional finance in form and formalities rather than substance and may even be more expensive for the income provided than a conventional bond exampleedit structure of a  million sukuk issued by the tabreed financing corporation in march  an example of a sukuk was a  million security used to finance the construction and delivery of cooling plants in abu dhabi this sukuk had an istisnaa and ijara structure and was issued by the tabreed financing corporation or national central cooling company pjsc in march  tabreed created an spv incorporated in the cayman islands which sold certificates of sukuk bonds with the proceeds of this sale it bought some partially completed central cooling plants “assets” held in trust for the sukuk  the spv leased the trust assets to the tabreed  which made rental payments to the spv  which passed the payments on to sukuk holders  when the sukuk matured the trust assets are bought back from the spv and the sukuk holders got their principal back if some dissolution event eg destruction of the leased property had interrupted the payment of rent this would have prompted “the continuation of payments in the form of repurchase price” this reduced the risk structure of the sukuk to that or near that of conventional bonds which permits the sukuk to earn the same or close to the same credit ratings that conventional bonds earn consequently they are able to be sold at an interest rater lower than they might otherwise although their transactions costs are higher than conventional bonds because of the creation of spvs as well as payment of various jurist and legal fees for structuring the bond issuance challenges criticism and controversyedit challengesedit according to a  imf report the supply of sukuk falls short of demand and with some exceptions issuance takes place without a comprehensive strategy to develop the domestic market sukuk are seen as wellsuited for infrastructure financing because of their risksharing property could also help fill financing gaps national authorities should therefore focus on developing the necessary infrastructure including promoting true securitization and enhanced clarity over investors’ rights and on stepping up regular sovereign issuance to provide a benchmark for the private sector increased sovereign issuance should be underpinned by sound public financial management key challenges to the islamic finance industry as a whole—including sukuk—as of  include according to the state of the global islamic economy report  and the imf are low levels of awareness and understanding of islamic finance products and services among the public leading them to not buy a scarcity of shariahcompliant monetary policy instruments and a lack of understanding of the monetary transmission mechanism complex financial products and corporate structures in some countriesjurisdictions because regulatory and supervisory frameworks do not address the unique risks of the industry consequently what is needed is increased regulatory clarity and harmonization better cooperation between islamic and conventional financial standardsetters and further improvement of supervisory tools underdeveloped safety nets and resolution frameworks in many places these include complete islamic deposit insurance systems where premiums are invested in shariahcompliant assets or shariahcompliant lendersoflastresort regulators who do not always have the capacity or willingness to ensure shariah compliance defaults in three years during and following the financial crisis of – —    — there were at least  substantial sukuk defaults and several large near defaults such as that of dubai world saved by a  billion loan from abu dhabi as of  there were a number of cases where the sukuk had defaulted or were in serious trouble in may  investment dar of kuwait defaulted on  million sukuk saad group set up a committee to restructure  million golden belt  sukuk standard  poors cut the rating of that sukuk owing to the nonavailability of vital information protection from originators default at least one of the three major bond rating agencies for the us has indicated doubts about the validity of transfer of assets from the originator in sukuk in the event of an insolvency of the originator and attempts by creditors to seize the assets fitch has not reviewed any transaction to date that would satisfy these requirements underscoring fitchs concern was the bankruptcy of east cameron partners ecp which issued a multipleawardwinning sukuk in  but filed for bankruptcy in october  prompting a legal dispute about the creditors right to  million in sukuk assets the final decision of the case did not clearly resolve this issue another major rating agency sp downgraded the sukuk of dubai islamic bank and sharjah islamic bank according to ibrahim warde as of  what is till unclear is what happens to sukuk when they fail  an issue that has not been tested in court in malaysia some sukuk issues have junk status and two other sukuk are already in default the easter cameron gas company in the united states and investment dar of kuwait one of the unresolved questions is whether sukuk holders should stand in the line of creditors or in the line of the owners of underlying assets in reviewing cases of sukuk defaults and bankruptcies muddassir siddiqui complained that through reading many cases that have so far been litigated in courts around the world i have found that in almost all cases the courts have struggled to reconcile the substance and form of the contract was it a sale lease construction or partnership contract or a financing arrangement between the parties according to rodney wilson when sukuk payments are delayed or fail the means of redress are potentially more complex than for conventional notes and bonds in particular under shari’ah leniency towards debtors is favoured which inevitably raises moral hazard problems criticism and controversyedit sukuk have been criticized as evading the restrictions on riba and imitating conventional bonds in february  the aaoifis board of scholars led by the granddaddy of modernday islamic finance sheik muhammad taqi usmani stated that as many as  percent of sukuk sold to date may not comply with all the precepts of shariah in a paper entitled sukuk and their contemporary applications released in november  usmani identified the following three key structuring elements that differentiate sukuk from conventional bonds sukuk must represent ownership shares in assets or commercial or industrial enterprises that bring profits or revenues payments to sukukholders should be the share of profits after costs of the assets or enterprise the value payable to the sukukholder on maturity should be the current market value of the assets or enterprise and not the principal originally invested usmani stated that by complex mechanisms sukuk had taken on the same characteristics as conventional interestbearing bonds as they do not return to investors more than a fixed percentage of the principal based on interest rates while guaranteeing the return of investors principal at maturity usmanis estimate that  of all sukuk in issuance were not shariahcompliant was based on the existence of guaranteed returns andor repurchase obligations from the issuer  a violation of shariah following usmanis criticisms the global sukuk market shrunk from us billion in  to approximately  billion in  although how much of this was due to his criticisms or the global financial crisis is a matter of debate the financial times has described this as an ongoing debate over form versus substance in islamic finance identifying two kinds of sukuk  assetbacked sukuk and the more numerous less strict allegedly noncompliant asset based sukuk in assetbacked sukuk there is a true sale between the originator and the special purpose vehicle spv that issues the sukuk and sukuk holders do not have recourse to the originator asset prices may vary over time in contrast assetbased sukuk do give their holders recourse to the originator and so more closely resemble conventional bonds  other critics include nonorthodox economist mahmoud elgamal who has complained that while providers of sukuk and other islamic finance instruments will often describe their distinguishing feature as the prohibition of interest they will then proceed to report the interest rate that islamic instruments pay for instance reuters’ august   coverage of bahrain’s  million sukuk  followed their characterization of islamic financial products as “interestfree” with a report that those sukuk will pay “ percent annual profit” he also complains that despite claims that sukuk—unlike conventional bonds—share the risk of their underlying asset and may increase or decrease in value in sukuk such as the tabreed sukuk mentioned above steady payment of rent is written into the sukuk contract giving them a risk structure essentially the same as conventional bonds another observer salman ali found that many of the sukuk structures do not conform to the shariah according to ali while most of the sukuk make an effort to remain within shariah bounds they replicate conventional debt instruments they often combine more than one contract which individually may be shariahcompliant but when combined may defeat the objective of the shariah furthermore the sukuk rate of return is often tied to the libor london interbank offered rate or euribor euro interbank offered rate interest rate rather than to the underlying business that the sukuk is financing this makes the sukuk so similar to conventional debt instruments that it is difficult to tell one from the other ali believes this may be why rating agencies such as standard  poors and moodys apply the same methodology for rating sukuk as for conventional debt instruments in  safari conducted various statistical and econometrics tests to check the argument that sukuk securities are merely the same as conventional bond however his results on the comparison of yield to maturity of sukuk and that of conventional bonds show that sukuk securities are different from conventional bonds in response to this argument it was pointed out that yield to maturity reflects the interplay of supply and demand which may be affected by a financial products packaging and target market rather than just the substance of the product alone in  goldman sacks abandoned a  billion sukuk programme

certificates also commonly referred to as sharia compliant bonds sukuk are defined by the aaoifi accounting and auditing organization for islamic financial institutions as securities of equal denomination representing individual ownership interests in a portfolio of eligible existing or future assetsnote  the fiqh academy of the oic legitimized the use of sukuk in february  sukuk were developed as an alternative to conventional bonds which are not considered permissible by many muslims as they pay interest and may finance businesses involved in nonshariacompliant activities gambling alcohol pork etc sukuk securities are structured to comply with sharia by paying profit not interest  generally by involving a tangible asset in the investment for example sukuk securities may have partial ownership of a property built by the investment company and held in a special purpose vehicle so that sukuk holders can collect the propertys profit as rent which is allowed under islamic law because they represent ownership of real assets and at least in theory do not guarantee repayment of initial investment sukuk resemble equity instruments but like a bond and unlike equity regular payments cease upon their expiration however most sukuk are assetbased rather than assetbacked  their assets are not truly owned by their special purpose vehicle and their holders have recourse to the originator if there is a shortfall in payments different types of sukuk are based on different structures of islamic contracts murabaha ijara istisna musharaka istithmar etc depending on the project the sukuk is financing according to the state of the global islamic economy report  of the  trillion of assets being managed in a sharia compliant manner in   billion were sukuk being

singapore  somalia  turkey  united arab emirates  united kingdom  hong kong  see also  references  notes  citations  books documents journal articles historyedit in the classical period of islam sakk sukuk meant any document representing a contract or conveyance of rights obligations or monies done in conformity with the shariahcitation needed the term was used to refer to forms of papers representing financial obligations originating from trade and other commercial activities in the islamic premodern period according to camille paldi the first sukuk transaction took place in damascus in its great mosque in the th century ad muslim traders are known to have used the cheque or ṣakk system since the time of harun alrashid th century of the abbasid caliphate  the modern western word “cheque” appears to have been derived from “sakk” singular of sukuk note  which during the middle ages referred to a written agreement to pay for goods when they were delivered and was used to avoid money having to be transported across dangerous terrain modern answering a need to provide short and medium term instruments so that balance sheets of islamic financial institutions could be more liquid the fiqh academy of the oic organization of islamic countries legitimized the use of sukuk in february  in  one of the first contemporary sukuk—worth rm million—were issued by malaysia shell mds sdn bhd on the basis of bai bithaman ajil there were no other sukuk issued until  when the market began to take off in  the government of sudan issued domestic sovereign shortterm sukuk worth  million sudanese pounds on the basis of musharaka in  the sukuk market went international with the issuance of the first usdollardenominated ijara sukuk worth  million by the central bank of bahrain since then many sovereign and corporate sukuk issues have been offered in various jurisdictions to standardize the growing market the aaoif issued shari’ah standard no on ‘investment sukuk’ in may  it

islamic financial market report p  forbes as of early  there were us billion worth of sukuk outstanding worldwide as of the end of  there were about  us dollardenominated islamic fixed income securities issued in the global markets that were investmentgrade and had a duration of at least one year these securities—which make up the citi sukuk index—had an average maturity of  years and most were issued by governments the top four issuers by market weight—making up over  of the market—were islamic development bank perusahaan penerbit sbsn indoiii saudi electricity co soq sukuk a qsc about  of the sukuk market is domestic not international most sukuk are not investment grade however and as of  there were  sukuk issues in total including local currency denominated nonglobal market sukuk according to thomson reuters  dinar standard according to the malaysian international islamic financial centre as of  the biggest issuers of sukuk were governments  and the second largest were power and utility companies  secondary marketedit sukuk securities tend to be bought and held as a result few securities enter the secondary market to be traded furthermore only public sukuk are able to enter this market as they are listed on stock exchanges the secondary market—whilst developing—remains a niche segment with virtually all of the trading done at the institution level the size of the secondary market remains unknown though lmc bahrain states they traded  million of sukuk in  as of july  sukukcom listed fifteen sukuk on the secondary market for gulf sukuk principlesedit ali arsalan tariq states that islamic finance—including sukuk—is based on a set of several prohibitions transactions in unethical goods and services earning returns from a loan contract ribainterest compensationbased restructuring of debts excessive uncertainty in contracts gharar gambling and chancebased games qimar trading in debt contracts at discount and forward foreign exchange transactions as shari’ah considers money to be a measuring tool for value and not an asset in itself it requires that one should not receive income from money or anything that has the genus of money alone as this simplistically interest is riba and forbidden from a sharia perspective certificates of debt are not tradable except at their par value although a different view is held by many in malaysiacitation needed while a bond is a contractual debt obligation of the issuer to pay to bondholders on certain specified dates interest and principal a sukuk is a certificate giving sukuk holders an undivided beneficial ownership in the underlying assets consequently sukuk holders are entitled to share in the revenues generated by the sukuk assets as well as being entitled to share in the proceeds of the realization of the sukuk assets similarities with bondsedit sukuk and bonds are sold to investors who receive a stream of paymentsnote  until the date of the maturity of the sukuk or bond at which time they get their original investment in the case of sukuk a full payment is not guaranteed back sukuk and bonds are intended to provide investment with less risk than equities such as shares of stock and so are often used to balance a portfolio of investment instruments both sukuk and bonds must issue a disclosure document known as a prospectus to describe the security they are sellilng to give investors an idea of how much risk is involved in particular sukukbonds rating agencies rate the credit worthiness of the issuers of the sukukbond both sukuk and bonds are initially sold by their issuers after that they or some sukuk and bonds may be bought and sold by brokers and agents mostly on the overthecounter otc market but are also available on some stock exchanges around the world differences from bondsedit ownership sukuk should indicate partial ownership of an asset bonds indicate a debt obligation compliance the assets that back sukuk should be compliant with shariah bonds need only comply with laws of countrylocality they are issued in pricing the face value of a sukuk is priced according to the value of the assets backing them bond pricing is based on credit rating ie the issuers credit worthiness rewards and risks sukuk can increase in value when the assets increase in value returns from bonds correspond to fixed interest because most bonds interest rates are fixed most increase in value when the market interest rates fall sales when you sell sukuk you are selling ownership in the assets backing them in instances where the certificate represents a debt to the holder the certificate will not be tradable on the secondary market and instead should be held until maturity the sale of bonds is the sale of debt principal sukuk investors in theory share the risk of the underlying asset and may not get all their initial investment the face value of the sukuk back the value payable to the sukukholder on maturity should be the current market value of the assets or enterprise and not the principal originally invested according to taqi usamani bond investors are guaranteed the return of their initial investmentprincipal in practice some sukuk are issued with repurchase guarantees conventional bonds are issued with underwriters sukuk may underwriters do not usually conduct the issuance and may not be required sukuk use special purpose vehicles to be the trusteeissuer of the sukuk definitions structure and characteristicsedit definitions the aaoifi accounting and auditing organization for islamic financial institutions the body which issues standards on accounting auditing governance ethical and sharia standards defines sukuk as securities of equal denomination representing individual ownership interests in a portfolio of eligible existing or future assetsnote  or ‘certificates of equal value representing undivided shares in the ownership of tangible assets usufructs and services or in the ownership of the assets of particular projects or special investment activity’ the islamic financial services board defines sukuk as certificates with each sakk representing a proportional undivided ownership right in tangible assets or a pool of predominantly tangible assets or a business venture these assets may be in a specific project or investment activity in accordance with sharia rules and principles the securities commission of malaysia defined sukuk as a document or certificate which represents the value of an asset need sharia forbids both the trading of shortterm debt instruments except at face value and the drawing upon the established interbank money markets both being seen as transactions involve interest and excessive uncertainty gharar as a consequence prior to the development of the sukuk market the balance sheets of islamic financial institutions tended to be highly illiquid and lacking in short and medium term investment opportunities for their current assets structure and characteristics sukuk are structured in several different ways the aaoifi has laid down  different types of sukuk while a conventional bond is a promise to repay a loan sukuk constitute partial ownership in a debt asset project business or investment debt sukuk murabaha these sukuk are not common because their payments to investors represent debt and are therefore not tradable or negotiable according to sharia if diluted with other nonmurahaha sukuk in a mixed portfolio they may be traded asset sukuk al ijara these are essentially rental or lease contracts or conventional leaserevenue bonds with these sukuk the borrowers tangible asset is sold to the financier and then leased back to the borrowers the borrowers then make regular payments back to the financiers from the income stream generated by the asset they are the most common type of sukuk as of  and have been described by faleel jamaldeen as wellknown because of there simplicity tradability and ability to provide a fixed flow of income asset at a future date sukuk alsalam in this sukuk the spv does not buy an asset but agrees to buy one at a future date in exchange for advance payments the asset is then sold in the future for its cost plus a profit by an agent on or before the date agreed to in the contract the seller delivers the asset to the agent who sells the asset who passes the proceeds minus expensesfees on to the spv which distributes the proceeds to the sukuk holders sukuk alsalam are at least usually used to support a companys short term liquidity requirements holders receive payment not with a regular flow of income but at maturity—similar to a zerocoupon bond an example of this kind of sukuk are  day cbb sukuk alsalam issued by central bank of bahrain project sukuk al istisna these sukuk are complex and cannot be traded in the secondary market or sold to a third party for less than its face value business sukuk al musharaka these sukuk holders are also the owners of the originator issuing the sukuk and participate in the decisionmaking these sukuk can be traded in the secondary market or investment sukuk al istithmar the most commonly used sukuk structures replicate the cash flows of conventional bonds such structures are listed on exchanges commonly the luxembourg stock exchange and london stock exchange in europe and made tradable through conventional organisations like euroclear or clearstream a key technique to achieve capital protection without amounting to a loan is a binding promise to repurchase certain assets eg in the case of sukuk al ijara by the issuer in the meantime a rent is being paid which is often benchmarked to an interest rate libor is the most common though its use is criticized by some sharia scholars the most accepted structure which is tradable is thereafter the sukuk al ijara debt certificates can only be bought before the finance occurs and then held to maturity from an islamic perspective this is critical for debt trading at market value without incurring the prohibited riba interest on moneycitation needed issuing and payment processedit stepbystep process of issuing a sukuk based on an asset the originator—a business firm requiring capital—creates a special purpose vehicle spv an independent entity and structures the spv protects the sukuk assets from creditors if the originator has financial troubles it specifies what asset or activity the sukuk will support how large the issuance of sukuk will be their face amounts interest rates maturity date spv are often located in taxefficient jurisdictions such as bahrain luxembourg or the cayman islands the spv issues the sukuk offering it for sale to investors with an agreement spelling out the relationship between obligator and sukuk holders depending on the type of sukuk this can be lessor and lessee partner etc with the money from the sale of sukuk certificates the spv passes offering to the originator who makes the sharia compliant asset purchase lease joint venture etc again depending on the type of sukuk the spv purchases assets such as land building machinery from the originator the sale proceeds are paid to the originatordebtor as the price of the assets the spv acting as a trustee on behalf of the sukukholders arranges to lease the assets back to the originator who pays the sukukholders the lease income the originator buys back the asset from the spv at a nominal price on termination of the lease in this type of sukuk fixed interest of a conventional bond is replaced by fixed lease income islamic economist muhammad akram khan complains that sukuk are different from conventional finance in form and formalities rather than substance and may even be more expensive for the income provided than a conventional bond exampleedit structure of a  million sukuk issued by the tabreed financing corporation in march  an example of a sukuk was a  million security used to finance the construction and delivery of cooling plants in abu dhabi this sukuk had an istisnaa and ijara structure and was issued by the tabreed financing corporation or national central cooling company pjsc in march  tabreed created an spv incorporated in the cayman islands which sold certificates of sukuk bonds with the proceeds of this sale it bought some partially completed central cooling plants “assets” held in trust for the sukuk  the spv leased the trust assets to the tabreed  which made rental payments to the spv  which passed the payments on to sukuk holders  when the sukuk matured the trust assets are bought back from the spv and the sukuk holders got their principal back if some dissolution event eg destruction of the leased property had interrupted the payment of rent this would have prompted “the continuation of payments in the form of repurchase price” this reduced the risk structure of the sukuk to that or near that of conventional bonds which permits the sukuk to earn the same or close to the same credit ratings that conventional bonds earn consequently they are able to be sold at an interest rater lower than they might otherwise although their transactions costs are higher than conventional bonds because of the creation of spvs as well as payment of various jurist and legal fees for structuring the bond issuance challenges criticism and controversyedit challengesedit according to a  imf report the supply of sukuk falls short of demand and with some exceptions issuance takes place without a comprehensive strategy to develop the domestic market sukuk are seen as wellsuited for infrastructure financing because of their risksharing property could also help fill financing gaps national authorities should therefore focus on developing the necessary infrastructure including promoting true securitization and enhanced clarity over investors’ rights and on stepping up regular sovereign issuance to provide a benchmark for the private sector increased sovereign issuance should be underpinned by sound public financial management key challenges to the islamic finance industry as a whole—including sukuk—as of  include according to the state of the global islamic economy report  and the imf are low levels of awareness and understanding of islamic finance products and services among the public leading them to not buy a scarcity of shariahcompliant monetary policy instruments and a lack of understanding of the monetary transmission mechanism complex financial products and corporate structures in some countriesjurisdictions because regulatory and supervisory frameworks do not address the unique risks of the industry consequently what is needed is increased regulatory clarity and harmonization better cooperation between islamic and conventional financial standardsetters and further improvement of supervisory tools underdeveloped safety nets and resolution frameworks in many places these include complete islamic deposit insurance systems where premiums are invested in shariahcompliant assets or shariahcompliant lendersoflastresort regulators who do not always have the capacity or willingness to ensure shariah compliance defaults in three years during and following the financial crisis of – —    — there were at least  substantial sukuk defaults and several large near defaults such as that of dubai world saved by a  billion loan from abu dhabi as of  there were a number of cases where the sukuk had defaulted or were in serious trouble in may  investment dar of kuwait defaulted on  million sukuk saad group set up a committee to restructure  million golden belt  sukuk standard  poors cut the rating of that sukuk owing to the nonavailability of vital information protection from originators default at least one of the three major bond rating agencies for the us has indicated doubts about the validity of transfer of assets from the originator in sukuk in the event of an insolvency of the originator and attempts by creditors to seize the assets fitch has not reviewed any transaction to date that would satisfy these requirements underscoring fitchs concern was the bankruptcy of east cameron partners ecp which issued a multipleawardwinning sukuk in  but filed for bankruptcy in october  prompting a legal dispute about the creditors right to  million in sukuk assets the final decision of the case did not clearly resolve this issue another major rating agency sp downgraded the sukuk of dubai islamic bank and sharjah islamic bank according to ibrahim warde as of  what is till unclear is what happens to sukuk when they fail  an issue that has not been tested in court in malaysia some sukuk issues have junk status and two other sukuk are already in default the easter cameron gas company in the united states and investment dar of kuwait one of the unresolved questions is whether sukuk holders should stand in the line of creditors or in the line of the owners of underlying assets in reviewing cases of sukuk defaults and bankruptcies muddassir siddiqui complained that through reading many cases that have so far been litigated in courts around the world i have found that in almost all cases the courts have struggled to reconcile the substance and form of the contract was it a sale lease construction or partnership contract or a financing arrangement between the parties according to rodney wilson when sukuk payments are delayed or fail the means of redress are potentially more complex than for conventional notes and bonds in particular under shari’ah leniency towards debtors is favoured which inevitably raises moral hazard problems criticism and controversyedit sukuk have been criticized as evading the restrictions on riba and imitating conventional bonds in february  the aaoifis board of scholars led by the granddaddy of modernday islamic finance sheik muhammad taqi usmani stated that as many as  percent of sukuk sold to date may not comply with all the precepts of shariah in a paper entitled sukuk and their contemporary applications released in november  usmani identified the following three key structuring elements that differentiate sukuk from conventional bonds sukuk must represent ownership shares in assets or commercial or industrial enterprises that bring profits or revenues payments to sukukholders should be the share of profits after costs of the assets or enterprise the value payable to the sukukholder on maturity should be the current market value of the assets or enterprise and not the principal originally invested usmani stated that by complex mechanisms sukuk had taken on the same characteristics as conventional interestbearing bonds as they do not return to investors more than a fixed percentage of the principal based on interest rates while guaranteeing the return of investors principal at maturity usmanis estimate that  of all sukuk in issuance were not shariahcompliant was based on the existence of guaranteed returns andor repurchase obligations from the issuer  a violation of shariah following usmanis criticisms the global sukuk market shrunk from us billion in  to approximately  billion in  although how much of this was due to his criticisms or the global financial crisis is a matter of debate the financial times has described this as an ongoing debate over form versus substance in islamic finance identifying two kinds of sukuk  assetbacked sukuk and the more numerous less strict allegedly noncompliant asset based sukuk in assetbacked sukuk there is a true sale between the originator and the special purpose vehicle spv that issues the sukuk and sukuk holders do not have recourse to the originator asset prices may vary over time in contrast assetbased sukuk do give their holders recourse to the originator and so more closely resemble conventional bonds  other critics include nonorthodox economist mahmoud elgamal who has complained that while providers of sukuk and other islamic finance instruments will often describe their distinguishing feature as the prohibition of interest they will then proceed to report the interest rate that islamic instruments pay for instance reuters’ august   coverage of bahrain’s  million sukuk  followed their characterization of islamic financial products as “interestfree” with a report that those sukuk will pay “ percent annual profit” he also complains that despite claims that sukuk—unlike conventional bonds—share the risk of their underlying asset and may increase or decrease in value in sukuk such as the tabreed sukuk mentioned above steady payment of rent is written into the sukuk contract giving them a risk structure essentially the same as conventional bonds another observer salman ali found that many of the sukuk structures do not conform to the shariah according to ali while most of the sukuk make an effort to remain within shariah bounds they replicate conventional debt instruments they often combine more than one contract which individually may be shariahcompliant but when combined may defeat the objective of the shariah furthermore the sukuk rate of return is often tied to the libor london interbank offered rate or euribor euro interbank offered rate interest rate rather than to the underlying business that the sukuk is financing this makes the sukuk so similar to conventional debt instruments that it is difficult to tell one from the other ali believes this may be why rating agencies such as standard  poors and moodys apply the same methodology for rating sukuk as for conventional debt instruments in  safari conducted various statistical and econometrics tests to check the argument that sukuk securities are merely the same as conventional bond however his results on the comparison of yield to maturity of sukuk and that of conventional bonds show that sukuk securities are different from conventional bonds in response to this argument it was pointed out that yield to maturity reflects the interplay of supply and demand which may be affected by a financial products packaging and target market rather than just the substance of the product alone in  goldman sacks abandoned a  billion sukuk programme in had registered

certificates also commonly referred to as sharia compliant bonds sukuk are defined by the aaoifi accounting and auditing organization for islamic financial institutions as securities of equal denomination representing individual ownership interests in a portfolio of eligible existing or future assetsnote  the fiqh academy of the oic legitimized the use of sukuk in february  sukuk were developed as an alternative to conventional bonds which are not considered permissible by many muslims as they pay interest and may finance businesses involved in nonshariacompliant activities gambling alcohol pork etc sukuk securities are structured to comply with sharia by paying profit not interest  generally by involving a tangible asset in the investment for example sukuk securities may have partial ownership of a property built by the investment company and held in a special purpose vehicle so that sukuk holders can collect the propertys profit as rent which is allowed under islamic law because they represent ownership of real assets and at least in theory do not guarantee repayment of initial investment sukuk resemble equity instruments but like a bond and unlike equity regular payments cease upon their expiration however most sukuk are assetbased rather than assetbacked  their assets are not truly owned by their special purpose vehicle and their holders have recourse to the originator if there is a shortfall in payments different types of sukuk are based on different structures of islamic contracts murabaha ijara istisna musharaka istithmar etc depending on the project the sukuk is financing according to the state of the global islamic economy report  of the  trillion of assets being managed in a sharia compliant manner in   billion were sukuk being

singapore  somalia  turkey  united arab emirates  united kingdom  hong kong  see also  references  notes  citations  books documents journal articles historyedit in the classical period of islam sakk sukuk meant any document representing a contract or conveyance of rights obligations or monies done in conformity with the shariahcitation needed the term was used to refer to forms of papers representing financial obligations originating from trade and other commercial activities in the islamic premodern period according to camille paldi the first sukuk transaction took place in damascus in its great mosque in the th century ad muslim traders are known to have used the cheque or ṣakk system since the time of harun alrashid th century of the abbasid caliphate  the modern western word “cheque” appears to have been derived from “sakk” singular of sukuk note  which during the middle ages referred to a written agreement to pay for goods when they were delivered and was used to avoid money having to be transported across dangerous terrain modern answering a need to provide short and medium term instruments so that balance sheets of islamic financial institutions could be more liquid the fiqh academy of the oic organization of islamic countries legitimized the use of sukuk in february  in  one of the first contemporary sukuk—worth rm million—were issued by malaysia shell mds sdn bhd on the basis of bai bithaman ajil there were no other sukuk issued until  when the market began to take off in  the government of sudan issued domestic sovereign shortterm sukuk worth  million sudanese pounds on the basis of musharaka in  the sukuk market went international with the issuance of the first usdollardenominated ijara sukuk worth  million by the central bank of bahrain since then many sovereign and corporate sukuk issues have been offered in various jurisdictions to standardize the growing market the aaoif issued shari’ah standard no on ‘investment sukuk’ in may  it

islamic financial market report p  forbes as of early  there were us billion worth of sukuk outstanding worldwide as of the end of  there were about  us dollardenominated islamic fixed income securities issued in the global markets that were investmentgrade and had a duration of at least one year these securities—which make up the citi sukuk index—had an average maturity of  years and most were issued by governments the top four issuers by market weight—making up over  of the market—were islamic development bank perusahaan penerbit sbsn indoiii saudi electricity co soq sukuk a qsc about  of the sukuk market is domestic not international most sukuk are not investment grade however and as of  there were  sukuk issues in total including local currency denominated nonglobal market sukuk according to thomson reuters  dinar standard according to the malaysian international islamic financial centre as of  the biggest issuers of sukuk were governments  and the second largest were power and utility companies  secondary marketedit sukuk securities tend to be bought and held as a result few securities enter the secondary market to be traded furthermore only public sukuk are able to enter this market as they are listed on stock exchanges the secondary market—whilst developing—remains a niche segment with virtually all of the trading done at the institution level the size of the secondary market remains unknown though lmc bahrain states they traded  million of sukuk in  as of july  sukukcom listed fifteen sukuk on the secondary market for gulf sukuk principlesedit ali arsalan tariq states that islamic finance—including sukuk—is based on a set of several prohibitions transactions in unethical goods and services earning returns from a loan contract ribainterest compensationbased restructuring of debts excessive uncertainty in contracts gharar gambling and chancebased games qimar trading in debt contracts at discount and forward foreign exchange transactions as shari’ah considers money to be a measuring tool for value and not an asset in itself it requires that one should not receive income from money or anything that has the genus of money alone as this simplistically interest is riba and forbidden from a sharia perspective certificates of debt are not tradable except at their par value although a different view is held by many in malaysiacitation needed while a bond is a contractual debt obligation of the issuer to pay to bondholders on certain specified dates interest and principal a sukuk is a certificate giving sukuk holders an undivided beneficial ownership in the underlying assets consequently sukuk holders are entitled to share in the revenues generated by the sukuk assets as well as being entitled to share in the proceeds of the realization of the sukuk assets similarities with bondsedit sukuk and bonds are sold to investors who receive a stream of paymentsnote  until the date of the maturity of the sukuk or bond at which time they get their original investment in the case of sukuk a full payment is not guaranteed back sukuk and bonds are intended to provide investment with less risk than equities such as shares of stock and so are often used to balance a portfolio of investment instruments both sukuk and bonds must issue a disclosure document known as a prospectus to describe the security they are sellilng to give investors an idea of how much risk is involved in particular sukukbonds rating agencies rate the credit worthiness of the issuers of the sukukbond both sukuk and bonds are initially sold by their issuers after that they or some sukuk and bonds may be bought and sold by brokers and agents mostly on the overthecounter otc market but are also available on some stock exchanges around the world differences from bondsedit ownership sukuk should indicate partial ownership of an asset bonds indicate a debt obligation compliance the assets that back sukuk should be compliant with shariah bonds need only comply with laws of countrylocality they are issued in pricing the face value of a sukuk is priced according to the value of the assets backing them bond pricing is based on credit rating ie the issuers credit worthiness rewards and risks sukuk can increase in value when the assets increase in value returns from bonds correspond to fixed interest because most bonds interest rates are fixed most increase in value when the market interest rates fall sales when you sell sukuk you are selling ownership in the assets backing them in instances where the certificate represents a debt to the holder the certificate will not be tradable on the secondary market and instead should be held until maturity the sale of bonds is the sale of debt principal sukuk investors in theory share the risk of the underlying asset and may not get all their initial investment the face value of the sukuk back the value payable to the sukukholder on maturity should be the current market value of the assets or enterprise and not the principal originally invested according to taqi usamani bond investors are guaranteed the return of their initial investmentprincipal in practice some sukuk are issued with repurchase guarantees conventional bonds are issued with underwriters sukuk may underwriters do not usually conduct the issuance and may not be required sukuk use special purpose vehicles to be the trusteeissuer of the sukuk definitions structure and characteristicsedit definitions the aaoifi accounting and auditing organization for islamic financial institutions the body which issues standards on accounting auditing governance ethical and sharia standards defines sukuk as securities of equal denomination representing individual ownership interests in a portfolio of eligible existing or future assetsnote  or ‘certificates of equal value representing undivided shares in the ownership of tangible assets usufructs and services or in the ownership of the assets of particular projects or special investment activity’ the islamic financial services board defines sukuk as certificates with each sakk representing a proportional undivided ownership right in tangible assets or a pool of predominantly tangible assets or a business venture these assets may be in a specific project or investment activity in accordance with sharia rules and principles the securities commission of malaysia defined sukuk as a document or certificate which represents the value of an asset need sharia forbids both the trading of shortterm debt instruments except at face value and the drawing upon the established interbank money markets both being seen as transactions involve interest and excessive uncertainty gharar as a consequence prior to the development of the sukuk market the balance sheets of islamic financial institutions tended to be highly illiquid and lacking in short and medium term investment opportunities for their current assets structure and characteristics sukuk are structured in several different ways the aaoifi has laid down  different types of sukuk while a conventional bond is a promise to repay a loan sukuk constitute partial ownership in a debt asset project business or investment debt sukuk murabaha these sukuk are not common because their payments to investors represent debt and are therefore not tradable or negotiable according to sharia if diluted with other nonmurahaha sukuk in a mixed portfolio they may be traded asset sukuk al ijara these are essentially rental or lease contracts or conventional leaserevenue bonds with these sukuk the borrowers tangible asset is sold to the financier and then leased back to the borrowers the borrowers then make regular payments back to the financiers from the income stream generated by the asset they are the most common type of sukuk as of  and have been described by faleel jamaldeen as wellknown because of there simplicity tradability and ability to provide a fixed flow of income asset at a future date sukuk alsalam in this sukuk the spv does not buy an asset but agrees to buy one at a future date in exchange for advance payments the asset is then sold in the future for its cost plus a profit by an agent on or before the date agreed to in the contract the seller delivers the asset to the agent who sells the asset who passes the proceeds minus expensesfees on to the spv which distributes the proceeds to the sukuk holders sukuk alsalam are at least usually used to support a companys short term liquidity requirements holders receive payment not with a regular flow of income but at maturity—similar to a zerocoupon bond an example of this kind of sukuk are  day cbb sukuk alsalam issued by central bank of bahrain project sukuk al istisna these sukuk are complex and cannot be traded in the secondary market or sold to a third party for less than its face value business sukuk al musharaka these sukuk holders are also the owners of the originator issuing the sukuk and participate in the decisionmaking these sukuk can be traded in the secondary market or investment sukuk al istithmar the most commonly used sukuk structures replicate the cash flows of conventional bonds such structures are listed on exchanges commonly the luxembourg stock exchange and london stock exchange in europe and made tradable through conventional organisations like euroclear or clearstream a key technique to achieve capital protection without amounting to a loan is a binding promise to repurchase certain assets eg in the case of sukuk al ijara by the issuer in the meantime a rent is being paid which is often benchmarked to an interest rate libor is the most common though its use is criticized by some sharia scholars the most accepted structure which is tradable is thereafter the sukuk al ijara debt certificates can only be bought before the finance occurs and then held to maturity from an islamic perspective this is critical for debt trading at market value without incurring the prohibited riba interest on moneycitation needed issuing and payment processedit stepbystep process of issuing a sukuk based on an asset the originator—a business firm requiring capital—creates a special purpose vehicle spv an independent entity and structures the spv protects the sukuk assets from creditors if the originator has financial troubles it specifies what asset or activity the sukuk will support how large the issuance of sukuk will be their face amounts interest rates maturity date spv are often located in taxefficient jurisdictions such as bahrain luxembourg or the cayman islands the spv issues the sukuk offering it for sale to investors with an agreement spelling out the relationship between obligator and sukuk holders depending on the type of sukuk this can be lessor and lessee partner etc with the money from the sale of sukuk certificates the spv passes offering to the originator who makes the sharia compliant asset purchase lease joint venture etc again depending on the type of sukuk the spv purchases assets such as land building machinery from the originator the sale proceeds are paid to the originatordebtor as the price of the assets the spv acting as a trustee on behalf of the sukukholders arranges to lease the assets back to the originator who pays the sukukholders the lease income the originator buys back the asset from the spv at a nominal price on termination of the lease in this type of sukuk fixed interest of a conventional bond is replaced by fixed lease income islamic economist muhammad akram khan complains that sukuk are different from conventional finance in form and formalities rather than substance and may even be more expensive for the income provided than a conventional bond exampleedit structure of a  million sukuk issued by the tabreed financing corporation in march  an example of a sukuk was a  million security used to finance the construction and delivery of cooling plants in abu dhabi this sukuk had an istisnaa and ijara structure and was issued by the tabreed financing corporation or national central cooling company pjsc in march  tabreed created an spv incorporated in the cayman islands which sold certificates of sukuk bonds with the proceeds of this sale it bought some partially completed central cooling plants “assets” held in trust for the sukuk  the spv leased the trust assets to the tabreed  which made rental payments to the spv  which passed the payments on to sukuk holders  when the sukuk matured the trust assets are bought back from the spv and the sukuk holders got their principal back if some dissolution event eg destruction of the leased property had interrupted the payment of rent this would have prompted “the continuation of payments in the form of repurchase price” this reduced the risk structure of the sukuk to that or near that of conventional bonds which permits the sukuk to earn the same or close to the same credit ratings that conventional bonds earn consequently they are able to be sold at an interest rater lower than they might otherwise although their transactions costs are higher than conventional bonds because of the creation of spvs as well as payment of various jurist and legal fees for structuring the bond issuance challenges criticism and controversyedit challengesedit according to a  imf report the supply of sukuk falls short of demand and with some exceptions issuance takes place without a comprehensive strategy to develop the domestic market sukuk are seen as wellsuited for infrastructure financing because of their risksharing property could also help fill financing gaps national authorities should therefore focus on developing the necessary infrastructure including promoting true securitization and enhanced clarity over investors’ rights and on stepping up regular sovereign issuance to provide a benchmark for the private sector increased sovereign issuance should be underpinned by sound public financial management key challenges to the islamic finance industry as a whole—including sukuk—as of  include according to the state of the global islamic economy report  and the imf are low levels of awareness and understanding of islamic finance products and services among the public leading them to not buy a scarcity of shariahcompliant monetary policy instruments and a lack of understanding of the monetary transmission mechanism complex financial products and corporate structures in some countriesjurisdictions because regulatory and supervisory frameworks do not address the unique risks of the industry consequently what is needed is increased regulatory clarity and harmonization better cooperation between islamic and conventional financial standardsetters and further improvement of supervisory tools underdeveloped safety nets and resolution frameworks in many places these include complete islamic deposit insurance systems where premiums are invested in shariahcompliant assets or shariahcompliant lendersoflastresort regulators who do not always have the capacity or willingness to ensure shariah compliance defaults in three years during and following the financial crisis of – —    — there were at least  substantial sukuk defaults and several large near defaults such as that of dubai world saved by a  billion loan from abu dhabi as of  there were a number of cases where the sukuk had defaulted or were in serious trouble in may  investment dar of kuwait defaulted on  million sukuk saad group set up a committee to restructure  million golden belt  sukuk standard  poors cut the rating of that sukuk owing to the nonavailability of vital information protection from originators default at least one of the three major bond rating agencies for the us has indicated doubts about the validity of transfer of assets from the originator in sukuk in the event of an insolvency of the originator and attempts by creditors to seize the assets fitch has not reviewed any transaction to date that would satisfy these requirements underscoring fitchs concern was the bankruptcy of east cameron partners ecp which issued a multipleawardwinning sukuk in  but filed for bankruptcy in october  prompting a legal dispute about the creditors right to  million in sukuk assets the final decision of the case did not clearly resolve this issue another major rating agency sp downgraded the sukuk of dubai islamic bank and sharjah islamic bank according to ibrahim warde as of  what is till unclear is what happens to sukuk when they fail  an issue that has not been tested in court in malaysia some sukuk issues have junk status and two other sukuk are already in default the easter cameron gas company in the united states and investment dar of kuwait one of the unresolved questions is whether sukuk holders should stand in the line of creditors or in the line of the owners of underlying assets in reviewing cases of sukuk defaults and bankruptcies muddassir siddiqui complained that through reading many cases that have so far been litigated in courts around the world i have found that in almost all cases the courts have struggled to reconcile the substance and form of the contract was it a sale lease construction or partnership contract or a financing arrangement between the parties according to rodney wilson when sukuk payments are delayed or fail the means of redress are potentially more complex than for conventional notes and bonds in particular under shari’ah leniency towards debtors is favoured which inevitably raises moral hazard problems criticism and controversyedit sukuk have been criticized as evading the restrictions on riba and imitating conventional bonds in february  the aaoifis board of scholars led by the granddaddy of modernday islamic finance sheik muhammad taqi usmani stated that as many as  percent of sukuk sold to date may not comply with all the precepts of shariah in a paper entitled sukuk and their contemporary applications released in november  usmani identified the following three key structuring elements that differentiate sukuk from conventional bonds sukuk must represent ownership shares in assets or commercial or industrial enterprises that bring profits or revenues payments to sukukholders should be the share of profits after costs of the assets or enterprise the value payable to the sukukholder on maturity should be the current market value of the assets or enterprise and not the principal originally invested usmani stated that by complex mechanisms sukuk had taken on the same characteristics as conventional interestbearing bonds as they do not return to investors more than a fixed percentage of the principal based on interest rates while guaranteeing the return of investors principal at maturity usmanis estimate that  of all sukuk in issuance were not shariahcompliant was based on the existence of guaranteed returns andor repurchase obligations from the issuer  a violation of shariah following usmanis criticisms the global sukuk market shrunk from us billion in  to approximately  billion in  although how much of this was due to his criticisms or the global financial crisis is a matter of debate the financial times has described this as an ongoing debate over form versus substance in islamic finance identifying two kinds of sukuk  assetbacked sukuk and the more numerous less strict allegedly noncompliant asset based sukuk in assetbacked sukuk there is a true sale between the originator and the special purpose vehicle spv that issues the sukuk and sukuk holders do not have recourse to the originator asset prices may vary over time in contrast assetbased sukuk do give their holders recourse to the originator and so more closely resemble conventional bonds  other critics include nonorthodox economist mahmoud elgamal who has complained that while providers of sukuk and other islamic finance instruments will often describe their distinguishing feature as the prohibition of interest they will then proceed to report the interest rate that islamic instruments pay for instance reuters’ august   coverage of bahrain’s  million sukuk  followed their characterization of islamic financial products as “interestfree” with a report that those sukuk will pay “ percent annual profit” he also complains that despite claims that sukuk—unlike conventional bonds—share the risk of their underlying asset and may increase or decrease in value in sukuk such as the tabreed sukuk mentioned above steady payment of rent is written into the sukuk contract giving them a risk structure essentially the same as conventional bonds another observer salman ali found that many of the sukuk structures do not conform to the shariah according to ali while most of the sukuk make an effort to remain within shariah bounds they replicate conventional debt instruments they often combine more than one contract which individually may be shariahcompliant but when combined may defeat the objective of the shariah furthermore the sukuk rate of return is often tied to the libor london interbank offered rate or euribor euro interbank offered rate interest rate rather than to the underlying business that the sukuk is financing this makes the sukuk so similar to conventional debt instruments that it is difficult to tell one from the other ali believes this may be why rating agencies such as standard  poors and moodys apply the same methodology for rating sukuk as for conventional debt instruments in  safari conducted various statistical and econometrics tests to check the argument that sukuk securities are merely the same as conventional bond however his results on the comparison of yield to maturity of sukuk and that of conventional bonds show that sukuk securities are different from conventional bonds in response to this argument it was pointed out that yield to maturity reflects the interplay of supply and demand which may be affected by a financial products packaging and target market rather than just the substance of the product alone in  goldman sacks abandoned a  billion sukuk programme in had registered

certificates also commonly referred to as sharia compliant bonds sukuk are defined by the aaoifi accounting and auditing organization for islamic financial institutions as securities of equal denomination representing individual ownership interests in a portfolio of eligible existing or future assetsnote  the fiqh academy of the oic legitimized the use of sukuk in february  sukuk were developed as an alternative to conventional bonds which are not considered permissible by many muslims as they pay interest and may finance businesses involved in nonshariacompliant activities gambling alcohol pork etc sukuk securities are structured to comply with sharia by paying profit not interest  generally by involving a tangible asset in the investment for example sukuk securities may have partial ownership of a property built by the investment company and held in a special purpose vehicle so that sukuk holders can collect the propertys profit as rent which is allowed under islamic law because they represent ownership of real assets and at least in theory do not guarantee repayment of initial investment sukuk resemble equity instruments but like a bond and unlike equity regular payments cease upon their expiration however most sukuk are assetbased rather than assetbacked  their assets are not truly owned by their special purpose vehicle and their holders have recourse to the originator if there is a shortfall in payments different types of sukuk are based on different structures of islamic contracts murabaha ijara istisna musharaka istithmar etc depending on the project the sukuk is financing according to the state of the global islamic economy report  of the  trillion of assets being managed in a sharia compliant manner in   billion were sukuk being

sukuk meant any document representing a contract or conveyance of rights obligations or monies done in conformity with the shariahcitation needed the term was used to refer to forms of papers representing financial obligations originating from trade and other commercial activities in the islamic premodern period according to camille paldi the first sukuk transaction took place in damascus in its great mosque in the th century ad muslim traders are known to have used the cheque or ṣakk system since the time of harun alrashid th century of the abbasid caliphate  the modern western word “cheque” appears to have been derived from “sakk” singular of sukuk note  which during the middle ages referred to a written agreement to pay for goods when they were delivered and was used to avoid money having to be transported across dangerous terrain modern answering a need to provide short and medium term instruments so that balance sheets of islamic financial institutions could be more liquid the fiqh academy of the oic organization of islamic countries legitimized the use of sukuk in february  in  one of the first contemporary sukuk—worth rm million—were issued by malaysia shell

enter this market as they are listed on stock exchanges the secondary market—whilst developing—remains a niche segment with virtually all of the trading done at the institution level the size of the secondary market remains unknown though lmc bahrain states they traded  million of sukuk in  as of july  sukukcom listed fifteen sukuk on the secondary market for gulf sukuk principlesedit ali arsalan tariq states that islamic finance—including sukuk—is based on a set of several prohibitions transactions in unethical goods and services earning returns from a loan contract ribainterest compensationbased restructuring of debts excessive uncertainty in contracts gharar gambling and chancebased games qimar trading in debt contracts at discount and forward foreign exchange transactions as shari’ah considers money to be a measuring tool for value and not an asset in itself it requires that one should not receive income from money or anything that has the genus of money alone as this simplistically interest is riba and forbidden from a sharia perspective certificates of debt are not tradable except at their par value although a different view is held by many in malaysiacitation needed while a bond is a contractual debt obligation of the issuer to pay to bondholders on certain specified dates interest and principal a sukuk is a certificate giving sukuk holders an undivided beneficial ownership in the underlying assets consequently sukuk holders are entitled to share in the revenues generated by the sukuk assets as well as being entitled to share in the proceeds of the realization of the sukuk assets similarities with bondsedit sukuk and bonds are sold to investors who receive a stream of paymentsnote  until the date of the maturity of the sukuk or bond at which time they get their original investment in the case of sukuk a full payment is not guaranteed back sukuk and bonds are intended to provide investment with less risk than equities such as shares of stock and so are often used to balance a portfolio of investment instruments both sukuk and bonds must issue a disclosure document known as a prospectus to describe the security they are sellilng to give investors an idea of how much risk is involved in particular sukukbonds rating agencies rate the credit worthiness of the issuers of the sukukbond both sukuk and bonds are initially sold by their issuers after that they or some sukuk and bonds may be bought and sold by brokers and agents mostly on the overthecounter otc market but are also available on some stock exchanges around the world differences from bondsedit ownership sukuk should indicate partial ownership of an asset bonds indicate a debt obligation compliance the assets that back sukuk should be compliant with shariah bonds need only comply with laws of countrylocality they are issued in pricing the face value of a sukuk is priced according to the value of the assets backing them bond pricing is based on credit rating ie the issuers credit worthiness rewards and risks sukuk can increase in value when the assets increase in value returns from bonds correspond to fixed interest because most bonds interest rates are fixed most increase in value when the market interest rates fall sales when you sell sukuk you are selling ownership in the assets backing them in instances where the certificate represents a debt to the holder the certificate will not be tradable on the secondary market and instead should be held until maturity the sale of bonds is the sale of debt principal sukuk investors in theory share the risk of the underlying asset and may not get all their initial investment the face value of the sukuk back the value payable to the sukukholder on maturity should be the current market value of the assets or enterprise and not the principal originally invested according to taqi usamani bond investors are guaranteed the return of their initial investmentprincipal in practice some sukuk are issued with repurchase guarantees conventional bonds are issued with underwriters sukuk may underwriters do not usually conduct the issuance and may not be required sukuk use special purpose vehicles to be the trusteeissuer of the sukuk definitions structure and characteristicsedit definitions the aaoifi accounting and auditing organization for islamic financial institutions the body which issues standards on accounting auditing governance ethical and sharia standards defines sukuk as securities of equal denomination representing individual ownership interests in a portfolio of eligible existing or future assetsnote  or ‘certificates of equal value representing undivided shares in the ownership of tangible assets usufructs and services or in the ownership of the assets of particular projects or special investment activity’ the islamic financial services board defines sukuk as certificates with each sakk representing a proportional undivided ownership right in tangible assets or a pool of predominantly tangible assets or a business venture these assets may be in a specific project or investment activity in accordance with sharia rules and principles the securities commission of malaysia defined sukuk as a document or certificate which represents the value of an asset need sharia forbids both the trading of shortterm debt instruments except at face value and the drawing upon the established interbank money markets both being seen as transactions involve interest and excessive uncertainty gharar as a consequence prior to the development of the sukuk market the balance sheets of islamic financial institutions tended to be highly illiquid and lacking in short and medium term investment opportunities for their current assets structure and characteristics sukuk are structured in several different ways the aaoifi has laid down  different types of sukuk while a conventional bond is a promise to repay a loan sukuk constitute partial ownership in a debt asset project business or investment debt sukuk murabaha these sukuk are not common because their payments to investors represent debt and are therefore not tradable or negotiable according to sharia if diluted with other nonmurahaha sukuk in a mixed portfolio they may be traded asset sukuk al ijara these are essentially rental or lease contracts or conventional leaserevenue bonds with these sukuk the borrowers tangible asset is sold to the financier and then leased back to the borrowers the borrowers then make regular payments back to the financiers from the income stream generated by the asset they are the most common type of sukuk as of  and have been described by faleel jamaldeen as wellknown because of there simplicity tradability and ability to provide a fixed flow of income asset at a future date sukuk alsalam in this sukuk the spv does not buy an asset but agrees to buy one at a future date in exchange for advance payments the asset is then sold in the future for its cost plus a profit by an agent on or before the date agreed to in the contract the seller delivers the asset to the agent who sells the asset who passes the proceeds minus expensesfees on to the spv which distributes the proceeds to the sukuk holders sukuk alsalam are at least usually used to support a companys short term liquidity requirements holders receive payment not with a regular flow of income but at maturity—similar to a zerocoupon bond an example of this kind of sukuk are  day cbb sukuk alsalam issued by central bank of bahrain project sukuk al istisna these sukuk are complex and cannot be traded in the secondary market or sold to a third party for less than its face value business sukuk al musharaka these sukuk holders are also the owners of the originator issuing the sukuk and participate in the decisionmaking these sukuk can be traded in the secondary market or investment sukuk al istithmar the most commonly used sukuk structures replicate the cash flows of conventional bonds such structures are listed on exchanges commonly the luxembourg stock exchange and london stock exchange in europe and made tradable through conventional organisations like euroclear or clearstream a key technique to achieve capital protection without amounting to a loan is a binding promise to repurchase certain assets eg in the case of sukuk al ijara by the issuer in the meantime a rent is being paid which is often benchmarked to an interest rate libor is the most common though its use is criticized by some sharia scholars the most accepted structure which is tradable is thereafter the sukuk al ijara debt certificates can only be bought before the finance occurs and then held to maturity from an islamic perspective this is critical for debt trading at market value without incurring the prohibited riba interest on moneycitation needed issuing and payment processedit stepbystep process of issuing a sukuk based on an asset the originator—a business firm requiring capital—creates a special purpose vehicle spv an independent entity and structures the spv protects the sukuk assets from creditors if the originator has financial troubles it specifies what asset or activity the sukuk will support how large the issuance of sukuk will be their face amounts interest rates maturity date spv are often located in taxefficient jurisdictions such as bahrain luxembourg or the cayman islands the spv issues the sukuk offering it for sale to investors with an agreement spelling out the relationship between obligator and sukuk holders depending on the type of sukuk this can be lessor and lessee partner etc with the money from the sale of sukuk certificates the spv passes offering to the originator who makes the sharia compliant asset purchase lease joint venture etc again depending on the type of sukuk the spv purchases assets such as land building machinery from the originator the sale proceeds are paid to the originatordebtor as the price of the assets the spv acting as a trustee on behalf of the sukukholders arranges to lease the assets back to the originator who pays the sukukholders the lease income the originator buys back the asset from the spv at a nominal price on termination of the lease in this type of sukuk fixed interest of a conventional bond is replaced by fixed lease income islamic economist muhammad akram khan complains that sukuk are different from conventional finance in form and formalities rather than substance and may even be more expensive for the income provided than a conventional bond exampleedit structure of a  million sukuk issued by the tabreed financing corporation in march  an example of a sukuk was a  million security used to finance the construction and delivery of cooling plants in abu dhabi this sukuk had an istisnaa and ijara structure and was issued by the tabreed financing corporation or national central cooling company pjsc in march  tabreed created an spv incorporated in the cayman islands which sold certificates of sukuk bonds with the proceeds of this sale it bought some partially completed central cooling plants “assets” held in trust for the sukuk  the spv leased the trust assets to the tabreed  which made rental payments to the spv  which passed the payments on to sukuk holders  when the sukuk matured the trust assets are bought back from the spv and the sukuk holders got their principal back if some dissolution event eg destruction of the leased property had interrupted the payment of rent this would have prompted “the continuation of payments in the form of repurchase price” this reduced the risk structure of the sukuk to that or near that of conventional bonds which permits the sukuk to earn the same or close to the same credit ratings that conventional bonds earn consequently they are able to be sold at an interest rater lower than they might otherwise although their transactions costs are higher than conventional bonds because of the creation of spvs as well as payment of various jurist and legal fees for structuring the bond issuance challenges criticism and controversyedit challengesedit according to a  imf report the supply of sukuk falls short of demand and with some exceptions issuance takes place without a comprehensive strategy to develop the domestic market sukuk are seen as wellsuited for infrastructure financing because of their risksharing property could also help fill financing gaps national authorities should therefore focus on developing the necessary infrastructure including promoting true securitization and enhanced clarity over investors’ rights and on stepping up regular sovereign issuance to provide a benchmark for the private sector increased sovereign issuance should be underpinned by sound public financial management key challenges to the islamic finance industry as a whole—including sukuk—as of  include according to the state of the global islamic economy report  and the imf are low levels of awareness and understanding of islamic finance products and services among the public leading them to not buy a scarcity of shariahcompliant monetary policy instruments and a lack of understanding of the monetary transmission mechanism complex financial products and corporate structures in some countriesjurisdictions because regulatory and supervisory frameworks do not address the unique risks of the industry consequently what is needed is increased regulatory clarity and harmonization better cooperation between islamic and conventional financial standardsetters and further improvement of supervisory tools underdeveloped safety nets and resolution frameworks in many places these include complete islamic deposit insurance systems where premiums are invested in shariahcompliant assets or shariahcompliant lendersoflastresort regulators who do not always have the capacity or willingness to ensure shariah compliance defaults in three years during and following the financial crisis of – —    — there were at least  substantial sukuk defaults and several large near defaults such as that of dubai world saved by a  billion loan from abu dhabi as of  there were a number of cases where the sukuk had defaulted or were in serious trouble in may  investment dar of kuwait defaulted on  million sukuk saad group set up a committee to restructure  million golden belt  sukuk standard  poors cut the rating of that sukuk owing to the nonavailability of vital information protection from originators default at least one of the three major bond rating agencies for the us has indicated doubts about the validity of transfer of assets from the originator in sukuk in the event of an insolvency of the originator and attempts by creditors to seize the assets fitch has not reviewed any transaction to date that would satisfy these requirements underscoring fitchs concern was the bankruptcy of east cameron partners ecp which issued a multipleawardwinning sukuk in  but filed for bankruptcy in october  prompting a legal dispute about the creditors right to  million in sukuk assets the final decision of the case did not clearly resolve this issue another major rating agency sp downgraded the sukuk of dubai islamic bank and sharjah islamic bank according to ibrahim warde as of  what is till unclear is what happens to sukuk when they fail  an issue that has not been tested in court in malaysia some sukuk issues have junk status and two other sukuk are already in default the easter cameron gas company in the united states and investment dar of kuwait one of the unresolved questions is whether sukuk holders should stand in the line of creditors or in the line of the owners of underlying assets in reviewing cases of sukuk defaults and bankruptcies muddassir siddiqui complained that through reading many cases that have so far been litigated in courts around the world i have found that in almost all cases the courts have struggled to reconcile the substance and form of the contract was it a sale lease construction or partnership contract or a financing arrangement between the parties according to rodney wilson when sukuk payments are delayed or fail the means of redress are potentially more complex than for conventional notes and bonds in particular under shari’ah leniency towards debtors is favoured which inevitably raises moral hazard problems criticism and controversyedit sukuk have been criticized as evading the restrictions on riba and imitating conventional bonds in february  the aaoifis board of scholars led by the granddaddy of modernday islamic finance sheik muhammad taqi usmani stated that as many as  percent of sukuk sold to date may not comply with all the precepts of shariah in a paper entitled sukuk and their contemporary applications released in november  usmani identified the following three key structuring elements that differentiate sukuk from conventional bonds sukuk must represent ownership shares in assets or commercial or industrial enterprises that bring profits or revenues payments to sukukholders should be the share of profits after costs of the assets or enterprise the value payable to the sukukholder on maturity should be the current market value of the assets or enterprise and not the principal originally invested usmani stated that by complex mechanisms sukuk had taken on the same characteristics as conventional interestbearing bonds as they do not return to investors more than a fixed percentage of the principal based on interest rates while guaranteeing the return of investors principal at maturity usmanis estimate that  of all sukuk in issuance were not shariahcompliant was based on the existence of guaranteed returns andor repurchase obligations from the issuer  a violation of shariah following usmanis criticisms the global sukuk market shrunk from us billion in  to approximately  billion in  although how much of this was due to his criticisms or the global financial crisis is a matter of debate the financial times has described this as an ongoing debate over form versus substance in islamic finance identifying two kinds of sukuk  assetbacked sukuk and the more numerous less strict allegedly noncompliant asset based sukuk in assetbacked sukuk there is a true sale between the originator and the special purpose vehicle spv that issues the sukuk and sukuk holders do not have recourse to the originator asset prices may vary over time in contrast assetbased sukuk do give their holders recourse to the originator and so more closely resemble conventional bonds  other critics include nonorthodox economist mahmoud elgamal who has complained that while providers of sukuk and other islamic finance instruments will often describe their distinguishing feature as the prohibition of interest they will then proceed to report the interest rate that islamic instruments pay for instance reuters’ august   coverage of bahrain’s  million sukuk  followed their characterization of islamic financial products as “interestfree” with a report that those sukuk will pay “ percent annual profit” he also complains that despite claims that sukuk—unlike conventional bonds—share the risk of their underlying asset and may increase or decrease in value in sukuk such as the tabreed sukuk mentioned above steady payment of rent is written into the sukuk contract giving them a risk structure essentially the same as conventional bonds another observer salman ali found that many of the sukuk structures do not conform to the shariah according to ali while most of the sukuk make an effort to remain within shariah bounds they replicate conventional debt instruments they often combine more than one contract which individually may be shariahcompliant but when combined may defeat the objective of the shariah furthermore the sukuk rate of return is often tied to the libor london interbank offered rate or euribor euro interbank offered rate interest rate rather than to the underlying business that the sukuk is financing this makes the sukuk so similar to conventional debt instruments that it is difficult to tell one from the other ali believes this may be why rating agencies such as standard  poors and moodys apply the same methodology for rating sukuk as for conventional debt instruments in  safari conducted various statistical and econometrics tests to check the argument that sukuk securities are merely the same as conventional bond however his results on the comparison of yield to maturity of sukuk and that of conventional bonds show that sukuk securities are different from conventional bonds in response to this argument it was pointed out that yield to maturity reflects the interplay of supply and demand which may be affected by a financial products packaging and target market rather than just the substance of the product alone in  goldman sacks abandoned a  billion sukuk programme in had registered

certificates also commonly referred to as sharia compliant bonds sukuk are defined by the aaoifi accounting and auditing organization for islamic financial institutions as securities of equal denomination representing individual ownership interests in a portfolio of eligible existing or future assetsnote  the fiqh academy of the oic legitimized the use of sukuk in february  sukuk were developed as an alternative to conventional bonds which are not considered permissible by many muslims as they pay interest and may finance businesses involved in nonshariacompliant activities gambling alcohol pork etc sukuk securities are structured to comply with sharia by paying profit not interest  generally by involving a tangible asset in the investment for example sukuk securities may have partial ownership of a property built by the investment company and held in a special purpose vehicle so that sukuk holders can collect the propertys profit as rent which is allowed under islamic law because they represent ownership of real assets and at least in theory do not guarantee repayment of initial investment sukuk resemble equity instruments but like a bond and unlike equity regular payments cease upon their expiration however most sukuk are assetbased rather than assetbacked  their assets are not truly owned by their special purpose vehicle and their holders have recourse to the originator if there is a shortfall in payments different types of sukuk are based on different structures of islamic contracts murabaha ijara istisna musharaka istithmar etc depending on the project the sukuk is financing according to the state of the global islamic economy report  of the  trillion of assets being managed in a sharia compliant manner in   billion were sukuk being

sukuk meant any document representing a contract or conveyance of rights obligations or monies done in conformity with the shariahcitation needed the term was used to refer to forms of papers representing financial obligations originating from trade and other commercial activities in the islamic premodern period according to camille paldi the first sukuk transaction took place in damascus in its great mosque in the th century ad muslim traders are known to have used the cheque or ṣakk system since the time of harun alrashid th century of the abbasid caliphate  the modern western word “cheque” appears to have been derived from “sakk” singular of sukuk note  which during the middle ages referred to a written agreement to pay for goods when they were delivered and was used to avoid money having to be transported across dangerous terrain modern answering a need to provide short and medium term instruments so that balance sheets of islamic financial institutions could be more liquid the fiqh academy of the oic organization of islamic countries legitimized the use of sukuk in february  in  one of the first contemporary sukuk—worth rm million—were issued by malaysia shell mds sdn bhd on the basis of bai bithaman ajil there were no other sukuk issued until  when the market began to take off in  the government of sudan issued domestic sovereign shortterm sukuk worth

since then many sovereign and corporate sukuk issues have been offered in various jurisdictions to standardize the growing market the aaoif issued shari’ah standard no on ‘investment sukuk’ in may  it

securities issued in the global markets that were investmentgrade and had a duration of at least one year these securities—which make up the citi sukuk index—had an average maturity of  years and most

 of the sukuk market is domestic not international most sukuk are not investment grade however and as of  there were  sukuk issues in total including local currency denominated nonglobal market sukuk according to thomson reuters  dinar standard according to the malaysian international islamic financial centre as of  the biggest issuers of sukuk were governments  and the second largest were power and utility companies  secondary marketedit sukuk securities tend to be bought and held as a result few securities enter the secondary market to be traded furthermore only public sukuk are able to enter this market as they are listed on stock exchanges the secondary market—whilst developing—remains a niche segment with virtually all of the trading done at the institution level the size of the secondary market remains unknown though lmc bahrain states they traded  million of sukuk in  as of july  sukukcom listed fifteen sukuk on the secondary market for gulf sukuk principlesedit ali arsalan tariq states that islamic finance—including sukuk—is based on a set of several prohibitions transactions in unethical goods and services earning returns from a loan contract ribainterest compensationbased restructuring of debts excessive uncertainty in contracts gharar gambling and chancebased games qimar trading in debt contracts at discount and forward foreign exchange transactions as shari’ah considers money to be a measuring tool for value and not an asset in itself it requires that one should not receive income from money or anything that has the genus of money alone as this simplistically interest is riba and forbidden from a sharia perspective certificates of debt are not tradable except at their par value although a different view is held by many in malaysiacitation needed while a bond is a contractual debt obligation of the issuer to pay to bondholders on certain specified dates interest and principal a sukuk is a certificate giving sukuk holders an undivided beneficial ownership in the underlying assets consequently sukuk holders are entitled to share in the revenues generated by the sukuk assets as well as being entitled to share in the proceeds of the realization of the sukuk assets similarities with bondsedit sukuk and bonds are sold to investors who receive a stream of paymentsnote  until the date of the maturity of the sukuk or bond at which time they get their original investment in the case of sukuk a full payment is not guaranteed back sukuk and bonds are intended to provide investment with less risk than equities such as shares of stock and so are often used to balance a portfolio of investment instruments both sukuk and bonds must issue a disclosure document known as a prospectus to describe the security they are sellilng to give investors an idea of how much risk is involved in particular sukukbonds rating agencies rate the credit worthiness of the issuers of the sukukbond both sukuk and bonds are initially sold by their issuers after that they or some sukuk and bonds may be bought and sold by brokers and agents mostly on the overthecounter otc market but are also available on some stock exchanges around the world differences from bondsedit ownership sukuk should indicate partial ownership of an asset bonds indicate a debt obligation compliance the assets that back sukuk should be compliant with shariah bonds need only comply with laws of countrylocality they are issued in pricing the face value of a sukuk is priced according to the value of the assets backing them bond pricing is based on credit rating ie the issuers credit worthiness rewards and risks sukuk can increase in value when the assets increase in value returns from bonds correspond to fixed interest because most bonds interest rates are fixed most increase in value when the market interest rates fall sales when you sell sukuk you are selling ownership in the assets backing them in instances where the certificate represents a debt to the holder the certificate will not be tradable on the secondary market and instead should be held until maturity the sale of bonds is the sale of debt principal sukuk investors in theory share the risk of the underlying asset and may not get all their initial investment the face value of the sukuk back the value payable to the sukukholder on maturity should be the current market value of the assets or enterprise and not the principal originally invested according to taqi usamani bond investors are guaranteed the return of their initial investmentprincipal in practice some sukuk are issued with repurchase guarantees conventional bonds are issued with underwriters sukuk may underwriters do not usually conduct the issuance and may not be required sukuk use special purpose vehicles to be the trusteeissuer of the sukuk definitions structure and characteristicsedit definitions the aaoifi accounting and auditing organization for islamic financial institutions the body which issues standards on accounting auditing governance ethical and sharia standards defines sukuk as securities of equal denomination representing individual ownership interests in a portfolio of eligible existing or future assetsnote  or ‘certificates of equal value representing undivided shares in the ownership of tangible assets usufructs and services or in the ownership of the assets of particular projects or special investment activity’ the islamic financial services board defines sukuk as certificates with each sakk representing a proportional undivided ownership right in tangible assets or a pool of predominantly tangible assets or a business venture these assets may be in a specific project or investment activity in accordance with sharia rules and principles the securities commission of malaysia defined sukuk as a document or certificate which represents the value of an asset need sharia forbids both the trading of shortterm debt instruments except at face value and the drawing upon the established interbank money markets both being seen as transactions involve interest and excessive uncertainty gharar as a consequence prior to the development of the sukuk market the balance sheets of islamic financial institutions tended to be highly illiquid and lacking in short and medium term investment opportunities for their current assets structure and characteristics sukuk are structured in several different ways the aaoifi has laid down  different types of sukuk while a conventional bond is a promise to repay a loan sukuk constitute partial ownership in a debt asset project business or investment debt sukuk murabaha these sukuk are not common because their payments to investors represent debt and are therefore not tradable or negotiable according to sharia if diluted with other nonmurahaha sukuk in a mixed portfolio they may be traded asset sukuk al ijara these are essentially rental or lease contracts or conventional leaserevenue bonds with these sukuk the borrowers tangible asset is sold to the financier and then leased back to the borrowers the borrowers then make regular payments back to the financiers from the income stream generated by the asset they are the most common type of sukuk as of  and have been described by faleel jamaldeen as wellknown because of there simplicity tradability and ability to provide a fixed flow of income asset at a future date sukuk alsalam in this sukuk the spv does not buy an asset but agrees to buy one at a future date in exchange for advance payments the asset is then sold in the future for its cost plus a profit by an agent on or before the date agreed to in the contract the seller delivers the asset to the agent who sells the asset who passes the proceeds minus expensesfees on to the spv which distributes the proceeds to the sukuk holders sukuk alsalam are at least usually used to support a companys short term liquidity requirements holders receive payment not with a regular flow of income but at maturity—similar to a zerocoupon bond an example of this kind of sukuk are  day cbb sukuk alsalam issued by central bank of bahrain project sukuk al istisna these sukuk are complex and cannot be traded in the secondary market or sold to a third party for less than its face value business sukuk al musharaka these sukuk holders are also the owners of the originator issuing the sukuk and participate in the decisionmaking these sukuk can be traded in the secondary market or investment sukuk al istithmar the most commonly used sukuk structures replicate the cash flows of conventional bonds such structures are listed on exchanges commonly the luxembourg stock exchange and london stock exchange in europe and made tradable through conventional organisations like euroclear or clearstream a key technique to achieve capital protection without amounting to a loan is a binding promise to repurchase certain assets eg in the case of sukuk al ijara by the issuer in the meantime a rent is being paid which is often benchmarked to an interest rate libor is the most common though its use is criticized by some sharia scholars the most accepted structure which is tradable is thereafter the sukuk al ijara debt certificates can only be bought before the finance occurs and then held to maturity from an islamic perspective this is critical for debt trading at market value without incurring the prohibited riba interest on moneycitation needed issuing and payment processedit stepbystep process of issuing a sukuk based on an asset the originator—a business firm requiring capital—creates a special purpose vehicle spv an independent entity and structures the spv protects the sukuk assets from creditors if the originator has financial troubles it specifies what asset or activity the sukuk will support how large the issuance of sukuk will be their face amounts interest rates maturity date spv are often located in taxefficient jurisdictions such as bahrain luxembourg or the cayman islands the spv issues the sukuk offering it for sale to investors with an agreement spelling out the relationship between obligator and sukuk holders depending on the type of sukuk this can be lessor and lessee partner etc with the money from the sale of sukuk certificates the spv passes offering to the originator who makes the sharia compliant asset purchase lease joint venture etc again depending on the type of sukuk the spv purchases assets such as land building machinery from the originator the sale proceeds are paid to the originatordebtor as the price of the assets the spv acting as a trustee on behalf of the sukukholders arranges to lease the assets back to the originator who pays the sukukholders the lease income the originator buys back the asset from the spv at a nominal price on termination of the lease in this type of sukuk fixed interest of a conventional bond is replaced by fixed lease income islamic economist muhammad akram khan complains that sukuk are different from conventional finance in form and formalities rather than substance and may even be more expensive for the income provided than a conventional bond exampleedit structure of a  million sukuk issued by the tabreed financing corporation in march  an example of a sukuk was a  million security used to finance the construction and delivery of cooling plants in abu dhabi this sukuk had an istisnaa and ijara structure and was issued by the tabreed financing corporation or national central cooling company pjsc in march  tabreed created an spv incorporated in the cayman islands which sold certificates of sukuk bonds with the proceeds of this sale it bought some partially completed central cooling plants “assets” held in trust for the sukuk  the spv leased the trust assets to the tabreed  which made rental payments to the spv  which passed the payments on to sukuk holders  when the sukuk matured the trust assets are bought back from the spv and the sukuk holders got their principal back if some dissolution event eg destruction of the leased property had interrupted the payment of rent this would have prompted “the continuation of payments in the form of repurchase price” this reduced the risk structure of the sukuk to that or near that of conventional bonds which permits the sukuk to earn the same or close to the same credit ratings that conventional bonds earn consequently they are able to be sold at an interest rater lower than they might otherwise although their transactions costs are higher than conventional bonds because of the creation of spvs as well as payment of various jurist and legal fees for structuring the bond issuance challenges criticism and controversyedit challengesedit according to a  imf report the supply of sukuk falls short of demand and with some exceptions issuance takes place without a comprehensive strategy to develop the domestic market sukuk are seen as wellsuited for infrastructure financing because of their risksharing property could also help fill financing gaps national authorities should therefore focus on developing the necessary infrastructure including promoting true securitization and enhanced clarity over investors’ rights and on stepping up regular sovereign issuance to provide a benchmark for the private sector increased sovereign issuance should be underpinned by sound public financial management key challenges to the islamic finance industry as a whole—including sukuk—as of  include according to the state of the global islamic economy report  and the imf are low levels of awareness and understanding of islamic finance products and services among the public leading them to not buy a scarcity of shariahcompliant monetary policy instruments and a lack of understanding of the monetary transmission mechanism complex financial products and corporate structures in some countriesjurisdictions because regulatory and supervisory frameworks do not address the unique risks of the industry consequently what is needed is increased regulatory clarity and harmonization better cooperation between islamic and conventional financial standardsetters and further improvement of supervisory tools underdeveloped safety nets and resolution frameworks in many places these include complete islamic deposit insurance systems where premiums are invested in shariahcompliant assets or shariahcompliant lendersoflastresort regulators who do not always have the capacity or willingness to ensure shariah compliance defaults in three years during and following the financial crisis of – —    — there were at least  substantial sukuk defaults and several large near defaults such as that of dubai world saved by a  billion loan from abu dhabi as of  there were a number of cases where the sukuk had defaulted or were in serious trouble in may  investment dar of kuwait defaulted on  million sukuk saad group set up a committee to restructure  million golden belt  sukuk standard  poors cut the rating of that sukuk owing to the nonavailability of vital information protection from originators default at least one of the three major bond rating agencies for the us has indicated doubts about the validity of transfer of assets from the originator in sukuk in the event of an insolvency of the originator and attempts by creditors to seize the assets fitch has not reviewed any transaction to date that would satisfy these requirements underscoring fitchs concern was the bankruptcy of east cameron partners ecp which issued a multipleawardwinning sukuk in  but filed for bankruptcy in october  prompting a legal dispute about the creditors right to  million in sukuk assets the final decision of the case did not clearly resolve this issue another major rating agency sp downgraded the sukuk of dubai islamic bank and sharjah islamic bank according to ibrahim warde as of  what is till unclear is what happens to sukuk when they fail  an issue that has not been tested in court in malaysia some sukuk issues have junk status and two other sukuk are already in default the easter cameron gas company in the united states and investment dar of kuwait one of the unresolved questions is whether sukuk holders should stand in the line of creditors or in the line of the owners of underlying assets in reviewing cases of sukuk defaults and bankruptcies muddassir siddiqui complained that through reading many cases that have so far been litigated in courts around the world i have found that in almost all cases the courts have struggled to reconcile the substance and form of the contract was it a sale lease construction or partnership contract or a financing arrangement between the parties according to rodney wilson when sukuk payments are delayed or fail the means of redress are potentially more complex than for conventional notes and bonds in particular under shari’ah leniency towards debtors is favoured which inevitably raises moral hazard problems criticism and controversyedit sukuk have been criticized as evading the restrictions on riba and imitating conventional bonds in february  the aaoifis board of scholars led by the granddaddy of modernday islamic finance sheik muhammad taqi usmani stated that as many as  percent of sukuk sold to date may not comply with all the precepts of shariah in a paper entitled sukuk and their contemporary applications released in november  usmani identified the following three key structuring elements that differentiate sukuk from conventional bonds sukuk must represent ownership shares in assets or commercial or industrial enterprises that bring profits or revenues payments to sukukholders should be the share of profits after costs of the assets or enterprise the value payable to the sukukholder on maturity should be the current market value of the assets or enterprise and not the principal originally invested usmani stated that by complex mechanisms sukuk had taken on the same characteristics as conventional interestbearing bonds as they do not return to investors more than a fixed percentage of the principal based on interest rates while guaranteeing the return of investors principal at maturity usmanis estimate that  of all sukuk in issuance were not shariahcompliant was based on the existence of guaranteed returns andor repurchase obligations from the issuer  a violation of shariah following usmanis criticisms the global sukuk market shrunk from us billion in  to approximately  billion in  although how much of this was due to his criticisms or the global financial crisis is a matter of debate the financial times has described this as an ongoing debate over form versus substance in islamic finance identifying two kinds of sukuk  assetbacked sukuk and the more numerous less strict allegedly noncompliant asset based sukuk in assetbacked sukuk there is a true sale between the originator and the special purpose vehicle spv that issues the sukuk and sukuk holders do not have recourse to the originator asset prices may vary over time in contrast assetbased sukuk do give their holders recourse to the originator and so more closely resemble conventional bonds  other critics include nonorthodox economist mahmoud elgamal who has complained that while providers of sukuk and other islamic finance instruments will often describe their distinguishing feature as the prohibition of interest they will then proceed to report the interest rate that islamic instruments pay for instance reuters’ august   coverage of bahrain’s  million sukuk  followed their characterization of islamic financial products as “interestfree” with a report that those sukuk will pay “ percent annual profit” he also complains that despite claims that sukuk—unlike conventional bonds—share the risk of their underlying asset and may increase or decrease in value in sukuk such as the tabreed sukuk mentioned above steady payment of rent is written into the sukuk contract giving them a risk structure essentially the same as conventional bonds another observer salman ali found that many of the sukuk structures do not conform to the shariah according to ali while most of the sukuk make an effort to remain within shariah bounds they replicate conventional debt instruments they often combine more than one contract which individually may be shariahcompliant but when combined may defeat the objective of the shariah furthermore the sukuk rate of return is often tied to the libor london interbank offered rate or euribor euro interbank offered rate interest rate rather than to the underlying business that the sukuk is financing this makes the sukuk so similar to conventional debt instruments that it is difficult to tell one from the other ali believes this may be why rating agencies such as standard  poors and moodys apply the same methodology for rating sukuk as for conventional debt instruments in  safari conducted various statistical and econometrics tests to check the argument that sukuk securities are merely the same as conventional bond however his results on the comparison of yield to maturity of sukuk and that of conventional bonds show that sukuk securities are different from conventional bonds in response to this argument it was pointed out that yield to maturity reflects the interplay of supply and demand which may be affected by a financial products packaging and target market rather than just the substance of the product alone in  goldman sacks abandoned a  billion sukuk programme in had registered

certificates also commonly referred to as sharia compliant bonds sukuk are defined by the aaoifi accounting and auditing organization for islamic financial institutions as securities of equal denomination representing individual ownership interests in a portfolio of eligible existing or future assetsnote  the fiqh academy of the oic legitimized the use of sukuk in february  sukuk were developed as an alternative to conventional bonds which are not considered permissible by many muslims as they pay interest and may finance businesses involved in nonshariacompliant activities gambling alcohol pork etc sukuk securities are structured to comply with sharia by paying profit not interest  generally by involving a tangible asset in the investment for example sukuk securities may have partial ownership of a property built by the investment company and held in a special purpose vehicle so that sukuk holders can collect the propertys profit as rent which is allowed under islamic law because they represent ownership of real assets and at least in theory do not guarantee repayment of initial investment sukuk resemble equity instruments but like a bond and unlike equity regular payments cease upon their expiration however most sukuk are assetbased rather than assetbacked  their assets are not truly owned by their special purpose vehicle and their holders have recourse to the originator if there is a shortfall in payments different types of sukuk are based on different structures of islamic contracts murabaha ijara istisna musharaka istithmar etc depending on the project the sukuk is financing according to the state of the global islamic economy report  of the  trillion of assets being managed in a sharia compliant manner in   billion were sukuk being

singapore  somalia  turkey  united arab emirates  united kingdom  hong kong  see also  references  notes  citations  books documents journal articles historyedit in the classical period of islam sakk sukuk meant any document representing a contract or conveyance of rights obligations or monies done in conformity with the shariahcitation needed the term was used to refer to forms of papers representing financial obligations originating from trade and other commercial activities in the islamic premodern period according to camille paldi the first sukuk transaction took place in damascus in its great mosque in the th century ad muslim traders are known to have used the cheque or ṣakk system since the time of harun alrashid th century of the abbasid caliphate  the modern western word “cheque” appears to have been derived from “sakk” singular of sukuk note  which during the middle ages referred to a written agreement to pay for goods when they were delivered and was used to avoid money having to be transported across dangerous terrain modern answering a need to provide short and medium term instruments so that balance sheets of islamic financial institutions could be more liquid the fiqh academy of the oic organization of islamic countries legitimized the use of sukuk in february  in  one of the first contemporary sukuk—worth rm million—were issued by malaysia shell mds sdn bhd on the basis of bai bithaman ajil there were no other sukuk issued until  when the market began to take off in  the government of sudan issued domestic sovereign shortterm sukuk worth  million sudanese pounds on the basis of musharaka in  the sukuk market went international with the issuance of the first usdollardenominated ijara sukuk worth  million by the central bank of bahrain since then many sovereign and corporate sukuk issues have been offered in various jurisdictions to standardize the growing market the aaoif issued shari’ah standard no on ‘investment sukuk’ in may  it

islamic financial market report p  forbes as of early  there were us billion worth of sukuk outstanding worldwide as of the end of  there were about  us dollardenominated islamic fixed income securities issued in the global markets that were investmentgrade and had a duration of at least one year these securities—which make up the citi sukuk index—had an average maturity of  years and most were issued by governments the top four issuers by market weight—making up over  of the market—were islamic development bank perusahaan penerbit sbsn indoiii saudi electricity co soq sukuk a qsc about  of the sukuk market is domestic not international most sukuk are not investment grade however and as of  there were  sukuk issues in total including local currency denominated nonglobal market sukuk according to thomson reuters  dinar standard according to the malaysian international islamic financial centre as of  the biggest issuers of sukuk were governments  and the second largest were power and utility companies  secondary marketedit sukuk securities tend to be bought and held as a result few securities enter the secondary market to be traded furthermore only public sukuk are able to enter this market as they are listed on stock exchanges the secondary market—whilst developing—remains a niche segment with virtually all of the trading done at the institution level the size of the secondary market remains unknown though lmc bahrain states they traded  million of sukuk in  as of july  sukukcom listed fifteen sukuk on the secondary market for gulf sukuk principlesedit ali arsalan tariq states that islamic finance—including sukuk—is based on a set of several prohibitions transactions in unethical goods and services earning returns from a loan contract ribainterest compensationbased restructuring of debts excessive uncertainty in contracts gharar gambling and chancebased games qimar trading in debt contracts at discount and forward foreign exchange transactions as shari’ah considers money to be a measuring tool for value and not an asset in itself it requires that one should not receive income from money or anything that has the genus of money alone as this simplistically interest is riba and forbidden from a sharia perspective certificates of debt are not tradable except at their par value although a different view is held by many in malaysiacitation needed while a bond is a contractual debt obligation of the issuer to pay to bondholders on certain specified dates interest and principal a sukuk is a certificate giving sukuk holders an undivided beneficial ownership in the underlying assets consequently sukuk holders are entitled to share in the revenues generated by the sukuk assets as well as being entitled to share in the proceeds of the realization of the sukuk assets similarities with bondsedit sukuk and bonds are sold to investors who receive a stream of paymentsnote  until the date of the maturity of the sukuk or bond at which time they get their original investment in the case of sukuk a full payment is not guaranteed back sukuk and bonds are intended to provide investment with less risk than equities such as shares of stock and so are often used to balance a portfolio of investment instruments both sukuk and bonds must issue a disclosure document known as a prospectus to describe the security they are sellilng to give investors an idea of how much risk is involved in particular sukukbonds rating agencies rate the credit worthiness of the issuers of the sukukbond both sukuk and bonds are initially sold by their issuers after that they or some sukuk and bonds may be bought and sold by brokers and agents mostly on the overthecounter otc market but are also available on some stock exchanges around the world differences from bondsedit ownership sukuk should indicate partial ownership of an asset bonds indicate a debt obligation compliance the assets that back sukuk should be compliant with shariah bonds need only comply with laws of countrylocality they are issued in pricing the face value of a sukuk is priced according to the value of the assets backing them bond pricing is based on credit rating ie the issuers credit worthiness rewards and risks sukuk can increase in value when the assets increase in value returns from bonds correspond to fixed interest because most bonds interest rates are fixed most increase in value when the market interest rates fall sales when you sell sukuk you are selling ownership in the assets backing them in instances where the certificate represents a debt to the holder the certificate will not be tradable on the secondary market and instead should be held until maturity the sale of bonds is the sale of debt principal sukuk investors in theory share the risk of the underlying asset and may not get all their initial investment the face value of the sukuk back the value payable to the sukukholder on maturity should be the current market value of the assets or enterprise and not the principal originally invested according to taqi usamani bond investors are guaranteed the return of their initial investmentprincipal in practice some sukuk are issued with repurchase guarantees conventional bonds are issued with underwriters sukuk may underwriters do not usually conduct the issuance and may not be required sukuk use special purpose vehicles to be the trusteeissuer of the sukuk definitions structure and characteristicsedit definitions the aaoifi accounting and auditing organization for islamic financial institutions the body which issues standards on accounting auditing governance ethical and sharia standards defines sukuk as securities of equal denomination representing individual ownership interests in a portfolio of eligible existing or future assetsnote  or ‘certificates of equal value representing undivided shares in the ownership of tangible assets usufructs and services or in the ownership of the assets of particular projects or special investment activity’ the islamic financial services board defines sukuk as certificates with each sakk representing a proportional undivided ownership right in tangible assets or a pool of predominantly tangible assets or a business venture these assets may be in a specific project or investment activity in accordance with sharia rules and principles the securities commission of malaysia defined sukuk as a document or certificate which represents the value of an asset need sharia forbids both the trading of shortterm debt instruments except at face value and the drawing upon the established interbank money markets both being seen as transactions involve interest and excessive uncertainty gharar as a consequence prior to the development of the sukuk market the balance sheets of islamic financial institutions tended to be highly illiquid and lacking in short and medium term investment opportunities for their current assets structure and characteristics sukuk are structured in several different ways the aaoifi has laid down  different types of sukuk while a conventional bond is a promise to repay a loan sukuk constitute partial ownership in a debt asset project business or investment debt sukuk murabaha these sukuk are not common because their payments to investors represent debt and are therefore not tradable or negotiable according to sharia if diluted with other nonmurahaha sukuk in a mixed portfolio they may be traded asset sukuk al ijara these are essentially rental or lease contracts or conventional leaserevenue bonds with these sukuk the borrowers tangible asset is sold to the financier and then leased back to the borrowers the borrowers then make regular payments back to the financiers from the income stream generated by the asset they are the most common type of sukuk as of  and have been described by faleel jamaldeen as wellknown because of there simplicity tradability and ability to provide a fixed flow of income asset at a future date sukuk alsalam in this sukuk the spv does not buy an asset but agrees to buy one at a future date in exchange for advance payments the asset is then sold in the future for its cost plus a profit by an agent on or before the date agreed to in the contract the seller delivers the asset to the agent who sells the asset who passes the proceeds minus expensesfees on to the spv which distributes the proceeds to the sukuk holders sukuk alsalam are at least usually used to support a companys short term liquidity requirements holders receive payment not with a regular flow of income but at maturity—similar to a zerocoupon bond an example of this kind of sukuk are  day cbb sukuk alsalam issued by central bank of bahrain project sukuk al istisna these sukuk are complex and cannot be traded in the secondary market or sold to a third party for less than its face value business sukuk al musharaka these sukuk holders are also the owners of the originator issuing the sukuk and participate in the decisionmaking these sukuk can be traded in the secondary market or investment sukuk al istithmar the most commonly used sukuk structures replicate the cash flows of conventional bonds such structures are listed on exchanges commonly the luxembourg stock exchange and london stock exchange in europe and made tradable through conventional organisations like euroclear or clearstream a key technique to achieve capital protection without amounting to a loan is a binding promise to repurchase certain assets eg in the case of sukuk al ijara by the issuer in the meantime a rent is being paid which is often benchmarked to an interest rate libor is the most common though its use is criticized by some sharia scholars the most accepted structure which is tradable is thereafter the sukuk al ijara debt certificates can only be bought before the finance occurs and then held to maturity from an islamic perspective this is critical for debt trading at market value without incurring the prohibited riba interest on moneycitation needed issuing and payment processedit stepbystep process of issuing a sukuk based on an asset the originator—a business firm requiring capital—creates a special purpose vehicle spv an independent entity and structures the spv protects the sukuk assets from creditors if the originator has financial troubles it specifies what asset or activity the sukuk will support how large the issuance of sukuk will be their face amounts interest rates maturity date spv are often located in taxefficient jurisdictions such as bahrain luxembourg or the cayman islands the spv issues the sukuk offering it for sale to investors with an agreement spelling out the relationship between obligator and sukuk holders depending on the type of sukuk this can be lessor and lessee partner etc with the money from the sale of sukuk certificates the spv passes offering to the originator who makes the sharia compliant asset purchase lease joint venture etc again depending on the type of sukuk the spv purchases assets such as land building machinery from the originator the sale proceeds are paid to the originatordebtor as the price of the assets the spv acting as a trustee on behalf of the sukukholders arranges to lease the assets back to the originator who pays the sukukholders the lease income the originator buys back the asset from the spv at a nominal price on termination of the lease in this type of sukuk fixed interest of a conventional bond is replaced by fixed lease income islamic economist muhammad akram khan complains that sukuk are different from conventional finance in form and formalities rather than substance and may even be more expensive for the income provided than a conventional bond exampleedit structure of a  million sukuk issued by the tabreed financing corporation in march  an example of a sukuk was a  million security used to finance the construction and delivery of cooling plants in abu dhabi this sukuk had an istisnaa and ijara structure and was issued by the tabreed financing corporation or national central cooling company pjsc in march  tabreed created an spv incorporated in the cayman islands which sold certificates of sukuk bonds with the proceeds of this sale it bought some partially completed central cooling plants “assets” held in trust for the sukuk  the spv leased the trust assets to the tabreed  which made rental payments to the spv  which passed the payments on to sukuk holders  when the sukuk matured the trust assets are bought back from the spv and the sukuk holders got their principal back if some dissolution event eg destruction of the leased property had interrupted the payment of rent this would have prompted “the continuation of payments in the form of repurchase price” this reduced the risk structure of the sukuk to that or near that of conventional bonds which permits the sukuk to earn the same or close to the same credit ratings that conventional bonds earn consequently they are able to be sold at an interest rater lower than they might otherwise although their transactions costs are higher than conventional bonds because of the creation of spvs as well as payment of various jurist and legal fees for structuring the bond issuance challenges criticism and controversyedit challengesedit according to a  imf report the supply of sukuk falls short of demand and with some exceptions issuance takes place without a comprehensive strategy to develop the domestic market sukuk are seen as wellsuited for infrastructure financing because of their risksharing property could also help fill financing gaps national authorities should therefore focus on developing the necessary infrastructure including promoting true securitization and enhanced clarity over investors’ rights and on stepping up regular sovereign issuance to provide a benchmark for the private sector increased sovereign issuance should be underpinned by sound public financial management key challenges to the islamic finance industry as a whole—including sukuk—as of  include according to the state of the global islamic economy report  and the imf are low levels of awareness and understanding of islamic finance products and services among the public leading them to not buy a scarcity of shariahcompliant monetary policy instruments and a lack of understanding of the monetary transmission mechanism complex financial products and corporate structures in some countriesjurisdictions because regulatory and supervisory frameworks do not address the unique risks of the industry consequently what is needed is increased regulatory clarity and harmonization better cooperation between islamic and conventional financial standardsetters and further improvement of supervisory tools underdeveloped safety nets and resolution frameworks in many places these include complete islamic deposit insurance systems where premiums are invested in shariahcompliant assets or shariahcompliant lendersoflastresort regulators who do not always have the capacity or willingness to ensure shariah compliance defaults in three years during and following the financial crisis of – —    — there were at least  substantial sukuk defaults and several large near defaults such as that of dubai world saved by a  billion loan from abu dhabi as of  there were a number of cases where the sukuk had defaulted or were in serious trouble in may  investment dar of kuwait defaulted on  million sukuk saad group set up a committee to restructure  million golden belt  sukuk standard  poors cut the rating of that sukuk owing to the nonavailability of vital information protection from originators default at least one of the three major bond rating agencies for the us has indicated doubts about the validity of transfer of assets from the originator in sukuk in the event of an insolvency of the originator and attempts by creditors to seize the assets fitch has not reviewed any transaction to date that would satisfy these requirements underscoring fitchs concern was the bankruptcy of east cameron partners ecp which issued a multipleawardwinning sukuk in  but filed for bankruptcy in october  prompting a legal dispute about the creditors right to  million in sukuk assets the final decision of the case did not clearly resolve this issue another major rating agency sp downgraded the sukuk of dubai islamic bank and sharjah islamic bank according to ibrahim warde as of  what is till unclear is what happens to sukuk when they fail  an issue that has not been tested in court in malaysia some sukuk issues have junk status and two other sukuk are already in default the easter cameron gas company in the united states and investment dar of kuwait one of the unresolved questions is whether sukuk holders should stand in the line of creditors or in the line of the owners of underlying assets in reviewing cases of sukuk defaults and bankruptcies muddassir siddiqui complained that through reading many cases that have so far been litigated in courts around the world i have found that in almost all cases the courts have struggled to reconcile the substance and form of the contract was it a sale lease construction or partnership contract or a financing arrangement between the parties according to rodney wilson when sukuk payments are delayed or fail the means of redress are potentially more complex than for conventional notes and bonds in particular under shari’ah leniency towards debtors is favoured which inevitably raises moral hazard problems criticism and controversyedit sukuk have been criticized as evading the restrictions on riba and imitating conventional bonds in february  the aaoifis board of scholars led by the granddaddy of modernday islamic finance sheik muhammad taqi usmani stated that as many as  percent of sukuk sold to date may not comply with all the precepts of shariah in a paper entitled sukuk and their contemporary applications released in november  usmani identified the following three key structuring elements that differentiate sukuk from conventional bonds sukuk must represent ownership shares in assets or commercial or industrial enterprises that bring profits or revenues payments to sukukholders should be the share of profits after costs of the assets or enterprise the value payable to the sukukholder on maturity should be the current market value of the assets or enterprise and not the principal originally invested usmani stated that by complex mechanisms sukuk had taken on the same characteristics as conventional interestbearing bonds as they do not return to investors more than a fixed percentage of the principal based on interest rates while guaranteeing the return of investors principal at maturity usmanis estimate that  of all sukuk in issuance were not shariahcompliant was based on the existence of guaranteed returns andor repurchase obligations from the issuer  a violation of shariah following usmanis criticisms the global sukuk market shrunk from us billion in  to approximately  billion in  although how much of this was due to his criticisms or the global financial crisis is a matter of debate the financial times has described this as an ongoing debate over form versus substance in islamic finance identifying two kinds of sukuk  assetbacked sukuk and the more numerous less strict allegedly noncompliant asset based sukuk in assetbacked sukuk there is a true sale between the originator and the special purpose vehicle spv that issues the sukuk and sukuk holders do not have recourse to the originator asset prices may vary over time in contrast assetbased sukuk do give their holders recourse to the originator and so more closely resemble conventional bonds  other critics include nonorthodox economist mahmoud elgamal who has complained that while providers of sukuk and other islamic finance instruments will often describe their distinguishing feature as the prohibition of interest they will then proceed to report the interest rate that islamic instruments pay for instance reuters’ august   coverage of bahrain’s  million sukuk  followed their characterization of islamic financial products as “interestfree” with a report that those sukuk will pay “ percent annual profit” he also complains that despite claims that sukuk—unlike conventional bonds—share the risk of their underlying asset and may increase or decrease in value in sukuk such as the tabreed sukuk mentioned above steady payment of rent is written into the sukuk contract giving them a risk structure essentially the same as conventional bonds another observer salman ali found that many of the sukuk structures do not conform to the shariah according to ali while most of the sukuk make an effort to remain within shariah bounds they replicate conventional debt instruments they often combine more than one contract which individually may be shariahcompliant but when combined may defeat the objective of the shariah furthermore the sukuk rate of return is often tied to the libor london interbank offered rate or euribor euro interbank offered rate interest rate rather than to the underlying business that the sukuk is financing this makes the sukuk so similar to conventional debt instruments that it is difficult to tell one from the other ali believes this may be why rating agencies such as standard  poors and moodys apply the same methodology for rating sukuk as for conventional debt instruments in  safari conducted various statistical and econometrics tests to check the argument that sukuk securities are merely the same as conventional bond however his results on the comparison of yield to maturity of sukuk and that of conventional bonds show that sukuk securities are different from conventional bonds in response to this argument it was pointed out that yield to maturity reflects the interplay of supply and demand which may be affected by a financial products packaging and target market rather than just the substance of the product alone in  goldman sacks abandoned a  billion sukuk programme in had registered

rhyming known as rapping in huntsville alabama hip hopstyle graffiti spraypaint art showing stylized elaborate lettering and colourful cartoons hip hop is a subculture and art movement developed by africanamericans  puerto ricans  from the south bronx in new york city during the late s while people unfamiliar with hip hop culture often use the expression hip hop to refer exclusively to hip hop music also called rap hip hop is characterized by anywhere from four to nine distinct elements or expressive realms of which hip hop music is only one element dj afrika bambaataa of the hip hop collective zulu nation outlined the pillars of hip hop culture coining the terms rapping also called mcing or emceeing a rhythmic vocal rhyming style orality djing and turntablism which is making music with record players and dj mixers auralsound and music creation bboyingbgirlingbreakdancing movementdance and graffiti art which he called aerosol writin visual art other elements of the hip hop subculture and arts movement beyond the main four are hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement intellectualphilosophical beatboxing a percussive vocal style street entrepreneurship africanamerican language and slang and hip hop fashion and style among others the south bronx hiphop scene emerged in the s and s from neighbourhood block parties thrown by the ghetto brothers a puerto rican group that has been described as being a gang a club and a music group members of the scene plugged in the amplifiers for their instruments and pa speakers into the lampposts on rd street and prospect avenue and used their live music events to break down racial barriers between africanamericans puerto ricans and other ethnic groups jamaican immigrant dj kool herc also played a key role in developing hiphop music at  sedgwick avenue herc mixed samples of existing records and deejayed percussion breaks mixing this music with his own jamaicanstyle toasting a style of chanting and boastful talking over a microphone to rev up the crowd and dancers kool herc is credited as the father of hiphop for developing the key dj techniques that along with rapping founded the hip hop music style by creating rhythmic beats by looping breaks small portions of songs emphasizing a percussive pattern on two turntables this was later accompanied by rapping or mcing a rhythmic style of chanting or speaking poetrylyrics and beatboxing a percussive vocal technique used to create beats to go along with an mc or rappers rhymescitation needed an original form of dancing called breakdancing which later became accompanied by popping locking and other dance moves which was done to the accompaniment of hiphop songs played on boom boxes and particular styles of hiphop dress and hair also developed art historian robert farris thompson describes the youth from the south bronx in the earlys as englishspeaking blacks from barbados like grandmaster flash black jamaicans like dj kool herc who introduced the rhythms from salsa music as well as afro conga and bongo drums as well as many who emulated the sounds of tito puente and willie colón these youths mixed these influences with existing musical styles associated with africanamericans prior to the s from jazz to funk  hiphop music became popular outside of the africanamerican community in the lates with the mainstream commercial success of gangsta rap critic greg tate described the hip hop movement as the only avantgarde still around still delivering a shock of newness to the wealthy bourgeoisie ronald savage known by the nickname beestinger who was a former member of the zulu nation carved the term six elements of the hip hop movement the six elements of the hip hop movement are consciousness awareness civil rights awareness activism awareness justice political awareness and community awareness in music ronald savage is known as the son of the hip hop movement hip is the culture and hop is the movement hiphop culture has spread to both urban and suburban communities throughout the united states and subsequently the world these elements were adapted and developed considerably particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the s and subsequent decades even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms including hip hop theater and hip hop film the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hiphop culture hiphop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon the importance of sampling tracks beats and basslines from old records to the art form means that much of the culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings attitudes and experiences for modern audiences sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called flipping in hiphop culture hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier africanamericanrooted musical genres such as blues jazz ragtime funk and disco to become one of the most practiced genres worldwide in the s with the rise of new media platforms and web  fans discovered and downloaded or streamed hip hop music through

record turntable in england in  in the s an underground urban movement known as hip hop began to develop in the south bronx in new york city it focused on emceeing or mcing over breakbeats house parties and neighbourhood block party events held outdoors hip hop music has been a powerful medium for protesting the impact of legal institutions on minorities particularly police and prisons historically hip hop arose out of the ruins of a postindustrial and ravaged south bronx as a form of expression of urban black and latino youth whom the public and political discourse had written off as marginalized communities jamaicanborn dj clive kool herc cindy campbell pioneered the use of djing percussion breaks in hip hop music beginning at hercs home in a highrise apartment at  sedgwick avenue the movement later spread across the entire borough herc created the blueprint for hip hop music and culture by building upon the jamaican tradition of impromptu toasting a spoken type of boastful poetry and speech over music on august   dj kool herc was the dj at his sisters backtoschool party he extended the beat of a record by using two record players isolating the percussion breaks by using a mixer to switch between the two records hercs experiments with making music with record players became what we now know as breaking or scratching a second key musical element in hip hop music is emceeing also called mcing or rapping emceeing is the rhythmic spoken delivery of rhymes and wordplay delivered at first without accompaniment and later done over a beat this spoken style was influenced by the african american style of capping a performance where men tried to outdo each other in originality of their language and tried to gain the favor of the listeners the basic elements of hip hop—boasting raps rival posses groups uptown throwdowns and political and social commentary—were all long present in african american music mcing and rapping performers moved back and forth between the predominance of toasting songs packed with a mix of boasting slackness and sexual innuendo and a more topical political socially conscious style the role of the mc originally was as a master of ceremonies for a dj dance event the mc would introduce the dj and try to pump up the audience the mc spoke between the djs songs urging everyone to get up and dance mcs would also tell jokes and use their energetic language and enthusiasm to rev up the crowd eventually this introducing role developed into longer sessions of spoken rhythmic wordplay and rhyming which became rapping by  hip hop music had become a mainstream genre it spread across the world in the s with controversial gangsta rap herc also developed upon breakbeat deejaying where the breaks of funk songs—the part most suited to dance usually percussionbased—were isolated and repeated for the purpose of allnight dance parties this form of music playback using hard funk and rock formed the basis of hip hop music campbells announcements and exhortations to dancers would lead to the syncopated rhymed spoken accompaniment now known as rapping he dubbed his dancers breakboys and breakgirls or simply bboys and bgirls according to herc breaking was also street slang for getting excited and acting energetically dj kool herc is a pioneer in developing hip hop music djs such as grand wizzard theodore grandmaster flash and jazzy jay refined and developed the use of breakbeats including cutting and scratching the approach used by herc was soon widely copied and by the late s djs were releasing inch records where they would rap to the beat popular tunes included kurtis blows the breaks and the sugarhill gangs rappers delight herc and other djs would connect their equipment to power lines and perform at venues such as public basketball courts and at  sedgwick avenue bronx new york now officially a historic building the equipment consisted of numerous speakers turntables and one or more microphones by using this technique djs could create a variety of music but according to rap attack by david toop at its worst the technique could turn the night into one endless and inevitably boring

draw teenagers out of gang life drugs and violence the lyrical content of many early rap groups focused on social issues most notably in the seminal track the message by grandmaster flash and the furious five which discussed the realities of life in the housing projects young black americans coming out of the civil rights movement have used hip hop culture in the s and s to show the limitations of the movement hip hop gave young african americans a voice to let their issues be heard like rockandroll hip hop is vigorously opposed by conservatives because it romanticises violence

been at the forefront of the hip hop movement since its inception in the bronx nevertheless as gangsta rap became the dominant force in hip hop music there were many songs with misogynistic antiwomen lyrics and many music videos depicted women in a sexualized fashion the negation of female voice and perspective is an issue that has come to define mainstream hip hop music the recording industry is less willing to back female artists than their male counterparts and when it does back them often it places emphasis on their sexuality over their musical substance and artistic abilities since the turn of the century the beginning of the s decade female hip hop artists have struggled to get mainstream attention with only a few such as older artists like the female duo salt n pepa to more contemporary ones like lil kim and nicki minaj reaching platinum status sedit icet with the commercial success of gangsta rap in the early s the emphasis in lyrics shifted to drugs violence and misogyny early proponents of gangsta rap included groups and artists such as icet who recorded what some consider to be the first gangster rap record  n the mornin and nwa whose second album niggazlife became the first gangsta rap album to enter the charts at number one gangsta rap also played an important part in hip hop becoming a mainstream commodity that albums such as nwas straight outta compton eazyes eazyduzit and ice cubes amerikkkas most wanted were selling in such high numbers meant that black teens were no longer hip hops sole buying audience as a result gangsta rap became

genres hip hop culture has grown from the avoided genre to a genre that is followed by  million fans worldwide this was made possible by the adaptation of music in different locations and the

welcomed this is somewhat the case in jamaica the homeland of the cultures father dj kool herc however despite hip hop music produced on the island lacking widespread local and international recognition artists such as five steez have defied the odds by impressing online hip hop tastemakers and even reggae critics hartwig vens argues that hip hop can also be viewed as a global learning experience author jeff chang argues that the essence of hip hop is the cipher born in the bronx where competition and community feed each other he also adds thousands of organizers from cape town to paris use hip hop in their communities to address environmental justice policing and prisons media justice and education while hip hop music has been criticized as a music that creates a divide

rapper entrepreneur and executive jayz emphasizes his wealth in the early tomid s there was no established hip hop music industry as exists in the s with record labels record producers managers and artists and repertoire staff politicians and businesspeople maligned and ignored the hip hop movement most hip hop artists performed in their local communities and recorded in underground scenes however in the late s music industry executives realized that they could capitalize on the success of gangsta rap they made a formula that created a titillating buffet of hypermasculinity and glorified violence this type of rap was marketed to the new fanbase white males they ignored the depictions of a harsh reality to focus on the sex and violence involved in an article for the village voice greg tate argues that the commercialization of hip hop is a negative and pervasive phenomenon writing that what we call hiphop is now inseparable from what we call the hip hop industry in which the nouveau riche and the superrich employers get richer ironically this commercialization coincides with a decline in rap sales and pressure from critics of the genre even other musicians like nas and krsone have claimed hip hop is dead in that it has changed so much over the years to cater to the consumer that it has lost the essence for which it was originally created however in his book in search of africa manthia diawara states that hip hop is really a voice of people who are marginalized in modern society he argues that the worldwide spread of hip hop as a market revolution is actually global expression of poor peoples desire for the good life and that this struggle aligns with the nationalist struggle for citizenship and belonging but also reveals the need to go beyond such struggles and celebrate the redemption of the black individual through tradition the problem may not be that female rappers do not have the same opportunities and recognition as their male counterparts it may be that the music industry that is so defined by gender biases industry executives seem to bet on the idea that men won’t want to listen to female rappers so they are given fewer opportunities as the hip hop genre has changed since the s the africanamerican cultural tradition that diawara describes has little place in hip hops mainstream artists music the push toward materialism and market success by contemporary rappers such as rick ross lil wayne and jay z has irked older hip hop fans and artists they see the genre losing its communitybased feel that focused more on black empowerment than wealth the commercialization of the genre stripped it of its earlier political nature and the politics and marketing plans of major record labels have forced rappers to craft their music and images to appeal to white affluent and suburban audiences after realizing her friends were making music but not getting television exposure other than what was seen on video music box darlene lewis modellyricist along with darryl washington and dean carroll brought hip hop music to the first exposure cable show on paragon cable and then created the on broadway television show there rappers had opportunities be interviewed and have their music videos played this predated mtv or video soul on bet the commercialization has made hip hop less edgy and authentic but it also has enabled hip hop artists to become successful as top rappers grow wealthier and start more outside business ventures this can indicate a stronger sense of black aspiration as rappers such as jayz

record turntable at a turntablism competition in france in  djing and turntablism are the techniques of manipulating sounds and creating music and beats using two or more phonograph turntables or other sound sources such as tapes cds or digital audio files and a dj mixer that is plugged into a pa system one of the first few hip hop djs was kool dj herc who created hip hop in the s through the isolation and extending of breaks the parts of albums that focused solely on the percussive beat in addition to developing hercs techniques djs grandmaster flowers grandmaster flash grand wizzard theodore and grandmaster caz made further innovations with the introduction of scratching which has become one of the key sounds associated with hip hop music traditionally a dj will use two turntables simultaneously and mix between the two these are connected to a dj mixer an amplifier speakers and various electronic music equipment such as a microphone and effects units the dj mixes the two albums currently in rotation andor does scratching by moving one of the record platters while manipulating the crossfader on the mixer the result of mixing two records is a unique sound created by the seemingly combined sound of two separate songs into one song although there is considerable overlap between the two roles a dj is not the same as a record producer of a music track the development of djing was also influenced by new turntablism techniques such as beatmatching a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the technics sl mk  first sold in  which had a precise variable pitch control and a direct drive motor djs were often avid record collectors who would hunt through used record stores for obscure soul records and vintage funk recordings djs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences dj pete rock mixing with two turntables in the early years of hip hop the djs were the stars as they created new music and beats with their record players while djing and turntablism continue to be used in hip hop music in the s the star role has increasingly been taken by mcs since the late s due to innovative creative mcs such as kurtis blow and melle mel of grandmaster flashs crew the furious five who developed strong rapping skills however a number of djs have gained stardom nonetheless in recent years famous djs include

to spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics with a strong rhythmic accompaniment rapping typically features complex wordplay rapid delivery and a range of street slang some of which is unique to the hip hop subculture while rapping is often done over beats either done by a dj a beatboxer it can also be done without accompaniment it can be broken down into different components such as content flow rhythm and rhyme and delivery rapping is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to the beat of the music the use of the word rap to describe quick and slangy speech or witty repartee long predates the musical form mcing is a form of expression that is embedded within ancient african culture and oral tradition as throughout history verbal acrobatics or jousting involving rhymes were common within the afroamerican community graffitiedit an aerosol paint can a common tool used in modern graffiti graffiti is the most controversial of hip hops elements as a number of the most notable graffiti pioneers say that they do not consider graffiti to be an element of hip hop including lady pink seen blade fargo cholly rock fuzz one and coco  lady pink says i don’t think graffiti is hiphop frankly i grew up with disco music theres a long background of graffiti as an entity unto itself and fargo says there is no correlation between hip hop and graffiti one has nothing to do with the other hip hop pioneer grandmaster flash has also questioned the connection between hip hop and graffiti saying you know what bugs me they put hip hop with graffiti how do they intertwine in america in the late s graffiti was used as a form of expression by political activists gangs such as the savage skulls la familia and savage nomads used graffiti to mark territory julio  was a puerto rican graffiti writer one of the first graffiti writers in new york city he was a member of the savage skulls gang and started writing his nickname in his neighborhood as early as  in  the new york times published an article taki  spawns pen pals about another graffiti writer with similar form taki  according to the article julio had been writing for a couple of years when taki began tagging his own name all around the city taki also states in the article that julio was busted and stopped writers following in the wake of taki and tracy  would add their street number to their nickname bomb cover a train with their work and let the subway take it—and their fame if it was impressive or simply pervasive enough—all city julio  never rose to takis fame because julio kept his tags localized to his own neighborhood phase  is an influential graffiti artist who began painting in the s one of the most common forms of graffiti is tagging or the act of stylizing your unique name or logo tagging began in philadelphia and new york city and has expanded worldwide although tagging is considered as vandalism by law enforcement it is hip hops visual art and the tags are part of a complex symbol system with its own social codes and subculture rules bubble lettering held sway initially among writers from the bronx though the elaborate brooklyn style tracy  dubbed wildstyle would come to define the art the early trendsetters were joined in the s by artists like dondi futura  daze blade lee fab five freddy zephyr rammellzee crash kel noc  and lady pink the relationship between graffiti and hip hop culture arises both from early graffiti artists engaging in other aspects of hip hop culture graffiti is understood as a visual expression of rap music just as breaking is viewed as a physical expression the  film wild style is widely regarded as the first hip hop motion picture which featured prominent figures within the new york graffiti scene during the said period the book subway art and the documentary style wars were also among the first ways the mainstream public were introduced to hip hop graffiti graffiti remains part of hip hop while crossing into the mainstream

dancer and displaying tongueincheek bravado breaking also called bboyingbgirling or breakdancing is a dynamic rhythmic style of dance which developed as one of the major elements of hip hop culture like many aspects of hip hop culture breakdance borrows heavily from many cultures including sera street dancing brazilian and asian martial arts russian folk dance and the dance moves of james brown michael jackson and california funk breaking took form in the south bronx in the s alongside the other elements of hip hop breakdancing is typically done with the accompaniment of hip hop music playing on a boom box or pa system according to the  documentary film the freshest kids a history of the bboy dj kool herc describes the b in bboy as short for breaking which at the time was slang for going off also one of the original names for the dance however early on the dance was known as the boing the sound a spring makes dancers at dj kool hercs parties saved their best dance moves for the percussion break section of the song getting in front of the audience to dance in a distinctive frenetic style the b in bboy or bgirl also stands simply for break as in breakboy or girl before the s bgirls’ presence was limited by their gender minority status navigating sexual politics of a masculinedominated scene and a lack of representation or encouragement for women to participate in the form the few bgirls who participated despite facing gender discrimination carved out a space for women as leaders within the breaking community and the number of bgirls participating has increased breaking was documented in style wars and was later given more focus in fictional films such as wild style and beat street early acts include the rock steady crew and new york city breakerscitation needed beatboxingedit biz markie is noted for his beatboxing skills he is holding the mic close to his mouth a technique beatboxers use to imitate deep basslines and bass drums by exploiting the proximity effect beatboxing is the technique of vocal percussion in which a singer imitates drums and other percussion instruments with her or his voice it is primarily concerned with the art of creating beats or rhythms using the human mouth the term beatboxing is derived from the mimicry of the first generation of drum machines then known as beatboxes it was first popularized by doug e fresh as it is a way of creating hip hop music it can be categorized under the production element of hip hop though it does sometimes include a type of rapping intersected with the humancreated beat it is generally considered to be part of the same pillar of hip hop as djing—in other words providing a musical backdrop or foundation for mcs to rap over beatboxers can create their beats just naturally but many of the beatboxing effects are enhanced by using a microphone plugged into a pa system this helps the beatboxer to make their beatboxing loud enough to be heard alongside a rapper mc turntablist and other hip hop artists beatboxing was popular in the s with prominent artists like the darren buffy the human beat box robinson of the fat boys and biz markie displaying their skills within the media it declined in popularity along with bboying in the late s but has undergone a resurgence since the late s marked by the release of make the music  by rahzel of the roots beatmakingproducingedit a typical rap drum beat written in drum notation although it is not described as one of the four core elements that make up hip hop music producing is another important element in music record producers play a similar role in sound recording that film directors play in making a movie the record producer recruits and selects artists rappers mcs djs beatboxers and so on plans the vision for the recording session coaches the performers on their songs chooses audio engineers sets out a budget for hiring the artists and technical experts and oversees the entire project the exact roles of a producer depend on each individual but some producers work with djs and drum machine programmers to create beats coach the djs in the selection of sampled basslines riffs and catch phrases give advice to rappers vocalists mcs and other artists give suggestions to performers on how to improve their flow and develop a unique personal style some producers work closely with the audio engineer to provide ideas on mixing effects units eg autotuned vocal effects such as those popularized by tpain micing of artists and so on the producer may independently develop the concept or vision for a project or album or develop the vision in collaboration with the artists and performers hip hop producer chilly chill behind a large audio console in a recording studio in hip hop since the beginning of mcing there have been producers who work in the studio behind the scenes to create the beats for mcs to rap over producers may find a beat they like on an old funk soul or disco record and then isolate the beat and turn it into a loop alternatively producers may create a beat with a drum machine or by hiring a drumkit percussionist to play acoustic drums the producer could even mix and layer different methods such as combining a sampled disco drum break with a drum machine track and some live newly recorded percussion parts or a live electric bass player a beat created by a hip hop producer may include other parts besides a drum beat such as a sampled bassline from a funk or disco song dialogue from a spoken word record or movie or rhythmic scratching and punches done by a turntablist or dj an early beatmaker was producer kurtis blow who won producer of the year credits in   and  known for the creation of sample and sample loops blow was considered the quincy jones of early hip hop a reference to the prolific african american record producer conductor arranger composer musician and bandleader those who create these beats are known as either beatmakers or producers however producers are known to have more input and direction on the overall the creation of a song or project while a beatmaker just provides or creates the beat as dr dre has said before once you finish the beat you have to produce the record the process of making beats includes sampling chopping looping sequencing beats recording mixing and mastering sam bos rap with computer gear in the studio most beats in hip hop are sampled from a preexisting record this means that a producer will take a portion or a sample of a song and reuse it as an instrumental section beat or portion of their song some examples of this are the isley brothers footsteps in the dark pts  and  being sampled to make ice cubes today was a good day another example is otis reddings try a little tenderness being sampled to create kanye west and jayzs otis chopping is dissecting the song that you are sampling so that you chop out the part or parts of the song be that the bassline rhythm guitar part drum break or other music you want to use in the beat looping is known as melodic or percussive sequence that repeats itself over a period of time so basically a producer will make an evennumber of bars of a beat eg four bars or eight bars repeat itself or loop of a full song length this loop provides an accompaniment for an mc to rap over while hip hop music makes a significant use of sampling old records using turntables and drum machines to create beats producers use electric and acoustic instruments on some songs pictured is an electric bass player at a hip hop show the tools needed to make beats in the late s were funk soul and other music genre records record turntables dj mixers audio consoles and relatively inexpensive portastudiostyle multitrack recording devices in the s and s beatmakers and producers used the new electronic and digital instruments that were developed suchas samplers sequencers drum machines and synthesizers from the s to the s various beatmakers and producers have used live instruments such as drum kit or electric bass on some tracks to record the finished beats or beat tracks beatmakers and producers use a variety of sound recording equipment typically multitrack recorders digital audio workstations also known as daws became more common in the s for producers some of the most used daws are fruity loops studio ableton live and pro tools daws have made it possible for more people to be able to make beats in their own home studio without going to a recording studio beatmakers who own daws do not have to buy all the hardware that a recording studio needed in the s huge  channel audio consoles multitrack recorders racks of rackmount effects units because era daws have everything they need to make beats on a good quality fast laptop computer beats are such an integral part of rap music that many producers have been able to make instrumental mixtapes or albums even though these instrumentals have no rapping listeners still enjoy the inventive ways the producer mixes different beats samples and instrumental melodies examples of these are th wonders tutenkhamen and j dillas donuts some hip hop records come in two versions a beat with rapping over it and an instrumental with just the beat the instrumental in this case is provided so that djs and turntablists can isolate breaks beats and other music to create new songs social impactedit effectsedit a bboy performing in san francisco hiphop has made a considerable social impact since its inception in the s hiphop has also become relevant to the field of education because of its implications for understanding language learning identity and curriculum orlando patterson a sociology professor at harvard university helps describe the phenomenon of how hiphop has spread rapidly around the world patterson argues that mass communication is controlled by the wealthy the government and major businesses in third world nations and countries around the world he also credits mass communication with creating a global cultural hiphop scene as a result the youth are influenced by the american hiphop scene and start their own forms of hiphop patterson believes that revitalization of hiphop music will occur around the world as traditional values are mixed with american hiphop music and ultimately a global exchange process will develop that brings youth around the world to listen to a common musical form of hiphop it has also been argued that rap music formed as a cultural response to historic oppression and racism a system for communication among black communities throughout the united states this is due to the fact that the culture reflected the social economic and political realities of the disenfranchised youth in the s hiphop lyrics are starting to reflect original socially conscious themes rappers are starting to question the governments power and its oppressive role in some societies rap music has been a tool for political social and cultural empowerment outside the united states members of minority communities—such as algerians in france and turks in germany—use rap as a platform to protest racism poverty and social structures

patterned cockney slang and radio deejays hyping their audience using rhymes hip hop has a distinctive associated slang it is also known by alternate names such as black english or ebonics academics suggest its development stems from a rejection of the racial hierarchy of language which held white english as the superior form of educated speech due to hiphops commercial success in the lates and early s many of these words have been assimilated into the cultural discourse of several different dialects across america and the world and even to nonhip hop fans the word diss for example is particularly prolific there are also a number of words which predate hip hop but are often associated with the culture with homie being a notable example sometimes terms like what the dilly yo are popularized by a single song in this case put your hands where my eyes could see by busta rhymes and are only used briefly one particular example is the rulebased slang of snoop dogg and e who add izzle or izz to the end or middle of words hip hop lyricism has gained a measure of legitimacy in academic and literary circles studies of hip hop linguistics are now offered at institutions such as the university of toronto where poet and author george eliot clarke has taught the potential power of hip hop music to promote social change greg thomas of the university of miami offers courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level studying the feminist and assertive nature of lil kims lyrics some academics including ernest morrell and jeffrey duncanandrade compare hip hop to the satirical works of great western canon poets of the modern era who use imagery and create a mood to criticize society as quoted in their work promoting academic literacy with urban youth through engaging hip hop culture “ hip hop texts are rich in imagery and metaphor and can be used to teach irony tone diction and point of view hip hop texts can be analyzed for theme motif plot and character development both grand master flash and ts eliot gazed out into their rapidly deteriorating societies and saw a wasteland both poets were essentially apocalyptic in nature as they witnessed death disease and decay ” hip hop lyrics have also been known for containing swear words in particular the word bitch is seen in countless songs from a bitch iz a bitch by nwa to missy elliotts she is a bitch it is often used in the negative connotation of a woman who is a shallow money grubber some female artists have tried to reclaim the word and use it as a term of empowerment regardless the hiphop community has recently taken an interest in discussing the use of the word bitch and whether it is necessary in rap not only the particular words but also the choice of which language in which rap is widely debated topic in international hip hop in canada the use of nonstandard variants of french such as franglais a mix of french and english by groups such as dead obies or chiac such as

has been censored on radio and television due to the explicit lyrics of certain genres many songs have been criticized for antiestablishment and sometimes violent messages the use of profanity as well as graphic depictions of violence and sex in hiphop music videos and songs makes it hard to broadcast on television stations such as mtv in music video form and on radio as a result many hiphop recordings are broadcast in censored format with offensive language bleeped or blanked out of the soundtrack or replaced with clean lyrics the result – which sometimes renders the remaining lyrics unintelligible or contradictory to the original recording – has become almost as widely identified with the genre as any other aspect of the music and has been parodied in films such as austin powers

times  gangsta rap is a subgenre of hip hop that reflects the violent culture of innercity american black youths the genre was pioneered in the mids by rappers such as schoolly d and icet and was popularized in the later part of the s by groups such as nwa icet released  in the mornin which is often regarded as the first gangsta rap song in  after the national attention that icet and nwa created in the lates and earlys gangsta rap became the most commercially lucrative subgenre of hiphop nwa is the group most frequently associated with the founding of gangsta rap their lyrics were

album body count the song was intended to speak from the viewpoint of a criminal getting revenge on racist brutal cops icets rock song infuriated government officials the national rifle association and various police advocacy groups consequently time warner music refused to release icets upcoming album home invasion because of the controversy surrounding cop killer icet suggested that the furor over the song was an overreaction telling journalist chuck philips theyve done movies about nurse killers and teacher killers and student killers actor arnold schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the terminator but i dont hear anybody complaining about that icet suggested to philips that the misunderstanding of cop killer and the attempts to censor it had racial overtones the supreme court says its ok for a white man to burn a cross in public but nobody wants a black man to write a record about a cop killer the white house administrations of both us presidents george h w bush and bill clinton criticized the genre the reason why rap is under attack is because it exposes all the contradictions of american culture what started out as an underground art form has become a vehicle to expose a lot of critical issues that are not usually discussed in american politics the problem here is that the white house and wannabes like bill clinton represent a political system that never

time kwaito is a music that came from a once hated and oppressed people but it is now sweeping the nation the main consumers of kwaito are adolescents and half of the south african population is under

very basic tools and even graffiti an important aspect of the hip hop culture is constrained due to its unavailability to the average person hip hop has begun making inroads with more than black artists there are number of other minority artists who are taking center stage as many first generation minority children come of age one example is rapper awkwafina an asianamerican who raps about being asian as well as being female she like many others use rap to express her experiences as a minority not necessarily to unite minorities together but to tell her story many hip hop artists that make it out of the developing world come to places like the united states in hopes of improving their situations maya arulpragasm aka mia is a sri lankaborn tamil hip hop artist in this situation she

build a relationship with atrisk youth and develop a deeper connection with the child hiphop has the potential to be taught as a way of helping people see the world more critically be it through forms of writing creating music or social activism the lyrics of hip hop have been used to learn about literary devices such as metaphor imagery irony tone theme motif plot and point of view organizations and facilities are providing spaces and programs for communities to explore making and learning about hiphop an example is the imp labs in regina saskatchewan canada many dance studios and colleges now offer lessons in hip hop alongside tap and ballet as well as krsone teaching hip hop lectures at harvard university hip hop producer th wonder and former rapperturned actor christopher play martin

university library established a hip hop collection to collect and make accessible the historical artifacts of hip hop culture and to ensure their preservation for future generations values and philosophyedit in hip hop culture it is considered essential to keep it real or to be authentic to the lived experiences of people from disadvantaged neighborhoods the ghetto despite the fact that hip hop artists typically use imagined scenarios and fictionalized stories in their raps the culture demands that they act as if all their lyrics are true or potentially true because of this lyrics of rap songs have often been treated as confessions to a number of violent crimes in the united states it is also considered to be the duty of rappers and other hip hop artists djs dancers to represent their city and neighborhood this demands being proud of being from disadvantaged cities neighborhoods that have traditionally been a source of shame and glorifying them in lyrics and graffiti this has potentially been one of the ways that hip hop has become regarded as a local rather than foreign genre of music in so many countries around the world in just a few decades nevertheless sampling and borrowing from a number of genres and places is also a part of the hip hop milieu and an album like the surprise hit kala by anglotamil rapper mia was recorded in locations all across the world and features sounds from a different country on every track authenticityedit graffiti depicting us rapper  cent larry nager of the cincinnati enquirer wrote that  cent has earned the right to use the trappings of gangsta rap – the macho posturing the guns the drugs the big cars and magnums of champagne hes not a poseur pretending to be a gangsta hes the real thing hip hop music artists and advocates have stated that hip hop has been an authentic true and real africanamerican artistic form and expressive cultural form since its emergence in innercity bronx neighborhoods in the s as well some music critics scholars and political commentators have denied hip hops authenticity advocates who claim hip hop is an authentic music genre state that it is an ongoing response to the violence and discrimination experienced by black people in the united states from the slavery that existed into the th century to the lynchings of the th century and the ongoing racial discrimination faced by blacks paul gilroy and alexander weheliye state that unlike disco jazz rb house music and other genres that were developed in the africanamerican community and which were quickly adopted and then increasingly controlled by white music industry executives hip hop has remained largely controlled by african american artists producers and executives in his book phonographies weheliye describes the political and cultural affiliations that hip hop music enables in contrast greg tate states that the marketdriven commodity form of commercial hip hop has uprooted the genre from the celebration of africanamerican culture and the messages of protest that predominated in its early forms tate states that the commodification and commercialization of hip hop culture undermines the dynamism of the genre for africanamerican communities these two dissenting understandings of hip hops scope and influence frame debates that revolve around hip hops possession of or lack of authenticity anticipating the market arguments of tate and others both gilroy and weheliye assert that hip hop has always had a different function than western popular music as a whole a function that exceeds the constraints of market capitalism weheliye notes popular music generally in the form of recordings has and still continues to function as one of the main channels of communication between the different geographical and cultural points in the african diaspora allowing artists to articulate and perform their diasporic citizenship to international audiences and establish conversations with other diasporic communities for paul gilroy hip hop proves an outlet of articulation and a sonic space in which african americans can exert control and influence that they often lack in other sociopolitical and economic domains in phonographies weheyliye explains how new sound technologies used in hip hop encourage diasporic citizenship and africanamerican cultural and political activities gilroy states that the power of hip hop music lies in developing black struggles by communicating information organizing consciousness and testing out or deployingindividual or collective forms of africanamerican cultural and political actions in the third chapter of the black atlantic jewels brought from bondage black music and the politics of authenticity gilroy asserts that these elements influence the production of and the interpretation of black cultural activities what gilroy calls the black atlantic musics rituals and traditions are a more expansive way of thinking about africanamerican blackness a way that moves beyond contemporary debates around essentialist and antiessentialist arguments as such gilroy states that music has been and remains a central staging ground for debates over the work responsibility and future role of black cultural and artistic productionh traditional hip hop vs progressive viewsedit ever since the overcommercialization of hiphop occurred between the late s and the mid s at peak traditional hip hop supporters have been in a feud with more progressive hip hop fans claiming that they are uneducated towards what they are building and that it they are not only building music that steps further and further away from hip hop but causes ignorance and misconceptions between fans of more progressed hip hop and traditional fans of the hip hop culture these views have been narrowed heavily over the past couple of years and have experienced change of views from the traditional side as well as acceptance towards evolution of hip hop however all of these beliefs seem to still be viewed under very specific sets of morals and ethics such as that one does not take themselves away or deny the true past of hiphop doing such would result in ignorance of the history of hip hop and a completely disconnected community of fans who become uncertain as to what truly should be considered hip hop fans of more progressed hip hop have received both acclaim due to innovation and futuristic views as well as strong criticism due to lack of proper education and what is felt as a completely changed form of values rather than evolved like most grassroots cultures hip hop initially rejected the views and support of the mainstream industry however eventually learned to be content due to the understanding of what opportunity and voice could be given the father of hip hop dj kool herc recently criticized the cancelled netflix series the get down due to its lack of viewer response by calling it the let down and that legendary hip hop dj grandmaster flash is grandmaster trash herc criticized the whole production for their misrepresentations of history and culture however he did state that he does support many stars in rap today such as lil wayne and drake who clearly do not support hip hop in anyway traditional herc and many other old school hip hop legends such as afrika bambaataa and grandmaster caz originally held views against mainstream rap however recent interviews have shown to prove that even they have changed their ways to a certain extent however rappers like krsone still feel a strong disapproval of the rap industry especially through mainstream media in bboying most supporters have began to slowly involve more industry sponsorship through events on the world bboy series and through the udef powered by silverback open other bboys have began to accept using the term breakdance but only if the term bboying is too difficult to communicate to the general public regardless of such bboys and bgirls still exist to showing lack of support to jams and events that they feel represent the culture as a sport form of entertainment and as well through capitalism battle rap as an industry has also been strongly supported by oldschool goldenera legends such as herc kid capri and krsone  receptionedit commercialization and stereotypingedit in  hip hop and rap pioneer chuck d from the group public enemy criticized young hip

hop brings young black people down though his criticism is focused mainly on crime and violenceglorifying gangsta rap and it ignores other rap genres that empower black youth hip hop has been criticized by rockcentric critics who state that hip hop is not a true art form and who state that rock and roll music is more authentic these critics are advocating a viewpoint called rockism which

elliott and mc lyte have made great strides since the hip hop industry first began by producing music and an image that did not cater to the hypersexualized stereotypes of black women in hip hop these women pioneered a revitalized and empowering image of black women in hip hop though many hip hop artists have embraced the ideals that effectively disenfranchise black female artists many others choose to employ forms of resistance that counteract these negative portrayals of women in hip hop and offer a different narrative these artists seek to expand ways of traditional thinking through different ways of cultural expression in this effort they hope to elicit a response to female hip hop artists not with a misogynist lens but with one that validates womens struggle while women have

people unfamiliar with hip hop culture often use the expression hip hop to refer exclusively to hip hop music also called rap hip hop is characterized by anywhere from four to nine distinct elements or expressive realms of which hip hop music is only one element dj afrika bambaataa of the hip hop collective zulu nation outlined the pillars of hip hop culture coining the terms rapping also called mcing or emceeing a rhythmic vocal rhyming style orality djing and turntablism which is making music with record players and dj mixers auralsound and music creation bboyingbgirlingbreakdancing movementdance and graffiti art which he called aerosol writin visual art other elements of the hip hop subculture and arts movement beyond the main four are hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement intellectualphilosophical beatboxing a percussive vocal style street entrepreneurship africanamerican language and slang and hip hop fashion and style among others the south bronx hiphop scene emerged in the s and s from neighbourhood block parties thrown by the ghetto brothers a puerto rican group that has been described as being a gang a club and a music group members of the scene plugged in the amplifiers for their instruments and pa speakers into the lampposts on rd street and prospect avenue and used their live music events to break down racial barriers between africanamericans puerto ricans and other ethnic groups jamaican immigrant dj kool herc also played a key role in developing hiphop music at  sedgwick avenue herc mixed samples of existing records and deejayed percussion breaks mixing this music with his own jamaicanstyle toasting a style of chanting and boastful talking over a microphone to rev up the crowd and dancers kool herc is credited as the father of hiphop for developing the key dj techniques that along with rapping founded the hip hop music style by creating rhythmic beats by looping breaks small portions of songs emphasizing a percussive pattern on two turntables this was later accompanied by rapping or mcing a rhythmic style of chanting or speaking poetrylyrics and beatboxing a percussive vocal technique used to create beats to go along with an mc or rappers rhymescitation needed an original form of dancing called breakdancing which later became accompanied by popping locking and other dance moves which was done to the accompaniment of hiphop songs played on boom boxes and particular styles of hiphop dress and hair also developed art historian robert farris thompson describes the youth from the south bronx in the earlys as englishspeaking blacks from barbados like grandmaster flash black jamaicans like dj kool herc who introduced the rhythms from salsa music as well as afro conga and bongo drums as well as many who emulated the sounds of tito puente and willie colón these youths mixed these influences with existing musical styles associated with africanamericans prior to the s from jazz to funk  hiphop music became popular outside of the africanamerican community in the lates with the mainstream commercial success of gangsta rap critic greg tate described the hip hop movement as the only avantgarde still around still delivering a shock of newness to the wealthy bourgeoisie ronald savage known by the nickname beestinger who was a former member of the zulu nation carved the term six elements of the hip hop movement the six elements of the hip hop movement are consciousness awareness civil rights awareness activism awareness justice political awareness and community awareness in music ronald savage is known as the son of the hip hop movement hip is the culture and hop is the movement hiphop culture has spread to both urban and suburban communities throughout the united states and subsequently the world these elements were adapted and developed considerably particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the s and subsequent decades even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms including hip hop theater and hip hop film the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hiphop culture hiphop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon the importance of sampling tracks beats and basslines from old records to the art form means that much of the culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings attitudes and experiences for modern audiences sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called flipping in hiphop culture hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier africanamericanrooted musical genres such as blues jazz ragtime funk and disco to become one of the most practiced genres worldwide in the s with the rise of new media platforms and web  fans discovered and downloaded or streamed hip hop music through social networking sites sns beginning with myspace as well as from websites like youtube

etymologyedit keith cowboy wiggins a member of grandmaster flash and the furious five has been credited with coining the term in  while teasing a friend who had just joined the us army by scat singing the madeup words hiphophiphop in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of marching soldiers cowboy later worked the hip hop cadence into his stage performance the group frequently performed with disco artists who would refer to this new type of music by calling them hip hoppers the name was originally meant as a sign of disrespect but soon came to identify this new music and culture the song rappers delight by the sugarhill gang released in  begins with the phrase i said a hip hop the hippie the hippie to the hip hip hop and you dont stop lovebug starski a bronx dj who put out a single called the positive life in  and dj hollywood then began using the term when referring to this new disco rap music bill alder an independent consultant once said there was hardly ever a moment when rap music was underground one of the very first socalled rap records was a monster hit rappers delight by the sugar hill gang on sugarhill records hip hop pioneer and south bronx community leader afrika bambaataa also credits lovebug starski as the first to use the term hip hop as it relates to the culture bambaataa former leader of the black spades gang also did much to further popularize the term the words hip hop first appeared in print on september   in the village voice in a profile of bambaataa written by steven hager who also published the first comprehensive history of the culture with st martins press historyedit sedit dj jazzy jeff who is also a record producer manipulating a record turntable in england in  in the s an underground urban movement known as hip hop began to develop in the south bronx in new york city it focused on emceeing or mcing over breakbeats house parties and neighbourhood block party events held outdoors hip hop music has been a powerful medium for protesting the impact of legal institutions on minorities particularly police and prisons historically hip hop arose out of the ruins of a postindustrial and ravaged south bronx as a form of expression of urban black and latino youth whom the public and political discourse had written off as marginalized communities jamaicanborn dj clive kool herc cindy campbell pioneered the use of djing percussion breaks in hip hop music beginning at hercs home in a highrise apartment at  sedgwick avenue the movement later spread across the entire borough herc created the blueprint for hip hop music and culture by building upon the jamaican tradition of impromptu toasting a spoken type of boastful poetry and speech over music on august   dj kool herc was the dj at his sisters backtoschool party he extended the beat of a record by using two record players isolating the percussion breaks by using a mixer to switch between the two records hercs experiments with making music with record players became what we now know as breaking or scratching a second key musical element in hip hop music is emceeing also called mcing or rapping emceeing is the rhythmic spoken delivery of rhymes and wordplay delivered at first without accompaniment and later done over a beat this spoken style was influenced by the african american style of capping a performance where men tried to outdo each other in originality of their language and tried to gain the favor of the listeners the basic elements of hip hop—boasting raps rival posses groups uptown throwdowns and political and social commentary—were all long present in african american music mcing and rapping performers moved back and forth between the predominance of toasting songs packed with a mix of boasting slackness and sexual innuendo and a more topical political socially conscious style the role of the mc originally was as a master of ceremonies for a dj dance event the mc would introduce the dj and try to pump up the audience the mc spoke between the djs songs urging everyone to get up and dance mcs would also tell jokes and use their energetic language and enthusiasm to rev up the crowd eventually this introducing role developed into longer sessions of spoken rhythmic wordplay and rhyming which became rapping by  hip hop music had become a mainstream genre it spread across the world in the s with controversial gangsta rap herc also developed upon breakbeat deejaying where the breaks of funk songs—the part most suited to dance usually percussionbased—were isolated and repeated for the purpose of allnight dance parties

many songs with misogynistic antiwomen lyrics and many music videos depicted women in a sexualized fashion the negation of female voice and perspective is an issue that has come to define mainstream hip hop music the recording industry is less willing to back female artists than their male counterparts and when it does back them often it places emphasis on their sexuality over their musical substance and artistic abilities since the turn of the century the beginning of the s decade female hip hop artists have struggled to get mainstream attention with only a few such as older artists

albums such as nwas straight outta compton eazyes eazyduzit and ice cubes amerikkkas most wanted were selling in such high numbers meant that black teens were no longer hip hops sole buying audience as a result gangsta rap became a platform for artists who chose to use their music to spread political and social messages to parts of the country that were previously unaware of the conditions of

hops messages allow the underprivileged and the mistreated to be heard these cultural translations cross borders while the music may be from a foreign country the message is something that many people

producers managers and artists and repertoire staff politicians and businesspeople maligned and ignored the hip hop movement most hip hop artists performed in their local communities and recorded in underground scenes however in the late s music industry executives realized that they could capitalize on the success of gangsta rap they made a formula that created a titillating buffet of hypermasculinity and glorified violence this type of rap was marketed to the new fanbase white males they ignored the depictions of a harsh reality to focus on the sex and violence involved in an article for the village voice greg tate argues that the commercialization of hip hop is a negative and pervasive phenomenon writing that what we call hiphop is now inseparable from what we call the hip hop industry in which the nouveau riche and the superrich employers get richer ironically this commercialization coincides with a decline in rap sales and pressure from critics of the genre even other musicians like nas and krsone have claimed hip hop is dead in that it has changed so much over the years to cater to the consumer that it has lost the essence for which it was originally created however in his book in search of africa manthia diawara states that hip hop is really a voice of people who are marginalized in modern society he argues that the worldwide spread of hip hop as a market revolution is actually global expression of poor peoples desire for the good life and that this struggle aligns with the nationalist struggle for citizenship and belonging but also reveals the need to go beyond such struggles and celebrate the redemption of the black individual through tradition the problem may not be that female rappers do not have the same opportunities and recognition as their male counterparts it may be that the music industry that is so defined by gender biases industry executives seem to bet on the idea that men won’t want to listen to female rappers so they are given fewer opportunities as the hip hop genre has changed since the s the africanamerican cultural tradition that diawara describes has little place in hip hops mainstream artists music the push toward materialism and market success by contemporary rappers such as rick ross lil wayne and jay z has irked older hip hop fans and artists they see the genre losing its communitybased feel that focused more on black empowerment than wealth the commercialization of the genre stripped it of its earlier political nature and the politics and marketing plans of major record labels have forced

television show there rappers had opportunities be interviewed and have their music videos played this predated mtv or video soul on bet the commercialization has made hip hop less edgy and authentic but it also has enabled hip hop artists to become successful as top rappers grow wealthier and start more outside business ventures this can indicate a stronger sense of black aspiration as rappers such as jayz and kanye west establish themselves as artists and entrepreneurs more young black people have hopes of achieving their goals the lens through which one views the genres commercialization

record turntable at a turntablism competition in france in  djing and turntablism are the techniques of manipulating sounds and creating music and beats using two or more phonograph turntables or other sound sources such as tapes cds or digital audio files and a dj mixer that is plugged into a pa system one of the first few hip hop djs was kool dj herc who created hip hop in the s through the isolation and extending of breaks the parts of albums that focused solely on the percussive beat in addition to developing hercs techniques djs grandmaster flowers grandmaster flash grand wizzard theodore and grandmaster caz made further innovations with the introduction of scratching which has become one of the key sounds associated with hip hop music traditionally a dj will use two turntables simultaneously and mix between the two these are connected to a dj mixer an amplifier speakers and various electronic music equipment such as a microphone and effects units the dj mixes the two albums currently in rotation andor does scratching by moving one of the record platters while manipulating the crossfader on the mixer the result of mixing two records is a unique sound created by the seemingly combined sound of two separate songs into one song although there is considerable overlap between the two roles a dj is not the same as a record producer of a music track the development of djing was also influenced by new turntablism techniques such as beatmatching a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the technics sl mk  first sold in  which had a precise variable pitch control and a direct drive motor djs were often avid record collectors who would hunt through used record stores for obscure soul records and vintage funk recordings djs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences dj pete rock mixing with two turntables in the early years of hip hop the djs were the stars as they created new music and beats with their record players while djing and turntablism continue to be used in hip hop music in the s the star role has increasingly been taken by mcs since the late s due to innovative creative mcs such as kurtis blow and melle mel of grandmaster flashs crew the furious five who developed strong rapping skills however a number of djs have gained stardom nonetheless in recent years famous djs include

subculture while rapping is often done over beats either done by a dj a beatboxer it can also be done without accompaniment it can be broken down into different components such as content flow rhythm and rhyme and delivery rapping is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to the beat of the music the use of the word rap to describe quick and slangy speech or witty

come to define the art the early trendsetters were joined in the s by artists like dondi futura  daze blade lee fab five freddy zephyr rammellzee crash kel noc  and lady pink the relationship between graffiti and hip hop culture arises both from early graffiti artists engaging in other aspects of hip hop culture graffiti is understood as a visual expression of rap music just as breaking is viewed as a physical expression the  film wild style is widely regarded as the first hip hop motion picture which featured prominent figures within the new york graffiti scene during the said period the book subway art and the documentary style wars were also among the first ways the mainstream public were introduced to hip hop graffiti graffiti remains part of hip hop while crossing into the mainstream

dancer and displaying tongueincheek bravado breaking also called bboyingbgirling or breakdancing is a dynamic rhythmic style of dance which developed as one of the major elements of hip hop culture like many aspects of hip hop culture breakdance borrows heavily from many cultures including sera street dancing brazilian and asian martial arts russian folk dance and the dance moves of james brown michael jackson and california funk breaking took form in the south bronx in the s alongside the other elements of hip hop breakdancing is typically done with the accompaniment of hip hop music playing on a boom box or pa system according to the  documentary film the freshest kids a history of the bboy dj kool herc describes the b in bboy as short for breaking which at the time was slang for going off also one of the original names for the dance however early on the dance was known as the boing the sound a spring makes dancers at dj kool hercs parties saved their best dance moves for the percussion break section of the song getting in front of the audience to dance in a distinctive frenetic style the b in bboy or bgirl also stands simply for break as in breakboy or girl before the s bgirls’ presence was limited by their gender minority status navigating sexual politics of a masculinedominated scene and a lack of representation or encouragement for women to participate in the form the few bgirls who participated despite facing gender discrimination carved out a space for women as leaders within the breaking community and the number of bgirls participating has increased breaking

effect beatboxing is the technique of vocal percussion in which a singer imitates drums and other percussion instruments with her or his voice it is primarily concerned with the art of creating beats or rhythms using the human mouth the term beatboxing is derived from the mimicry of the first generation of drum machines then known as beatboxes it was first popularized by doug e fresh as it is a way of creating hip hop music it can be categorized under the production element of hip hop though it does sometimes include a type of rapping intersected with the humancreated beat it is generally considered to be part of the same pillar of hip hop as djing—in other words providing a musical backdrop or foundation for mcs to rap over beatboxers can create their beats just naturally but many of the beatboxing effects are enhanced by using a microphone plugged into a pa system this helps the beatboxer to make their beatboxing loud enough to be heard alongside a rapper mc turntablist and other hip hop artists beatboxing was popular in the s with prominent artists like the darren buffy the human beat box robinson of the fat boys and biz markie displaying their skills within the media it

typical rap drum beat written in drum notation although it is not described as one of the four core elements that make up hip hop music producing is another important element in music record producers play a similar role in sound recording that film directors play in making a movie the record producer recruits and selects artists rappers mcs djs beatboxers and so on plans the vision for the recording session coaches the performers on their songs chooses audio engineers sets out a budget for hiring the artists and technical experts and oversees the entire project the exact roles of a producer depend on each individual but some producers work with djs and drum machine programmers to create beats coach the djs in the selection of sampled basslines riffs and catch phrases give advice to rappers vocalists mcs and other artists give suggestions to performers on how to improve their flow and develop a unique personal style some producers work closely with the audio engineer to provide ideas on mixing effects units eg autotuned vocal effects such as those popularized by tpain micing of artists and so on the producer may independently develop the concept or vision for a project or album or develop the vision in collaboration with the artists and performers hip hop producer chilly chill behind a large audio console in a recording studio in hip hop since the beginning of mcing there have been producers who work in the studio behind the scenes to create the beats for mcs to rap over producers may find a beat they like on an old funk soul or disco record and then isolate the beat and turn it into a loop alternatively producers may create a beat with a drum machine or by hiring a drumkit percussionist to play acoustic drums the producer could even mix and layer different methods such as combining a sampled disco drum break with a drum machine track and some live newly recorded percussion parts or a live electric bass player a beat created by a hip hop producer may include other parts besides a drum beat such as a sampled bassline from a funk or disco song dialogue from a spoken word record or movie or rhythmic scratching and punches done by a turntablist or dj an early beatmaker was producer kurtis blow who won producer of the year credits in   and  known for the creation of sample and sample loops blow was considered the quincy jones of early hip hop a reference to the prolific african american record producer conductor arranger composer musician and bandleader those who create these beats are known as either beatmakers or producers however producers are known to have more input and direction on the overall the creation of a song or project while a beatmaker just provides or creates the beat as dr dre has said before once you finish the beat you have to produce the record the process of making beats includes sampling chopping looping sequencing beats recording mixing and mastering sam bos rap with computer gear in the studio most beats in hip hop are sampled from a preexisting record this means that a producer will take a portion or a sample of a song and reuse it as an instrumental section beat or portion of their song some examples of this are the isley brothers footsteps in the dark pts  and  being sampled to make ice cubes today was a good day another example is otis reddings try a little tenderness being sampled to create kanye west and jayzs otis chopping is dissecting the song that you are sampling so that you chop out the part or parts of the song be that the bassline rhythm guitar part drum break or other music you want to use in the beat looping is known as melodic or percussive sequence that repeats itself over a period of time so basically a producer will make an evennumber of bars of a beat eg four bars or eight bars repeat itself or loop of a full song length this loop provides an accompaniment for an mc to rap over while hip hop music makes a significant use of sampling old records using turntables and drum machines to create beats producers use electric and acoustic instruments on some songs pictured is an electric bass player at a hip hop show the tools needed to make beats in the late s were funk soul and other music genre records record turntables dj mixers audio consoles and relatively inexpensive portastudiostyle multitrack recording devices in the s and s beatmakers and producers used the new electronic and digital instruments that were developed suchas samplers sequencers drum machines and synthesizers from the s to the s various beatmakers and producers have used live instruments such as drum kit or electric bass on some tracks to record the finished beats or beat tracks beatmakers and producers use a variety of sound recording equipment typically multitrack recorders digital audio workstations also known as daws became more common in the s for producers some of the most used daws are fruity loops studio ableton live and pro tools daws have made it possible for more people to be able to make beats in their own home studio without going to a recording studio beatmakers who own daws do not have to buy all the hardware that a recording studio needed in the s huge  channel audio consoles multitrack recorders racks of rackmount effects units because era daws have everything they need to make beats on a good quality fast laptop computer beats are such an integral part of rap music that many producers have been able to make instrumental mixtapes or albums even though these instrumentals have no rapping listeners still enjoy the inventive ways the producer mixes different beats samples and instrumental melodies examples of these are th wonders tutenkhamen and j dillas donuts some hip hop records come in two versions a beat with rapping over it and an instrumental with just the beat the instrumental in this case is provided so that djs and turntablists can isolate breaks beats and other music to create new songs social impactedit effectsedit a bboy performing in san francisco hiphop has made a considerable social impact since its inception in the s hiphop has also become relevant to the field of education because of its implications for understanding language learning identity and curriculum orlando patterson a sociology professor at harvard university helps describe the phenomenon of how hiphop has spread rapidly around the world patterson argues that mass communication is controlled by the wealthy the government and major businesses in third world nations and countries around the world he also credits mass communication with creating a global cultural hiphop scene as a result the youth are influenced by the american hiphop scene and start their own forms of hiphop patterson believes that revitalization of hiphop music will occur around the world as traditional values are mixed with american hiphop music and ultimately a global exchange process will develop that brings youth around the world to listen to a common musical form of hiphop it has also been argued that rap music formed as a cultural response to historic oppression and racism a system for communication among black communities throughout the united states this is due to the fact that the culture reflected the social economic and political realities of the disenfranchised youth in the s hiphop lyrics are starting to reflect original socially conscious themes rappers are starting to question the governments power and its oppressive role in some societies rap music has been a tool for political social and

patterned cockney slang and radio deejays hyping their audience using rhymes hip hop has a distinctive associated slang it is also known by alternate names such as black english or ebonics academics suggest its development stems from a rejection of the racial hierarchy of language which held white english as the superior form of educated speech due to hiphops commercial success in the lates and early s many of these words have been assimilated into the cultural discourse of several different dialects across america and the world and even to nonhip hop fans the word diss for example is particularly prolific there are also a number of words which predate hip hop but are often associated with the culture with homie being a notable example sometimes terms like what the dilly yo are popularized by a single song in this case put your hands where my eyes could see by busta rhymes and are only used briefly one particular example is the rulebased slang of snoop dogg and e who add izzle or izz to the end or middle of words hip hop lyricism has gained a measure of legitimacy in academic and literary circles studies of hip hop linguistics are now offered at institutions such as the university of toronto where poet and author george eliot clarke has taught the potential power of hip hop music to promote social change greg thomas of the university of miami offers courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level studying the feminist and assertive nature of lil kims lyrics some academics including ernest morrell and jeffrey duncanandrade compare hip hop to the satirical works of great western canon poets of the modern era who use imagery and create a mood to criticize society as quoted in their work promoting academic literacy with urban youth through engaging hip hop culture “ hip hop texts are rich in imagery and metaphor and can be used to teach irony tone diction and point of view hip hop texts can be analyzed for theme motif plot and character development both grand master flash and ts eliot gazed out into their rapidly deteriorating societies and saw a wasteland both poets were essentially apocalyptic in nature as they witnessed death

has been censored on radio and television due to the explicit lyrics of certain genres many songs have been criticized for antiestablishment and sometimes violent messages the use of profanity as well as graphic depictions of violence and sex in hiphop music videos and songs makes it hard to broadcast on television stations such as mtv in music video form and on radio as a result many hiphop recordings are broadcast in censored format with offensive language bleeped or blanked out of the soundtrack or replaced with clean lyrics the result – which sometimes renders the remaining lyrics unintelligible or contradictory to the original recording – has become almost as widely identified with the genre as any other aspect of the music and has been parodied in films such as austin powers

says its ok for a white man to burn a cross in public but nobody wants a black man to write a record about a cop killer the white house administrations of both us presidents george h w bush and bill clinton criticized the genre the reason why rap is under attack is because it exposes all the contradictions of american culture what started out as an underground art form has become a vehicle to

frequently used as a musical response to perceived political andor social injustices in south africa the largest form of hip hop is called kwaito which has had a growth similar to american hiphop kwaito is a direct reflection of a postapartheid south africa and is a voice for the voiceless a term that us hip hop is often referred to kwaito is even perceived as a lifestyle encompassing many aspects of life including language and fashion kwaito is a political and partydriven genre as performers use the music to express their political views and also to express their desire to have a good time kwaito is a music that came from a once hated and oppressed people but it is now sweeping the nation the main consumers of kwaito are adolescents and half of the south african population is under twentyone years of age some of the large kwaito artists have sold more than  albums and in an industry where  albums sold is considered a gold record those are impressive numbers kwaito allows the

reggae music jamaican kool herc brought the sound systems technology and techniques of reggae music to new york during the s jamaican hip hop artists often rap in both brooklyn and jamaican accents jamaican hip hop subject matter is often influenced by outside and internal forces outside forces such as the blingbling era of todays modern hip hop and internal influences coming from the use of anticolonialism and marijuana or ganja references which rastafarians believe bring them closer to god author wayne marshall argues that hip hop as with any number of africanamerican cultural forms before it offers a range of compelling and contradictory significations to jamaican artist and audiences from modern blackness to foreign mind transnational cosmopolitanism to militant panafricanism radical remixology to outright mimicry hip hop in jamaica embodies the myriad ways that jamaicans embrace reject and incorporate foreign yet familiar forms arabic hip hop artist klash loon in the developing world hip hop has made a considerable impact in the social context despite the lack of resources hip hop has made considerable inroads due to limited funds hip hop artists are forced to use very basic tools and even graffiti an important aspect of the hip hop culture is constrained due to its unavailability to the average person hip hop has begun making inroads with more than black artists there are number of other minority artists who are taking center stage as many first generation minority children come of age one example is rapper awkwafina an asianamerican who raps about being asian as well as being female she like many others use rap to express her experiences as a minority not necessarily to unite minorities together but to tell her story many hip hop artists that make it out of the developing world come to places like the united states in hopes of improving their situations maya arulpragasm aka mia is a sri lankaborn tamil hip hop artist in this situation she claims im just trying to build some sort of bridge im trying to create a third place somewhere in between the developed world and the developing world another music artist using hip hop to provide a

warafflicted people in africa and has also been sought out for the international lecture circuit with major talks at popular talkfests like ted educationedit scholars argue that hiphop can have an empowering effect on youth while there is misogyny violence and drug use in rap music videos and lyrics hip hop also displays many positive themes of selfreliance resilience and selfesteem these messages can be inspiring for a youth living in poverty a lot of rap songs contain references to strengthening the africanamerican community promoting social causes social workers have used hip hop to build a relationship with atrisk youth and develop a deeper connection with the child hiphop has the potential to be taught as a way of helping people see the world more critically be it through forms of writing creating music or social activism the lyrics of hip hop have been used to learn about literary devices such as metaphor imagery irony tone theme motif plot and point of view organizations and facilities are providing spaces and programs for communities to explore making and learning about hiphop an example is the imp labs in regina saskatchewan canada many dance studios and colleges now offer lessons in hip hop alongside tap and ballet as well as krsone teaching hip hop lectures at harvard university hip hop producer th wonder and former rapperturned actor christopher play martin from hiphop group kidnplay have taught hip hop history classes at north carolina central university and th wonder has also taught a hip hop sampling soul class at duke university in  the cornell university library established a hip hop collection to collect and make accessible the historical artifacts of hip hop culture and to ensure their preservation for future generations values and philosophyedit in hip hop culture it is considered essential to keep it real or to be authentic to the lived experiences of people from disadvantaged neighborhoods the ghetto despite the fact that hip hop artists typically use imagined scenarios and fictionalized stories in their raps the culture demands that they act as if all their lyrics are true or potentially true because of this lyrics of rap songs have often been treated as confessions to a number of violent crimes in the united states it is also considered to be the duty of rappers and other hip hop artists djs dancers to represent their city and neighborhood this demands being proud of being from disadvantaged cities neighborhoods that have traditionally been a source of shame and glorifying them in lyrics and graffiti this has potentially been one of the ways that hip hop has become regarded as a local rather than foreign genre of music in so many countries around the world in just a few decades nevertheless sampling and borrowing from a number of genres and places is also a part of the hip hop milieu and an album like the surprise hit kala by anglotamil rapper mia was recorded in locations all across the world and features sounds from a different country on every track authenticityedit graffiti depicting us rapper  cent larry nager of the cincinnati enquirer wrote that  cent has earned the right to use the trappings of gangsta rap – the macho posturing the guns the drugs the big cars and magnums of champagne hes not a poseur pretending to be a gangsta hes the real thing hip hop music artists and advocates have stated that hip hop has been an authentic true and real africanamerican artistic form and expressive cultural form since its emergence in innercity bronx neighborhoods in the s as well some music critics scholars and political commentators have denied hip hops authenticity advocates who claim hip hop is an authentic music genre state that it is an ongoing response to the violence and discrimination experienced by black people in the united states from the slavery that existed into the th century to the lynchings of the th century and the ongoing racial discrimination faced by blacks paul gilroy and alexander weheliye state that unlike disco jazz rb house music and other genres that were developed in the africanamerican community and which were quickly adopted and then increasingly controlled by white music industry executives hip hop has remained largely controlled by african american artists producers and executives in his book phonographies weheliye describes the political and cultural affiliations that hip hop music enables in contrast greg tate states that the marketdriven commodity form of commercial hip hop has uprooted the genre from the celebration of africanamerican culture and the messages of protest that predominated in its early forms tate states that the commodification and commercialization of hip hop culture undermines the dynamism of the genre for africanamerican communities these two dissenting understandings of hip hops scope and influence frame debates that revolve around hip hops possession of or lack of authenticity anticipating the market arguments of tate and others both gilroy and weheliye assert that hip hop has always had a different function than western popular music as a whole a function that exceeds the constraints of market capitalism weheliye notes popular music generally in the form of recordings has and still continues to function as one of the main channels of communication between the different geographical and cultural points in the african diaspora allowing artists to articulate and perform their diasporic citizenship to international audiences and establish conversations with other diasporic communities for paul gilroy hip hop proves an outlet of articulation and a sonic space in which african americans can exert control and influence that they often lack in other sociopolitical and economic domains in phonographies weheyliye explains how new sound technologies used in hip hop encourage diasporic citizenship and africanamerican cultural and political activities gilroy states that the power of hip hop music lies in developing black struggles by communicating information organizing consciousness and testing out or deployingindividual or collective forms of africanamerican cultural and political actions in the third chapter of the black atlantic jewels brought from bondage black music and the politics of authenticity gilroy asserts that these elements influence the production of and the interpretation of black cultural activities what gilroy calls the black atlantic musics rituals and traditions are a more expansive way of thinking about africanamerican blackness a way that moves beyond contemporary debates around essentialist and antiessentialist arguments as such gilroy states that music has been and remains a central staging ground for debates over the work responsibility and future role of black cultural and artistic productionh traditional hip hop vs progressive viewsedit ever since the overcommercialization of hiphop occurred between the late s and the mid s at peak traditional hip hop supporters have been in a feud with more progressive hip hop fans claiming that they are uneducated towards what they are building and that it they are not only building music that steps further and further away from hip hop but causes ignorance and misconceptions between fans of more progressed hip hop and traditional fans of the hip hop culture these views have been narrowed heavily over the past couple of years and have experienced change of views from the traditional side as well as acceptance towards evolution of hip hop however all of these beliefs seem to still be viewed under very specific sets of morals and ethics such as that one does not take themselves away or deny the true past of hiphop doing such would result in ignorance of the history of hip hop and a completely disconnected community of fans who become uncertain as to what truly should be considered hip hop fans of more progressed hip hop have received both acclaim due to innovation and futuristic views as well as strong criticism due to lack of proper education and what is felt as a completely changed form of values rather than evolved like most grassroots cultures hip hop initially rejected the views and support of the mainstream industry however eventually learned to be content due to the understanding of what opportunity and voice could be given the father of hip hop dj kool herc recently criticized the cancelled netflix series the get down due to its lack of viewer response by calling it the let down and that legendary hip hop dj grandmaster flash is grandmaster trash herc criticized the whole production for their misrepresentations of history and culture however he did state that he does support many stars in rap today such as lil wayne and drake who clearly do not support hip hop in anyway traditional herc and many other old school hip hop legends such as afrika bambaataa and grandmaster caz originally held views against mainstream rap however recent interviews have shown to prove that even they have changed their ways to a certain extent however rappers like krsone still feel a strong disapproval of the rap industry especially through mainstream media in bboying most supporters have began to slowly involve more industry sponsorship through events on the world bboy series and through the udef powered by silverback open other bboys have began to accept using the term breakdance but only if the term bboying is too difficult to communicate to the general public regardless of such bboys and bgirls still exist to showing lack of support to jams and events that they feel represent the culture as a sport form of entertainment and as well through capitalism battle rap as an industry has also been strongly supported by oldschool goldenera legends such as herc kid capri and krsone  receptionedit commercialization and stereotypingedit in  hip hop and rap pioneer chuck d from the group public enemy criticized young hip hop artists from the s stating that they have taken a music genre with extensive roots in underground music and turned it into commercialized pop music in particular seminal figures in the early underground politicallymotivated music such as ice t have criticized current hip hop artists for being more concerned with image than substance critics have stated that s hip hop artists are contributing to cultural stereotyping of africanamerican culture and are poseur gangsters critics have also stated that hip hop music promotes drug use and violence comedian bill cosby states that hip hop brings young black people down though his criticism is focused mainly on crime and violenceglorifying gangsta rap and it ignores other rap genres that empower black youth hip hop has been criticized by rockcentric critics who state that hip hop is not a true art form and who state that rock and roll music is more authentic these critics are advocating a viewpoint called rockism which favors music written and performed by the individual artist as seen in some famous singersongwriterled rock bands and is against s decadeera hip hop which these critics argue give too large a role to record producers and digital sound recording hip hop is seen as being too violent and explicit in comparison with rock some contend that the criticisms have racial overtones as these critics deny that

over  hip hop songs had lyrics that described violence toward women including rape assault and murder these antiwomen hip hop lyrics have led some male listeners to make physical threats toward women and they have created negative stereotypes of young urban africanamerican women hip hop music promotes masculine hegemony and it depicts women as individuals who must rely on men the portrayal of women in hip hop lyrics and videos tends to be violent degrading and highly sexualized there is a high frequency of songs with lyrics that are demeaning or depict sexual violence or sexual assault towards women videos often portray idealized female bodies and depict women as being the object of male pleasure very few female artists have been recognized in hip hop and the most popular successful and influential artists record producers and music executives are males women who are in rap groups such as lauryn hill of the fugees tend to have less advantages and opportunities than male artists female artists have received little to no recognition in hip hop only one female artist has won best rap album of the year at the grammy awards since the category was added in  in addition african

elliott and mc lyte have made great strides since the hip hop industry first began by producing music and an image that did not cater to the hypersexualized stereotypes of black women in hip hop these women pioneered a revitalized and empowering image of black women in hip hop though many hip hop artists have embraced the ideals that effectively disenfranchise black female artists many others choose to employ forms of resistance that counteract these negative portrayals of women in hip hop and offer a different narrative these artists seek to expand ways of traditional thinking through different ways of cultural expression in this effort they hope to elicit a response to female hip hop artists not with a misogynist lens but with one that validates womens struggle while women have been marginalized in hip hops music industryaccording to whom established artists like missy elliott lil kim and others are providing mentorship for new female mcs in addition there is a vibrant scene

people unfamiliar with hip hop culture often use the expression hip hop to refer exclusively to hip hop music also called rap hip hop is characterized by anywhere from four to nine distinct elements or expressive realms of which hip hop music is only one element dj afrika bambaataa of the hip hop collective zulu nation outlined the pillars of hip hop culture coining the terms rapping also called mcing or emceeing a rhythmic vocal rhyming style orality djing and turntablism which is making music with record players and dj mixers auralsound and music creation bboyingbgirlingbreakdancing movementdance and graffiti art which he called aerosol writin visual art other elements of the hip hop subculture and arts movement beyond the main four are hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement intellectualphilosophical beatboxing a percussive vocal style street entrepreneurship africanamerican language and slang and hip hop fashion and style among others the south bronx hiphop scene emerged in the s and s from neighbourhood block parties thrown by the ghetto brothers a puerto rican group that has been described as being a gang a club and a music group members of the scene plugged in the amplifiers for their instruments and pa speakers into the lampposts on rd street and prospect avenue and used their live music events to break down racial barriers between africanamericans puerto ricans and other ethnic groups jamaican immigrant dj kool herc also played a key role in developing hiphop music at  sedgwick avenue herc mixed samples of existing records and deejayed percussion breaks mixing this music with his own jamaicanstyle toasting a style of chanting and boastful talking over a microphone to rev up the crowd and dancers kool herc is credited as the father of hiphop for developing the key dj techniques that along with rapping founded the hip hop music style by creating rhythmic beats by looping breaks small portions of songs emphasizing a percussive pattern on two turntables this was later accompanied by rapping or mcing a rhythmic style of chanting or speaking poetrylyrics and beatboxing a percussive vocal technique used to create beats to go along with an mc or rappers rhymescitation needed an original form of dancing called breakdancing which later became accompanied by popping locking and other dance moves which was done to the accompaniment of hiphop songs played on boom boxes and particular styles of hiphop dress and hair also developed art historian robert farris thompson describes the youth from the south bronx in the earlys as englishspeaking blacks from barbados like grandmaster flash black jamaicans like dj kool herc who introduced the rhythms from salsa music as well as afro conga and bongo drums as well as many who emulated the sounds of tito puente and willie colón these youths mixed these influences with existing musical styles associated with africanamericans prior to the s from jazz to funk  hiphop music became popular outside of the africanamerican community in the lates with the mainstream commercial success of gangsta rap critic greg tate described the hip hop movement as the only avantgarde still around still delivering a shock of newness to the wealthy bourgeoisie ronald savage known by the nickname beestinger who was a former member of the zulu nation carved the term six elements of the hip hop movement the six elements of the hip hop movement are consciousness awareness civil rights awareness activism awareness justice political awareness and community awareness in music ronald savage is known as the son of the hip hop movement hip is the culture and hop is the movement hiphop culture has spread to both urban and suburban communities throughout the united states and subsequently the world these elements were adapted and developed considerably particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the s and subsequent decades even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms including hip hop theater and hip hop film the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hiphop culture hiphop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon the importance of sampling tracks beats and basslines from old records to the art form means that much of the culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings attitudes and experiences for modern audiences sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called flipping in hiphop culture hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier africanamericanrooted musical genres such as blues jazz ragtime funk and disco to become one of the most practiced genres worldwide in the s

etymologyedit keith cowboy wiggins a member of grandmaster flash and the furious five has been credited with coining the term in  while teasing a friend who had just joined the us army by scat singing the madeup words hiphophiphop in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of marching soldiers cowboy later worked the hip hop cadence into his stage performance the group frequently performed with disco artists who would refer to this new type of music by calling them hip hoppers the name was originally meant as a sign of disrespect but soon came to identify this new music and culture the song rappers delight by the sugarhill gang released in  begins with the phrase i said a hip hop the hippie the hippie to the hip hip hop and you dont stop lovebug starski a bronx dj who put out a single called the positive life in  and dj hollywood then began using the term when referring to this new disco rap music bill alder an independent consultant once said there was hardly ever a moment when rap music was underground one of the very first socalled rap records was a monster hit rappers delight by the sugar hill gang on sugarhill records hip hop pioneer and south bronx community leader afrika bambaataa also credits lovebug starski as the first to use the term hip hop as it relates to the culture bambaataa former leader of the black spades gang also did much to further popularize the term the words hip hop first appeared in print on september   in the village voice in a profile of bambaataa written by steven hager who also published the first comprehensive history of the culture with st martins press historyedit sedit dj jazzy jeff who is also a record producer manipulating a record turntable in england in  in the s an underground urban movement known as hip hop began to develop in the south bronx in new york city it focused on emceeing or mcing over breakbeats house parties and neighbourhood block party events held outdoors hip hop music has been a powerful medium for protesting the impact of legal institutions on minorities particularly police and prisons historically hip hop arose out of the ruins of a postindustrial and ravaged south bronx as a form of expression of urban black and latino youth whom the public and political discourse had written off as marginalized communities jamaicanborn dj clive kool herc cindy campbell pioneered the use of djing percussion breaks in hip hop music beginning at hercs home in a highrise apartment at  sedgwick avenue the movement later spread across the entire borough herc created the blueprint for hip hop music and culture by building upon the jamaican tradition of impromptu toasting a spoken type of boastful poetry and speech over music on august   dj kool herc was the dj at his sisters backtoschool party he extended the beat of a record by using two record players isolating the percussion breaks by using a mixer to switch between the two records hercs experiments with making music with record players became what we now know as breaking or scratching a second key musical element in hip hop music is emceeing also called mcing or rapping emceeing is the rhythmic spoken delivery of rhymes and wordplay delivered at first without accompaniment and later done over a beat this spoken style was influenced by the african american style of capping a performance where men tried to outdo each other in originality of their language and tried to gain the favor of the listeners the basic elements of hip hop—boasting raps rival posses groups uptown throwdowns and political and social commentary—were all long present in african american music mcing and rapping performers moved back and forth between the predominance of toasting songs packed with a mix of boasting slackness and sexual innuendo and a more topical political socially conscious style the role of the mc originally was as a master of ceremonies for a dj dance event the mc would introduce the dj and try to pump up the audience the mc spoke between the djs songs urging everyone to get up and dance mcs would also tell jokes and use their energetic language and enthusiasm to rev up the crowd eventually this introducing role developed into longer sessions of spoken rhythmic wordplay and rhyming which became rapping by  hip hop music had become a mainstream genre it spread across the world in the s with controversial gangsta rap herc also developed upon breakbeat deejaying where the breaks of funk songs—the part most suited to dance usually percussionbased—were isolated and repeated for the purpose of allnight dance parties this form of music playback using hard funk and rock formed the basis of hip hop music campbells announcements and exhortations to dancers would lead to the syncopated rhymed spoken accompaniment now known as rapping he dubbed his dancers breakboys and breakgirls or simply bboys and bgirls according to herc breaking was also street slang for getting excited and acting energetically dj kool herc is a pioneer in developing hip hop music djs such as grand wizzard theodore grandmaster flash and jazzy jay refined and developed the use of breakbeats including cutting and scratching the approach used by herc was soon widely copied and by the late s djs were releasing inch records where they would rap to the beat popular tunes included kurtis blows the breaks and the sugarhill gangs rappers delight herc and other djs would connect their equipment to power lines and perform at venues such as public basketball courts and at  sedgwick avenue bronx new york now officially a historic building the equipment consisted of numerous speakers turntables and one or more microphones by using this technique djs could create a variety of music but according to rap attack by david toop at its worst the technique could turn the night into one endless and inevitably boring song kc the prince of soul a rapperlyricist with pete dj jones is often credited with being the first rap lyricist to call himself an mc street gangs were prevalent in the poverty of the south bronx and much of the graffiti rapping and bboying at these parties were all artistic variations on the competition and oneupmanship of street gangs sensing that gang members often violent urges could be turned into creative ones afrika bambaataa founded the zulu nation a loose confederation of streetdance crews graffiti artists and rap musicians by the late s the culture had gained media attention with billboard magazine printing an article titled b beats bombarding bronx commenting on the local phenomenon and mentioning influential figures such as kool herc the new york city blackout of  saw widespread looting arson and other citywide disorders especially in the bronx where a number of looters stole dj equipment from electronics stores as a result the hip hop genre barely known outside of the bronx at the time grew at an astounding rate from  onward afrika bambaataa with dj yutaka of universal zulu nation in  dj kool hercs house parties gained popularity and later moved to outdoor venues in order to accommodate more people hosted in parks these outdoor parties became a means of expression and an outlet for teenagers where instead of getting into trouble on the streets teens now had a place to expend their pentup energy tony tone a member of the cold crush brothers stated that hip hop saved a lot of lives for innercity youth participating in hip hop culture became a way of dealing with the hardships of life as minorities within america and an outlet to deal with the risk of violence and the rise of gang culture mc kid lucky mentions that people used to breakdance against each other instead of fightingfull citation needed inspired by dj kool herc afrika bambaataa created a street organization

many songs with misogynistic antiwomen lyrics and many music videos depicted women in a sexualized fashion the negation of female voice and perspective is an issue that has come to define mainstream hip hop music the recording industry is less willing to back female artists than their male counterparts and when it does back them often it places emphasis on their sexuality over their musical substance and artistic abilities since the turn of the century the beginning of the s decade female hip hop artists have struggled to get mainstream attention with only a few such as older artists like the female duo salt n pepa to more contemporary ones like lil kim and nicki minaj reaching platinum status sedit icet with the commercial success of gangsta rap in the early s the emphasis in

albums such as nwas straight outta compton eazyes eazyduzit and ice cubes amerikkkas most wanted were selling in such high numbers meant that black teens were no longer hip hops sole buying audience as a result gangsta rap became a platform for artists who chose to use their music to spread political and social messages to parts of the country that were previously unaware of the conditions of

hops messages allow the underprivileged and the mistreated to be heard these cultural translations cross borders while the music may be from a foreign country the message is something that many people

producers managers and artists and repertoire staff politicians and businesspeople maligned and ignored the hip hop movement most hip hop artists performed in their local communities and recorded in underground scenes however in the late s music industry executives realized that they could capitalize on the success of gangsta rap they made a formula that created a titillating buffet of hypermasculinity and glorified violence this type of rap was marketed to the new fanbase white males they ignored the depictions of a harsh reality to focus on the sex and violence involved in an article for the village voice greg tate argues that the commercialization of hip hop is a negative and pervasive phenomenon writing that what we call hiphop is now inseparable from what we call the hip hop industry in which the nouveau riche and the superrich employers get richer ironically this commercialization coincides with a decline in rap sales and pressure from critics of the genre even other musicians like nas and krsone have claimed hip hop is dead in that it has changed so much over the years to cater to the consumer that it has lost the essence for which it was originally created however in his book in search of africa manthia diawara states that hip hop is really a voice of people who are marginalized in modern society he argues that the worldwide spread of hip hop as a market revolution is actually global expression of poor peoples desire for the good life and that this struggle aligns with the nationalist struggle for citizenship and belonging but also reveals the need to go beyond such struggles and celebrate the redemption of the black individual through tradition the problem may not be that female rappers do not have the same opportunities and recognition as their male counterparts it may be that the music industry that is so defined by gender biases industry executives seem to bet on the idea that men won’t want to listen to female rappers so they are given fewer opportunities as the hip hop genre has changed since the s the africanamerican cultural tradition that diawara describes has little place in hip hops mainstream artists music the push toward materialism and market success by contemporary rappers such as rick ross lil wayne and jay z has irked older hip hop fans and artists they see the genre losing its communitybased feel that focused more on black empowerment than wealth the commercialization of the genre stripped it of its earlier political nature and the politics and marketing plans of major record labels have forced

television show there rappers had opportunities be interviewed and have their music videos played this predated mtv or video soul on bet the commercialization has made hip hop less edgy and authentic but it also has enabled hip hop artists to become successful as top rappers grow wealthier and start more outside business ventures this can indicate a stronger sense of black aspiration as rappers such as jayz and kanye west establish themselves as artists and entrepreneurs more young black people have hopes of achieving their goals the lens through which one views the genres commercialization

record turntable at a turntablism competition in france in  djing and turntablism are the techniques of manipulating sounds and creating music and beats using two or more phonograph turntables or other sound sources such as tapes cds or digital audio files and a dj mixer that is plugged into a pa system one of the first few hip hop djs was kool dj herc who created hip hop in the s through the isolation and extending of breaks the parts of albums that focused solely on the percussive beat in addition to developing hercs techniques djs grandmaster flowers grandmaster flash grand wizzard theodore and grandmaster caz made further innovations with the introduction of scratching which has become one of the key sounds associated with hip hop music traditionally a dj will use two turntables simultaneously and mix between the two these are connected to a dj mixer an amplifier speakers and various electronic music equipment such as a microphone and effects units the dj mixes the two albums currently in rotation andor does scratching by moving one of the record platters while manipulating the crossfader on the mixer the result of mixing two records is a unique sound created by the seemingly combined sound of two separate songs into one song although there is considerable overlap between the two roles a dj is not the same as a record producer of a music track the development of djing was also influenced by new turntablism techniques such as beatmatching a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the technics sl mk  first sold in  which had a precise variable pitch control and a direct drive motor djs were often avid record collectors who would hunt through used record stores for obscure soul records and vintage funk recordings djs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences dj pete rock mixing with two turntables in the early years of hip hop the djs were the stars as they created new music and beats with their record players while djing and turntablism continue to be used in hip hop music in the s the star role has increasingly been taken by mcs since the late s due to innovative creative mcs such as kurtis blow and melle mel of grandmaster flashs crew the furious five who developed strong rapping skills however a number of djs have gained stardom nonetheless in recent years famous djs include

subculture while rapping is often done over beats either done by a dj a beatboxer it can also be done without accompaniment it can be broken down into different components such as content flow rhythm and rhyme and delivery rapping is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to the beat of the music the use of the word rap to describe quick and slangy speech or witty

graffiti is hiphop frankly i grew up with disco music theres a long background of graffiti as an entity unto itself and fargo says there is no correlation between hip hop and graffiti one has nothing

come to define the art the early trendsetters were joined in the s by artists like dondi futura  daze blade lee fab five freddy zephyr rammellzee crash kel noc  and lady pink the relationship between graffiti and hip hop culture arises both from early graffiti artists engaging in other aspects of hip hop culture graffiti is understood as a visual expression of rap music just as breaking is viewed as a physical expression the  film wild style is widely regarded as the first hip hop motion picture which featured prominent figures within the new york graffiti scene during the said period the book subway art and the documentary style wars were also among the first ways the mainstream public were introduced to hip hop graffiti graffiti remains part of hip hop while crossing into the mainstream

dancer and displaying tongueincheek bravado breaking also called bboyingbgirling or breakdancing is a dynamic rhythmic style of dance which developed as one of the major elements of hip hop culture like many aspects of hip hop culture breakdance borrows heavily from many cultures including sera street dancing brazilian and asian martial arts russian folk dance and the dance moves of james brown michael jackson and california funk breaking took form in the south bronx in the s alongside the other elements of hip hop breakdancing is typically done with the accompaniment of hip hop music playing on a boom box or pa system according to the  documentary film the freshest kids a history of the bboy dj kool herc describes the b in bboy as short for breaking which at the time was slang for going off also one of the original names for the dance however early on the dance was known as the boing the sound a spring makes dancers at dj kool hercs parties saved their best dance moves for the percussion break section of the song getting in front of the audience to dance in a distinctive frenetic style the b in bboy or bgirl also stands simply for break as in breakboy or girl before the s bgirls’ presence was limited by their gender minority status navigating sexual politics of a masculinedominated scene and a lack of representation or encouragement for women to participate in the form the few bgirls who participated despite facing gender discrimination carved out a space for women as leaders within the breaking community and the number of bgirls participating has increased breaking

effect beatboxing is the technique of vocal percussion in which a singer imitates drums and other percussion instruments with her or his voice it is primarily concerned with the art of creating beats or rhythms using the human mouth the term beatboxing is derived from the mimicry of the first generation of drum machines then known as beatboxes it was first popularized by doug e fresh as it is a way of creating hip hop music it can be categorized under the production element of hip hop though it does sometimes include a type of rapping intersected with the humancreated beat it is generally considered to be part of the same pillar of hip hop as djing—in other words providing a musical backdrop or foundation for mcs to rap over beatboxers can create their beats just naturally but many of the beatboxing effects are enhanced by using a microphone plugged into a pa system this helps the beatboxer to make their beatboxing loud enough to be heard alongside a rapper mc turntablist and other hip hop artists beatboxing was popular in the s with prominent artists like the darren buffy the human beat box robinson of the fat boys and biz markie displaying their skills within the media it

typical rap drum beat written in drum notation although it is not described as one of the four core elements that make up hip hop music producing is another important element in music record producers play a similar role in sound recording that film directors play in making a movie the record producer recruits and selects artists rappers mcs djs beatboxers and so on plans the vision for the recording session coaches the performers on their songs chooses audio engineers sets out a budget for hiring the artists and technical experts and oversees the entire project the exact roles of a producer depend on each individual but some producers work with djs and drum machine programmers to create beats coach the djs in the selection of sampled basslines riffs and catch phrases give advice to rappers vocalists mcs and other artists give suggestions to performers on how to improve their flow and develop a unique personal style some producers work closely with the audio engineer to provide ideas on mixing effects units eg autotuned vocal effects such as those popularized by tpain micing of artists and so on the producer may independently develop the concept or vision for a project or album or develop the vision in collaboration with the artists and performers hip hop producer chilly chill behind a large audio console in a recording studio in hip hop since the beginning of mcing there have been producers who work in the studio behind the scenes to create the beats for mcs to rap over producers may find a beat they like on an old funk soul or disco record and then isolate the beat and turn it into a loop alternatively producers may create a beat with a drum machine or by hiring a drumkit percussionist to play acoustic drums the producer could even mix and layer different methods such as combining a sampled disco drum break with a drum machine track and some live newly recorded percussion parts or a live electric bass player a beat created by a hip hop producer may include other parts besides a drum beat such as a sampled bassline from a funk or disco song dialogue from a spoken word record or movie or rhythmic scratching and punches done by a turntablist or dj an early beatmaker was producer kurtis blow who won producer of the year credits in   and  known for the creation of sample and sample loops blow was considered the quincy jones of early hip hop a reference to the prolific african american record producer conductor arranger composer musician and bandleader those who create these beats are known as either beatmakers or producers however producers are known to have more input and direction on the overall the creation of a song or project while a beatmaker just provides or creates the beat as dr dre has said before once you finish the beat you have to produce the record the process of making beats includes sampling chopping looping sequencing beats recording mixing and mastering sam bos rap with computer gear in the studio most beats in hip hop are sampled from a preexisting record this means that a producer will take a portion or a sample of a song and reuse it as an instrumental section beat or portion of their song some examples of this are the isley brothers footsteps in the dark pts  and  being sampled to make ice cubes today was a good day another example is otis reddings try a little tenderness being sampled to create kanye west and jayzs otis chopping is dissecting the song that you are sampling so that you chop out the part or parts of the song be that the bassline rhythm guitar part drum break or other music you want to use in the beat looping is known as melodic or percussive sequence that repeats itself over a period of time so basically a producer will make an evennumber of bars of a beat eg four bars or eight bars repeat itself or loop of a full song length this loop provides an accompaniment for an mc to rap over while hip hop music makes a significant use of sampling old records using turntables and drum machines to create beats producers use electric and acoustic instruments on some songs pictured is an electric bass player at a hip hop show the tools needed to make beats in the late s were funk soul and other music genre records record turntables dj mixers audio consoles and relatively inexpensive portastudiostyle multitrack recording devices in the s and s beatmakers and producers used the new electronic and digital instruments that were developed suchas samplers sequencers drum machines and synthesizers from the s to the s various beatmakers and producers have used live instruments such as drum kit or electric bass on some tracks to record the finished beats or beat tracks beatmakers and producers use a variety of sound recording equipment typically multitrack recorders digital audio workstations also known as daws became more common in the s for producers some of the most used daws are fruity loops studio ableton live and pro tools daws have made it possible for more people to be able to make beats in their own home studio without going to a recording studio beatmakers who own daws do not have to buy all the hardware that a recording studio needed in the s huge  channel audio consoles multitrack recorders racks of rackmount effects units because era daws have everything they need to make beats on a good quality fast laptop computer beats are such an integral part of rap music that many producers have been able to make instrumental mixtapes or albums even though these instrumentals have no rapping listeners still enjoy the inventive ways the producer mixes different beats samples and instrumental melodies examples of these are th wonders tutenkhamen and j dillas donuts some hip hop records come in two versions a beat with rapping over it and an instrumental with just the beat the instrumental in this case is provided so that djs and turntablists can isolate breaks beats and other music to create new songs

because of its implications for understanding language learning identity and curriculum orlando patterson a sociology professor at harvard university helps describe the phenomenon of how hiphop has spread rapidly around the world patterson argues that mass communication is controlled by the wealthy the government and major businesses in third world nations and countries around the world he also credits mass communication with creating a global cultural hiphop scene as a result the youth are influenced by the american hiphop scene and start their own forms of hiphop patterson believes that revitalization of hiphop music will occur around the world as traditional values are mixed with american hiphop music and ultimately a global exchange process will develop that brings youth around the world to listen to a common musical form of hiphop it has also been argued that rap music formed as a cultural response to historic oppression and racism a system for communication among black communities throughout the united states this is due to the fact that the culture reflected the social economic and political realities of the disenfranchised youth in the s hiphop lyrics are starting to reflect original socially conscious themes rappers are starting to question the governments power and its oppressive role in some societies rap music has been a tool for political social and

patterned cockney slang and radio deejays hyping their audience using rhymes hip hop has a distinctive associated slang it is also known by alternate names such as black english or ebonics academics suggest its development stems from a rejection of the racial hierarchy of language which held white english as the superior form of educated speech due to hiphops commercial success in the lates and early s many of these words have been assimilated into the cultural discourse of several different dialects across america and the world and even to nonhip hop fans the word diss for example is particularly prolific there are also a number of words which predate hip hop but are often associated with the culture with homie being a notable example sometimes terms like what the dilly yo are popularized by a single song in this case put your hands where my eyes could see by busta rhymes and are only used briefly one particular example is the rulebased slang of snoop dogg and e who add izzle or izz to the end or middle of words hip hop lyricism has gained a measure of legitimacy in academic and literary circles studies of hip hop linguistics are now offered at institutions such as the university of toronto where poet and author george eliot clarke has taught the potential power of hip hop music to promote social change greg thomas of the university of miami offers courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level studying the feminist and assertive nature of lil kims lyrics some academics including ernest morrell and jeffrey duncanandrade compare hip hop to the satirical works of great western canon poets of the modern era who use imagery and create a mood to criticize society as quoted in their work promoting academic literacy with urban youth through engaging hip hop culture “ hip hop texts are rich in imagery and metaphor and can be used to teach irony tone diction and point of view hip hop texts can be analyzed for theme motif plot and character development both grand master flash and ts eliot gazed out into their rapidly deteriorating societies and saw a wasteland both poets were essentially apocalyptic in nature as they witnessed death disease and decay ” hip hop lyrics have also been known for containing swear words in particular the word bitch is seen in countless songs from a bitch iz a bitch by nwa to missy elliotts she is a bitch it is often used in the negative connotation of a woman who is a shallow money grubber some female artists have tried to reclaim the word and use it as a term of empowerment regardless the hiphop community has recently taken an interest in discussing the use of the word bitch and whether it is necessary in rap not only the particular words but also the choice of which language in which

has been censored on radio and television due to the explicit lyrics of certain genres many songs have been criticized for antiestablishment and sometimes violent messages the use of profanity as well as graphic depictions of violence and sex in hiphop music videos and songs makes it hard to broadcast on television stations such as mtv in music video form and on radio as a result many hiphop recordings are broadcast in censored format with offensive language bleeped or blanked out of the soundtrack or replaced with clean lyrics the result – which sometimes renders the remaining lyrics unintelligible or contradictory to the original recording – has become almost as widely identified with the genre as any other aspect of the music and has been parodied in films such as austin powers in goldmember in which mike myers character dr evil – performing in a parody of a hiphop music video hard knock life by jayz – performs an entire verse that is blanked out in  roger ebert wrote “ rap

popularized in the later part of the s by groups such as nwa icet released  in the mornin which is often regarded as the first gangsta rap song in  after the national attention that icet and nwa created in the lates and earlys gangsta rap became the most commercially lucrative subgenre of hiphop nwa is the group most frequently associated with the founding of gangsta rap their lyrics were

says its ok for a white man to burn a cross in public but nobody wants a black man to write a record about a cop killer the white house administrations of both us presidents george h w bush and bill clinton criticized the genre the reason why rap is under attack is because it exposes all the contradictions of american culture what started out as an underground art form has become a vehicle to expose a lot of critical issues that are not usually discussed in american politics the problem here is that the white house and wannabes like bill clinton represent a political system that never

list of hip hop genres breaking in ljubljana slovenia hiphop music has spawned dozens of subgenres which incorporate hip hop music production approaches such as sampling creating beats or rapping the diversification process stems from the appropriation of hip hop culture by other ethnic groups there are many varying social influences that affect hip hops message in different nations it is frequently used as a musical response to perceived political andor social injustices in south africa the largest form of hip hop is called kwaito which has had a growth similar to american hiphop kwaito is a direct reflection of a postapartheid south africa and is a voice for the voiceless a term that us hip hop is often referred to kwaito is even perceived as a lifestyle encompassing many aspects of life including language and fashion kwaito is a political and partydriven genre as performers use the music to express their political views and also to express their desire to have a good time kwaito is a music that came from a once hated and oppressed people but it is now sweeping the nation the main consumers of kwaito are adolescents and half of the south african population is under twentyone years of age some of the large kwaito artists have sold more than  albums and in an industry where  albums sold is considered a gold record those are impressive numbers kwaito allows the participation and creative engagement of otherwise socially excluded peoples in the generation of popular media south african hip hop is more diverse lately and there are hip hop acts in south africa

youth jal pictured at the tribeca film festival in new york in jamaica the sounds of hip hop are derived from american and jamaican influences jamaican hip hop is defined both through dancehall and reggae music jamaican kool herc brought the sound systems technology and techniques of reggae music to new york during the s jamaican hip hop artists often rap in both brooklyn and jamaican accents jamaican hip hop subject matter is often influenced by outside and internal forces outside forces such as the blingbling era of todays modern hip hop and internal influences coming from the use of anticolonialism and marijuana or ganja references which rastafarians believe bring them closer to god author wayne marshall argues that hip hop as with any number of africanamerican cultural forms before it offers a range of compelling and contradictory significations to jamaican artist and audiences from modern blackness to foreign mind transnational cosmopolitanism to militant panafricanism radical remixology to outright mimicry hip hop in jamaica embodies the myriad ways that jamaicans embrace reject and incorporate foreign yet familiar forms arabic hip hop artist klash loon in the developing world hip hop has made a considerable impact in the social context despite the lack of resources hip hop has made considerable inroads due to limited funds hip hop artists are forced to use very basic tools and even graffiti an important aspect of the hip hop culture is constrained due to its unavailability to the average person hip hop has begun making inroads with more than black artists there are number of other minority artists who are taking center stage as many first generation minority children come of age one example is rapper awkwafina an asianamerican who raps about being asian as well as being female she like many others use rap to express her experiences as a minority not necessarily to unite minorities together but to tell her story many hip hop artists that make it out of the developing world come to places like the united states in hopes of improving their situations maya arulpragasm aka mia is a sri lankaborn tamil hip hop artist in this situation she claims im just trying to build some sort of bridge im trying to create a third place somewhere in between the developed world and the developing world another music artist using hip hop to provide a positive message to young africans is emmanuel jal who is a former child soldier from south sudan jal is one of the few south sudanese music artists to have broken through on an international level with his unique form of hip hop and a positive message in his lyrics jal has attracted the attention of mainstream media and academics with his story and use of hip hop as a healing medium for warafflicted people in africa and has also been sought out for the international lecture circuit with major talks at popular talkfests like ted educationedit scholars argue that hiphop can have an empowering effect on youth while there is misogyny violence and drug use in rap music videos and lyrics hip hop also displays many positive themes of selfreliance resilience and selfesteem these messages can be inspiring for a youth living in poverty a lot of rap songs contain references to strengthening the africanamerican community promoting social causes social workers have used hip hop to build a relationship with atrisk youth and develop a deeper connection with the child hiphop has the potential to be taught as a way of helping people see the world more critically be it through forms of writing creating music or social activism the lyrics of hip hop have been used to learn about literary devices such as metaphor imagery irony tone theme motif plot and point of view organizations and facilities are providing spaces and programs for communities to explore making and learning about hiphop an example is the imp labs in regina saskatchewan canada many dance studios and colleges now offer lessons in hip hop alongside tap and ballet as well as krsone teaching hip hop lectures at harvard university hip hop producer th wonder and former rapperturned actor christopher play martin from hiphop group kidnplay have taught hip hop history classes at north carolina central university and th wonder has also taught a hip hop sampling soul class at duke university in  the cornell university library established a hip hop collection to collect and make accessible the historical artifacts of hip hop culture and to ensure their preservation for future generations values and philosophyedit in hip hop culture it is considered essential to keep it real or to be authentic to the lived experiences of people from disadvantaged neighborhoods the ghetto despite the fact that hip hop artists typically use imagined scenarios and fictionalized stories in their raps the culture demands that they act as if all their lyrics are true or potentially true because of this lyrics of rap songs have often been treated as confessions to a number of violent crimes in the united states it is also considered to be the duty of rappers and other hip hop artists djs dancers to represent their city and neighborhood this demands being proud of being from disadvantaged cities neighborhoods that have traditionally been a source of shame and glorifying them in lyrics and graffiti this has potentially been one of the ways that hip hop has become regarded as a local rather than foreign genre of music in so many countries around the world in just a few decades nevertheless sampling and borrowing from a number of genres and places is also a part of the hip hop milieu and an album like the surprise hit kala by anglotamil rapper mia was recorded in locations all across the world and features sounds from a different country on every track authenticityedit graffiti depicting us rapper  cent larry nager of the cincinnati enquirer wrote that  cent has earned the right to use the trappings of gangsta rap – the macho posturing the guns the drugs the big cars and magnums of champagne hes not a poseur pretending to be a gangsta hes the real thing hip hop music artists and advocates have stated that hip hop has been an authentic true and real africanamerican artistic form and expressive cultural form since its emergence in innercity bronx neighborhoods in the s as well some music critics scholars and political commentators have denied hip hops authenticity advocates who claim hip hop is an authentic music genre state that it is an ongoing response to the violence and discrimination experienced by black people in the united states from the slavery that existed into the th century to the lynchings of the th century and the ongoing racial discrimination faced by blacks paul gilroy and alexander weheliye state that unlike disco jazz rb house music and other genres that were developed in the africanamerican community and which were quickly adopted and then increasingly controlled by white music industry executives hip hop has remained largely controlled by african american artists producers and executives in his book phonographies weheliye describes the political and cultural affiliations that hip hop music enables in contrast greg tate states that the marketdriven commodity form of commercial hip hop has uprooted the genre from the celebration of africanamerican culture and the messages of protest that predominated in its early forms tate states that the commodification and commercialization of hip hop culture undermines the dynamism of the genre for africanamerican communities these two dissenting understandings of hip hops scope and influence frame debates that revolve around hip hops possession of or lack of authenticity anticipating the market arguments of tate and others both gilroy and weheliye assert that hip hop has always had a different function than western popular music as a whole a function that exceeds the constraints of market capitalism weheliye notes popular music generally in the form of recordings has and still continues to function as one of the main channels of communication between the different geographical and cultural points in the african diaspora allowing artists to articulate and perform their diasporic citizenship to international audiences and establish conversations with other diasporic communities for paul gilroy hip hop proves an outlet of articulation and a sonic space in which african americans can exert control and influence that they often lack in other sociopolitical and economic domains in phonographies weheyliye explains how new sound technologies used in hip hop encourage diasporic citizenship and africanamerican cultural and political activities gilroy states that the power of hip hop music lies in developing black struggles by communicating information organizing consciousness and testing out or deployingindividual or collective forms of africanamerican cultural and political actions in the third chapter of the black atlantic jewels brought from bondage black music and the politics of authenticity gilroy asserts that these elements influence the production of and the interpretation of black cultural activities what gilroy calls the black atlantic musics rituals and traditions are a more expansive way of thinking about africanamerican blackness a way that moves beyond contemporary debates around essentialist and antiessentialist arguments as such gilroy states that music has been and remains a central staging ground for debates over the work responsibility and future role of black cultural and artistic productionh traditional hip hop vs progressive viewsedit ever since the overcommercialization of hiphop occurred between the late s and the mid s at peak traditional hip hop supporters have been in a feud with more progressive hip hop fans claiming that they are uneducated towards what they are building and that it they are not only building music that steps further and further away from hip hop but causes ignorance and misconceptions between fans of more progressed hip hop and traditional fans of the hip hop culture these views have been narrowed heavily over the past couple of years and have experienced change of views from the traditional side as well as acceptance towards evolution of hip hop however all of these beliefs seem to still be viewed under very specific sets of morals and ethics such as that one does not take themselves away or deny the true past of hiphop doing such would result in ignorance of the history of hip hop and a completely disconnected community of fans who become uncertain as to what truly should be considered hip hop fans of more progressed hip hop have received both acclaim due to innovation and futuristic views as well as strong criticism due to lack of proper education and what is felt as a completely changed form of values rather than evolved like most grassroots cultures hip hop initially rejected the views and support of the mainstream industry however eventually learned to be content due to the understanding of what opportunity and voice could be given the father of hip hop dj kool herc recently criticized the cancelled netflix series the get down due to its lack of viewer response by calling it the let down and that legendary hip hop dj grandmaster flash is grandmaster trash herc criticized the whole production for their misrepresentations of history and culture however he did state that he does support many stars in rap today such as lil wayne and drake who clearly do not support hip hop in anyway traditional herc and many other old school hip hop legends such as afrika bambaataa and grandmaster caz originally held views against mainstream rap however recent interviews have shown to prove that even they have changed their ways to a certain extent however rappers like krsone still feel a strong disapproval of the rap industry especially through mainstream media in bboying most supporters have began to slowly involve more industry sponsorship through events on the world bboy series and through the udef powered by silverback open other bboys have began to accept using the term breakdance but only if the term bboying is too difficult to communicate to the general public regardless of such bboys and bgirls still exist to showing lack of support to jams and events that they feel represent the culture as a sport form of entertainment and as well through capitalism battle rap as an industry has also been strongly supported by oldschool goldenera legends such as herc kid capri and krsone  receptionedit commercialization and stereotypingedit in  hip hop and rap pioneer chuck d from the group public enemy criticized young hip hop artists from the s stating that they have taken a music genre with extensive roots in underground music and turned it into commercialized pop music in particular seminal figures in the early underground politicallymotivated music such as ice t have criticized current hip hop artists for being more concerned with image than substance critics have stated that s hip hop artists are contributing to cultural stereotyping of africanamerican culture and are poseur gangsters critics have also stated that hip hop music promotes drug use and violence comedian bill cosby states that hip hop brings young black people down though his criticism is focused mainly on crime and violenceglorifying gangsta rap and it ignores other rap genres that empower black youth hip hop has been criticized by rockcentric critics who state that hip hop is not a true art form and who state that rock and roll music is more authentic these critics are advocating a viewpoint called rockism which favors music written and performed by the individual artist as seen in some famous singersongwriterled rock bands and is against s decadeera hip hop which these critics argue give too large a role to record producers and digital sound recording hip hop is seen as being too violent and explicit in comparison with rock some contend that the criticisms have racial overtones as these critics deny that hip hop is an art form and praising rock genres that prominently feature white males marginalization of womenedit hip hop artist lauryn hill has been successful as a solo performer and as a member of the fugees this photo shows her performing at the ottawa bluesfest in  the hip hop music genre and its subculture has been criticized for its gender bias and its negative impacts on women in africanamerican culture gangsta rap artists such as eazye dr dre and snoop dogg have song lyrics that portray women as sex toys and as people who are inferior to and dependent on men between  and  over  hip hop songs had lyrics that described violence toward women including rape assault and murder these antiwomen hip hop lyrics have led some male listeners to make physical threats toward women and they have created negative stereotypes of young urban africanamerican women hip hop music promotes masculine hegemony and it depicts women as individuals who must rely on men the portrayal of women in hip hop lyrics and videos tends to be violent degrading and highly sexualized there is a high frequency of songs with lyrics that are demeaning or depict sexual violence or sexual assault towards women videos often portray idealized female bodies and depict women as being the object of male pleasure very few female artists have been recognized in hip hop and the most popular successful and influential artists record producers and music executives are males women who are in rap groups such as lauryn hill of the fugees tend to have less advantages and opportunities than male artists female artists have received little to no recognition in hip hop only one female artist has won best rap album of the year at the grammy awards since the category was added in  in addition african american female hip hop artists have been recognized even less in the industry besides icons like lauryn hill white rapper iggy azalea is the first female hip hop artist to get a number one single on

elliott and mc lyte have made great strides since the hip hop industry first began by producing music and an image that did not cater to the hypersexualized stereotypes of black women in hip hop these women pioneered a revitalized and empowering image of black women in hip hop though many hip hop artists have embraced the ideals that effectively disenfranchise black female artists many others choose to employ forms of resistance that counteract these negative portrayals of women in hip hop and offer a different narrative these artists seek to expand ways of traditional thinking through different ways of cultural expression in this effort they hope to elicit a response to female hip hop artists not with a misogynist lens but with one that validates womens struggle while women have been marginalized in hip hops music industryaccording to whom established artists like missy elliott lil kim and others are providing mentorship for new female mcs in addition there is a vibrant scene

people unfamiliar with hip hop culture often use the expression hip hop to refer exclusively to hip hop music also called rap hip hop is characterized by anywhere from four to nine distinct elements or expressive realms of which hip hop music is only one element dj afrika bambaataa of the hip hop collective zulu nation outlined the pillars of hip hop culture coining the terms rapping also called mcing or emceeing a rhythmic vocal rhyming style orality djing and turntablism which is making music with record players and dj mixers auralsound and music creation bboyingbgirlingbreakdancing movementdance and graffiti art which he called aerosol writin visual art other elements of the hip hop subculture and arts movement beyond the main four are hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement intellectualphilosophical beatboxing a percussive vocal style street entrepreneurship africanamerican language and slang and hip hop fashion and style among others the south bronx hiphop scene emerged in the s and s from neighbourhood block parties thrown by the ghetto brothers a puerto rican group that has been described as being a gang a club and a music group members of the scene plugged in the amplifiers for their instruments and pa speakers into the lampposts on rd street and prospect avenue and used their live music events to break down racial barriers between africanamericans puerto ricans and other ethnic groups jamaican immigrant dj kool herc also played a key role in developing hiphop music at  sedgwick avenue herc mixed samples of existing records and deejayed percussion breaks mixing this music with his own jamaicanstyle toasting a style of chanting and boastful talking over a microphone to rev up the crowd and dancers kool herc is credited as the father of hiphop for developing the key dj techniques that along with rapping founded the hip hop music style by creating rhythmic beats by looping breaks small portions of songs emphasizing a percussive pattern on two turntables this was later accompanied by rapping or mcing a rhythmic style of chanting or speaking poetrylyrics and beatboxing a percussive vocal technique used to create beats to go along with an mc or rappers rhymescitation needed an original form of dancing called breakdancing which later became accompanied by popping locking and other dance moves which was done to the accompaniment of hiphop songs played on boom boxes and particular styles of hiphop dress and hair also developed art historian robert farris thompson describes the youth from the south bronx in the earlys as englishspeaking blacks from barbados like grandmaster flash black jamaicans like dj kool herc who introduced the rhythms from salsa music as well as afro conga and bongo drums as well as many who emulated the sounds of tito puente and willie colón these youths mixed these influences with existing musical styles associated with africanamericans prior to the s from jazz to funk  hiphop music became popular outside of the africanamerican community in the lates with the mainstream commercial success of gangsta rap critic greg tate described the hip hop movement as the only avantgarde still around still delivering a shock of newness to the wealthy bourgeoisie ronald savage known by the nickname beestinger who was a former member of the zulu nation carved the term six elements of the hip hop movement the six elements of the hip hop movement are consciousness awareness civil rights awareness activism awareness justice political awareness and community awareness in music ronald savage is known as the son of the hip hop movement hip is the culture and hop is the movement hiphop culture has spread to both urban and suburban communities throughout the united states and subsequently the world these elements were adapted and developed considerably particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the s and subsequent decades even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms including hip hop theater and hip hop film the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hiphop culture hiphop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon the importance of sampling tracks beats and basslines from old records to the art form means that much of the culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings attitudes and experiences for modern audiences sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called flipping in hiphop culture hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier africanamericanrooted musical genres such as blues jazz ragtime funk and disco to become one of the most practiced genres worldwide in the s

etymologyedit keith cowboy wiggins a member of grandmaster flash and the furious five has been credited with coining the term in  while teasing a friend who had just joined the us army by scat singing the madeup words hiphophiphop in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of marching soldiers cowboy later worked the hip hop cadence into his stage performance the group frequently performed with disco artists who would refer to this new type of music by calling them hip hoppers the name was originally meant as a sign of disrespect but soon came to identify this new music and culture the song rappers delight by the sugarhill gang released in  begins with the phrase i said a hip hop the hippie the hippie to the hip hip hop and you dont stop lovebug starski a bronx dj who put out a single called the positive life in  and dj hollywood then began using the term when referring to this new disco rap music bill alder an independent consultant once said there was hardly ever a moment when rap music was underground one of the very first socalled rap records was a monster hit rappers delight by the sugar hill gang on sugarhill records hip hop pioneer and south bronx community leader afrika bambaataa also credits lovebug starski as the first to use the term hip hop as it relates to the culture bambaataa former leader of the black spades gang also did much to further popularize the term the words hip hop first appeared in print on september   in the village voice in a profile of bambaataa written by steven hager who also published the first comprehensive history of the culture with st martins press historyedit sedit dj jazzy jeff who is also a record producer manipulating a record turntable in england in  in the s an underground urban movement known as hip hop began to develop in the south bronx in new york city it focused on emceeing or mcing over breakbeats house parties and neighbourhood block party events held outdoors hip hop music has been a powerful medium for protesting the impact of legal institutions on minorities particularly police and prisons historically hip hop arose out of the ruins of a postindustrial and ravaged south bronx as a form of expression of urban black and latino youth whom the public and political discourse had written off as marginalized communities jamaicanborn dj clive kool herc cindy campbell pioneered the use of djing percussion breaks in hip hop music beginning at hercs home in a highrise apartment at  sedgwick avenue the movement later spread across the entire borough herc created the blueprint for hip hop music and culture by building upon the jamaican tradition of impromptu toasting a spoken type of boastful poetry and speech over music on august   dj kool herc was the dj at his sisters backtoschool party he extended the beat of a record by using two record players isolating the percussion breaks by using a mixer to switch between the two records hercs experiments with making music with record players became what we now know as breaking or scratching a second key musical element in hip hop music is emceeing also called mcing or rapping emceeing is the rhythmic spoken delivery of rhymes and wordplay delivered at first without accompaniment and later done over a beat this spoken style was influenced by the african american style of capping a performance where men tried to outdo each other in originality of their language and tried to gain the favor of the listeners the basic elements of hip hop—boasting raps rival posses groups uptown throwdowns and political and social commentary—were all long present in african american music mcing and rapping performers moved back and forth between the predominance of toasting songs packed with a mix of boasting slackness and sexual innuendo and a more topical political socially conscious style the role of the mc originally was as a master of ceremonies for a dj dance event the mc would introduce the dj and try to pump up the audience the mc spoke between the djs songs urging everyone to get up and dance mcs would also tell jokes and use their energetic language and enthusiasm to rev up the crowd eventually this introducing role developed into longer sessions of spoken rhythmic wordplay and rhyming which became rapping by  hip hop music had become a mainstream genre it spread across the world in the s with controversial gangsta rap herc also developed upon breakbeat deejaying where the breaks of funk songs—the part most suited to dance usually percussionbased—were isolated and repeated for the purpose of allnight dance parties this form of music playback using hard funk and rock formed the basis of hip hop music campbells announcements and exhortations to dancers would lead to the syncopated rhymed spoken accompaniment now known as rapping he dubbed his dancers breakboys and breakgirls or simply bboys and bgirls according to herc breaking was also street slang for getting excited and acting energetically dj kool herc is a pioneer in developing hip hop music djs such as grand wizzard theodore grandmaster flash and jazzy jay refined and developed the use of breakbeats including cutting and scratching the approach used by herc was soon widely copied and by the late s djs were releasing inch records where they would rap to the beat popular tunes included kurtis blows the breaks and the sugarhill gangs rappers delight herc and other djs would connect their equipment to power lines and perform at venues such as public basketball courts and at  sedgwick avenue bronx new york now officially a historic building the equipment consisted of numerous speakers turntables and one or more microphones by using this technique djs could create a variety of music but according to rap attack by david toop at its worst the technique could turn the night into one endless and inevitably boring song kc the prince of soul a rapperlyricist with pete dj jones is often credited with being the first rap lyricist to call himself an mc street gangs were prevalent in the poverty of the south bronx and much of the graffiti rapping and bboying at these parties were all artistic variations on the competition and oneupmanship of street gangs sensing that gang members often violent urges could be turned into creative ones afrika bambaataa founded the zulu nation a loose confederation of streetdance crews graffiti artists and rap musicians by the late s the culture had gained media attention with billboard magazine printing an article titled b beats bombarding bronx commenting on the local phenomenon and mentioning influential figures such as kool herc the new york city blackout of  saw widespread looting arson and other citywide disorders especially in the bronx where a number of looters stole dj equipment from electronics stores as a result the hip hop genre barely known outside of the bronx at the time grew at an astounding rate from  onward afrika bambaataa with dj yutaka of universal zulu nation in  dj kool hercs house parties gained popularity and later moved to outdoor venues in order to accommodate more people hosted in parks these outdoor parties became a means of expression and an outlet for teenagers where instead of getting into trouble on the streets teens now had a place to expend their pentup energy tony tone a member of the cold crush brothers stated that hip hop saved a lot of lives for innercity youth participating in hip hop culture became a way of dealing with the hardships of life as minorities within america and an outlet to deal with the risk of violence and the rise of gang culture mc kid lucky mentions that people used to breakdance against each other instead of fightingfull citation needed inspired by dj kool herc afrika bambaataa created a street organization called universal zulu nation centered around hip hop as a means to draw teenagers out of gang life drugs and violence the lyrical content of many early rap groups focused on social issues most notably in the seminal track the message by grandmaster flash and the furious five which discussed the realities of life in the housing projects young black americans coming out of the civil rights movement have used hip hop culture in the s and s to show the limitations of the movement hip hop gave young african americans a voice to let their issues be heard like rockandroll hip hop is vigorously opposed by conservatives because it romanticises violence lawbreaking and gangs it also gave people a chance for financial gain by reducing the rest of the world to consumers of its social concerns in late  debbie harry of blondie took nile rodgers of chic to such an event as the main backing track used was the break from chics good times the new style influenced harry and blondies later hit single from  rapture became the first major single containing hip hop elements by a white group or artist to hit number one on the us billboard hot —the song itself is usually considered new wave and fuses heavy pop music elements but there is an extended rap by harry near the end ronald beestinger savage is an entrepreneur hiphop artist author and activist sedit hip hop as a culture was further defined in  when afrika bambaataa and the soulsonic force released the electrofunk track planet rock instead of simply rapping over disco beats bambaataa with producer arthur baker created an electronic sound taking advantage of the rapidly improving drum machine roland tr synthesizer technology as well as sampling from kraftwerk planet rock is widely regarded as a turning point fusing electro with hip hop was like a light being switched on resulting in a new genre other groundbreaking records released in  were the message by grandmaster flash and the furious five nunk by warp  man parrishs hip hop be

graffiti art mcingrapping djing and bboying hip hop became the dominant cultural movement of the minoritypopulated urban communities in the s the s also saw many artists make social statements through hip hop in  melle mel and duke bootee recorded the message officially credited to grandmaster flash and the furious five a song that foreshadowed the socially conscious statements of rundmcs its like that and public enemys black steel in the hour of chaos during the s hip hop also embraced the creation of rhythm by using the human body via the vocal percussion technique of beatboxing pioneers such as doug e fresh biz markie and buffy from the fat boys made beats rhythm and musical sounds using their mouth lips tongue voice and other body parts human beatbox artists would also sing or imitate

s or early s women artists have also been at the forefront of the hip hop movement since its inception in the bronx nevertheless as gangsta rap became the dominant force in hip hop music there were many songs with misogynistic antiwomen lyrics and many music videos depicted women in a sexualized fashion the negation of female voice and perspective is an issue that has come to define mainstream hip hop music the recording industry is less willing to back female artists than their male counterparts and when it does back them often it places emphasis on their sexuality over their musical substance and artistic abilities since the turn of the century the beginning of the s decade female hip hop artists have struggled to get mainstream attention with only a few such as older artists like the female duo salt n pepa to more contemporary ones like lil kim and nicki minaj reaching platinum status sedit icet with the commercial success of gangsta rap in the early s the emphasis in

albums such as nwas straight outta compton eazyes eazyduzit and ice cubes amerikkkas most wanted were selling in such high numbers meant that black teens were no longer hip hops sole buying audience

are also instances of fusion genres hip hop culture has grown from the avoided genre to a genre that is followed by  million fans worldwide this was made possible by the adaptation of music in

creates a divide between western music and music from the rest of the world a musical cross pollination has taken place which strengthens the power of hip hop to influence different communities hip hops messages allow the underprivileged and the mistreated to be heard these cultural translations cross borders while the music may be from a foreign country the message is something that many people

producers managers and artists and repertoire staff politicians and businesspeople maligned and ignored the hip hop movement most hip hop artists performed in their local communities and recorded in underground scenes however in the late s music industry executives realized that they could capitalize on the success of gangsta rap they made a formula that created a titillating buffet of hypermasculinity and glorified violence this type of rap was marketed to the new fanbase white males they ignored the depictions of a harsh reality to focus on the sex and violence involved in an article for the village voice greg tate argues that the commercialization of hip hop is a negative and pervasive phenomenon writing that what we call hiphop is now inseparable from what we call the hip hop industry in which the nouveau riche and the superrich employers get richer ironically this commercialization coincides with a decline in rap sales and pressure from critics of the genre even other musicians like nas and krsone have claimed hip hop is dead in that it has changed so much over the years to cater to the consumer that it has lost the essence for which it was originally created however in his book in search of africa manthia diawara states that hip hop is really a voice of people who are marginalized in modern society he argues that the worldwide spread of hip hop as a market revolution is actually global expression of poor peoples desire for the good life and that this struggle aligns with the nationalist struggle for citizenship and belonging but also reveals the need to go beyond such struggles and celebrate the redemption of the black individual through tradition the problem may not be that female rappers do not have the same opportunities and recognition as their male counterparts it may be that the music industry that is so defined by gender biases industry executives seem to bet on the idea that men won’t want to listen to female rappers so they are given fewer opportunities as the hip hop genre has changed since the s the africanamerican cultural tradition that diawara describes has little place in hip hops mainstream artists music the push toward materialism and market success by contemporary rappers such as rick ross lil wayne and jay z has irked older hip hop fans and artists they see the genre losing its communitybased feel that focused more on black empowerment than wealth the commercialization of the genre stripped it of its earlier political nature and the politics and marketing plans of major record labels have forced rappers to craft their music and images to appeal to white affluent and suburban audiences after realizing her friends were making music but not getting television exposure other than what was seen on

television show there rappers had opportunities be interviewed and have their music videos played this predated mtv or video soul on bet the commercialization has made hip hop less edgy and authentic but it also has enabled hip hop artists to become successful as top rappers grow wealthier and start more outside business ventures this can indicate a stronger sense of black aspiration as rappers such as jayz and kanye west establish themselves as artists and entrepreneurs more young black people have hopes of achieving their goals the lens through which one views the genres commercialization

record turntable at a turntablism competition in france in  djing and turntablism are the techniques of manipulating sounds and creating music and beats using two or more phonograph turntables or other sound sources such as tapes cds or digital audio files and a dj mixer that is plugged into a pa system one of the first few hip hop djs was kool dj herc who created hip hop in the s through the isolation and extending of breaks the parts of albums that focused solely on the percussive beat in addition to developing hercs techniques djs grandmaster flowers grandmaster flash grand wizzard theodore and grandmaster caz made further innovations with the introduction of scratching which has become one of the key sounds associated with hip hop music traditionally a dj will use two turntables simultaneously and mix between the two these are connected to a dj mixer an amplifier speakers and various electronic music equipment such as a microphone and effects units the dj mixes the two albums currently in rotation andor does scratching by moving one of the record platters while manipulating the crossfader on the mixer the result of mixing two records is a unique sound created by the seemingly combined sound of two separate songs into one song although there is considerable overlap between the two roles a dj is not the same as a record producer of a music track the development of djing was also influenced by new turntablism techniques such as beatmatching a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the technics sl mk  first sold in  which had a precise variable pitch control and a direct drive motor djs were often avid record collectors who would hunt through used record stores for obscure soul records and vintage funk recordings djs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences dj pete rock mixing with two turntables in the early years of hip hop the djs were the stars as they created new music and beats with their record players while djing and turntablism continue to be used in hip hop music in the s the star role has increasingly been taken by mcs since the late s due to innovative creative mcs such as kurtis blow and melle mel of grandmaster flashs crew the furious five who developed strong rapping skills however a number of djs have gained stardom nonetheless in recent years famous djs include

to spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics with a strong rhythmic accompaniment rapping typically features complex wordplay rapid delivery and a range of street slang some of which is unique to the hip hop subculture while rapping is often done over beats either done by a dj a beatboxer it can also be done without accompaniment it can be broken down into different components such as content flow rhythm and rhyme and delivery rapping is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to the beat of the music the use of the word rap to describe quick and slangy speech or witty

come to define the art the early trendsetters were joined in the s by artists like dondi futura  daze blade lee fab five freddy zephyr rammellzee crash kel noc  and lady pink the relationship between graffiti and hip hop culture arises both from early graffiti artists engaging in other aspects of hip hop culture graffiti is understood as a visual expression of rap music just as breaking is viewed as a physical expression the  film wild style is widely regarded as the first hip hop motion picture which featured prominent figures within the new york graffiti scene during the said period the book subway art and the documentary style wars were also among the first ways the mainstream public were introduced to hip hop graffiti graffiti remains part of hip hop while crossing into the mainstream

dancer and displaying tongueincheek bravado breaking also called bboyingbgirling or breakdancing is a dynamic rhythmic style of dance which developed as one of the major elements of hip hop culture like many aspects of hip hop culture breakdance borrows heavily from many cultures including sera street dancing brazilian and asian martial arts russian folk dance and the dance moves of james brown michael jackson and california funk breaking took form in the south bronx in the s alongside the other elements of hip hop breakdancing is typically done with the accompaniment of hip hop music playing on a boom box or pa system according to the  documentary film the freshest kids a history of the bboy dj kool herc describes the b in bboy as short for breaking which at the time was slang for going off also one of the original names for the dance however early on the dance was known as the boing the sound a spring makes dancers at dj kool hercs parties saved their best dance moves for the percussion break section of the song getting in front of the audience to dance in a distinctive frenetic style the b in bboy or bgirl also stands simply for break as in breakboy or girl before the s bgirls’ presence was limited by their gender minority status navigating sexual politics of a masculinedominated scene and a lack of representation or encouragement for women to participate in the form the few bgirls who participated despite facing gender discrimination carved out a space for women as leaders within the breaking community and the number of bgirls participating has increased breaking

beatboxingedit biz markie is noted for his beatboxing skills he is holding the mic close to his mouth a technique beatboxers use to imitate deep basslines and bass drums by exploiting the proximity effect beatboxing is the technique of vocal percussion in which a singer imitates drums and other percussion instruments with her or his voice it is primarily concerned with the art of creating beats or rhythms using the human mouth the term beatboxing is derived from the mimicry of the first generation of drum machines then known as beatboxes it was first popularized by doug e fresh as it is a way of creating hip hop music it can be categorized under the production element of hip hop though it does sometimes include a type of rapping intersected with the humancreated beat it is generally considered to be part of the same pillar of hip hop as djing—in other words providing a musical backdrop or foundation for mcs to rap over beatboxers can create their beats just naturally but many of the beatboxing effects are enhanced by using a microphone plugged into a pa system this helps the beatboxer to make their beatboxing loud enough to be heard alongside a rapper mc turntablist and other hip hop artists beatboxing was popular in the s with prominent artists like the darren buffy the human beat box robinson of the fat boys and biz markie displaying their skills within the media it declined in popularity along with bboying in the late s but has undergone a resurgence since the late s marked by the release of make the music  by rahzel of the roots beatmakingproducingedit a typical rap drum beat written in drum notation although it is not described as one of the four core elements that make up hip hop music producing is another important element in music record producers play a similar role in sound recording that film directors play in making a movie the record producer recruits and selects artists rappers mcs djs beatboxers and so on plans the vision for the recording session coaches the performers on their songs chooses audio engineers sets out a budget for hiring the artists and technical experts and oversees the entire project the exact roles of a producer depend on each individual but some producers work with djs and drum machine programmers to create beats coach the djs in the selection of sampled basslines riffs and catch phrases give advice to rappers vocalists mcs and other artists give suggestions to performers on how to improve their flow and develop a unique personal style some producers work closely with the audio engineer to provide ideas on mixing effects units eg autotuned vocal effects such as those popularized by tpain micing of artists and so on the producer may independently develop the concept or vision for a project or album or develop the vision in collaboration with the artists and performers hip hop producer chilly chill behind a large audio console in a recording studio in hip hop since the beginning of mcing there have been producers who work in the studio behind the scenes to create the beats for mcs to rap over producers may find a beat they like on an old funk soul or disco record and then isolate the beat and turn it into a loop alternatively producers may create a beat with a drum machine or by hiring a drumkit percussionist to play acoustic drums the producer could even mix and layer different methods such as combining a sampled disco drum break with a drum machine track and some live newly recorded percussion parts or a live electric bass player a beat created by a hip hop producer may include other parts besides a drum beat such as a sampled bassline from a funk or disco song dialogue from a spoken word record or movie or rhythmic scratching and punches done by a turntablist or dj an early beatmaker was producer kurtis blow who won producer of the year credits in   and  known for the creation of sample and sample loops blow was considered the quincy jones of early hip hop a reference to the prolific african american record producer conductor arranger composer musician and bandleader those who create these beats are known as either beatmakers or producers however producers are known to have more input and direction on the overall the creation of a song or project while a beatmaker just provides or creates the beat as dr dre has said before once you finish the beat you have to produce the record the process of making beats includes sampling chopping looping sequencing beats recording mixing and mastering sam bos rap with computer gear in the studio most beats in hip hop are sampled from a preexisting record this means that a producer will take a portion or a sample of a song and reuse it as an instrumental section beat or portion of their song some examples of this are the isley brothers footsteps in the dark pts  and  being sampled to make ice cubes today was a good day another example is otis reddings try a little tenderness being sampled to create kanye west and jayzs otis chopping is dissecting the song that you are sampling so that you chop out the part or parts of the song be that the bassline rhythm guitar part drum break or other music you want to use in the beat looping is known as melodic or percussive sequence that repeats itself over a period of time so basically a producer will make an evennumber of bars of a beat eg four bars or eight bars repeat itself or loop of a full song length this loop provides an accompaniment for an mc to rap over while hip hop music makes a significant use of sampling old records using turntables and drum machines to create beats producers use electric and acoustic instruments on some songs pictured is an electric bass player at a hip hop show the tools needed to make beats in the late s were funk soul and other music genre records record turntables dj mixers audio consoles and relatively inexpensive portastudiostyle multitrack recording devices in the s and s beatmakers and producers used the new electronic and digital instruments that were developed suchas samplers sequencers drum machines and synthesizers from the s to the s various beatmakers and producers have used live instruments such as drum kit or electric bass on some tracks to record the finished beats or beat tracks beatmakers and producers use a variety of sound recording equipment typically multitrack recorders digital audio workstations also known as daws became more common in the s for producers some of the most used daws are fruity loops studio ableton live and pro tools daws have made it possible for more people to be able to make beats in their own home studio without going to a recording studio beatmakers who own daws do not have to buy all the hardware that a recording studio needed in the s huge  channel audio consoles multitrack recorders racks of rackmount effects units because era daws have everything they need to make beats on a good quality fast laptop computer beats are such an integral part of rap music that many producers have been able to make instrumental mixtapes or albums even though these instrumentals have no rapping listeners still enjoy the inventive ways the producer mixes different beats samples and instrumental melodies examples of these are th wonders tutenkhamen and j dillas donuts some hip hop records come in two versions a beat with rapping over it and an instrumental with just the beat the instrumental in this case is provided so that djs and turntablists can isolate breaks beats and other music to create new songs

because of its implications for understanding language learning identity and curriculum orlando patterson a sociology professor at harvard university helps describe the phenomenon of how hiphop has spread rapidly around the world patterson argues that mass communication is controlled by the wealthy the government and major businesses in third world nations and countries around the world he also credits mass communication with creating a global cultural hiphop scene as a result the youth are influenced by the american hiphop scene and start their own forms of hiphop patterson believes that revitalization of hiphop music will occur around the world as traditional values are mixed with american hiphop music and ultimately a global exchange process will develop that brings youth around the world to listen to a common musical form of hiphop it has also been argued that rap music formed as a cultural response to historic oppression and racism a system for communication among black communities throughout the united states this is due to the fact that the culture reflected the social economic and political realities of the disenfranchised youth in the s hiphop lyrics are starting to reflect original socially conscious themes rappers are starting to question the governments power and its oppressive role in some societies rap music has been a tool for political social and

patterned cockney slang and radio deejays hyping their audience using rhymes hip hop has a distinctive associated slang it is also known by alternate names such as black english or ebonics academics suggest its development stems from a rejection of the racial hierarchy of language which held white english as the superior form of educated speech due to hiphops commercial success in the lates and early s many of these words have been assimilated into the cultural discourse of several different dialects across america and the world and even to nonhip hop fans the word diss for example is particularly prolific there are also a number of words which predate hip hop but are often associated with the culture with homie being a notable example sometimes terms like what the dilly yo are popularized by a single song in this case put your hands where my eyes could see by busta rhymes and are only used briefly one particular example is the rulebased slang of snoop dogg and e who add izzle or izz to the end or middle of words hip hop lyricism has gained a measure of legitimacy in academic and literary circles studies of hip hop linguistics are now offered at institutions such as the university of toronto where poet and author george eliot clarke has taught the potential power of hip hop music to promote social change greg thomas of the university of miami offers courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level studying the feminist and assertive nature of lil kims lyrics some academics including ernest morrell and jeffrey duncanandrade compare hip hop to the satirical works of great western canon poets of the modern era who use imagery and create a mood to criticize society as quoted in their work promoting academic literacy with urban youth through engaging hip hop culture “ hip hop texts are rich in imagery and metaphor and can be used to teach irony tone diction and point of view hip hop texts can be analyzed for theme motif plot and character development both grand master flash and ts eliot gazed out into their rapidly deteriorating societies and saw a wasteland both poets were essentially apocalyptic in nature as they witnessed death disease and decay ” hip hop lyrics have also been known for containing swear words in particular the word bitch is seen in countless songs from a bitch iz a bitch by nwa to missy elliotts she is a bitch it is often used in the negative connotation of a woman who is a shallow money grubber some female artists have tried to reclaim the word and use it as a term of empowerment regardless the hiphop community has recently taken an interest in discussing the use of the word bitch and whether it is necessary in rap not only the particular words but also the choice of which language in which

has been censored on radio and television due to the explicit lyrics of certain genres many songs have been criticized for antiestablishment and sometimes violent messages the use of profanity as well as graphic depictions of violence and sex in hiphop music videos and songs makes it hard to broadcast on television stations such as mtv in music video form and on radio as a result many hiphop recordings are broadcast in censored format with offensive language bleeped or blanked out of the soundtrack or replaced with clean lyrics the result – which sometimes renders the remaining lyrics unintelligible or contradictory to the original recording – has become almost as widely identified with the genre as any other aspect of the music and has been parodied in films such as austin powers in goldmember in which mike myers character dr evil – performing in a parody of a hiphop music video hard knock life by jayz – performs an entire verse that is blanked out in  roger ebert wrote “ rap

distinctive urban apparel and looks have been an important way for rappers breakdancers and other hiphop community members to express themselves as the hiphop music genres popularity increased so did the effect of its fashion while there were early items synonymous with hiphop that crossed over into the mainstream culture like rundmcs affinity for adidas shoes or the wutang clans championing of

of baggy shirts jeans and jerseys as names like pharrell and jayz started their own clothing lines and still others like kanye west linked up with designers like louis vuitton the clothes got tighter

klein to tailor lines to the lucrative market of hip hop artists and fans ” artists now use brands as a means of supplemental income to their music or are creating and expanding their own brands that

hop fashion diversificationedit this section may need to be rewritten entirely to comply with wikipedias quality standards you can help the discussion page may contain suggestions march  main article list of hip hop genres breaking in ljubljana slovenia hiphop music has spawned dozens of subgenres which incorporate hip hop music production approaches such as sampling creating beats or rapping the diversification process stems from the appropriation of hip hop culture by other ethnic groups there are many varying social influences that affect hip hops message in different nations it is frequently used as a musical response to perceived political andor social injustices in south africa the largest form of hip hop is called kwaito which has had a growth similar to american hiphop kwaito is a direct reflection of a postapartheid south africa and is a voice for the voiceless a term that us hip hop is often referred to kwaito is even perceived as a lifestyle encompassing many aspects of life including language and fashion kwaito is a political and partydriven genre as performers use the music to express their political views and also to express their desire to have a good time kwaito is a music that came from a once hated and oppressed people but it is now sweeping the nation the main consumers of kwaito are adolescents and half of the south african population is under twentyone years of age some of the large kwaito artists have sold more than  albums and in an industry where  albums sold is considered a gold record those are impressive numbers kwaito allows the participation and creative engagement of otherwise socially excluded peoples in the generation of popular media south african hip hop is more diverse lately and there are hip hop acts in south africa that have made an impact and continue making impact worldwide these include tumi ben sharpa hiphop pantsula tuks senganga south sudanese musician emmanuel jal uses hip hop to heal wartorn african youth jal pictured at the tribeca film festival in new york in jamaica the sounds of hip hop are derived from american and jamaican influences jamaican hip hop is defined both through dancehall and reggae music jamaican kool herc brought the sound systems technology and techniques of reggae music to new york during the s jamaican hip hop artists often rap in both brooklyn and jamaican accents jamaican hip hop subject matter is often influenced by outside and internal forces outside forces such as the blingbling era of todays modern hip hop and internal influences coming from the use of anticolonialism and marijuana or ganja references which rastafarians believe bring them closer to god author wayne marshall argues that hip hop as with any number of africanamerican cultural forms before it offers a range of compelling and contradictory significations to jamaican artist and audiences from modern blackness to foreign mind transnational cosmopolitanism to militant panafricanism radical remixology to outright mimicry hip hop in jamaica embodies the myriad ways that jamaicans embrace reject and incorporate foreign yet familiar forms arabic hip hop artist klash loon in the developing world hip hop has made a considerable impact in the social context despite the lack of resources hip hop has made considerable inroads due to limited funds hip hop artists are forced to use very basic tools and even graffiti an important aspect of the hip hop culture is constrained due to its unavailability to the average person hip hop has begun making inroads with more than black artists there are number of other minority artists who are taking center stage as many first generation minority children come of age one example is rapper awkwafina an asianamerican who raps about being asian as well as being female she like many others use rap to express her experiences as a minority not necessarily to unite minorities together but to tell her story many hip hop artists that make it out of the developing world come to places like the united states in hopes of improving their situations maya arulpragasm aka mia is a sri lankaborn tamil hip hop artist in this situation she claims im just trying to build some sort of bridge im trying to create a third place somewhere in between the developed world and the developing world another music artist using hip hop to provide a positive message to young africans is emmanuel jal who is a former child soldier from south sudan jal is one of the few south sudanese music artists to have broken through on an international level with his unique form of hip hop and a positive message in his lyrics jal has attracted the attention of mainstream media and academics with his story and use of hip hop as a healing medium for warafflicted people in africa and has also been sought out for the international lecture circuit with major talks at popular talkfests like ted educationedit scholars argue that hiphop can have an empowering effect on youth while there is misogyny violence and drug use in rap music videos and lyrics hip hop also displays many positive themes of selfreliance resilience and selfesteem these messages can be inspiring for a youth living in poverty a lot of rap songs contain references to strengthening the africanamerican community promoting social causes social workers have used hip hop to build a relationship with atrisk youth and develop a deeper connection with the child hiphop has the potential to be taught as a way of helping people see the world more critically be it through forms of writing creating music or social activism the lyrics of hip hop have been used to learn about literary devices such as metaphor imagery irony tone theme motif plot and point of view organizations and facilities are providing spaces and programs for communities to explore making and learning about hiphop an example is the imp labs in regina saskatchewan canada many dance studios and colleges now offer lessons in hip hop alongside tap and ballet as well as krsone teaching hip hop lectures at harvard university hip hop producer th wonder and former rapperturned actor christopher play martin from hiphop group kidnplay have taught hip hop history classes at north carolina central university and th wonder has also taught a hip hop sampling soul class at duke university in  the cornell university library established a hip hop collection to collect and make accessible the historical artifacts of hip hop culture and to ensure their preservation for future generations values and philosophyedit in hip hop culture it is considered essential to keep it real or to be authentic to the lived experiences of people from disadvantaged neighborhoods the ghetto despite the fact that hip hop artists typically use imagined scenarios and fictionalized stories in their raps the culture demands that they act as if all their lyrics are true or potentially true because of this lyrics of rap songs have often been treated as confessions to a number of violent crimes in the united states it is also considered to be the duty of rappers and other hip hop artists djs dancers to represent their city and neighborhood this demands being proud of being from disadvantaged cities neighborhoods that have traditionally been a source of shame and glorifying them in lyrics and graffiti this has potentially been one of the ways that hip hop has become regarded as a local rather than foreign genre of music in so many countries around the world in just a few decades nevertheless sampling and borrowing from a number of genres and places is also a part of the hip hop milieu and an album like the surprise hit kala by anglotamil rapper mia was recorded in locations all across the world and features sounds from a different country on every track authenticityedit graffiti depicting us rapper  cent larry nager of the cincinnati enquirer wrote that  cent has earned the right to use the trappings of gangsta rap – the macho posturing the guns the drugs the big cars and magnums of champagne hes not a poseur pretending to be a gangsta hes the real thing hip hop music artists and advocates have stated that hip hop has been an authentic true and real africanamerican artistic form and expressive cultural form since its emergence in innercity bronx neighborhoods in the s as well some music critics scholars and political commentators have denied hip hops authenticity advocates who claim hip hop is an authentic music genre state that it is an ongoing response to the violence and discrimination experienced by black people in the united states from the slavery that existed into the th century to the lynchings of the th century and the ongoing racial discrimination faced by blacks paul gilroy and alexander weheliye state that unlike disco jazz rb house music and other genres that were developed in the africanamerican community and which were quickly adopted and then increasingly controlled by white music industry executives hip hop has remained largely controlled by african american artists producers and executives in his book phonographies weheliye describes the political and cultural affiliations that hip hop music enables in contrast greg tate states that the marketdriven commodity form of commercial hip hop has uprooted the genre from the celebration of africanamerican culture and the messages of protest that predominated in its early forms tate states that the commodification and commercialization of hip hop culture undermines the dynamism of the genre for africanamerican communities these two dissenting understandings of hip hops scope and influence frame debates that revolve around hip hops possession of or lack of authenticity anticipating the market arguments of tate and others both gilroy and weheliye assert that hip hop has always had a different function than western popular music as a whole a function that exceeds the constraints of market capitalism weheliye notes popular music generally in the form of recordings has and still continues to function as one of the main channels of communication between the different geographical and cultural points in the african diaspora allowing artists to articulate and perform their diasporic citizenship to international audiences and establish conversations with other diasporic communities for paul gilroy hip hop proves an outlet of articulation and a sonic space in which african americans can exert control and influence that they often lack in other sociopolitical and economic domains in phonographies weheyliye explains how new sound technologies used in hip hop encourage diasporic citizenship and africanamerican cultural and political activities gilroy states that the power of hip hop music lies in developing black struggles by communicating information organizing consciousness and testing out or deployingindividual or collective forms of africanamerican cultural and political actions in the third chapter of the black atlantic jewels brought from bondage black music and the politics of authenticity gilroy asserts that these elements influence the production of and the interpretation of black cultural activities what gilroy calls the black atlantic musics rituals and traditions are a more expansive way of thinking about africanamerican blackness a way that moves beyond contemporary debates around essentialist and antiessentialist arguments as such gilroy states that music has been and remains a central staging ground for debates over the work responsibility and future role of black cultural and artistic productionh traditional hip hop vs progressive viewsedit ever since the overcommercialization of hiphop occurred between the late s and the mid s at peak traditional hip hop supporters have been in a feud with more progressive hip hop fans claiming that they are uneducated towards what they are building and that it they are not only building music that steps further and further away from hip hop but causes ignorance and misconceptions between fans of more progressed hip hop and traditional fans of the hip hop culture these views have been narrowed heavily over the past couple of years and have experienced change of views from the traditional side as well as acceptance towards evolution of hip hop however all of these beliefs seem to still be viewed under very specific sets of morals and ethics such as that one does not take themselves away or deny the true past of hiphop doing such would result in ignorance of the history of hip hop and a completely disconnected community of fans who become uncertain as to what truly should be considered hip hop fans of more progressed hip hop have received both acclaim due to innovation and futuristic views as well as strong criticism due to lack of proper education and what is felt as a completely changed form of values rather than evolved like most grassroots cultures hip hop initially rejected the views and support of the mainstream industry however eventually learned to be content due to the understanding of what opportunity and voice could be given the father of hip hop dj kool herc recently criticized the cancelled netflix series the get down due to its lack of viewer response by calling it the let down and that legendary hip hop dj grandmaster flash is grandmaster trash herc criticized the whole production for their misrepresentations of history and culture however he did state that he does support many stars in rap today such as lil wayne and drake who clearly do not support hip hop in anyway traditional herc and many other old school hip hop legends such as afrika bambaataa and grandmaster caz originally held views against mainstream rap however recent interviews have shown to prove that even they have changed their ways to a certain extent however rappers like krsone still feel a strong disapproval of the rap industry especially through mainstream media in bboying most supporters have began to slowly involve more industry sponsorship through events on the world bboy series and through the udef powered by silverback open other bboys have began to accept using the term breakdance but only if the term bboying is too difficult to communicate to the general public regardless of such bboys and bgirls still exist to showing lack of support to jams and events that they feel represent the culture as a sport form of entertainment and as well through capitalism battle rap as an industry has also been strongly supported by oldschool goldenera legends such as herc kid capri and krsone  receptionedit commercialization and stereotypingedit in  hip hop and rap pioneer chuck d from the group public enemy criticized young hip hop artists from the s stating that they have taken a music genre with extensive roots in underground music and turned it into commercialized pop music in particular seminal figures in the early underground politicallymotivated music such as ice t have criticized current hip hop artists for being more concerned with image than substance critics have stated that s hip hop artists are contributing to cultural stereotyping of africanamerican culture and are poseur gangsters critics have also stated that hip hop music promotes drug use and violence comedian bill cosby states that hip hop brings young black people down though his criticism is focused mainly on crime and violenceglorifying gangsta rap and it ignores other rap genres that empower black youth hip hop has been criticized by rockcentric critics who state that hip hop is not a true art form and who state that rock and roll music is more authentic these critics are advocating a viewpoint called rockism which favors music written and performed by the individual artist as seen in some famous singersongwriterled rock bands and is against s decadeera hip hop which these critics argue give too large a role to record producers and digital sound recording hip hop is seen as being too violent and explicit in comparison with rock some contend that the criticisms have racial overtones as these critics deny that hip hop is an art form and praising rock genres that prominently feature white males marginalization of womenedit hip hop artist lauryn hill has been successful as a solo performer and as a member of the fugees this photo shows her performing at the ottawa bluesfest in  the hip hop music genre and its subculture has been criticized for its gender bias and its negative impacts on women in africanamerican culture gangsta rap artists such as eazye dr dre and snoop dogg have song lyrics that portray women as sex toys and as people who are inferior to and dependent on men between  and  over  hip hop songs had lyrics that described violence toward women including rape assault and murder these antiwomen hip hop lyrics have led some male listeners to make physical threats toward women and they have created negative stereotypes of young urban africanamerican women hip hop music promotes masculine hegemony and it depicts women as individuals who must rely on men the portrayal of women in hip hop lyrics and videos tends to be violent degrading and highly sexualized there is a high frequency of songs with lyrics that are demeaning or depict sexual violence or sexual assault towards women videos often portray idealized female bodies and depict women as being the object of male pleasure very few female artists have been recognized in hip hop and the most popular successful and influential artists record producers and music executives are males women who are in rap groups such as lauryn hill of the fugees tend to have less advantages and opportunities than male artists female artists have received little to no recognition in hip hop only one female artist has won best rap album of the year at the grammy awards since the category was added in  in addition african american female hip hop artists have been recognized even less in the industry besides icons like lauryn hill white rapper iggy azalea is the first female hip hop artist to get a number one single on the american pop charts homophobia and transphobiaedit as well the hip hop music community has been criticized for its homophobia and transphobia hip hop song lyrics contain offensive homophobic slurs most popularly the pejorative term faggot and sometimes violent threats towards queer people such as rapper dmxs where the hood at rapper eazyes nobody move rap group brand nubians punks jump up to get beat down many rappers and hip hop artists have advocated homophobia andor transphobia these artists include ja rule who in an interview claimedwe need to go step to mtv and viacom and lets talk

transgender rappers until the s hip hop music has excluded the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt community this has perpetuated a culture in hip hop that is prejudiced towards queer and trans people making it a tough culture for queer artists to participate in despite this prejudice some queergenderqueer rappers and hip hop artists have become successful and popular in the s one of the more notable members of the lgbt community in hip hop is frank ocean who came out in  and has released critically acclaimed albums and won two grammy awards other successful queer hip hoprap artists

elliott and mc lyte have made great strides since the hip hop industry first began by producing music and an image that did not cater to the hypersexualized stereotypes of black women in hip hop these women pioneered a revitalized and empowering image of black women in hip hop though many hip hop artists have embraced the ideals that effectively disenfranchise black female artists many others choose to employ forms of resistance that counteract these negative portrayals of women in hip hop and offer a different narrative these artists seek to expand ways of traditional thinking through different ways of cultural expression in this effort they hope to elicit a response to female hip hop artists not with a misogynist lens but with one that validates womens struggle while women have been marginalized in hip hops music industryaccording to whom established artists like missy elliott lil kim and others are providing mentorship for new female mcs in addition there is a vibrant scene outside the mainstream that provides an opportunity for women and their music to flourish rap music has the power to influence how we view black women in our society queen latifah used her

people unfamiliar with hip hop culture often use the expression hip hop to refer exclusively to hip hop music also called rap hip hop is characterized by anywhere from four to nine distinct elements or expressive realms of which hip hop music is only one element dj afrika bambaataa of the hip hop collective zulu nation outlined the pillars of hip hop culture coining the terms rapping also called

movementdance and graffiti art which he called aerosol writin visual art other elements of the hip hop subculture and arts movement beyond the main four are hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement intellectualphilosophical beatboxing a percussive vocal style street entrepreneurship africanamerican language and slang and hip hop fashion and style among others the south bronx hiphop scene emerged in the s and s from neighbourhood block parties thrown by the ghetto brothers a puerto rican group that has been described as being a gang a club and a music group members of the scene plugged in the amplifiers for their instruments and pa speakers into the lampposts on rd street and prospect avenue and used their live music events to break down racial barriers between africanamericans puerto ricans and other ethnic groups jamaican immigrant dj kool herc also played a key role in developing hiphop music at  sedgwick avenue herc mixed samples of existing records and deejayed percussion breaks mixing this music with his own jamaicanstyle toasting a style of chanting and boastful talking over a microphone to rev up the crowd and dancers kool herc is credited as the father of hiphop for developing the key dj techniques that along with rapping founded the hip hop music style by creating rhythmic beats by looping breaks small portions of songs emphasizing a percussive pattern on two turntables this was later accompanied by rapping or mcing a rhythmic style of chanting or speaking poetrylyrics and beatboxing a percussive vocal technique used to create beats to go along with an mc or rappers rhymescitation needed an original form of dancing called breakdancing which later became accompanied by popping locking and other dance moves which was done to the accompaniment of hiphop songs played on boom boxes and particular styles of hiphop dress and hair also developed art historian robert farris thompson describes the youth from the south bronx in the earlys as englishspeaking blacks from barbados like grandmaster flash black jamaicans like dj kool herc who introduced the rhythms from salsa music as well as afro conga and bongo drums as well as many who emulated the sounds of tito puente and willie colón these youths mixed these influences with existing musical styles associated with africanamericans prior to the s from jazz to funk  hiphop music became popular outside of the africanamerican community in the lates with the mainstream commercial success of gangsta rap critic greg tate described the hip hop movement as the only avantgarde still around still delivering a shock of newness to the wealthy bourgeoisie ronald savage known by the nickname beestinger who was a former member of the zulu nation carved the term six elements of the hip hop movement the six elements of the hip hop movement are consciousness awareness civil rights awareness activism awareness justice political awareness and community awareness in music ronald savage is known as the son of the hip hop movement hip is the culture and hop is the movement hiphop culture has spread to both urban and suburban communities throughout the united states and subsequently the world these elements were adapted and developed considerably particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the s and subsequent decades even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms including hip hop theater and hip hop film the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hiphop culture hiphop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon the importance of sampling tracks beats and basslines from old records to the art form means that much of the culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings attitudes and experiences for modern audiences sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called flipping in hiphop culture hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier africanamericanrooted musical genres such as blues jazz ragtime funk and disco to become one of the most practiced genres worldwide in the s

etymologyedit keith cowboy wiggins a member of grandmaster flash and the furious five has been credited with coining the term in  while teasing a friend who had just joined the us army by scat singing the madeup words hiphophiphop in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of marching soldiers cowboy later worked the hip hop cadence into his stage performance the group frequently performed with disco artists who would refer to this new type of music by calling them hip hoppers the name was originally meant as a sign of disrespect but soon came to identify this new music and culture the song rappers delight by the sugarhill gang released in  begins with the phrase i said a hip hop the hippie the hippie to the hip hip hop and you dont stop lovebug starski a bronx dj who put out a single called the positive life in  and dj hollywood then began using the term when referring to this new disco rap music bill alder an independent consultant once said there was hardly ever a moment when rap music was underground one of the very first socalled rap records was a monster hit rappers delight by the sugar hill gang on sugarhill records hip hop pioneer and south bronx community leader afrika bambaataa also credits lovebug starski as the first to use the term hip hop as it relates to the culture bambaataa former leader of the black spades gang also did much to further popularize the term the words hip hop first appeared in print on september   in the village voice in a profile of bambaataa written by steven hager who also published the first comprehensive history of the culture with st martins press historyedit sedit dj jazzy jeff who is also a record producer manipulating a record turntable in england in  in the s an underground urban movement known as hip hop began to develop in the south bronx in new york city it focused on emceeing or mcing over breakbeats house parties and neighbourhood block party events held outdoors hip hop music has been a powerful medium for protesting the impact of legal institutions on minorities particularly police and prisons historically hip hop arose out of the ruins of a postindustrial and ravaged south bronx as a form of expression of urban black and latino youth whom the public and political discourse had written off as marginalized communities jamaicanborn dj clive kool herc cindy campbell pioneered the use of djing percussion breaks in hip hop music beginning at hercs home in a highrise apartment at  sedgwick avenue the movement later spread across the entire borough herc created the blueprint for hip hop music and culture by building upon the jamaican tradition of impromptu toasting a spoken type of boastful poetry and speech over music on august   dj kool herc was the dj at his sisters backtoschool party he extended the beat of a record by using two record players isolating the percussion breaks by using a mixer to switch between the two records hercs experiments with making music with record players became what we now know as breaking or scratching a second key musical element in hip hop music is emceeing also called mcing or rapping emceeing is the rhythmic spoken delivery of rhymes and wordplay delivered at first without accompaniment and later done over a beat this spoken style was influenced by the african american style of capping a performance where men tried to outdo each other in originality of their language and tried to gain the favor of the listeners the basic elements of hip hop—boasting raps rival posses groups uptown throwdowns and political and social commentary—were all long present in african american music mcing and rapping performers moved back and forth between the predominance of toasting songs packed with a mix of boasting slackness and sexual innuendo and a more topical political socially conscious style the role of the mc originally was as a master of ceremonies for a dj dance event the mc would introduce the dj and try to pump up the audience the mc spoke between the djs songs urging everyone to get up and dance mcs would also tell jokes and use their energetic language and enthusiasm to rev up the crowd eventually this introducing role developed into longer sessions of spoken rhythmic wordplay and rhyming which became rapping by  hip hop music had become a mainstream genre it spread across the world in the s with controversial gangsta rap herc also developed upon breakbeat deejaying where the breaks of funk songs—the part most suited to dance usually percussionbased—were isolated and repeated for the purpose of allnight dance parties this form of music playback using hard funk and rock formed the basis of hip hop music campbells announcements and exhortations to dancers would lead to the syncopated rhymed spoken accompaniment now known as rapping he dubbed his dancers breakboys and breakgirls or simply bboys and bgirls according to herc breaking was also street slang for getting excited and acting energetically dj kool herc is a pioneer in developing hip hop music djs such as grand wizzard theodore grandmaster flash and jazzy jay refined and developed the use of breakbeats including cutting and scratching the approach used by herc was soon widely copied and by the late s djs were releasing inch records where they would rap to the beat popular tunes included kurtis blows the breaks and the sugarhill gangs rappers delight herc and other djs would connect their equipment to power lines and perform at venues such as public basketball courts and at  sedgwick avenue bronx new york now officially a historic building the equipment consisted of numerous speakers turntables and one or more microphones by using this technique djs could create a variety of music but according to rap attack by david toop at its worst the technique could turn the night into one endless and inevitably boring song kc the prince of soul a rapperlyricist with pete dj jones is often credited with being the first rap lyricist to call himself an mc street gangs were prevalent in the poverty of the south bronx and much of the graffiti rapping and bboying at these parties were all artistic variations on the competition and oneupmanship of street gangs sensing that gang members often violent urges could be turned into creative ones afrika bambaataa founded the zulu nation a loose confederation of streetdance crews graffiti artists and rap musicians by the late s the culture had gained media attention with billboard magazine printing an article titled b beats bombarding bronx commenting on the local phenomenon and mentioning influential figures such as kool herc the new york city blackout of  saw widespread looting arson and other citywide disorders especially in the bronx where a number of looters stole dj equipment from electronics stores as a result the hip hop genre barely known outside of the bronx at the time grew at an astounding rate from  onward afrika bambaataa with dj yutaka of universal zulu nation in  dj kool hercs house parties gained popularity and later moved to outdoor venues in order to accommodate more people hosted in parks these outdoor parties became a means of expression and an outlet for teenagers where instead of getting into trouble on the streets teens now had a place to expend their pentup energy tony tone a member of the cold crush brothers stated that hip hop saved a lot of lives for innercity youth participating in hip hop culture became a way of dealing with the hardships of life as minorities within america and an outlet to deal with the risk of violence and the rise of gang culture mc kid lucky mentions that people used to breakdance against each other instead of fightingfull citation needed inspired by dj kool herc afrika bambaataa created a street organization called universal zulu nation centered around hip hop as a means to draw teenagers out of gang life drugs and violence the lyrical content of many early rap groups focused on social issues most notably in the seminal track the message by grandmaster flash and the furious five which discussed the realities of life in the housing projects young black americans coming out of the civil rights movement have used hip hop culture in the s and s to show the limitations of the movement hip hop gave young african americans a voice to let their issues be heard like rockandroll hip hop is vigorously opposed by conservatives because it romanticises violence lawbreaking and gangs it also gave people a chance for financial gain by reducing the rest of the world to consumers of its social concerns in late  debbie harry of blondie took nile rodgers of chic to such an event as the main backing track used was the break from chics good times the new style influenced harry and blondies later hit single from  rapture became the first major single containing hip hop elements by a white group or artist to hit number one on the us billboard hot —the song itself is usually considered new wave and fuses heavy pop music elements but there is an extended rap by harry near the end ronald beestinger savage is an entrepreneur hiphop artist author and activist sedit hip hop as a culture was further defined in  when afrika bambaataa and the soulsonic force released the electrofunk track planet rock instead of simply rapping over disco beats bambaataa with producer arthur baker created an electronic sound taking advantage of the rapidly improving drum machine roland tr synthesizer technology as well as sampling from kraftwerk planet rock is widely regarded as a turning point fusing electro with hip hop was like a light being switched on resulting in a new genre other groundbreaking records released in  were the message by grandmaster flash and the furious five nunk by warp  man parrishs hip hop be

graffiti art mcingrapping djing and bboying hip hop became the dominant cultural movement of the minoritypopulated urban communities in the s the s also saw many artists make social statements through hip hop in  melle mel and duke bootee recorded the message officially credited to grandmaster flash and the furious five a song that foreshadowed the socially conscious statements of rundmcs its like that and public enemys black steel in the hour of chaos during the s hip hop also embraced the creation of rhythm by using the human body via the vocal percussion technique of beatboxing pioneers such as doug e fresh biz markie and buffy from the fat boys made beats rhythm and musical sounds using their mouth lips tongue voice and other body parts human beatbox artists would also sing or imitate turntablism scratching or other instrument sounds the appearance of music videos changed entertainment they often glorified urban neighborhoods the music video for planet rock showcased the subculture of hip hop musicians graffiti artists and bboysbgirls many hip hoprelated films were released between  and  among them wild style beat street krush groove breakin and the documentary style wars these films expanded the appeal of hip hop beyond the boundaries of new york by  youth worldwide were embracing the hip hop culture the hip hop artwork and slang of us urban communities quickly found its way to europe as the cultures global appeal took rootcitation needed the four traditional dances of hip hop are rocking bboyingbgirling locking and popping all of which trace their origins to the late s or early s women artists have also been at the forefront of the hip hop movement since its inception in the bronx nevertheless as gangsta rap became the dominant force in hip hop music there were many songs with misogynistic antiwomen lyrics and many music videos depicted women in a sexualized fashion the negation of female voice and perspective is an issue that has come to define mainstream hip hop music the recording industry is less willing to back female artists than their male counterparts and when it does back them often it places emphasis on their sexuality over their musical substance and artistic abilities since the turn of the century the beginning of the s decade female hip hop artists have struggled to get mainstream attention with only a few such as older artists like the female duo salt n pepa to more contemporary ones like lil kim and nicki minaj reaching platinum status sedit icet with the commercial success of gangsta rap in the early s the emphasis in lyrics shifted to drugs violence and misogyny early proponents of gangsta rap included groups and artists such as icet who recorded what some consider to be the first gangster rap record  n the mornin and nwa whose second album niggazlife became the first gangsta rap album to enter the charts at number one gangsta rap also played an important part in hip hop becoming a mainstream commodity that albums such as nwas straight outta compton eazyes eazyduzit and ice cubes amerikkkas most wanted were selling in such high numbers meant that black teens were no longer hip hops sole buying audience as a result gangsta rap became a platform for artists who chose to use their music to spread political and social messages to parts of the country that were previously unaware of the conditions of ghettos while hip hop music now appeals to a broader demographic media critics argue that socially and politically conscious hip hop has been largely disregarded by mainstream america global

are also instances of fusion genres hip hop culture has grown from the avoided genre to a genre that is followed by  million fans worldwide this was made possible by the adaptation of music in

of hip hop is not always welcomed this is somewhat the case in jamaica the homeland of the cultures father dj kool herc however despite hip hop music produced on the island lacking widespread local and international recognition artists such as five steez have defied the odds by impressing online hip hop tastemakers and even reggae critics hartwig vens argues that hip hop can also be viewed as a global learning experience author jeff chang argues that the essence of hip hop is the cipher born in the bronx where competition and community feed each other he also adds thousands of organizers from cape town to paris use hip hop in their communities to address environmental justice policing and prisons media justice and education while hip hop music has been criticized as a music that creates a divide between western music and music from the rest of the world a musical cross pollination has taken place which strengthens the power of hip hop to influence different communities hip hops messages allow the underprivileged and the mistreated to be heard these cultural translations cross borders while the music may be from a foreign country the message is something that many people can relate to something not foreign at all even when hip hop is transplanted to other countries it often retains its vital progressive agenda that challenges the status quo in gothenburg sweden

producers managers and artists and repertoire staff politicians and businesspeople maligned and ignored the hip hop movement most hip hop artists performed in their local communities and recorded in underground scenes however in the late s music industry executives realized that they could capitalize on the success of gangsta rap they made a formula that created a titillating buffet of hypermasculinity and glorified violence this type of rap was marketed to the new fanbase white males they ignored the depictions of a harsh reality to focus on the sex and violence involved in an article for the village voice greg tate argues that the commercialization of hip hop is a negative and pervasive phenomenon writing that what we call hiphop is now inseparable from what we call the hip hop industry in which the nouveau riche and the superrich employers get richer ironically this commercialization coincides with a decline in rap sales and pressure from critics of the genre even other musicians like nas and krsone have claimed hip hop is dead in that it has changed so much over the years to cater to the consumer that it has lost the essence for which it was originally created however in his book in search of africa manthia diawara states that hip hop is really a voice of people who are marginalized in modern society he argues that the worldwide spread of hip hop as a market revolution is actually global expression of poor peoples desire for the good life and that this struggle aligns with the nationalist struggle for citizenship and belonging but also reveals the need to go beyond such struggles and celebrate the redemption of the black individual through tradition the problem may not be that female rappers do not have the same opportunities and recognition as their male counterparts it may be that the music industry that is so defined by gender biases industry executives seem to bet on the idea that men won’t want to listen to female rappers so they are given fewer opportunities as the hip hop genre has changed since the s the africanamerican cultural tradition that diawara describes has little place in hip hops mainstream artists music the push toward materialism and market success by contemporary rappers such as rick ross lil wayne and jay z has irked older hip hop fans and artists they see the genre losing its communitybased feel that focused more on black empowerment than wealth the commercialization of the genre stripped it of its earlier political nature and the politics and marketing plans of major record labels have forced rappers to craft their music and images to appeal to white affluent and suburban audiences after realizing her friends were making music but not getting television exposure other than what was seen on video music box darlene lewis modellyricist along with darryl washington and dean carroll brought hip hop music to the first exposure cable show on paragon cable and then created the on broadway television show there rappers had opportunities be interviewed and have their music videos played this predated mtv or video soul on bet the commercialization has made hip hop less edgy and authentic but it also has enabled hip hop artists to become successful as top rappers grow wealthier and start more outside business ventures this can indicate a stronger sense of black aspiration as rappers such as jayz and kanye west establish themselves as artists and entrepreneurs more young black people have hopes of achieving their goals the lens through which one views the genres commercialization can make it seem positive or negative cultureedit djing and turntablism mcingrapping breakdancing graffiti art and beatboxing are the creative outlets that collectively make up hip hop culture and its revolutionary aesthetic like the blues these arts were developed by african american communities to enable people to make a statement whether political or emotional and participate in community activities these practices spread globally around the s as fans could make it their own and express themselves in new and creative ways in music dance and other arts djingedit dj qbert manipulating a record turntable at a turntablism competition in france in  djing and turntablism are the techniques of manipulating sounds and creating music and beats using two or more phonograph turntables or other sound sources such as tapes cds or digital audio files and a dj mixer that is plugged into a pa system one of the first few hip hop djs was kool dj herc who created hip hop in the s through the isolation and extending of breaks the parts of albums that focused solely on the percussive beat in addition to developing hercs techniques djs grandmaster flowers grandmaster flash grand wizzard theodore and grandmaster caz made further innovations with the introduction of scratching which has become one of the key sounds associated with hip hop music traditionally a dj will use two turntables simultaneously and mix between the two these are connected to a dj mixer an amplifier speakers and various electronic music equipment such as a microphone and effects units the dj mixes the two albums currently in rotation andor does scratching by moving one of the record platters while manipulating the crossfader on the mixer the result of mixing two records is a unique sound created by the seemingly combined sound of two separate songs into one song although there is considerable overlap between the two roles a dj is not the same as a record producer of a music track the development of djing was also influenced by new turntablism techniques such as beatmatching a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the technics sl mk  first sold in  which had a precise variable pitch control and a direct drive motor djs were often avid record collectors who would hunt through used record stores for obscure soul records and vintage funk recordings djs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences dj pete rock mixing with two turntables in the early years of hip hop the djs were the stars as they created new music and beats with their record players while djing and turntablism continue to be used in hip hop music in the s the star role has increasingly been taken by mcs since the late s due to innovative creative mcs such as kurtis blow and melle mel of grandmaster flashs crew the furious five who developed strong rapping skills however a number of djs have gained stardom nonetheless in recent years famous djs include

to spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics with a strong rhythmic accompaniment rapping typically features complex wordplay rapid delivery and a range of street slang some of which is unique to the hip hop subculture while rapping is often done over beats either done by a dj a beatboxer it can also be done without accompaniment it can be broken down into different components such as content flow rhythm and rhyme and delivery rapping is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to the beat of the music the use of the word rap to describe quick and slangy speech or witty repartee long predates the musical form mcing is a form of expression that is embedded within ancient african culture and oral tradition as throughout history verbal acrobatics or jousting involving

most notable graffiti pioneers say that they do not consider graffiti to be an element of hip hop including lady pink seen blade fargo cholly rock fuzz one and coco  lady pink says i don’t think graffiti is hiphop frankly i grew up with disco music theres a long background of graffiti as an entity unto itself and fargo says there is no correlation between hip hop and graffiti one has nothing to do with the other hip hop pioneer grandmaster flash has also questioned the connection between hip hop and graffiti saying you know what bugs me they put hip hop with graffiti how do they intertwine in america in the late s graffiti was used as a form of expression by political activists gangs such as the savage skulls la familia and savage nomads used graffiti to mark territory julio  was a puerto rican graffiti writer one of the first graffiti writers in new york city he was a member of the savage skulls gang and started writing his nickname in his neighborhood as early as  in  the new york times published an article taki  spawns pen pals about another graffiti writer with similar form taki  according to the article julio had been writing for a couple of years when taki began tagging his own name all around the city taki also states in the article that julio was busted and stopped writers following in the wake of taki and tracy  would add their street number to their nickname bomb cover a train with their work and let the subway take it—and their fame if it was impressive or simply pervasive enough—all city julio  never rose to takis fame because julio kept his

or logo tagging began in philadelphia and new york city and has expanded worldwide although tagging is considered as vandalism by law enforcement it is hip hops visual art and the tags are part of a complex symbol system with its own social codes and subculture rules bubble lettering held sway initially among writers from the bronx though the elaborate brooklyn style tracy  dubbed wildstyle would come to define the art the early trendsetters were joined in the s by artists like dondi futura  daze blade lee fab five freddy zephyr rammellzee crash kel noc  and lady pink the relationship between graffiti and hip hop culture arises both from early graffiti artists engaging in other aspects of hip hop culture graffiti is understood as a visual expression of rap music just as breaking is viewed as a physical expression the  film wild style is widely regarded as the first hip hop motion picture which featured prominent figures within the new york graffiti scene during the said period the book subway art and the documentary style wars were also among the first ways the mainstream public were introduced to hip hop graffiti graffiti remains part of hip hop while crossing into the mainstream

dancer and displaying tongueincheek bravado breaking also called bboyingbgirling or breakdancing is a dynamic rhythmic style of dance which developed as one of the major elements of hip hop culture like many aspects of hip hop culture breakdance borrows heavily from many cultures including sera street dancing brazilian and asian martial arts russian folk dance and the dance moves of james brown michael jackson and california funk breaking took form in the south bronx in the s alongside the other elements of hip hop breakdancing is typically done with the accompaniment of hip hop music playing on a boom box or pa system according to the  documentary film the freshest kids a history of the bboy dj kool herc describes the b in bboy as short for breaking which at the time was slang for going off also one of the original names for the dance however early on the dance was known as the boing the sound a spring makes dancers at dj kool hercs parties saved their best dance moves for the percussion break section of the song getting in front of the audience to dance in a distinctive frenetic style the b in bboy or bgirl also stands simply for break as in breakboy or girl before the s bgirls’ presence was limited by their gender minority status navigating sexual politics of a masculinedominated scene and a lack of representation or encouragement for women to participate in the form the few bgirls who participated despite facing gender discrimination carved out a space for women as leaders within the breaking community and the number of bgirls participating has increased breaking was documented in style wars and was later given more focus in fictional films such as wild style and beat street early acts include the rock steady crew and new york city breakerscitation needed beatboxingedit biz markie is noted for his beatboxing skills he is holding the mic close to his mouth a technique beatboxers use to imitate deep basslines and bass drums by exploiting the proximity effect beatboxing is the technique of vocal percussion in which a singer imitates drums and other percussion instruments with her or his voice it is primarily concerned with the art of creating beats or rhythms using the human mouth the term beatboxing is derived from the mimicry of the first generation of drum machines then known as beatboxes it was first popularized by doug e fresh as it is a way of creating hip hop music it can be categorized under the production element of hip hop though it does sometimes include a type of rapping intersected with the humancreated beat it is generally considered to be part of the same pillar of hip hop as djing—in other words providing a musical backdrop or foundation for mcs to rap over beatboxers can create their beats just naturally but many of the beatboxing effects are enhanced by using a microphone plugged into a pa system this helps the beatboxer to make their beatboxing loud enough to be heard alongside a rapper mc turntablist and other hip hop artists beatboxing was popular in the s with prominent artists like the darren buffy the human beat box robinson of the fat boys and biz markie displaying their skills within the media it declined in popularity along with bboying in the late s but has undergone a resurgence since the late s marked by the release of make the music  by rahzel of the roots beatmakingproducingedit a typical rap drum beat written in drum notation although it is not described as one of the four core elements that make up hip hop music producing is another important element in music record producers play a similar role in sound recording that film directors play in making a movie the record producer recruits and selects artists rappers mcs djs beatboxers and so on plans the vision for the recording session coaches the performers on their songs chooses audio engineers sets out a budget for hiring the artists and technical experts and oversees the entire project the exact roles of a producer depend on each individual but some producers work with djs and drum machine programmers to create beats coach the djs in the selection of sampled basslines riffs and catch phrases give advice to rappers vocalists mcs and other artists give suggestions to performers on how to improve their flow and develop a unique personal style some producers work closely with the audio engineer to provide ideas on mixing effects units eg autotuned vocal effects such as those popularized by tpain micing of artists and so on the producer may independently develop the concept or vision for a project or album or develop the vision in collaboration with the artists and performers hip hop producer chilly chill behind a large audio console in a recording studio in hip hop since the beginning of mcing there have been producers who work in the studio behind the scenes to create the beats for mcs to rap over producers may find a beat they like on an old funk soul or disco record and then isolate the beat and turn it into a loop alternatively producers may create a beat with a drum machine or by hiring a drumkit percussionist to play acoustic drums the producer could even mix and layer different methods such as combining a sampled disco drum break with a drum machine track and some live newly recorded percussion parts or a live electric bass player a beat created by a hip hop producer may include other parts besides a drum beat such as a sampled bassline from a funk or disco song dialogue from a spoken word record or movie or rhythmic scratching and punches done by a turntablist or dj an early beatmaker was producer kurtis blow who won producer of the year credits in   and  known for the creation of sample and sample loops blow was considered the quincy jones of early hip hop a reference to the prolific african american record producer conductor arranger composer musician and bandleader those who create these beats are known as either beatmakers or producers however producers are known to have more input and direction on the overall the creation of a song or project while a beatmaker just provides or creates the beat as dr dre has said before once you finish the beat you have to produce the record the process of making beats includes sampling chopping looping sequencing beats recording mixing and mastering sam bos rap with computer gear in the studio most beats in hip hop are sampled from a preexisting record this means that a producer will take a portion or a sample of a song and reuse it as an instrumental section beat or portion of their song some examples of this are the isley brothers footsteps in the dark pts  and  being sampled to make ice cubes today was a good day another example is otis reddings try a little tenderness being sampled to create kanye west and jayzs otis chopping is dissecting the song that you are sampling so that you chop out the part or parts of the song be that the bassline rhythm guitar part drum break or other music you want to use in the beat looping is known as melodic or percussive sequence that repeats itself over a period of time so basically a producer will make an evennumber of bars of a beat eg four bars or eight bars repeat itself or loop of a full song length this loop provides an accompaniment for an mc to rap over while hip hop music makes a significant use of sampling old records using turntables and drum machines to create beats producers use electric and acoustic instruments on some songs pictured is an electric bass player at a hip hop show the tools needed to make beats in the late s were funk soul and other music genre records record turntables dj mixers audio consoles and relatively inexpensive portastudiostyle multitrack recording devices in the s and s beatmakers and producers used the new electronic and digital instruments that were developed suchas samplers sequencers drum machines and synthesizers from the s to the s various beatmakers and producers have used live instruments such as drum kit or electric bass on some tracks to record the finished beats or beat tracks beatmakers and producers use a variety of sound recording equipment typically multitrack recorders digital audio workstations also known as daws became more common in the s for producers some of the most used daws are fruity loops studio ableton live and pro tools daws have made it possible for more people to be able to make beats in their own home studio without going to a recording studio beatmakers who own daws do not have to buy all the hardware that a recording studio needed in the s huge  channel audio consoles multitrack recorders racks of rackmount effects units because era daws have everything they need to make beats on a good quality fast laptop computer beats are such an integral part of rap music that many producers have been able to make instrumental mixtapes or albums even though these instrumentals have no rapping listeners still enjoy the inventive ways the producer mixes different beats samples and instrumental melodies examples of these are th wonders tutenkhamen and j dillas donuts some hip hop records come in two versions a beat with rapping over it and an instrumental with just the beat the instrumental in this case is provided so that djs and turntablists can isolate breaks beats and other music to create new songs social impactedit effectsedit a bboy performing in san francisco hiphop has made a considerable social impact since its inception in the s hiphop has also become relevant to the field of education because of its implications for understanding language learning identity and curriculum orlando patterson a sociology professor at harvard university helps describe the phenomenon of how hiphop has spread rapidly around the world patterson argues that mass communication is controlled by the wealthy the government and major businesses in third world nations and countries around the world he also credits mass communication with creating a global cultural hiphop scene as a result the youth are influenced by the american hiphop scene and start their own forms of hiphop patterson believes that revitalization of hiphop music will occur around the world as traditional values are mixed with american hiphop music and ultimately a global exchange process will develop that brings youth around the world to listen to a common musical form of hiphop it has also been argued that rap music formed as a cultural response to historic oppression and racism a system for communication among black communities throughout the united states this is due to the fact that the culture reflected the social economic and political realities of the disenfranchised youth in the s hiphop lyrics are starting to reflect original socially conscious themes rappers are starting to question the governments power and its oppressive role in some societies rap music has been a tool for political social and

patterned cockney slang and radio deejays hyping their audience using rhymes hip hop has a distinctive associated slang it is also known by alternate names such as black english or ebonics academics suggest its development stems from a rejection of the racial hierarchy of language which held white english as the superior form of educated speech due to hiphops commercial success in the lates and early s many of these words have been assimilated into the cultural discourse of several different dialects across america and the world and even to nonhip hop fans the word diss for example is particularly prolific there are also a number of words which predate hip hop but are often associated with the culture with homie being a notable example sometimes terms like what the dilly yo are popularized by a single song in this case put your hands where my eyes could see by busta rhymes and are only used briefly one particular example is the rulebased slang of snoop dogg and e who add izzle or izz to the end or middle of words hip hop lyricism has gained a measure of legitimacy in academic and literary circles studies of hip hop linguistics are now offered at institutions such as the university of toronto where poet and author george eliot clarke has taught the potential power of hip hop music to promote social change greg thomas of the university of miami offers courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level studying the feminist and assertive nature of lil kims lyrics some academics including ernest morrell and jeffrey duncanandrade compare hip hop to the satirical works of great western canon poets of the modern era who use imagery and create a mood to criticize society as quoted in their work promoting academic literacy with urban youth through engaging hip hop culture “ hip hop texts are rich in imagery and metaphor and can be used to teach irony tone diction and point of view hip hop texts can be analyzed for theme motif plot and character development both grand master flash and ts eliot gazed out into their rapidly deteriorating societies and saw a wasteland both poets were essentially apocalyptic in nature as they witnessed death disease and decay ” hip hop lyrics have also been known for containing swear words in particular the word bitch is seen in countless songs from a bitch iz a bitch by nwa to missy elliotts she is a bitch it is often used in the negative connotation of a woman who is a shallow money grubber some female artists have tried to reclaim the word and use it as a term of empowerment regardless the hiphop community has recently taken an interest in discussing the use of the word bitch and whether it is necessary in rap not only the particular words but also the choice of which language in which rap is widely debated topic in international hip hop in canada the use of nonstandard variants of french such as franglais a mix of french and english by groups such as dead obies or chiac such as

has been censored on radio and television due to the explicit lyrics of certain genres many songs have been criticized for antiestablishment and sometimes violent messages the use of profanity as well as graphic depictions of violence and sex in hiphop music videos and songs makes it hard to broadcast on television stations such as mtv in music video form and on radio as a result many hiphop recordings are broadcast in censored format with offensive language bleeped or blanked out of the soundtrack or replaced with clean lyrics the result – which sometimes renders the remaining lyrics unintelligible or contradictory to the original recording – has become almost as widely identified with the genre as any other aspect of the music and has been parodied in films such as austin powers in goldmember in which mike myers character dr evil – performing in a parody of a hiphop music video hard knock life by jayz – performs an entire verse that is blanked out in  roger ebert wrote “ rap

fashionedit rapper snoop dogg at a  show clothing hair and other styles have been a big part of hip hops social and cultural impact since the s although the styles have changed over the decades distinctive urban apparel and looks have been an important way for rappers breakdancers and other hiphop community members to express themselves as the hiphop music genres popularity increased so did the effect of its fashion while there were early items synonymous with hiphop that crossed over into the mainstream culture like rundmcs affinity for adidas shoes or the wutang clans championing of clarks’ wallabees it wasn’t until its commercial peak that hiphop fashion became influential starting in the mid to lates hip hop culture embraced some major designers and established a new connection with classic fashion brands such as ralph lauren calvin klein and tommy hilfiger all tapped into hiphop culture and gave very little in return moving into the new millennium hiphop fashion consisted of baggy shirts jeans and jerseys as names like pharrell and jayz started their own clothing lines and still others like kanye west linked up with designers like louis vuitton the clothes got tighter more classically fashionable and expensive as hiphop has a seen a shift in the means by which its artists express their masculinity from violence and intimidation to wealthflaunting and entrepreneurship it has also seen the emergence of rapper branding the modernday hip hop artist is no longer limited to music serving as their sole occupation or source of income by the earlys major apparel companies had realized the economic potential of tapping into hip hop culturetommy hilfiger was one of the first major fashion designers who actively courted rappers as a way of promoting his street wear by joining forces the artist and the corporation are able to jointly benefit from each others resources hiphop artists are trendsetters and tastemakers their fans range from minority groups who can relate to their professed struggles to majority groups who cannot truly relate but like to consume the fantasy of living a more masculine life the rappers provide the cool hip factor while the corporations deliver the product advertising and financial assets tommy hilfiger one of the first mainstream designers to actively court rappers as a way of promoting his street wear serves a prototypical example of the hip hipfashion collaborations “ in exchange for giving artists free wardrobes hilfiger found its name mentioned in both rhyming verses of rap songs and their ‘shoutout’ lyrics in which rap artists chant out thanks to friends and sponsors for their support hilfigers success convinced other large mainstream american fashion design companies like ralph lauren and calvin klein to tailor lines to the lucrative market of hip hop artists and fans ” artists now use brands as a means of supplemental income to their music or are creating and expanding their own brands that become their primary source of income as harry elam explains there has been a movement from the incorporation and redefinition of existing trends to actually designing and marketing products as hip hop fashion diversificationedit this section may need to be rewritten entirely to comply with wikipedias quality standards you can help the discussion page may contain suggestions march  main article list of hip hop genres breaking in ljubljana slovenia hiphop music has spawned dozens of subgenres which incorporate hip hop music production approaches such as sampling creating beats or rapping the diversification process stems from the appropriation of hip hop culture by other ethnic groups there are many varying social influences that affect hip hops message in different nations it is frequently used as a musical response to perceived political andor social injustices in south africa the largest form of hip hop is called kwaito which has had a growth similar to american hiphop kwaito is a direct reflection of a postapartheid south africa and is a voice for the voiceless a term that us hip hop is often referred to kwaito is even perceived as a lifestyle encompassing many aspects of life including language and fashion kwaito is a political and partydriven genre as performers use the music to express their political views and also to express their desire to have a good time kwaito is a music that came from a once hated and oppressed people but it is now sweeping the nation the main consumers of kwaito are adolescents and half of the south african population is under twentyone years of age some of the large kwaito artists have sold more than  albums and in an industry where  albums sold is considered a gold record those are impressive numbers kwaito allows the participation and creative engagement of otherwise socially excluded peoples in the generation of popular media south african hip hop is more diverse lately and there are hip hop acts in south africa that have made an impact and continue making impact worldwide these include tumi ben sharpa hiphop pantsula tuks senganga south sudanese musician emmanuel jal uses hip hop to heal wartorn african youth jal pictured at the tribeca film festival in new york in jamaica the sounds of hip hop are derived from american and jamaican influences jamaican hip hop is defined both through dancehall and reggae music jamaican kool herc brought the sound systems technology and techniques of reggae music to new york during the s jamaican hip hop artists often rap in both brooklyn and jamaican accents jamaican hip hop subject matter is often influenced by outside and internal forces outside forces such as the blingbling era of todays modern hip hop and internal influences coming from the use of anticolonialism and marijuana or ganja references which rastafarians believe bring them closer to god author wayne marshall argues that hip hop as with any number of africanamerican cultural forms before it offers a range of compelling and contradictory significations to jamaican artist and audiences from modern blackness to foreign mind transnational cosmopolitanism to militant panafricanism radical remixology to outright mimicry hip hop in jamaica embodies the myriad ways that jamaicans embrace reject and incorporate foreign yet familiar forms arabic hip hop artist klash loon in the developing world hip hop has made a considerable impact in the social context despite the lack of resources hip hop has made considerable inroads due to limited funds hip hop artists are forced to use very basic tools and even graffiti an important aspect of the hip hop culture is constrained due to its unavailability to the average person hip hop has begun making inroads with more than black artists there are number of other minority artists who are taking center stage as many first generation minority children come of age one example is rapper awkwafina an asianamerican who raps about being asian as well as being female she like many others use rap to express her experiences as a minority not necessarily to unite minorities together but to tell her story many hip hop artists that make it out of the developing world come to places like the united states in hopes of improving their situations maya arulpragasm aka mia is a sri lankaborn tamil hip hop artist in this situation she claims im just trying to build some sort of bridge im trying to create a third place somewhere in between the developed world and the developing world another music artist using hip hop to provide a positive message to young africans is emmanuel jal who is a former child soldier from south sudan jal is one of the few south sudanese music artists to have broken through on an international level with his unique form of hip hop and a positive message in his lyrics jal has attracted the attention of mainstream media and academics with his story and use of hip hop as a healing medium for warafflicted people in africa and has also been sought out for the international lecture circuit with major talks at popular talkfests like ted educationedit scholars argue that hiphop can have an empowering effect on youth while there is misogyny violence and drug use in rap music videos and lyrics hip hop also displays many positive themes of selfreliance resilience and selfesteem these messages can be inspiring for a youth living in poverty a lot of rap songs contain references to strengthening the africanamerican community promoting social causes social workers have used hip hop to build a relationship with atrisk youth and develop a deeper connection with the child hiphop has the potential to be taught as a way of helping people see the world more critically be it through forms of writing creating music or social activism the lyrics of hip hop have been used to learn about literary devices such as metaphor imagery irony tone theme motif plot and point of view organizations and facilities are providing spaces and programs for communities to explore making and learning about hiphop an example is the imp labs in regina saskatchewan canada many dance studios and colleges now offer lessons in hip hop alongside tap and ballet as well as krsone teaching hip hop lectures at harvard university hip hop producer th wonder and former rapperturned actor christopher play martin from hiphop group kidnplay have taught hip hop history classes at north carolina central university and th wonder has also taught a hip hop sampling soul class at duke university in  the cornell university library established a hip hop collection to collect and make accessible the historical artifacts of hip hop culture and to ensure their preservation for future generations values and philosophyedit in hip hop culture it is considered essential to keep it real or to be authentic to the lived experiences of people from disadvantaged neighborhoods the ghetto despite the fact that hip hop artists typically use imagined scenarios and fictionalized stories in their raps the culture demands that they act as if all their lyrics are true or potentially true because of this lyrics of rap songs have often been treated as confessions to a number of violent crimes in the united states it is also considered to be the duty of rappers and other hip hop artists djs dancers to represent their city and neighborhood this demands being proud of being from disadvantaged cities neighborhoods that have traditionally been a source of shame and glorifying them in lyrics and graffiti this has potentially been one of the ways that hip hop has become regarded as a local rather than foreign genre of music in so many countries around the world in just a few decades nevertheless sampling and borrowing from a number of genres and places is also a part of the hip hop milieu and an album like the surprise hit kala by anglotamil rapper mia was recorded in locations all across the world and features sounds from a different country on every track authenticityedit graffiti depicting us rapper  cent larry nager of the cincinnati enquirer wrote that  cent has earned the right to use the trappings of gangsta rap – the macho posturing the guns the drugs the big cars and magnums of champagne hes not a poseur pretending to be a gangsta hes the real thing hip hop music artists and advocates have stated that hip hop has been an authentic true and real africanamerican artistic form and expressive cultural form since its emergence in innercity bronx neighborhoods in the s as well some music critics scholars and political commentators have denied hip hops authenticity advocates who claim hip hop is an authentic music genre state that it is an ongoing response to the violence and discrimination experienced by black people in the united states from the slavery that existed into the th century to the lynchings of the th century and the ongoing racial discrimination faced by blacks paul gilroy and alexander weheliye state that unlike disco jazz rb house music and other genres that were developed in the africanamerican community and which were quickly adopted and then increasingly controlled by white music industry executives hip hop has remained largely controlled by african american artists producers and executives in his book phonographies weheliye describes the political and cultural affiliations that hip hop music enables in contrast greg tate states that the marketdriven commodity form of commercial hip hop has uprooted the genre from the celebration of africanamerican culture and the messages of protest that predominated in its early forms tate states that the commodification and commercialization of hip hop culture undermines the dynamism of the genre for africanamerican communities these two dissenting understandings of hip hops scope and influence frame debates that revolve around hip hops possession of or lack of authenticity anticipating the market arguments of tate and others both gilroy and weheliye assert that hip hop has always had a different function than western popular music as a whole a function that exceeds the constraints of market capitalism weheliye notes popular music generally in the form of recordings has and still continues to function as one of the main channels of communication between the different geographical and cultural points in the african diaspora allowing artists to articulate and perform their diasporic citizenship to international audiences and establish conversations with other diasporic communities for paul gilroy hip hop proves an outlet of articulation and a sonic space in which african americans can exert control and influence that they often lack in other sociopolitical and economic domains in phonographies weheyliye explains how new sound technologies used in hip hop encourage diasporic citizenship and africanamerican cultural and political activities gilroy states that the power of hip hop music lies in developing black struggles by communicating information organizing consciousness and testing out or deployingindividual or collective forms of africanamerican cultural and political actions in the third chapter of the black atlantic jewels brought from bondage black music and the politics of authenticity gilroy asserts that these elements influence the production of and the interpretation of black cultural activities what gilroy calls the black atlantic musics rituals and traditions are a more expansive way of thinking about africanamerican blackness a way that moves beyond contemporary debates around essentialist and antiessentialist arguments as such gilroy states that music has been and remains a central staging ground for debates over the work responsibility and future role of black cultural and artistic productionh traditional hip hop vs progressive viewsedit ever since the overcommercialization of hiphop occurred between the late s and the mid s at peak traditional hip hop supporters have been in a feud with more progressive hip hop fans claiming that they are uneducated towards what they are building and that it they are not only building music that steps further and further away from hip hop but causes ignorance and misconceptions between fans of more progressed hip hop and traditional fans of the hip hop culture these views have been narrowed heavily over the past couple of years and have experienced change of views from the traditional side as well as acceptance towards evolution of hip hop however all of these beliefs seem to still be viewed under very specific sets of morals and ethics such as that one does not take themselves away or deny the true past of hiphop doing such would result in ignorance of the history of hip hop and a completely disconnected community of fans who become uncertain as to what truly should be considered hip hop fans of more progressed hip hop have received both acclaim due to innovation and futuristic views as well as strong criticism due to lack of proper education and what is felt as a completely changed form of values rather than evolved like most grassroots cultures hip hop initially rejected the views and support of the mainstream industry however eventually learned to be content due to the understanding of what opportunity and voice could be given the father of hip hop dj kool herc recently criticized the cancelled netflix series the get down due to its lack of viewer response by calling it the let down and that legendary hip hop dj grandmaster flash is grandmaster trash herc criticized the whole production for their misrepresentations of history and culture however he did state that he does support many stars in rap today such as lil wayne and drake who clearly do not support hip hop in anyway traditional herc and many other old school hip hop legends such as afrika bambaataa and grandmaster caz originally held views against mainstream rap however recent interviews have shown to prove that even they have changed their ways to a certain extent however rappers like krsone still feel a strong disapproval of the rap industry especially through mainstream media in bboying most supporters have began to slowly involve more industry sponsorship through events on the world bboy series and through the udef powered by silverback open other bboys have began to accept using the term breakdance but only if the term bboying is too difficult to communicate to the general public regardless of such bboys and bgirls still exist to showing lack of support to jams and events that they feel represent the culture as a sport form of entertainment and as well through capitalism battle rap as an industry has also been strongly supported by oldschool goldenera legends such as herc kid capri and krsone  receptionedit commercialization and stereotypingedit in  hip hop and rap pioneer chuck d from the group public enemy criticized young hip hop artists from the s stating that they have taken a music genre with extensive roots in underground music and turned it into commercialized pop music in particular seminal figures in the early underground politicallymotivated music such as ice t have criticized current hip hop artists for being more concerned with image than substance critics have stated that s hip hop artists are contributing to cultural stereotyping of africanamerican culture and are poseur gangsters critics have also stated that hip hop music promotes drug use and violence comedian bill cosby states that hip hop brings young black people down though his criticism is focused mainly on crime and violenceglorifying gangsta rap and it ignores other rap genres that empower black youth hip hop has been criticized by rockcentric critics who state that hip hop is not a true art form and who state that rock and roll music is more authentic these critics are advocating a viewpoint called rockism which favors music written and performed by the individual artist as seen in some famous singersongwriterled rock bands and is against s decadeera hip hop which these critics argue give too large a role to record producers and digital sound recording hip hop is seen as being too violent and explicit in comparison with rock some contend that the criticisms have racial overtones as these critics deny that hip hop is an art form and praising rock genres that prominently feature white males marginalization of womenedit hip hop artist lauryn hill has been successful as a solo performer and as a member of the fugees this photo shows her performing at the ottawa bluesfest in  the hip hop music genre and its subculture has been criticized for its gender bias and its negative impacts on women in africanamerican culture gangsta rap artists such as eazye dr dre and snoop dogg have song lyrics that portray women as sex toys and as people who are inferior to and dependent on men between  and  over  hip hop songs had lyrics that described violence toward women including rape assault and murder these antiwomen hip hop lyrics have led some male listeners to make physical threats toward women and they have created negative stereotypes of young urban africanamerican women hip hop music promotes masculine hegemony and it depicts women as individuals who must rely on men the portrayal of women in hip hop lyrics and videos tends to be violent degrading and highly sexualized there is a high frequency of songs with lyrics that are demeaning or depict sexual violence or sexual assault towards women videos often portray idealized female bodies and depict women as being the object of male pleasure very few female artists have been recognized in hip hop and the most popular successful and influential artists record producers and music executives are males women who are in rap groups such as lauryn hill of the fugees tend to have less advantages and opportunities than male artists female artists have received little to no recognition in hip hop only one female artist has won best rap album of the year at the grammy awards since the category was added in  in addition african american female hip hop artists have been recognized even less in the industry besides icons like lauryn hill white rapper iggy azalea is the first female hip hop artist to get a number one single on the american pop charts homophobia and transphobiaedit as well the hip hop music community has been criticized for its homophobia and transphobia hip hop song lyrics contain offensive homophobic slurs most popularly the pejorative term faggot and sometimes violent threats towards queer people such as rapper dmxs where the hood at rapper eazyes nobody move rap group brand nubians punks jump up to get beat down many rappers and hip hop artists have advocated homophobia andor transphobia these artists include ja rule who in an interview claimedwe need to go step to mtv and viacom and lets talk about all these fucking shows that they have on mtv that is promoting homosexuality that my kids can’t watch this shit and rap artist erick sermon who has said publiclyhip hop will never accept transgender rappers until the s hip hop music has excluded the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt community this has perpetuated a culture in hip hop that is prejudiced towards queer and trans people making it a tough culture for queer artists to participate in despite this prejudice some queergenderqueer rappers and hip hop artists have become successful and popular in the s one of the more notable members of the lgbt community in hip hop is frank ocean who came out in  and has released critically acclaimed albums and won two grammy awards other successful queer hip hoprap artists

elliott and mc lyte have made great strides since the hip hop industry first began by producing music and an image that did not cater to the hypersexualized stereotypes of black women in hip hop these women pioneered a revitalized and empowering image of black women in hip hop though many hip hop artists have embraced the ideals that effectively disenfranchise black female artists many others choose to employ forms of resistance that counteract these negative portrayals of women in hip hop and offer a different narrative these artists seek to expand ways of traditional thinking through different ways of cultural expression in this effort they hope to elicit a response to female hip hop artists not with a misogynist lens but with one that validates womens struggle while women have been marginalized in hip hops music industryaccording to whom established artists like missy elliott lil kim and others are providing mentorship for new female mcs in addition there is a vibrant scene outside the mainstream that provides an opportunity for women and their music to flourish rap music has the power to influence how we view black women in our society queen latifah used her awardwinning song unity to support to other women and to inform of the presence of women in the hip hop genre however many contemporary females in hip hop do not embody this mindset and counteract it

people unfamiliar with hip hop culture often use the expression hip hop to refer exclusively to hip hop music also called rap hip hop is characterized by anywhere from four to nine distinct elements or expressive realms of which hip hop music is only one element dj afrika bambaataa of the hip hop collective zulu nation outlined the pillars of hip hop culture coining the terms rapping also called

movementdance and graffiti art which he called aerosol writin visual art other elements of the hip hop subculture and arts movement beyond the main four are hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement intellectualphilosophical beatboxing a percussive vocal style street entrepreneurship africanamerican language and slang and hip hop fashion and style among others the south bronx hiphop scene emerged in the s and s from neighbourhood block parties thrown by the ghetto brothers a puerto rican group that has been described as being a gang a club and a music group members of the scene plugged in the amplifiers for their instruments and pa speakers into the lampposts on rd street and prospect avenue and used their live music events to break down racial barriers between africanamericans puerto ricans and other ethnic groups jamaican immigrant dj kool herc also played a key role in developing hiphop music at  sedgwick avenue herc mixed samples of existing records and deejayed percussion breaks mixing this music with his own jamaicanstyle toasting a style of chanting and boastful talking over a microphone to rev up the crowd and dancers kool herc is credited as the father of hiphop for developing the key dj techniques that along with rapping founded the hip hop music style by creating rhythmic beats by looping breaks small portions of songs emphasizing a percussive pattern on two turntables this was later accompanied by rapping or mcing a rhythmic style of chanting or speaking poetrylyrics and beatboxing a percussive vocal technique used to create beats to go along with an mc or rappers rhymescitation needed an original form of dancing called breakdancing which later became accompanied by popping locking and other dance moves which was done to the accompaniment of hiphop songs played on boom boxes and particular styles of hiphop dress and hair also developed art historian robert farris thompson describes the youth from the south bronx in the earlys as englishspeaking blacks from barbados like grandmaster flash black jamaicans like dj kool herc who introduced the rhythms from salsa music as well as afro conga and bongo drums as well as many who emulated the sounds of tito puente and willie colón these youths mixed these influences with existing musical styles associated with africanamericans prior to the s from jazz to funk  hiphop music became popular outside of the africanamerican community in the lates with the mainstream commercial success of gangsta rap critic greg tate described the hip hop movement as the only avantgarde still around still delivering a shock of newness to the wealthy bourgeoisie ronald savage known by the nickname beestinger who was a former member of the zulu nation carved the term six elements of the hip hop movement the six elements of the hip hop movement are consciousness awareness civil rights awareness activism awareness justice political awareness and community awareness in music ronald savage is known as the son of the hip hop movement hip is the culture and hop is the movement hiphop culture has spread to both urban and suburban communities throughout the united states and subsequently the world these elements were adapted and developed considerably particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the s and subsequent decades even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms including hip hop theater and hip hop film the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hiphop culture hiphop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon the importance of sampling tracks beats and basslines from old records to the art form means that much of the culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings attitudes and experiences for modern audiences sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called flipping in hiphop culture hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier africanamericanrooted musical genres such as blues jazz ragtime funk and disco to become one of the most practiced genres worldwide in the s

etymologyedit keith cowboy wiggins a member of grandmaster flash and the furious five has been credited with coining the term in  while teasing a friend who had just joined the us army by scat singing the madeup words hiphophiphop in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of marching soldiers cowboy later worked the hip hop cadence into his stage performance the group frequently performed with disco artists who would refer to this new type of music by calling them hip hoppers the name was originally meant as a sign of disrespect but soon came to identify this new music and culture the song rappers delight by the sugarhill gang released in  begins with the phrase i said a hip hop the hippie the hippie to the hip hip hop and you dont stop lovebug starski a bronx dj who put out a single called the positive life in  and dj hollywood then began using the term when referring to this new disco rap music bill alder an independent consultant once said there was hardly ever a moment when rap music was underground one of the very first socalled rap records was a monster hit rappers delight by the sugar hill gang on sugarhill records hip hop pioneer and south bronx community leader afrika bambaataa also credits lovebug starski as the first to use the term hip hop as it relates to the culture bambaataa former leader of the black spades gang also did much to further popularize the term the words hip hop first appeared in print on september   in the village voice in a profile of bambaataa written by steven hager who also published the first comprehensive history of the culture with st martins press historyedit sedit dj jazzy jeff who is also a record producer manipulating a record turntable in england in  in the s an underground urban movement known as hip hop began to develop in the south bronx in new york city it focused on emceeing or mcing over breakbeats house parties and neighbourhood block party events held outdoors hip hop music has been a powerful medium for protesting the impact of legal institutions on minorities particularly police and prisons historically hip hop arose out of the ruins of a postindustrial and ravaged south bronx as a form of expression of urban black and latino youth whom the public and political discourse had written off as marginalized communities jamaicanborn dj clive kool herc cindy campbell pioneered the use of djing percussion breaks in hip hop music beginning at hercs home in a highrise apartment at  sedgwick avenue the movement later spread across the entire borough herc created the blueprint for hip hop music and culture by building upon the jamaican tradition of impromptu toasting a spoken type of boastful poetry and speech over music on august   dj kool herc was the dj at his sisters backtoschool party he extended the beat of a record by using two record players isolating the percussion breaks by using a mixer to switch between the two records hercs experiments with making music with record players became what we now know as breaking or scratching a second key musical element in hip hop music is emceeing also called mcing or rapping emceeing is the rhythmic spoken delivery of rhymes and wordplay delivered at first without accompaniment and later done over a beat this spoken style was influenced by the african american style of capping a performance where men tried to outdo each other in originality of their language and tried to gain the favor of the listeners the basic elements of hip hop—boasting raps rival posses groups uptown throwdowns and political and social commentary—were all long present in african american music mcing and rapping performers moved back and forth between the predominance of toasting songs packed with a mix of boasting slackness and sexual innuendo and a more topical political socially conscious style the role of the mc originally was as a master of ceremonies for a dj dance event the mc would introduce the dj and try to pump up the audience the mc spoke between the djs songs urging everyone to get up and dance mcs would also tell jokes and use their energetic language and enthusiasm to rev up the crowd eventually this introducing role developed into longer sessions of spoken rhythmic wordplay and rhyming which became rapping by  hip hop music had become a mainstream genre it spread across the world in the s with controversial gangsta rap herc also developed upon breakbeat deejaying where the breaks of funk songs—the part most suited to dance usually percussionbased—were isolated and repeated for the purpose of allnight dance parties this form of music playback using hard funk and rock formed the basis of hip hop music campbells announcements and exhortations to dancers would lead to the syncopated rhymed spoken accompaniment now known as rapping he dubbed his dancers breakboys and breakgirls or simply bboys and bgirls according to herc breaking was also street slang for getting excited and acting energetically dj kool herc is a pioneer in developing hip hop music djs such as grand wizzard theodore grandmaster flash and jazzy jay refined and developed the use of breakbeats including cutting and scratching the approach used by herc was soon widely copied and by the late s djs were releasing inch records where they would rap to the beat popular tunes included kurtis blows the breaks and the sugarhill gangs rappers delight herc and other djs would connect their equipment to power lines and perform at venues such as public basketball courts and at  sedgwick avenue bronx new york now officially a historic building the equipment consisted of numerous speakers turntables and one or more microphones by using this technique djs could create a variety of music but according to rap attack by david toop at its worst the technique could turn the night into one endless and inevitably boring song kc the prince of soul a rapperlyricist with pete dj jones is often credited with being the first rap lyricist to call himself an mc street gangs were prevalent in the poverty of the south bronx and much of the graffiti rapping and bboying at these parties were all artistic variations on the competition and oneupmanship of street gangs sensing that gang members often violent urges could be turned into creative ones afrika bambaataa founded the zulu nation a loose confederation of streetdance crews graffiti artists and rap musicians by the late s the culture had gained media attention with billboard magazine printing an article titled b beats bombarding bronx commenting on the local phenomenon and mentioning influential figures such as kool herc the new york city blackout of  saw widespread looting arson and other citywide disorders especially in the bronx where a number of looters stole dj equipment from electronics stores as a result the hip hop genre barely known outside of the bronx at the time grew at an astounding rate from  onward afrika bambaataa with dj yutaka of universal zulu nation in  dj kool hercs house parties gained popularity and later moved to outdoor venues in order to accommodate more people hosted in parks these outdoor parties became a means of expression and an outlet for teenagers where instead of getting into trouble on the streets teens now had a place to expend their pentup energy tony tone a member of the cold crush brothers stated that hip hop saved a lot of lives for innercity youth participating in hip hop culture became a way of dealing with the hardships of life as minorities within america and an outlet to deal with the risk of violence and the rise of gang culture mc kid lucky mentions that people used to breakdance against each other instead of fightingfull citation needed inspired by dj kool herc afrika bambaataa created a street organization called universal zulu nation centered around hip hop as a means to draw teenagers out of gang life drugs and violence the lyrical content of many early rap groups focused on social issues most notably in the seminal track the message by grandmaster flash and the furious five which discussed the realities of life in the housing projects young black americans coming out of the civil rights movement have used hip hop culture in the s and s to show the limitations of the movement hip hop gave young african americans a voice to let their issues be heard like rockandroll hip hop is vigorously opposed by conservatives because it romanticises violence lawbreaking and gangs it also gave people a chance for financial gain by reducing the rest of the world to consumers of its social concerns in late  debbie harry of blondie took nile rodgers of chic to such an event as the main backing track used was the break from chics good times the new style influenced harry and blondies later hit single from  rapture became the first major single containing hip hop elements by a white group or artist to hit number one on the us billboard hot —the song itself is usually considered new wave and fuses heavy pop music elements but there is an extended rap by harry near the end ronald beestinger savage is an entrepreneur hiphop artist author and activist sedit hip hop as a culture was further defined in  when afrika bambaataa and the soulsonic force released the electrofunk track planet rock instead of simply rapping over disco beats bambaataa with producer arthur baker created an electronic sound taking advantage of the rapidly improving drum machine roland tr synthesizer technology as well as sampling from kraftwerk planet rock is widely regarded as a turning point fusing electro with hip hop was like a light being switched on resulting in a new genre other groundbreaking records released in  were the message by grandmaster flash and the furious five nunk by warp  man parrishs hip hop be

graffiti art mcingrapping djing and bboying hip hop became the dominant cultural movement of the minoritypopulated urban communities in the s the s also saw many artists make social statements through hip hop in  melle mel and duke bootee recorded the message officially credited to grandmaster flash and the furious five a song that foreshadowed the socially conscious statements of rundmcs its like that and public enemys black steel in the hour of chaos during the s hip hop also embraced the creation of rhythm by using the human body via the vocal percussion technique of beatboxing pioneers such as doug e fresh biz markie and buffy from the fat boys made beats rhythm and musical sounds using their mouth lips tongue voice and other body parts human beatbox artists would also sing or imitate turntablism scratching or other instrument sounds the appearance of music videos changed entertainment they often glorified urban neighborhoods the music video for planet rock showcased the subculture of hip hop musicians graffiti artists and bboysbgirls many hip hoprelated films were released between  and  among them wild style beat street krush groove breakin and the documentary style wars these films expanded the appeal of hip hop beyond the boundaries of new york by  youth worldwide were embracing the hip hop culture the hip hop artwork and slang of us urban communities quickly found its way to europe as the cultures global appeal took rootcitation needed the four traditional dances of hip hop are rocking bboyingbgirling locking and popping all of which trace their origins to the late s or early s women artists have also been at the forefront of the hip hop movement since its inception in the bronx nevertheless as gangsta rap became the dominant force in hip hop music there were many songs with misogynistic antiwomen lyrics and many music videos depicted women in a sexualized fashion the negation of female voice and perspective is an issue that has come to define mainstream hip hop music the recording industry is less willing to back female artists than their male counterparts and when it does back them often it places emphasis on their sexuality over their musical substance and artistic abilities since the turn of the century the beginning of the s decade female hip hop artists have struggled to get mainstream attention with only a few such as older artists like the female duo salt n pepa to more contemporary ones like lil kim and nicki minaj reaching platinum status sedit icet with the commercial success of gangsta rap in the early s the emphasis in lyrics shifted to drugs violence and misogyny early proponents of gangsta rap included groups and artists such as icet who recorded what some consider to be the first gangster rap record  n the mornin and nwa whose second album niggazlife became the first gangsta rap album to enter the charts at number one gangsta rap also played an important part in hip hop becoming a mainstream commodity that albums such as nwas straight outta compton eazyes eazyduzit and ice cubes amerikkkas most wanted were selling in such high numbers meant that black teens were no longer hip hops sole buying audience as a result gangsta rap became a platform for artists who chose to use their music to spread political and social messages to parts of the country that were previously unaware of the conditions of ghettos while hip hop music now appeals to a broader demographic media critics argue that socially and politically conscious hip hop has been largely disregarded by mainstream america global innovationsedit british hip hop artist and poet kate tempest performs her signature piece let them eat chaos at the  treefort music fest in boise idaho according to the us department of state hip hop is now the center of a mega music and fashion industry around the world that crosses social barriers and cuts across racial lines national geographic recognizes hip hop as the worlds favorite youth culture in which just about every country on the planet seems to have developed its own local rap scene through its international travels hip hop is now considered a global musical epidemic according to the village voice hip hop is custommade to combat the anomie that preys on adolescents wherever nobody knows their name hip hop sounds and styles dd styles differ from region to region but there are also instances of fusion genres hip hop culture has grown from the avoided genre to a genre that is followed by  million fans worldwide this was made possible by the adaptation of music in different locations and the influence on style of behavior and dress not all countries have embraced hip hop where as can be expected in countries with strong local culture the interloping wildstyle of hip hop is not always welcomed this is somewhat the case in jamaica the homeland of the cultures father dj kool herc however despite hip hop music produced on the island lacking widespread local and international recognition artists such as five steez have defied the odds by impressing online hip hop tastemakers and even reggae critics hartwig vens argues that hip hop can also be viewed as a global learning experience author jeff chang argues that the essence of hip hop is the cipher born in the bronx where competition and community feed each other he also adds thousands of organizers from cape town to paris use hip hop in their communities to address environmental justice policing and prisons media justice and education while hip hop music has been criticized as a music that creates a divide between western music and music from the rest of the world a musical cross pollination has taken place which strengthens the power of hip hop to influence different communities hip hops messages allow the underprivileged and the mistreated to be heard these cultural translations cross borders while the music may be from a foreign country the message is something that many people can relate to something not foreign at all even when hip hop is transplanted to other countries it often retains its vital progressive agenda that challenges the status quo in gothenburg sweden

producers managers and artists and repertoire staff politicians and businesspeople maligned and ignored the hip hop movement most hip hop artists performed in their local communities and recorded in underground scenes however in the late s music industry executives realized that they could capitalize on the success of gangsta rap they made a formula that created a titillating buffet of hypermasculinity and glorified violence this type of rap was marketed to the new fanbase white males they ignored the depictions of a harsh reality to focus on the sex and violence involved in an article for the village voice greg tate argues that the commercialization of hip hop is a negative and pervasive phenomenon writing that what we call hiphop is now inseparable from what we call the hip hop industry in which the nouveau riche and the superrich employers get richer ironically this commercialization coincides with a decline in rap sales and pressure from critics of the genre even other musicians like nas and krsone have claimed hip hop is dead in that it has changed so much over the years to cater to the consumer that it has lost the essence for which it was originally created however in his book in search of africa manthia diawara states that hip hop is really a voice of people who are marginalized in modern society he argues that the worldwide spread of hip hop as a market revolution is actually global expression of poor peoples desire for the good life and that this struggle aligns with the nationalist struggle for citizenship and belonging but also reveals the need to go beyond such struggles and celebrate the redemption of the black individual through tradition the problem may not be that female rappers do not have the same opportunities and recognition as their male counterparts it may be that the music industry that is so defined by gender biases industry executives seem to bet on the idea that men won’t want to listen to female rappers so they are given fewer opportunities as the hip hop genre has changed since the s the africanamerican cultural tradition that diawara describes has little place in hip hops mainstream artists music the push toward materialism and market success by contemporary rappers such as rick ross lil wayne and jay z has irked older hip hop fans and artists they see the genre losing its communitybased feel that focused more on black empowerment than wealth the commercialization of the genre stripped it of its earlier political nature and the politics and marketing plans of major record labels have forced rappers to craft their music and images to appeal to white affluent and suburban audiences after realizing her friends were making music but not getting television exposure other than what was seen on video music box darlene lewis modellyricist along with darryl washington and dean carroll brought hip hop music to the first exposure cable show on paragon cable and then created the on broadway television show there rappers had opportunities be interviewed and have their music videos played this predated mtv or video soul on bet the commercialization has made hip hop less edgy and authentic but it also has enabled hip hop artists to become successful as top rappers grow wealthier and start more outside business ventures this can indicate a stronger sense of black aspiration as rappers such as jayz and kanye west establish themselves as artists and entrepreneurs more young black people have hopes of achieving their goals the lens through which one views the genres commercialization can make it seem positive or negative cultureedit djing and turntablism mcingrapping breakdancing graffiti art and beatboxing are the creative outlets that collectively make up hip hop culture and its revolutionary aesthetic like the blues these arts were developed by african american communities to enable people to make a statement whether political or emotional and participate in community activities these practices spread globally around the s as fans could make it their own and express themselves in new and creative ways in music dance and other arts djingedit dj qbert manipulating a record turntable at a turntablism competition in france in  djing and turntablism are the techniques of manipulating sounds and creating music and beats using two or more phonograph turntables or other sound sources such as tapes cds or digital audio files and a dj mixer that is plugged into a pa system one of the first few hip hop djs was kool dj herc who created hip hop in the s through the isolation and extending of breaks the parts of albums that focused solely on the percussive beat in addition to developing hercs techniques djs grandmaster flowers grandmaster flash grand wizzard theodore and grandmaster caz made further innovations with the introduction of scratching which has become one of the key sounds associated with hip hop music traditionally a dj will use two turntables simultaneously and mix between the two these are connected to a dj mixer an amplifier speakers and various electronic music equipment such as a microphone and effects units the dj mixes the two albums currently in rotation andor does scratching by moving one of the record platters while manipulating the crossfader on the mixer the result of mixing two records is a unique sound created by the seemingly combined sound of two separate songs into one song although there is considerable overlap between the two roles a dj is not the same as a record producer of a music track the development of djing was also influenced by new turntablism techniques such as beatmatching a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the technics sl mk  first sold in  which had a precise variable pitch control and a direct drive motor djs were often avid record collectors who would hunt through used record stores for obscure soul records and vintage funk recordings djs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences dj pete rock mixing with two turntables in the early years of hip hop the djs were the stars as they created new music and beats with their record players while djing and turntablism continue to be used in hip hop music in the s the star role has increasingly been taken by mcs since the late s due to innovative creative mcs such as kurtis blow and melle mel of grandmaster flashs crew the furious five who developed strong rapping skills however a number of djs have gained stardom nonetheless in recent years famous djs include

to spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics with a strong rhythmic accompaniment rapping typically features complex wordplay rapid delivery and a range of street slang some of which is unique to the hip hop subculture while rapping is often done over beats either done by a dj a beatboxer it can also be done without accompaniment it can be broken down into different components such as content flow rhythm and rhyme and delivery rapping is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to the beat of the music the use of the word rap to describe quick and slangy speech or witty repartee long predates the musical form mcing is a form of expression that is embedded within ancient african culture and oral tradition as throughout history verbal acrobatics or jousting involving rhymes were common within the afroamerican community graffitiedit an aerosol paint can a common tool used in modern graffiti graffiti is the most controversial of hip hops elements as a number of the most notable graffiti pioneers say that they do not consider graffiti to be an element of hip hop including lady pink seen blade fargo cholly rock fuzz one and coco  lady pink says i don’t think graffiti is hiphop frankly i grew up with disco music theres a long background of graffiti as an entity unto itself and fargo says there is no correlation between hip hop and graffiti one has nothing to do with the other hip hop pioneer grandmaster flash has also questioned the connection between hip hop and graffiti saying you know what bugs me they put hip hop with graffiti how do they intertwine in america in the late s graffiti was used as a form of expression by political activists gangs such as the savage skulls la familia and savage nomads used graffiti to mark territory julio  was a puerto rican graffiti writer one of the first graffiti writers in new york city he was a member of the savage skulls gang and started writing his nickname in his neighborhood as early as  in  the new york times published an article taki  spawns pen pals about another graffiti writer with similar form taki  according to the article julio had been writing for a couple of years when taki began tagging his own name all around the city taki also states in the article that julio was busted and stopped writers following in the wake of taki and tracy  would add their street number to their nickname bomb cover a train with their work and let the subway take it—and their fame if it was impressive or simply pervasive enough—all city julio  never rose to takis fame because julio kept his

or logo tagging began in philadelphia and new york city and has expanded worldwide although tagging is considered as vandalism by law enforcement it is hip hops visual art and the tags are part of a complex symbol system with its own social codes and subculture rules bubble lettering held sway initially among writers from the bronx though the elaborate brooklyn style tracy  dubbed wildstyle would come to define the art the early trendsetters were joined in the s by artists like dondi futura  daze blade lee fab five freddy zephyr rammellzee crash kel noc  and lady pink the relationship between graffiti and hip hop culture arises both from early graffiti artists engaging in other aspects of hip hop culture graffiti is understood as a visual expression of rap music just as breaking is viewed as a physical expression the  film wild style is widely regarded as the first hip hop motion picture which featured prominent figures within the new york graffiti scene during the said period the book subway art and the documentary style wars were also among the first ways the mainstream public were introduced to hip hop graffiti graffiti remains part of hip hop while crossing into the mainstream

dancer and displaying tongueincheek bravado breaking also called bboyingbgirling or breakdancing is a dynamic rhythmic style of dance which developed as one of the major elements of hip hop culture like many aspects of hip hop culture breakdance borrows heavily from many cultures including sera street dancing brazilian and asian martial arts russian folk dance and the dance moves of james brown michael jackson and california funk breaking took form in the south bronx in the s alongside the other elements of hip hop breakdancing is typically done with the accompaniment of hip hop music playing on a boom box or pa system according to the  documentary film the freshest kids a history of the bboy dj kool herc describes the b in bboy as short for breaking which at the time was slang for going off also one of the original names for the dance however early on the dance was known as the boing the sound a spring makes dancers at dj kool hercs parties saved their best dance moves for the percussion break section of the song getting in front of the audience to dance in a distinctive frenetic style the b in bboy or bgirl also stands simply for break as in breakboy or girl before the s bgirls’ presence was limited by their gender minority status navigating sexual politics of a masculinedominated scene and a lack of representation or encouragement for women to participate in the form the few bgirls who participated despite facing gender discrimination carved out a space for women as leaders within the breaking community and the number of bgirls participating has increased breaking was documented in style wars and was later given more focus in fictional films such as wild style and beat street early acts include the rock steady crew and new york city breakerscitation needed beatboxingedit biz markie is noted for his beatboxing skills he is holding the mic close to his mouth a technique beatboxers use to imitate deep basslines and bass drums by exploiting the proximity effect beatboxing is the technique of vocal percussion in which a singer imitates drums and other percussion instruments with her or his voice it is primarily concerned with the art of creating beats or rhythms using the human mouth the term beatboxing is derived from the mimicry of the first generation of drum machines then known as beatboxes it was first popularized by doug e fresh as it is a way of creating hip hop music it can be categorized under the production element of hip hop though it does sometimes include a type of rapping intersected with the humancreated beat it is generally considered to be part of the same pillar of hip hop as djing—in other words providing a musical backdrop or foundation for mcs to rap over beatboxers can create their beats just naturally but many of the beatboxing effects are enhanced by using a microphone plugged into a pa system this helps the beatboxer to make their beatboxing loud enough to be heard alongside a rapper mc turntablist and other hip hop artists beatboxing was popular in the s with prominent artists like the darren buffy the human beat box robinson of the fat boys and biz markie displaying their skills within the media it declined in popularity along with bboying in the late s but has undergone a resurgence since the late s marked by the release of make the music  by rahzel of the roots beatmakingproducingedit a typical rap drum beat written in drum notation although it is not described as one of the four core elements that make up hip hop music producing is another important element in music record producers play a similar role in sound recording that film directors play in making a movie the record producer recruits and selects artists rappers mcs djs beatboxers and so on plans the vision for the recording session coaches the performers on their songs chooses audio engineers sets out a budget for hiring the artists and technical experts and oversees the entire project the exact roles of a producer depend on each individual but some producers work with djs and drum machine programmers to create beats coach the djs in the selection of sampled basslines riffs and catch phrases give advice to rappers vocalists mcs and other artists give suggestions to performers on how to improve their flow and develop a unique personal style some producers work closely with the audio engineer to provide ideas on mixing effects units eg autotuned vocal effects such as those popularized by tpain micing of artists and so on the producer may independently develop the concept or vision for a project or album or develop the vision in collaboration with the artists and performers hip hop producer chilly chill behind a large audio console in a recording studio in hip hop since the beginning of mcing there have been producers who work in the studio behind the scenes to create the beats for mcs to rap over producers may find a beat they like on an old funk soul or disco record and then isolate the beat and turn it into a loop alternatively producers may create a beat with a drum machine or by hiring a drumkit percussionist to play acoustic drums the producer could even mix and layer different methods such as combining a sampled disco drum break with a drum machine track and some live newly recorded percussion parts or a live electric bass player a beat created by a hip hop producer may include other parts besides a drum beat such as a sampled bassline from a funk or disco song dialogue from a spoken word record or movie or rhythmic scratching and punches done by a turntablist or dj an early beatmaker was producer kurtis blow who won producer of the year credits in   and  known for the creation of sample and sample loops blow was considered the quincy jones of early hip hop a reference to the prolific african american record producer conductor arranger composer musician and bandleader those who create these beats are known as either beatmakers or producers however producers are known to have more input and direction on the overall the creation of a song or project while a beatmaker just provides or creates the beat as dr dre has said before once you finish the beat you have to produce the record the process of making beats includes sampling chopping looping sequencing beats recording mixing and mastering sam bos rap with computer gear in the studio most beats in hip hop are sampled from a preexisting record this means that a producer will take a portion or a sample of a song and reuse it as an instrumental section beat or portion of their song some examples of this are the isley brothers footsteps in the dark pts  and  being sampled to make ice cubes today was a good day another example is otis reddings try a little tenderness being sampled to create kanye west and jayzs otis chopping is dissecting the song that you are sampling so that you chop out the part or parts of the song be that the bassline rhythm guitar part drum break or other music you want to use in the beat looping is known as melodic or percussive sequence that repeats itself over a period of time so basically a producer will make an evennumber of bars of a beat eg four bars or eight bars repeat itself or loop of a full song length this loop provides an accompaniment for an mc to rap over while hip hop music makes a significant use of sampling old records using turntables and drum machines to create beats producers use electric and acoustic instruments on some songs pictured is an electric bass player at a hip hop show the tools needed to make beats in the late s were funk soul and other music genre records record turntables dj mixers audio consoles and relatively inexpensive portastudiostyle multitrack recording devices in the s and s beatmakers and producers used the new electronic and digital instruments that were developed suchas samplers sequencers drum machines and synthesizers from the s to the s various beatmakers and producers have used live instruments such as drum kit or electric bass on some tracks to record the finished beats or beat tracks beatmakers and producers use a variety of sound recording equipment typically multitrack recorders digital audio workstations also known as daws became more common in the s for producers some of the most used daws are fruity loops studio ableton live and pro tools daws have made it possible for more people to be able to make beats in their own home studio without going to a recording studio beatmakers who own daws do not have to buy all the hardware that a recording studio needed in the s huge  channel audio consoles multitrack recorders racks of rackmount effects units because era daws have everything they need to make beats on a good quality fast laptop computer beats are such an integral part of rap music that many producers have been able to make instrumental mixtapes or albums even though these instrumentals have no rapping listeners still enjoy the inventive ways the producer mixes different beats samples and instrumental melodies examples of these are th wonders tutenkhamen and j dillas donuts some hip hop records come in two versions a beat with rapping over it and an instrumental with just the beat the instrumental in this case is provided so that djs and turntablists can isolate breaks beats and other music to create new songs

because of its implications for understanding language learning identity and curriculum orlando patterson a sociology professor at harvard university helps describe the phenomenon of how hiphop has spread rapidly around the world patterson argues that mass communication is controlled by the wealthy the government and major businesses in third world nations and countries around the world he also credits mass communication with creating a global cultural hiphop scene as a result the youth are influenced by the american hiphop scene and start their own forms of hiphop patterson believes that revitalization of hiphop music will occur around the world as traditional values are mixed with american hiphop music and ultimately a global exchange process will develop that brings youth around the world to listen to a common musical form of hiphop it has also been argued that rap music formed as a cultural response to historic oppression and racism a system for communication among black communities throughout the united states this is due to the fact that the culture reflected the social economic and political realities of the disenfranchised youth in the s hiphop lyrics are starting to reflect original socially conscious themes rappers are starting to question the governments power and its oppressive role in some societies rap music has been a tool for political social and

patterned cockney slang and radio deejays hyping their audience using rhymes hip hop has a distinctive associated slang it is also known by alternate names such as black english or ebonics academics suggest its development stems from a rejection of the racial hierarchy of language which held white english as the superior form of educated speech due to hiphops commercial success in the lates and early s many of these words have been assimilated into the cultural discourse of several different dialects across america and the world and even to nonhip hop fans the word diss for example is particularly prolific there are also a number of words which predate hip hop but are often associated with the culture with homie being a notable example sometimes terms like what the dilly yo are popularized by a single song in this case put your hands where my eyes could see by busta rhymes and are only used briefly one particular example is the rulebased slang of snoop dogg and e who add izzle or izz to the end or middle of words hip hop lyricism has gained a measure of legitimacy in academic and literary circles studies of hip hop linguistics are now offered at institutions such as the university of toronto where poet and author george eliot clarke has taught the potential power of hip hop music to promote social change greg thomas of the university of miami offers courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level studying the feminist and assertive nature of lil kims lyrics some academics including ernest morrell and jeffrey duncanandrade compare hip hop to the satirical works of great western canon poets of the modern era who use imagery and create a mood to criticize society as quoted in their work promoting academic literacy with urban youth through engaging hip hop culture “ hip hop texts are rich in imagery and metaphor and can be used to teach irony tone diction and point of view hip hop texts can be analyzed for theme motif plot and character development both grand master flash and ts eliot gazed out into their rapidly deteriorating societies and saw a wasteland both poets were essentially apocalyptic in nature as they witnessed death disease and decay ” hip hop lyrics have also been known for containing swear words in particular the word bitch is seen in countless songs from a bitch iz a bitch by nwa to missy elliotts she is a bitch it is often used in the negative connotation of a woman who is a shallow money grubber some female artists have tried to reclaim the word and use it as a term of empowerment regardless the hiphop community has recently taken an interest in discussing the use of the word bitch and whether it is necessary in rap not only the particular words but also the choice of which language in which rap is widely debated topic in international hip hop in canada the use of nonstandard variants of french such as franglais a mix of french and english by groups such as dead obies or chiac such as

has been censored on radio and television due to the explicit lyrics of certain genres many songs have been criticized for antiestablishment and sometimes violent messages the use of profanity as well as graphic depictions of violence and sex in hiphop music videos and songs makes it hard to broadcast on television stations such as mtv in music video form and on radio as a result many hiphop recordings are broadcast in censored format with offensive language bleeped or blanked out of the soundtrack or replaced with clean lyrics the result – which sometimes renders the remaining lyrics unintelligible or contradictory to the original recording – has become almost as widely identified with the genre as any other aspect of the music and has been parodied in films such as austin powers in goldmember in which mike myers character dr evil – performing in a parody of a hiphop music video hard knock life by jayz – performs an entire verse that is blanked out in  roger ebert wrote “ rap

list of hip hop genres breaking in ljubljana slovenia hiphop music has spawned dozens of subgenres which incorporate hip hop music production approaches such as sampling creating beats or rapping the diversification process stems from the appropriation of hip hop culture by other ethnic groups there are many varying social influences that affect hip hops message in different nations it is frequently used as a musical response to perceived political andor social injustices in south africa the largest form of hip hop is called kwaito which has had a growth similar to american hiphop kwaito is a direct reflection of a postapartheid south africa and is a voice for the voiceless a term that us hip hop is often referred to kwaito is even perceived as a lifestyle encompassing many aspects of life including language and fashion kwaito is a political and partydriven genre as performers use the music to express their political views and also to express their desire to have a good time kwaito is a music that came from a once hated and oppressed people but it is now sweeping the nation the main consumers of kwaito are adolescents and half of the south african population is under twentyone years of age some of the large kwaito artists have sold more than  albums and in an industry where  albums sold is considered a gold record those are impressive numbers kwaito allows the participation and creative engagement of otherwise socially excluded peoples in the generation of popular media south african hip hop is more diverse lately and there are hip hop acts in south africa that have made an impact and continue making impact worldwide these include tumi ben sharpa hiphop pantsula tuks senganga south sudanese musician emmanuel jal uses hip hop to heal wartorn african youth jal pictured at the tribeca film festival in new york in jamaica the sounds of hip hop are derived from american and jamaican influences jamaican hip hop is defined both through dancehall and reggae music jamaican kool herc brought the sound systems technology and techniques of reggae music to new york during the s jamaican hip hop artists often rap in both brooklyn and jamaican accents jamaican hip hop subject matter is often influenced by outside and internal forces outside forces such as the blingbling era of todays modern hip hop and internal influences coming from the use of anticolonialism and marijuana or ganja references which rastafarians believe bring them closer to god author wayne marshall argues that hip hop as with any number of africanamerican cultural forms before it offers a range of compelling and contradictory significations to jamaican artist and audiences from modern blackness to foreign mind transnational cosmopolitanism to militant panafricanism radical remixology to outright mimicry hip hop in jamaica embodies the myriad ways that jamaicans embrace reject and incorporate foreign yet familiar forms arabic hip hop artist klash loon in the developing world hip hop has made a considerable impact in the social context despite the lack of resources hip hop has made considerable inroads due to limited funds hip hop artists are forced to use very basic tools and even graffiti an important aspect of the hip hop culture is constrained due to its unavailability to the average person hip hop has begun making inroads with more than black artists there are number of other minority artists who are taking center stage as many first generation minority children come of age one example is rapper awkwafina an asianamerican who raps about being asian as well as being female she like many others use rap to express her experiences as a minority not necessarily to unite minorities together but to tell her story many hip hop artists that make it out of the developing world come to places like the united states in hopes of improving their situations maya arulpragasm aka mia is a sri lankaborn tamil hip hop artist in this situation she claims im just trying to build some sort of bridge im trying to create a third place somewhere in between the developed world and the developing world another music artist using hip hop to provide a positive message to young africans is emmanuel jal who is a former child soldier from south sudan jal is one of the few south sudanese music artists to have broken through on an international level with his unique form of hip hop and a positive message in his lyrics jal has attracted the attention of mainstream media and academics with his story and use of hip hop as a healing medium for warafflicted people in africa and has also been sought out for the international lecture circuit with major talks at popular talkfests like ted educationedit scholars argue that hiphop can have an empowering effect on youth while there is misogyny violence and drug use in rap music videos and lyrics hip hop also displays many positive themes of selfreliance resilience and selfesteem these messages can be inspiring for a youth living in poverty a lot of rap songs contain references to strengthening the africanamerican community promoting social causes social workers have used hip hop to build a relationship with atrisk youth and develop a deeper connection with the child hiphop has the potential to be taught as a way of helping people see the world more critically be it through forms of writing creating music or social activism the lyrics of hip hop have been used to learn about literary devices such as metaphor imagery irony tone theme motif plot and point of view organizations and facilities are providing spaces and programs for communities to explore making and learning about hiphop an example is the imp labs in regina saskatchewan canada many dance studios and colleges now offer lessons in hip hop alongside tap and ballet as well as krsone teaching hip hop lectures at harvard university hip hop producer th wonder and former rapperturned actor christopher play martin from hiphop group kidnplay have taught hip hop history classes at north carolina central university and th wonder has also taught a hip hop sampling soul class at duke university in  the cornell university library established a hip hop collection to collect and make accessible the historical artifacts of hip hop culture and to ensure their preservation for future generations values and philosophyedit in hip hop culture it is considered essential to keep it real or to be authentic to the lived experiences of people from disadvantaged neighborhoods the ghetto despite the fact that hip hop artists typically use imagined scenarios and fictionalized stories in their raps the culture demands that they act as if all their lyrics are true or potentially true because of this lyrics of rap songs have often been treated as confessions to a number of violent crimes in the united states it is also considered to be the duty of rappers and other hip hop artists djs dancers to represent their city and neighborhood this demands being proud of being from disadvantaged cities neighborhoods that have traditionally been a source of shame and glorifying them in lyrics and graffiti this has potentially been one of the ways that hip hop has become regarded as a local rather than foreign genre of music in so many countries around the world in just a few decades nevertheless sampling and borrowing from a number of genres and places is also a part of the hip hop milieu and an album like the surprise hit kala by anglotamil rapper mia was recorded in locations all across the world and features sounds from a different country on every track authenticityedit graffiti depicting us rapper  cent larry nager of the cincinnati enquirer wrote that  cent has earned the right to use the trappings of gangsta rap – the macho posturing the guns the drugs the big cars and magnums of champagne hes not a poseur pretending to be a gangsta hes the real thing hip hop music artists and advocates have stated that hip hop has been an authentic true and real africanamerican artistic form and expressive cultural form since its emergence in innercity bronx neighborhoods in the s as well some music critics scholars and political commentators have denied hip hops authenticity advocates who claim hip hop is an authentic music genre state that it is an ongoing response to the violence and discrimination experienced by black people in the united states from the slavery that existed into the th century to the lynchings of the th century and the ongoing racial discrimination faced by blacks paul gilroy and alexander weheliye state that unlike disco jazz rb house music and other genres that were developed in the africanamerican community and which were quickly adopted and then increasingly controlled by white music industry executives hip hop has remained largely controlled by african american artists producers and executives in his book phonographies weheliye describes the political and cultural affiliations that hip hop music enables in contrast greg tate states that the marketdriven commodity form of commercial hip hop has uprooted the genre from the celebration of africanamerican culture and the messages of protest that predominated in its early forms tate states that the commodification and commercialization of hip hop culture undermines the dynamism of the genre for africanamerican communities these two dissenting understandings of hip hops scope and influence frame debates that revolve around hip hops possession of or lack of authenticity anticipating the market arguments of tate and others both gilroy and weheliye assert that hip hop has always had a different function than western popular music as a whole a function that exceeds the constraints of market capitalism weheliye notes popular music generally in the form of recordings has and still continues to function as one of the main channels of communication between the different geographical and cultural points in the african diaspora allowing artists to articulate and perform their diasporic citizenship to international audiences and establish conversations with other diasporic communities for paul gilroy hip hop proves an outlet of articulation and a sonic space in which african americans can exert control and influence that they often lack in other sociopolitical and economic domains in phonographies weheyliye explains how new sound technologies used in hip hop encourage diasporic citizenship and africanamerican cultural and political activities gilroy states that the power of hip hop music lies in developing black struggles by communicating information organizing consciousness and testing out or deployingindividual or collective forms of africanamerican cultural and political actions in the third chapter of the black atlantic jewels brought from bondage black music and the politics of authenticity gilroy asserts that these elements influence the production of and the interpretation of black cultural activities what gilroy calls the black atlantic musics rituals and traditions are a more expansive way of thinking about africanamerican blackness a way that moves beyond contemporary debates around essentialist and antiessentialist arguments as such gilroy states that music has been and remains a central staging ground for debates over the work responsibility and future role of black cultural and artistic productionh traditional hip hop vs progressive viewsedit ever since the overcommercialization of hiphop occurred between the late s and the mid s at peak traditional hip hop supporters have been in a feud with more progressive hip hop fans claiming that they are uneducated towards what they are building and that it they are not only building music that steps further and further away from hip hop but causes ignorance and misconceptions between fans of more progressed hip hop and traditional fans of the hip hop culture these views have been narrowed heavily over the past couple of years and have experienced change of views from the traditional side as well as acceptance towards evolution of hip hop however all of these beliefs seem to still be viewed under very specific sets of morals and ethics such as that one does not take themselves away or deny the true past of hiphop doing such would result in ignorance of the history of hip hop and a completely disconnected community of fans who become uncertain as to what truly should be considered hip hop fans of more progressed hip hop have received both acclaim due to innovation and futuristic views as well as strong criticism due to lack of proper education and what is felt as a completely changed form of values rather than evolved like most grassroots cultures hip hop initially rejected the views and support of the mainstream industry however eventually learned to be content due to the understanding of what opportunity and voice could be given the father of hip hop dj kool herc recently criticized the cancelled netflix series the get down due to its lack of viewer response by calling it the let down and that legendary hip hop dj grandmaster flash is grandmaster trash herc criticized the whole production for their misrepresentations of history and culture however he did state that he does support many stars in rap today such as lil wayne and drake who clearly do not support hip hop in anyway traditional herc and many other old school hip hop legends such as afrika bambaataa and grandmaster caz originally held views against mainstream rap however recent interviews have shown to prove that even they have changed their ways to a certain extent however rappers like krsone still feel a strong disapproval of the rap industry especially through mainstream media in bboying most supporters have began to slowly involve more industry sponsorship through events on the world bboy series and through the udef powered by silverback open other bboys have began to accept using the term breakdance but only if the term bboying is too difficult to communicate to the general public regardless of such bboys and bgirls still exist to showing lack of support to jams and events that they feel represent the culture as a sport form of entertainment and as well through capitalism battle rap as an industry has also been strongly supported by oldschool goldenera legends such as herc kid capri and krsone  receptionedit commercialization and stereotypingedit in  hip hop and rap pioneer chuck d from the group public enemy criticized young hip hop artists from the s stating that they have taken a music genre with extensive roots in underground music and turned it into commercialized pop music in particular seminal figures in the early underground politicallymotivated music such as ice t have criticized current hip hop artists for being more concerned with image than substance critics have stated that s hip hop artists are contributing to cultural stereotyping of africanamerican culture and are poseur gangsters critics have also stated that hip hop music promotes drug use and violence comedian bill cosby states that hip hop brings young black people down though his criticism is focused mainly on crime and violenceglorifying gangsta rap and it ignores other rap genres that empower black youth hip hop has been criticized by rockcentric critics who state that hip hop is not a true art form and who state that rock and roll music is more authentic these critics are advocating a viewpoint called rockism which favors music written and performed by the individual artist as seen in some famous singersongwriterled rock bands and is against s decadeera hip hop which these critics argue give too large a role to record producers and digital sound recording hip hop is seen as being too violent and explicit in comparison with rock some contend that the criticisms have racial overtones as these critics deny that hip hop is an art form and praising rock genres that prominently feature white males marginalization of womenedit hip hop artist lauryn hill has been successful as a solo performer and as a member of the fugees this photo shows her performing at the ottawa bluesfest in  the hip hop music genre and its subculture has been criticized for its gender bias and its negative impacts on women in africanamerican culture gangsta rap artists such as eazye dr dre and snoop dogg have song lyrics that portray women as sex toys and as people who are inferior to and dependent on men between  and  over  hip hop songs had lyrics that described violence toward women including rape assault and murder these antiwomen hip hop lyrics have led some male listeners to make physical threats toward women and they have created negative stereotypes of young urban africanamerican women hip hop music promotes masculine hegemony and it depicts women as individuals who must rely on men the portrayal of women in hip hop lyrics and videos tends to be violent degrading and highly sexualized there is a high frequency of songs with lyrics that are demeaning or depict sexual violence or sexual assault towards women videos often portray idealized female bodies and depict women as being the object of male pleasure very few female artists have been recognized in hip hop and the most popular successful and influential artists record producers and music executives are males women who are in rap groups such as lauryn hill of the fugees tend to have less advantages and opportunities than male artists female artists have received little to no recognition in hip hop only one female artist has won best rap album of the year at the grammy awards since the category was added in  in addition african american female hip hop artists have been recognized even less in the industry besides icons like lauryn hill white rapper iggy azalea is the first female hip hop artist to get a number one single on the american pop charts homophobia and transphobiaedit as well the hip hop music community has been criticized for its homophobia and transphobia hip hop song lyrics contain offensive homophobic slurs most popularly the pejorative term faggot and sometimes violent threats towards queer people such as rapper dmxs where the hood at rapper eazyes nobody move rap group brand nubians punks jump up to get beat down many rappers and hip hop artists have advocated homophobia andor transphobia these artists include ja rule who in an interview claimedwe need to go step to mtv and viacom and lets talk about all these fucking shows that they have on mtv that is promoting homosexuality that my kids can’t watch this shit and rap artist erick sermon who has said publiclyhip hop will never accept transgender rappers until the s hip hop music has excluded the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt community this has perpetuated a culture in hip hop that is prejudiced towards queer and trans people making it a tough culture for queer artists to participate in despite this prejudice some queergenderqueer rappers and hip hop artists have become successful and popular in the s one of the more notable members of the lgbt community in hip hop is frank ocean who came out in  and has released critically acclaimed albums and won two grammy awards other successful queer hip hoprap artists include female bisexual rapper azealia banks pansexual androgynous rapper and singer angel haze lesbian rapper siya and genderqueer rapper mykki blancocitation needed legacyedit this section possibly

elliott and mc lyte have made great strides since the hip hop industry first began by producing music and an image that did not cater to the hypersexualized stereotypes of black women in hip hop these women pioneered a revitalized and empowering image of black women in hip hop though many hip hop artists have embraced the ideals that effectively disenfranchise black female artists many others choose to employ forms of resistance that counteract these negative portrayals of women in hip hop and offer a different narrative these artists seek to expand ways of traditional thinking through different ways of cultural expression in this effort they hope to elicit a response to female hip hop artists not with a misogynist lens but with one that validates womens struggle while women have been marginalized in hip hops music industryaccording to whom established artists like missy elliott lil kim and others are providing mentorship for new female mcs in addition there is a vibrant scene outside the mainstream that provides an opportunity for women and their music to flourish rap music has the power to influence how we view black women in our society queen latifah used her awardwinning song unity to support to other women and to inform of the presence of women in the hip hop genre however many contemporary females in hip hop do not embody this mindset and counteract it

personal loans such sites usually require borrowers to meet certain stringent requirements such as a minimum credit score eg fico score of  to qualify for unsecured personal loans some existing online lending sites also allow lenders to provide funds for the personal loans in exchange for a return however like the borrowers the lenders also have to meet certain stringent requirements such as minimum annual gross income minimum liquid net worth etc in order to qualify to be a lender of personal loans furthermore as unsecured personal loans are inherently high risk existing lending sites usually provide high interest rate to lenders which results in high interest rates for borrowers brief description of the drawings  fig a is a diagram illustrating an example environment in which the

exemplary systemization of the online secured loan manager server detailed description  an online secured loan manager “oslm” system facilitates creation of a secured loan product the oslm system obtains collateral from multiple sponsors located through a borrowers social network and apportions the collateral from each sponsor to a fraction of the loan to create a secured loan product the oslm system by leveraging the borrowers social network and allowing division of sponsorship or guarantee allows borrowers to qualify for and obtain a loan even if their creditworthiness as determined by credit agencies is low  the oslm system offers several advantages over existing lending programs for example the oslm system qualifies borrowers for a secured loan based on the strength of their social network andor their ability to find sponsors willing to provide or pledge collateral the secured loans provided by the oslm system are low risk with low interest rates and therefore more attractive to borrowers furthermore the oslm system unlike existing lending programs secures loans using the sponsors collateral such that the borrowers credit worthiness or lack of credit history does not prevent the borrower from qualifying for a secured loan besides borrowers who can qualify for secured loans with low interest rates the oslm system in one embodiment offers the sponsors a fee in return for providing the collateral the oslm system also allows lenders to purchase or invest in secured loan products  various implementations of the oslm system and method will now be described the following description provides specific details for a thorough understanding and an enabling description of these implementations one skilled in the art will understand however that the invention may be practiced without many of these details additionally some wellknown structures or functions may not be shown or described in detail so as to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the relevant description of the various implementations the terminology used in the description presented below is intended to be interpreted in its broadest reasonable manner even though it is being used in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific implementations of the invention example environment and architecture  the oslm system may be implemented in a suitable computing environment  such as the one shown in fig a although not required aspects and implementations of the oslm system will be described in the general context of computer executable instructions such as routines executed by a general purpose computer a personal computer a server or other computing systems  the oslm system operates in environment  client devices  such as but not limited to a computer a laptop a mobile phone tablet and the like are used by borrowers  sponsors  and lenders  to access the webbased oslm system hosted by server computers such as the oslm server  over networks  networks  may include wired and wireless networks private networks and public networks eg the internet client devices  may use their network interfaces to connect to andor communicate with networks  either directly or via wireless routers or cell towers network interfaces may employ connection protocols such as direct connect ethernet wireless connection such as ieee an and the like to connect to networks  the oslm server  is also connected to the network  to provide oslm services in one implementation the oslm server  may include a firewall  and a database server such as an sql server  which is connected to or can access a database such as the database  alternately the firewall may be optional in some implementations a diagrammatic representation of the oslm server  is described in detail with respect to fig   the oslm server  may be connected to a trust bank  implemented as a server via the network  the trust bank  may be responsible for carrying out various instructions issued by the oslm server  for example the trust bank  maintains andor holds collateral from sponsors assists in collateral valuation creates and maintains accounts for borrower  sponsor  andor lender  and the like in one implementation the trust bank  in a further implementation provides reports of assets held collateral valuation cash movements loans outstanding and the like the trust bank  takes in payment from a borrower and disperses the payment as instructed by the oslm server  in one implementation the trust bank  may enter into a trust operating agreement with the oslm system to assist the oslm system in its functions in return for a fee the trust bank  may be connected to one or more databases such as the database  to store account data  the oslm server  may communicate with a credit reporting agency  over the network  the oslm server  may request the credit reporting agency  for credit reports to verify the borrower  the lender  andor the sponsor  in the event of default the oslm server  may report the borrower to the credit reporting agency  the oslm server  may also communicate with a collateral service agent  to obtain financial information on collateral assets for collateral valuation and monitoring examples of the collateral service agent  includes bloomberg markit and others  the term “server” as used herein refers generally to a computer device program or combination thereof that processes and responds to requests from remote clients across a network the term “client” as used herein refers generally to a computer device program or combination thereof that is capable of processing and making requests obtaining and processing responses from servers via a network  referring to fig b architecture  depicts participants of a secured lending transaction facilitated by the oslm server  in order to facilitate a secured lending transaction the oslm server  interacts with a borrower  the borrowers sponsor network  that includes one or more sponsors eg sponsors  to n a plurality of lenders eg lenders  to n  and a trust bank  over a network for example the oslm server  receives from the borrowers sponsor network  collateral  for a loan the oslm server  provides the collateral  to the trust bank  the oslm server  also receives funds for the loan  from one or more lenders  and provides the loan  to the borrower  the oslm server  receives executed note and periodic interest and principal payments  from the borrower  the oslm server  provides the interest and principal payment  to the one or more lenders  the oslm  also receives from the borrower a periodic fee payment  and distributes a portion of the fee payment to the borrowers sponsor network  as sponsor fee  and keeps the remaining portion of the fee payment as a transaction fee the oslm server  also provides the trust bank  a fee payment  for holding the collateral  managing the borrower lender and sponsor accounts and the like in one implementation the payment  is includes an authorization to withdraw funds from the borrowers account with the trust bank  in one embodiment the oslm system may be structured as a special purpose vehicle “spv” which is a bankruptcy remote company all transactions and agreements eg lender agreements loan agreements collateral agreements trust agreements etc where the oslm is a counterparty are performed via the spv although not shown a third party trustee may also be a part of the oslm architecture the trustee may be responsible for overseeing various operations performed by the oslm including collateral management  fig  is a diagram illustrating an example structure of a secured loan  that is provided to a borrower  the loan  may be secured by a plurality of sponsors eg sponsors  from the borrowers network  andor other sponsors eg sponsor  from another network  that is outside of the borrowers network all of the sponsors  together may constitute the borrowers sponsor network in one embodiment the loan  includes divisible guarantees such that the loan can be divided into multiple portions and each such portion can be secured by collateral from a sponsor for example th of the loan  is secured using collateral eg represented by reference numeral  put forward by sponsor  similarly th of the loan  is secured using collateral put forward by sponsor  and so on until all of the loan  is secured in its entirety the divisible guarantee aspect of the loan  reduces the obligation of each sponsor to a fraction of the loan for which the sponsor provided collateral  various types of collateral  may be used to secure each portion of the loan  the collateral  includes but is not limited to cash equities certificates of deposit lines of credit mutual funds debt instruments derivative instruments foreign securities real estate hard assets and the like in one embodiment the collateral  can include personal or soft guarantees  the borrowers network  includes one or more sponsors that are located using the borrowers social connections the network  may include online social and professional networks such as the facebook twitter google plus linkedin and the like that the borrower is a member of for example sponsor  and sponsor  are shown in fig  as sponsors located through social network sites  similarly sponsors  and  in borrowers network  are identified or selected using the borrowers contact list or address book  which may include names addresses phone number email and other contact information of friends acquaintances colleagues neighbors and the like some sponsors eg sponsors  and  may be located using other onlineoffline communities andor networks  examples of onlineoffline communities may include but are not limited to education related networks eg high school college graduate school etc alumni or other networks professional societies such as ieee swe and the like cultural organizations and the like some sponsors eg sponsor  may be outside of the borrowers network located by the oslm system on behalf of the borrower using advertisement or other channels  the oslm system may use for example online or offline advertisements on the oslm website andor other websites to find one or more sponsors willing to provide collateral for securing one or more portions of the loan in exchange for a fee  the loan  may be funded by one or more lenders eg lenders  when funded by more than one lender each lender may contribute funds towards a portion of the loan for example lender  funds th of the loan  lender  funds another th of the loan  and lender  funds ⅖th of the loan  the loan may be provided to the borrower  when it is fully funded by one or more lenders and fully secured by one or more sponsors collateral  various types of lenders may fund the loan by way of example only lenders may include institutional lenders eg lender  hedge funds eg lender  individual lenders eg lender  and the like lenders receive a fee or an interest on the principal in return for funding the loans example oslm system  fig  is a block diagram of the modules or components in the oslm system  and some of the data that is received stored and transmitted by the system the oslm server  processes loan requests from borrowers and collects information relating to potential sponsors identified by the borrowers or in some instances by the oslm server  for each loan request the oslm server  contacts the potential sponsors on the borrowers behalf to solicit a collateral pledge in return for a fee when the value of the collateral pledged by the sponsors reaches a predetermined threshold the oslm server  offers the secured loan for sale or investment to lenders in return for a fee when the contribution from a lender meets the amount of the loan the oslm server  executes a secured lending transaction to transfer the loan amount from the lender to the borrower after providing the loan to the borrower the oslm server  continues to monitor collateral values manage payments and take necessary steps to address collateral shortfall andor default by the borrower until the loan is repaid by the borrower  various inputs may be provided to the oslm server  as part of the process for creating a secured loan product for example in one implementation a loan request  may be received from a borrower the loan request may be sent as a secure hypertext transfer protocol https message and may be formatted in xml for example the loan request  may include information relating to the loan such as but not limited to loan amount loan period purpose for borrowing and the like the loan request  in one implementation may also include borrower information such as but not limited to name address social security number telephone number email address and the like  the loan request  may be processed by one or more oslm server  modules such as a borrower module  having a loan request processing module  and a borrower verification module  the loan request processing module  may receive the loan request  and parse the loan request to extract details of the loan request the loan request processing module  may provide the borrower information to the borrower verification module  which is responsible for verifying the information provided by the borrower for example the borrower verification module  may use the borrowers social security number to perform a background check on the borrower andor obtain a credit report from one or more credit reporting agencies eg  the borrower verification module  may also perform a phone verification based on the phone number provided in some implementations the borrower verification module  may verify the name address contact information income and the like to ensure that the information provided by the borrower is correct  the borrower verification module  provides the results of each verification performed to the loan request processing module  which in turn processes the verification results data to determine whether to put the loan request on hold or to move to the next phase of loan request processing in one implementation the determination may be based on one or more rules for evaluating the verification results for example one rule may specify that if any one verification step is incomplete the loan request is put on hold until the incomplete verification step is completed by way of another example another rule may specify that if the age of the borrower is within  to  the occupation is student credit score is at least  with an income source the verification is successful various other rules for evaluating the verification results may be set up to facilitate the processing of the loan request in one implementation the loan request processing module  may generate an intermediate output not shown informing the borrower of the verification results  the oslm server  may receive from the borrower a sponsor locator channel selection input  the sponsor locator channel selection  specifies one or more channels via which the oslm system can send sponsorship requests the sponsor locator channel selection  also can also include selections of potential sponsors for sending the sponsorship requests example channels for locating sponsors include but are not limited to social networks email or smsmms invites contacts or address books oslm website and the like examples of social networks include the facebook twitter linkedin google plus skype and the like contacts or address books may be imported from email services such as gmail yahoo mail hotmail etc mobile devices andor other computing devices managing personal information management pim data invitation may be sent to specific individuals or groups via email smsmms and the like an example user interface for selecting the sponsor locator channels is shown in fig a  a sponsor module  having a social network link module  a sponsor response tracking module  and a sponsor verification module  may be responsible for obtaining andor processing the sponsor locator channel selection input  for example the social network link module  may provide social network tools or plugins contact importing tools email mmssms andor other messaging tools and the like to allow the borrowers to select one or more sponsor locator channels and from the selected sponsor locator channels choose potential sponsors to send sponsorship requests the social network link module  may also send autogenerated eg from a template or borrowercustomized sponsorship requests  via the borrower selected channels to the selected potential sponsors  the oslm server  may receive a response from at least some of the sponsors receiving the sponsorship requests some sponsors may accept the sponsorship request while others may decline the request those who accept the sponsorship request may provide sponsor information  to the oslm server  the sponsor information may include identity information such as name address social security email phone and the like the sponsor information may also include information on the collateral that the sponsor is pledging to secure the borrowers loan  the sponsor verification module  in one implementation is responsible for verifying the sponsor information for example a background andor credit check may be performed on the sponsors to verify their identity information such as name address phone number etc the results of the verification may be provided to the sponsor response tracking module  in one implementation  the sponsor response tracking module  may track monitor and classify response to sponsorship requests from potential sponsors for example if  sponsorship requests were sent out to potential sponsors the module may monitor the response status eg request accepted request declined no response for each sponsorship request the module may then take appropriate actions based on the response status in one implementation for example the module may periodically send a reminder to those potential sponsors who have not responded to the sponsorship request the module may also track the verification status of each potential sponsor who accepted the request to for example include or exclude the potential sponsor from being a member of the borrowers sponsor network for example if the sponsor verification module  indicates that a potential sponsor cannot be verified because of a low credit score eg a credit score below a certain threshold value the sponsor response tracking module  may decline the potential sponsors offer to provide collateral and exclude the potential sponsor from joining the borrowers sponsor network the sponsor response tracking module  in coordination with the collateral manager  may further filter out potential sponsors with collateral that cannot be verified or that do not meet collateral verification criteria established by the collateral manager   in one implementation the sponsor response tracking module may detect when the aggregate value of the collateral from the borrowers sponsor network meets or exceeds a threshold value for securing the loan the borrowers sponsor network includes only those potential sponsors who meet the sponsor and collateral verification criteria considering the example of tables  and  of fig  the borrower has requested a  loan and the borrowers sponsor network includes three sponsors eg friend a neighbor b and family member c after determining the collateral value eg by the collateral manager  and taking a haircut of for example  the aggregate collateral value after the haircut from the sponsor network is equivalent to  when the sponsor response tracking module  detects that the aggregate collateral value after the haircut from the sponsor network is equal to or greater than the loan amount the borrowers loan is deemed fully secured resulting in a secured loan product which can be offered to lenders for purchase or investment in one implementation the sponsor response tracking module generates notification for the borrower andor potential sponsors who have not responded to the sponsorship request that the loan is fully secured and that additional collateral is no longer required  the collateral manager  is responsible for verification valuation monitoring andor liquidation of collateral provided by the potential sponsors in one embodiment the sponsor module  may provide the collateral information received from the potential sponsors to the collateral manager  for verification the collateral verification module  may for example verify each collateral asset with the respective collateral issuing or related agencies or financial institutions for example if a potential sponsor offers cash as collateral the collateral verification module  can contact the potential sponsors bank to verify that the potential sponsor has the specified amount of cash in his or her account in another implementation if the collateral is a line of credit the collateral verification module  can verify the line of credit amount from the line of credit issuing financial institution or from credit reporting agencies  in one implementation the collateral manager  may include a monitoring module  that is responsible for initial collateral valuation and subsequent collateral monitoring in one implementation the collateral monitoring module  may use market data from financial information services such as markit bloomberg and the like to estimate or appraise the fair market value of the asset being used as a collateral for the borrowers loan in another implementation instead of the fair market value the collateral value may be based on the collateral assets liquidation or fire sale value in another implementation the collateral monitoring module  may obtain estimated collateral valuation data from external collateral valuation service providers eg collateral service agent  the collateral valuation data may encompass assets in various markets such as the equity interest rate currency commodity credit property bonds and the like the collateral monitoring module  may take a haircut from the fair market value or the fire sale value of the collateral eg estimated inhouse or obtained from external valuation service providers to determine the collateral value for securing the loan for example if the collateral is cash a smaller haircut eg  may be taken from the fair market or fire sale value however if the collateral has a higher risk then a larger haircut eg  for k as collateral may be taken the collateral monitoring module  in one implementation communicates the collateral value after the haircut to the sponsor response tracking module   the collateral monitoring module  is also responsible for monitoring the value of the collateral originating from the sponsor network on a daily weekly monthly or other periodic basis in addition to monitoring the collateral value the collateral monitoring module  may in one implementation verify that the ownership of the collateral has not changed or that the collateral has not been revoked in the event that the collateral monitoring module  detects a collateral shortfall or any other changes that may affect the value or liquidity of the collateral the module may generate an alert or notification to the responsible sponsor and borrower andor the collateral liquidation module   the collateral liquidation module  is responsible for initiating andor processing liquidation of collateral in the event of a default or collateral shortfall as determined by a default handling module  or the collateral monitoring module  respectively in one implementation the collateral liquidation may be outsourced to collateral liquidation agencies  one embodiment of the oslm server  includes a lender module  for obtaining lender information  and processing the lender information to verify the lender lender information may include but is not limited to name address social security number telephone number email address bank accountrouting number and the like the lender module  may perform a background or credit check on the lender to verify that the lender is qualified in one implementation the lender module  may also provide one or more user interfaces such as the user interface  of fig b to allow lenders to view and select secured loans to fund at different rates of return andor purchase loans from other lenders of the oslm system in a further implementation the lender module  may track the lenders investment portfolio in some implementations the lender module  may also generate recommendations for investment or other opportunities eg an opportunity to be a sponsor based on lenders investment history andor preference settings  another embodiment of the oslm server  includes a loan fulfillment module  for tracking andor managing funding of secured loans the loan fulfillment module  may also match the loans with lenders to fund the secured loans for example in one implementation the loan fulfillment module  keeps track of all unfunded or partially funded loans and offers such loans to potential lenders if funding of any loans includes a time constraint eg loan needed in  month the loan fulfillment module  may also keep track of the time left to fund the secured loan when a secured loan is fully funded the loan fulfillment module  notifies the transaction manager  to complete the secured lending transaction and provide the borrower the requested loan  the transaction manager  in one embodiment facilitates execution of various agreements between the oslm eg the spv and the sponsors in the borrowers sponsor network the lender and the borrower in one implementation all of the agreements are executed electronically with each party receiving agreement documentation electronically  in one embodiment the transaction manager  may facilitate execution of a collateral agreement by each sponsor in the sponsor network the collateral agreement is between the sponsor and the oslm spv when a sponsor enters into a collateral agreement with oslm spv the sponsor agrees to provide assets to be used as collateral for a loan made to the borrower by a lender in one implementation the collateral agreement may stipulate certain criteria to be used by the oslm when making loans to borrowers the transaction manager  may provide the sponsors documentation of any loan made to the borrower and certify that the lending criteria stipulated in the collateral agreement are met  in another embodiment the transaction manager  may facilitate execution of a funding agreement by the lender funding the loans the funding agreement is between the lender and the oslm spv the funding agreement obligates the lender to provide funding against certain assets held as collateral the funding agreement may specify for example assets acceptable for collateral acceptable collateral value haircuts to be used for valuation purposes acceptable loantovalue ltv ratios call levels to be used to bring collateral valueltvs to acceptable levels and the like in one implementation the transaction manager  may provide the lender with documentation of interest in collateral held to support funding  the transaction manager  may also include a note issuer module  and an account opening module  in an embodiment to complete the secured lending transaction for example when the loan requested by a borrower is fully secured and funded the transaction manager  may obtain a confirmation from the borrower to complete the transaction the transaction manager  may also facilitate execution of a loan agreement by the borrower to receive the loan the loan agreement is between the borrower and the oslm spv whereby the borrower agrees to borrow funds and pay interest and repay principal when the transaction is completed the oslm server  may generate a response  indicating approval of the loan request to the borrower  the account opening module  may request a trust bank eg trust bank  to create accounts for all parties and provide instructions to the trust bank to fund a lender account with funds from the lender eg by authorized withdrawal from lenders bank account having funds a check deposit etc and each sponsor account with collateral from the sponsor the note issuer module  may issue an executed promissory note or another negotiable instrument to the lender in the amount of the loan requested by the borrower to complete the secured lending transaction  one embodiment of the oslm server  also includes an accounting manager  having a payment allocation module  a payment tracking module  and a statement reporting module  to facilitate allocation and distribution of fees and other payments to the parties involved in the secured lending transaction  the payment tracking module  in one implementation may keep track of payment due dates status of payments from the borrower determine payments to be made to the lender sponsors andor other parties and provide instructions to the trust bank to process the payments the payment tracking module  may further detect when payments are past due date andor a grace period and notify the default handling module  to initiate default handling procedures such that the lender can recoup the amount of the defaulted loan  the payment allocation module  may be responsible for apportioning payment received from the borrower for distribution to the sponsors lenders and the oslm according to a predefined allocation scheme in one implementation the allocation scheme may itself be determined by the payment allocation module  for example based on the size of the loan or a risk factor consideration the payment allocation module  may generate a payment allocation scheme that specifies the interest rate on the loan and how that interest rate payment is apportioned among the sponsors lenders and the oslm in an alternate implementation a default payment allocation scheme may be generated and applied to secured loan transactions in yet another implementation a recommended payment allocation scheme may be generated which can be modified based on sponsor or lender requirements negotiation andor agreement  in one implementation for example the allocation scheme may indicate that the borrower is to pay  apr on the loan the lender or a group of lenders is to receive a return corresponding to  apr the sponsor network is to receive a fee corresponding to  apr and the oslm is to receive a fee corresponding to  apr the payment allocation module may apportion based on the payment allocation scheme for the secured loan transaction the payment received from the borrower among the lender sponsors and oslm and instruct the trust bank to transfer funds based on the apportionment to the respective accounts  the statement reporting module  may in one implementation generate for the borrower the lender and the sponsors statements regarding payments on a periodic basis for example the statement reporting module  may generate for the borrower a monthly statement detailing the payment amount due the payment due date a grace period penalty for late payment andor the like for the sponsors and the lender the statement reporting module  may generate payment statements detailing payment amount deposited in the respective accounts  one embodiment of the oslm server  may include a sponsor swap module  the sponsor swap module allows a borrower to replace one or more sponsors from his or her sponsor network with one or more new sponsors the replacement may be necessitated by various events such as a sponsors desire to be released from the collateral agreement death bankruptcy or other life changing events in one implementation a sponsor can be released from the collateral agreement only after a new sponsor has been found and verified and the new sponsor agrees to enter into a collateral agreement with the oslm in a further implementation release andor entry of a new sponsor may invalidate the previously agreed upon payment allocation scheme and a new payment allocation scheme may be generated  another embodiment of the oslm server  includes a default handling module  that is responsible for detecting initiating andor processing a default by the borrower the default handling module  for example via the payment tracking module  detects when a loan is in default if a payment on the loan is not made within a specified time period eg  days from the due date a default condition may arise the default handling module  may send notices to the parties involved ie the borrower sponsors and lenders via the statement reporting module  for example to inform the parties involved of options for handling the default for example in one implementation the one or more of the parties may pull out agree to an extension and the like at the end of the extension period if the default is not remedied or the parties decide to pull out the default handling module  may generate and send instructions to the trust bank to sell the sponsors assets to generate proceeds the default handling module  may also determine the amount owed to the lenders and instruct the trust bank to transfer the amount owed from the proceeds generated to the lenders accounts to cover the default the module  may then apportion any remaining proceeds among the sponsors according to their contribution the module  following settlement of the secured loan reports the borrower to appropriate credit agencies eg  for defaulting on the secured loan  in addition to direct lending where a lender or a group of lenders provide funds for a single loan some embodiments of the oslm server  support pooling of loans and allow lenders to fund loan pools the oslm server  in a further embodiment allows structuring or securitization of a loan or a pool of loans and selling of such securitized loans or loan pools to lenders or loan buyers via a loan securitization module  the securitized loan product may be in the form of bonds passthrough securities collateralized debt obligation cdo and the like the loan securitization module  in one implementation is responsible for determining and assigning credit ratings and pricing the securitized loan products for sale the principal and interest on the underlying loans may be used for making payments to the loan buyers and the sponsors  the oslm server  may also include an authentication module  that creates and manages user accounts eg borrower sponsor and lender accounts and authenticates such accounts based on one or more factors of authentication eg using user name and password location one time password telephone verification and the like to provide the account holders access to the website hosted by the oslm server   depending on the implementation one or more of the modules  may be implemented in software hardware or a combination thereof one or more of the modules  described above may be consolidated into a single module in some embodiments additional or less modules may be present in the oslm server  for example the oslm server  may also include one or more cryptography modules that perform cryptographic operations eg encryption decryption digital signing and the like on data that is stored in or read out of the one or more database components eg database tables  andor exchanged with other modules components andor devices the cryptography modules may apply any suitable cryptography algorithms such as but not limited to advanced encryption standard aes secure hash algorithm  or  sha or sha message digest  md andor the like  one of more of the modules  may be connected to or in communication with one or more of the databases andor database tables  to execute queries such as those written in python php sql and the like to retrieve andor store data the borrower account database table  includes various data fields such as but not limited to borrower id name address social security number telephone number email address primary bank information primary bank account number trust bank account number loan id and the like the sponsor account database table  includes various data fields such as but not limited to sponsor id sponsor network id loan id collateral id name address social security number email address telephone number primary bank information primary bank account number trust bank account number sponsor status and the like the lender account database table  includes various data fields such as but not limited to lender id loan id name address social security number telephone number email address bank accountrouting number and the like the trust bank database table  includes various data fields such as but not limited to borrower trust bank account number sponsor trust bank account number lender trust bank account number transaction id and the like the collateral database table  includes various data fields such as but not limited to collateral id transaction id collateral value collateral valuation date collateral status collateral type haircut and the like the loan

transaction status and the like the accounting account database table  includes various data fields such as but not limited to loan id payment status eg late payment current payment delinquent minimum payment rate sponsor amount lender amount fee amount and the like example processing  an exemplary method of loan request processing and sponsor selection in the oslm system is illustrated by the logic flow diagram of figs ab referring to fig a at block  a borrower requests a loan from the oslm via the oslm website or mobile application the request includes borrower information such as but not limited to name address social security number telephone number email address bank account information authorization for the oslm to perform a background or credit check and the like the loan request may also include information on the requested loan such as but not limited to loan amount loan period purpose for borrowing and the like  the oslm server  receives the borrower information and the loan request at block  the oslm server  extracts the details of the borrower information and verifies the information at block  the verification process may include communication with external parties or agencies such as the credit reporting agencies banks and the like at decision block  the oslm server  determines whether the verification is successful or not if the verification of borrower information  is incomplete or unsuccessful error handling procedures may be initiated at block  for example the oslm server  may request reentry of information that does not match what is in the public records entry of additional information for verification completion of action items to resolve any verification issues andor the like alternately if the verification is determined to be successful at decision block  the oslm server  generates an offer for the requested loan at block  the offer includes fees andor interest rates payable by the borrower and the fees andor interest rates that will be provided to the potential loan sponsors and lenders for example the offer includes a base portion that constitutes the fee for the oslm services a lender portion that is payable to the lender for providing funds for the loan and a sponsor portion that is payable to the sponsors for providing collateral for the loan the base portion of the offer may be nonnegotiable or negotiable in one implementation the base portion of the offer may be determined based on one or more risk criteria similarly the lender and sponsor portions of the offer may be negotiable or nonnegotiable in some implementations the offer may include both negotiable and nonnegotiable portions such that the total amount or interest rate payable by the borrower remains unfinalized until the lenders and the sponsors enter into an agreement with the oslm via the spv the offer in one implementation is the payment allocation scheme the offer may be specific to the borrower and in one implementation is valid for a given time period loan amount andor purpose the offer may also have a life time eg  hours within which the borrower must enter into an agreement with the oslm to lock in the given interest rate in some implementations more than one offer may be presented and when multiple offers are presented the borrower may select one or more of the presented offers for consideration by the potential sponsors andor lenders  in one embodiment the oslm server  may generate a special offer that allows the borrower to enter into a forced savings agreement where a portion of any payment the borrower makes is automatically deposited in an account such as a savings account an investment account and the like the funds in the savings account may be used for curing nonpayment of a loan in one implementation in another implementation the funds in the savings account may not be available for withdrawal for a period of time thereby forcing the borrower to save for example a borrower who is paying  apr on a credit card debt may receive an offer from the oslm at  apr with  apr going to the sponsors  to the lender and  to the oslm subject to sponsor andor lender agreement with the rates provided if the borrower desires to enter into a forced savings agreement an offer at  apr may be generated where an amount corresponding to  apr is deposited in a savings account periodically  at block  the oslm server  requests identification of sponsor locator channels such as a social network site address book invite oslm website andor the like the borrower  receives the request at block  and selects one or more desired sponsor locator channels for example the borrower can select the facebook as one channel and gmail contacts as another channel at block  the oslm server  receives the borrowers selection of sponsor locator channels and uses the selected channels to identify a list of target sponsors at block  for example the oslm server  connects to the facebook using the borrowers authentication credentials and obtains a list of friends that the borrower can select from similarly the oslm imports contacts from the borrowers gmail account using the borrowers authentication credentials the oslm server  provides the list of target sponsors for selection by the borrower at block  the borrower at block  receives the list makes one or more selections and provides the selections to the oslm server   at block  the oslm server  receives the target sponsor selections from the borrower at block  the oslm server  generates and sends sponsorship requests including the applicable offer portion details to the selected target sponsors the oslm server  in one implementation sends the sponsorship requests using the channel that was used to select the target sponsors for example if the sponsorship requests are to be sent to the borrowers facebook friends the sponsorship request may be sent via the facebook platform eg facebook message wall post etc  at block  the oslm server  tracks responses to the sponsorship requests from the target sponsors at decision block  if a sponsorship request is accepted the process moves to block  of fig b if however no response is received or accepted within a certain time period the oslm server  requests additional target sponsor selections using the previously selected channels or new channels at block  alternately the oslm server  may identify and provide additional target sponsors for selection at block  the oslm server  identified target selections may include target sponsors known to the borrower eg from borrower selected channels andor target sponsors unknown to borrowers such as other users of the oslm system who are interested in sponsoring loans in exchange for fees at block  the borrower receives the request and proceeds to select additional target sponsors which are then provided to the oslm server   referring to fig b the oslm server  may evaluate each target sponsor who accepted the sponsorship request at block  in one implementation at decision block  the oslm server  examines the sponsor response to determine if a preferred rate or fee arrangement is requested by the target sponsor if there is no preferred ratefee arrangement the oslm server  requests sponsor information from the target sponsor at block  the sponsor information in one implementation may include identity information such as the target sponsors name address social security email phone and the like the sponsor information may also include information on the collateral that the target sponsor is pledging to secure the borrowers loan  alternately if at decision block  the target sponsor requests a preferred ratefee arrangement the oslm server  provides the preferred ratefee arrangement to the borrower for approval or negotiation at block  at block  the oslm server  obtains the borrowers response to the sponsors rate request at decision block  the oslm server  decides whether to accept or reject the target sponsor based on the borrowers response eg borrower and target sponsor agree on a rate if the target sponsor is accepted the oslm server  requests the target sponsors information at block  conversely if the target sponsor is rejected the oslm server  at decision block  determines if the borrowers loan is fully secured by collateral from various sponsors the determination at decision block  is based on collateral valuation information provided by the collateral manager  for example if the loan is fully secured the oslm server  proceeds to block  of fig c if the loan is not fully secured and if there are other sponsor responses waiting to be reviewed as determined at decision block  the process moves to block  for evaluation of the next target sponsor however if the loan is not fully secured and there are no other sponsor responses waiting to be reviewed the oslm server  requests additional target sponsor selection from the borrower at block  of fig a  when the target sponsor accepts the sponsorship request and the offer with or without a preferred rate the oslm server  requests sponsor information at block  the oslm server  verifies the received information at block  using any of the previously discussed methods at decision block  the oslm server  determines based on the verification results and the collateral information for example if the target sponsor meets the sponsorship requirements if the target sponsor fails to meet the sponsorship requirements eg target sponsors collateral valuation is below the minimum threshold required etc the oslm server  initiates error handling procedures at block  for example the oslm server  may notify the target sponsor andor the borrower that the target sponsor did not meet the qualification requirements in one implementation the oslm server  may provide the target sponsor an opportunity to remedy any deficiency eg put up additional collateral if the reason for the disqualification is collateral not accepted by the oslm server  conversely if the target sponsor meets the sponsorship requirements the oslm server  adds the target sponsor to the sponsor network at block  and proceeds to evaluate if the collateral from the sponsor network is enough to secure the loan in full at decision block   the processing of target sponsor responses and sending of sponsorship requests to additional target sponsors may continue until the borrowers loan is fully secured by the collateral from the target sponsors that are accepted by the oslm server  andor the borrower in one implementation in another implementation if the borrowers loan is not fully secured at the rate desired by the borrower or within a given time frame the oslm server  may allow the borrower to modify his or her offer to make it more attractive to target sponsors considering pledging collateral for the borrowers loan  an exemplary method of offering a secured loan to a lender is illustrated by the logic flow diagram of fig c when a loan is fully secured by the borrowers sponsor network the oslm server  posts the secured loan and associated details on the oslm website to attract potential lenders most or all of the secured loans that need funds may be searched by interested lenders using the user interface eg user interface  of fig b provided by the oslm server  alternately the borrower may have the option to selectively publish the loan details eg by messaging within the oslm website to potential lenders who meet a certain criteria  when a lender submits an interest to contribute funds for a loan by selecting a loan and inputting a contribution amount eg a portion or full value of the loan the oslm server  provides an offer eg lender portion of the offer to the lender at block  at decision block  if the offer is not accepted by the potential lender the oslm server  may allow the lender to negotiate with the borrower to select a different rate or the lender may provide a counteroffer alternately the oslm server  may reject the offer and proceed to evaluate the next potential lender at block  if on the other hand at decision block  the offer is accepted by a potential lender the oslm server  obtains lender information from the potential lender at block  the lender information may include but is not limited to name address social security number telephone number email address bank accountrouting number and the like at block  the oslm server  verifies the lender information by for example performing a background or credit check on the lender examining public records examining banking history funds in the bank account andor the like if the verification is determined to be incomplete or unsuccessful at decision block  the oslm server  may reject the potential lender and move on to the next potential lender at block  in one implementation depending on the reason for incomplete or failed verification the oslm server  may allow the lender to address any issues for reconsideration  if the verification is determined to be successful and assuming that lender is funding the whole of the secured loan the oslm server  requests the borrower to confirm the sponsors the lender and the respective offers to the sponsors the lender and the oslm server  at block  the oslm server  in one implementation may require the lender to enter into a lending agreement with the oslm server  upon successful verification in a further implementation the lending agreement may be timelimited such that if the transaction does not occur within a predefined time period the lending agreement becomes invalid  at decision block  if the oslm server  receives confirmation from the borrower to proceed with the transaction the oslm initiates a secure transaction among the borrower the lender and the sponsors at block  the details of the transaction is discussed with respect to fig  alternately if the borrower fails to provide a confirmation to proceed with the transaction within a predefined time period eg  hours or rejects the transaction as determined at block  the oslm server  cancels the loan request at block  in one implementation the borrower may be charged a processing fee regardless of whether the transaction goes through or not  in instances where a lender partially funds a loan each lender may enter into a lending agreement with the oslm via the spv the transaction however may be initiated only when additional lenders are located and the loan is fully funded  an exemplary method of executing a secured loan transaction is illustrated in the logic flow diagram of fig  following confirmation from the borrower to proceed with the transaction the oslm server  sends transaction information to the trust bank  at block  the transaction information may include information such as but not limited to some or all of the borrower information  the sponsor information  the lender information  and the like the transaction information may also include information relating to collateral provided by the sponsors in one implementation at block  the trust bank  receives the transaction information and creates accounts for the borrower the sponsors and the lender at block  the trust bank  may also obtain withdraw or cash in funds from the lender and deposit the funds to the lender account at block  at block  in one implementation the trust bank  may obtain collateral from the sponsors and deposit the collateral to the respective sponsor accounts at block  the trust bank  may provide a confirmation of receipt of the funds and collateral in respective lender and sponsor accounts to the oslm server   at block  the oslm server  may receive the confirmation from the trust bank  the oslm server  may also receive the details of the funds transferred and item andor values of the collateral in the sponsor accounts at decision block  the oslm server  may verify whether the funds and collateral in the accounts at the trust bank  match the funds and collateral specified on the lender agreement and the collateral agreement respectively if there is a discrepancy the oslm server  requests the responsible party to correct any deficiency at block  if the deficiency is not corrected with a given time period as determined at decision block  the oslm server  cancels the transaction at block  and notifies all parties that the transaction cannot be completed  if however there are no discrepancies at decision block  or if any deficiency is corrected with the given time period at decision block  the oslm server  issues a financial instrument such as an executed promissory note in the amount of the loan requested by the borrower at block  the oslm server  sends the financial instrument to the trust bank  along with a request to transfer funds for the loan from the lender account to the borrower account at block   the trust bank  receives the financial instrument and the request to transfer the funds for the loan at block  the trust bank  processes the request at block  and provides a confirmation to the oslm server  at block  the oslm server  receives the confirmation at  and at block  notifies the borrower the lender and the sponsors that the transaction is completed  in one embodiment the oslm server  monitors the payment on the loan provided to the borrower the oslm server  also ensures that the sponsors and the lender receive the payment owed an exemplary flow of payments is illustrated in the data flow diagram of fig  the messages that are exchanged between the oslm server  and the borrower  the sponsors n  lender  and the trust bank  may be secure hypertext transfer protocol https messages formatted in xml for example and including transport layer security tls secure sockets layer ssl or the like  the oslm server  periodically generates a loan statement at block  including the payment amount due and the due date via the accounting manager  for example the payment amount due may be a combination of interest rate andor fees and a portion of the principal the oslm server  sends the loan statement  electronically over a network to the borrower  the loan statement  may also be accessed by the borrower  by logging in to the oslm server  website or using a mobile application the borrower  then makes a loan payment  to the trust bank  the loan payment  may be made electronically using direct deposit bill pay money transfer or any other methods of electronic payment transfer the loan payment  may include interest payment on the loan and fees payable to the oslm and the sponsor network the trust bank  receives the loan payment  and provides a confirmation message  to the oslm server  indicating receipt of payment and the amount of the payment from the borrower  the oslm server  matches the amount of the payment received to the borrowers payment obligation and schedule at  and sends a payment receipt alert message  to the borrower   the oslm server  then sends allocation instructions  for payment to the sponsors and the lender to the trust bank  the trust bank  uses the allocation instructions to transfer funds to the sponsor and lender accounts at  the trust bank  then sends a confirmation message  including the amounts transferred to the sponsor and lender accounts to the oslm server  at  the oslm server  verifies that the transferred amounts match the allocation instructions the oslm server  then generates electronic statements for the sponsors and the lender indicating the deposit of funds at  the oslm server  then sends the payment statements for the sponsors in a message  to the sponsors similarly the payment statement for the lender is sent in a message  to the lender  the payment statements may also be available for access or download through the oslm websitemobile application  in one embodiment of the oslm system default events can arise if the loan payments are not made on time or when there is a collateral shortfall a collateral shortfall is created when the value of the collateral falls below a threshold amount in the oslm system if the borrower defaults and the collateral call is not met within a call period or the loan default is not remedied the collateral is liquidated with proceeds used to repay principal amount due to the lender and any accrued interest any excess cash is returned to the sponsors and the note is transferred to the sponsors if the funds paid to the lender is not sufficient to repay principal and interest due the oslm system may sell the note and the unmet collateral call and the lender has the last right to match the highest bid the sponsors forfeit all rights and interest in the note the loan sale proceeds is used to make up the shortfall of principal and interest due to the lender  an exemplary method of managing default is illustrated in the logic flow diagram of fig  in one embodiment the oslm server  periodically monitors the status of the loan payments and the collateral value at block  at decision block  the oslm server  makes a determination regarding the status of the loan payments and the collateral value for example if the loan payment is current and the collateral value is sufficient ie above the threshold set the oslm server  continues its activities as usual at block  the oslm server  uses loan payments from the borrower to make payments owed to the sponsors and the lender  if at decision block  the oslm server  determines that the loan payment is late the oslm server  sends a late payment notice to the borrower at block  the oslm server  may usually give the borrower a grace period to make the payment at decision block  if the oslm server  determines that the borrower has failed to cure the late payment the oslm server  sends a notice indicating failure to cure the late payment to the borrower and the borrowers sponsor network at block  if the borrower does not cure the late payment after the second notice as determined at decision block  the oslm server  provides the sponsors an option to buy the promissory note at block  alternately the oslm server  provides the sponsors an option to liquidate the collateral to cure the default  at block  the oslm server  uses the proceeds from the sale of the promissory note or the liquidation of the collateral to return the lender the principal and any interest accrued any excess proceeds is returned to the sponsors at block  at block  the borrower is reported to one or more credit agencies for defaulting on the loan  in some implementations if the borrower cures the late payment upon receiving the first notice or upon receiving the second notice the oslm server  does not operate in the default mode instead the oslm server  uses the loan payment to pay the sponsors and the lender at block   referring to decision block  if the oslm server  detects a collateral shortfall the oslm server  sends a notice to the responsible sponsor in the sponsor network andor all the sponsors in the sponsor network indicating the collateral shortfall and the amount of the shortfall at block  at decision block  if the responsible sponsor cures the shortfall liquidation of the collateral is averted however if the shortfall is not cured the oslm proceeds to liquidate the collateral at block  and use the proceeds generated from the collateral to secure the loan at block   in one implementation the oslm server  via the sponsor swap module  for example may notify the borrower when there is a collateral shortfall and give the borrower an opportunity to find a replacement sponsor alternately the sponsor associated with the collateral shortfall or the oslm server  may find a replacement sponsor to take his or her position example user interfaces  figs ab are diagrams illustrating exemplary user interfaces of the oslm server  referring to fig a the user interface  allows a borrower to find sponsors the user interface  includes various sponsor locator channels such as one or more social network plugins  that allow the borrower to access list of users select potential sponsors and send communication to the sponsors invite option  to enter one or more email addresses of potential sponsors and send an email communication to the potential sponsors import contacts option  that allows the borrower to import contacts from address books and contacts maintained externally in gmail yahoo or other services option  to connect to users of the oslm website and the like when a sponsor locator channel  is selected the user interface may display an address field  to enter or select potential sponsors and a message field  to write a personal message to the potential sponsors an oslm server  generated message text  with link for accessing the oslm website may be appended to any message sent to potential sponsors  referring to fig b example user interface  allows a lender to select loans for investment a list of secured loans  that are unfunded or partially funded is displayed along with details such as the term of the loan amount of the loan percentage of the loan already funded time left to fund the loan amount the lender desires to use to fund the loan the rate of return and the like the user interface  includes tools to filter loans based on one or more criteria eg student loan and amount less than  or search for loans available for funding the user interface  may also include a portfolio summary section  where the lenders portfolio of investments made using the oslm system in various loan products are graphically displayed the user interface may also include portfolio diversification section  that provides options for the lender to become a sponsor diversify the current portfolio by investing in different types of loans and the like the oslm server  may identify diversification opportunities based on the lenders current portfolio allocations investment history and available loan options  exemplary secured loans available from the oslm system are illustrated by tables  and  in fig  table  lists a sponsor network the collateral type haircut the collateral value before and after the haircut and the sponsors preferred rates for the loan securing portion of an example transaction table  lists the details of an example loan secured by the sponsor network of table  similarly table  lists another
