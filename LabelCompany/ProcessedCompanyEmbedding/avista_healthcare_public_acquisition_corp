to public shareholders who properly redeem their shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business combination  a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to  as described in this prospectus as of june   we had borrowed  under the promissory note with our sponsor subsequent to june   our sponsor loaned us an additional  to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering these loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions and amounts not to be held in the trust account in the event that offering expenses are less than as set forth in this table any such amounts will be used for postclosing working capital expenses in the event that the offering expenses are more than as set forth in this table we may fund such excess with funds not held in the trust account  the underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to  of the gross proceeds of this offering upon completion of our initial business combination  which constitutes the underwriters deferred commissions or up to  if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital the underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions  includes organizational and administrative expenses and may include amounts related to abovelisted expenses in the event actual amounts exceed estimates  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination in the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel in addition our staffing needs may vary and as a result we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would not be available for our expenses the amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust account based on current interest rates we would expect approximately  to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in the trust account over  months following the investment of such funds in specified us government treasury bills beginning in january  however we can provide no assurances regarding this amount this estimate assumes an interest rate of  per annum based upon current yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested in addition in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we complete our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us otherwise such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account in the event that our initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to  of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our initial shareholders the terms of such loans by our sponsor affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors if any have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account  includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our initial business combination to fund a no shop provision and commitment fees for financing the rules of the nasdaq provide that at least  of the gross proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants  or  if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full including  or up to  if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full of deferred underwriting commissions will upon the consummation of this offering be placed in a noninterest bearing usbased trust account at jp morgan chase bank na with continental stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee beginning in january  the funds in the trust account will be invested only in us government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act which invest only in direct us government treasury obligations based on current interest rates we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately  per year assuming an interest rate of  per year following the investment of such funds in specified us government treasury bills or in specified money market funds beginning in january  we will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes if any the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of i the completion of our initial business combination ii the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance and timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering and iii the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering subject to applicable law based on current interest rates we do not expect that interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes the net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial business combination if our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the posttransaction company the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital we believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable if we are required to seek additional capital we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor members of our management team or their affiliates but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us we will enter into an administrative services agreement pursuant to which we will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of  per month for office space administrative and support services upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation we will cease paying these monthly fees prior to the closing of this offering our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to  to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering as of june   we had borrowed  under the promissory note with our sponsor subsequent to june   our sponsor loaned us an additional  to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering these loans are noninterest bearing unsecured and are due at the earlier of december   or the closing of this offering these loans will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds not held in the trust account in addition in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we complete our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us otherwise such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account in the event that our initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to  of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our initial shareholders the terms of such loans by our officers and directors if any have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our sponsor directors officers advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination the price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial business combination however such persons have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions if they engage in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the exchange act we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply with such rules we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions to be less than  so that we are not subject to the secs penny stock rules and the agreement for our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash if too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of i the completion of our initial business combination ii the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering and iii the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering subject to applicable law in no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account our initial shareholders have entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination in addition our initial shareholders officers and directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame however if our sponsor or any of our officers directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination company description we are a newly organized blank check company incorporated on december   as a cayman islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger share exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination we have not identified any business combination target and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any substantive discussions directly or indirectly with respect to identifying any business combination target our founders are two of the founders and managing partners of avista avista is a middle market private equity firm focused on control buyout and growth investments in the healthcare communications and industrial sectors with offices in new york houston and london thompson dean our executive chairman

private equity funds avista capital partners i ii iii and iv lp and had approximately  billion in assets under management as of june   we expect that avista will raise additional funds and  or successor funds in the future our management team has significant experience sourcing analyzing acquiring and operating healthcare related businesses since inception avista funds have invested in  healthcare portfolio companies while we may acquire a target business in any industry or location our initial focus will be to acquire and operate a north american or european healthcarerelated business ahpac will target businesses in the healthcare industry that it considers to have strong management teams stable cash flows and robust growth prospects we believe that we derive significant benefit from our management team and board members the ahpac team as well as our affiliation with avista we believe that the ahpac team brings a distinctive blend of private equity investing experience deal sourcing capabilities and operating expertise our team has extensive experience not only identifying and executing such acquisitions but also running and operating the businesses post transaction in addition the ahpac team has significant experience working with private companies to reshape their operations and help drive value creation not all of such companies have achieved the same level of value creation we believe that the ahpac team is well positioned to identify attractive acquisition candidates because of their extensive contacts and transaction sources including a broad list of industry executives public board members private owners wealthy families private capital managers private equity funds investment bankers and other transaction intermediaries a central component of our acquisition strategy is our management teams ability to implement value creation initiatives designed to drive shareholder value as they have done in the past for avista portfolio companies not all of which have achieved the same level of shareholder value the ahpac team blends financial sophistication operating perspective and business management skills to execute on these
