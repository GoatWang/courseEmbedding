estate events food business classifieds story  news may    pmpublication the east hampton press suskind selling methodist church in harbor enlarge upload a photo may    pm by oliver peterson despite his earlier assertions that he would renovate the historic united methodist church in sag harbor and make it his home former southampton town board member dennis suskind has now listed the building for sale“it’s really been a personal business decision for dennis and his wife cynthia” the suskinds’ real estate agent former southampton town trustee scott strough of strough associates said tuesday mr strough listed the yearold church for his clients last week but said that despite a rumored  million price tag he and the suskinds have yet to determine an asking pricemr suskind bought the church from the methodist congregation for  million when it could no longer maintain the squarefoot building on madison street but the sale will not officially close until next week“we’re going to come out with a price soon” mr strough said“i’m just exploring selling it that’s all” mr suskind said on tuesday explaining that his decision is a product of “life and time and age” mr suskind a retired goldman sachs executive has listed morgan hill farm his squarefoot home on  acres on kellis pond in bridgehampton for sale as well for just under  million and said he’s waiting to see if it or the church sells firstmr suskind came under fire from certain community members when his plans to buy the church and convert it into his home were made public last summer activists including goat on a boat puppet theater owner liz joyce hoped the church might become a community center for sag harbor village the town of southampton responded by ordering appraisals for a potential community preservation fund purchase in july“i’m not too hopeful of that happening” mr strough said of a cpf purchase but he noted that the suskinds would allow the town and village every opportunity to purchase the property although the appraisals are not public it’s clear that if the town had offered more for the church than mr suskind the congregation and pastor tom macleod likely would have accepted the town’s offer“they would not share the appraisals” mr suskind said adding that he doesn’t expect the town to make a bid now “they don’t have a need for it” he said noting that he’s continuing to do architectural work on the church designing it to be a home and the work has been well received by the sag harbor village architectural review board “i’m doing all of this at the same time” he saidcee scott brown chairman of the sag harbor arb said tuesday that the church had come before the board as a discussion item several months ago and members had discussed the placement of a pool as well as parking issues on the property which covers less than a half acre“it was very cursory” mr brown said noting that the board had suggested that mr suskind push the pool as far back from madison street as possible screen it from the road and reduce the amount of parkingany proposal to buy the church will require “a significant amount of hard money” mr strough said explaining that acquisition is only the first expense for a purchase additional money would be needed for maintenance repairs and any redesign to accommodate a new use be it a home or community centerdespite the hurdles ms joyce is still optimistic about the recent turn of events“i think it’s really nice that there’s another opportunity” for the town to buy the church she said adding “the good part is there’s not a church in there anymore”the congregation is no longer actively worshipping in the building which removes constitutional issues inherent in transforming the church into a community center something ms joyce had to contend with last yearms joyce suggested the church would also be a perfect building for expanding the john jermain memorial library which has been seeking an additional building for years a library she said is by its nature a community center anyway and the church comes already equipped with a playground and parkingthe congregation is currently attending the st david’s african methodist episcopal zion church on eastville avenue in sag harbor while its members await construction of their new church on carroll street off the bridgehamptonsag harbor turnpike the congregation has maintained ownership of the large stained glass windows at their original church and they will be installed at the new building on carroll street“part of my contract with them is they own the windows” mr suskind saidbecause the windows are not part of the original and protected historic structure and were added later they are not legally bound to remain in the church but the building exterior cannot be changed mr strough said that standard clear windows are part of the structure and the stained glass were simply placed on top          you have read  of  free articles this

region southampton caught in ethics turmoil by julia c meadjan   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story celebrating the return of a republican majority to the southampton town board during its yearly organizational meeting on monday councilwoman linda kabot described it as a new day for town government while councilman dennis suskind a democrat grumbled that there are those on long island who believe southampton is run by cronyism deceit and unethical practicespolitics as usual to be sure but the new day dawned under a cloud that has hung over town hall for a month since a majority of the town ethics board resigned to protest what it described as the town supervisors obstruction of a board investigationlast spring mr suskind filed a complaint with the ethics board alleging that the town supervisor patrick heaney strongarmed a candidate for town attorney by threatening to expose the lawyers arrest record if he did not withdraw from consideration mr heaney in an interview on tuesday denied making any threats saying he only offered advice that the record could become known if the lawyer john shields continued to pursue the jobtown justice court records show mr shields was charged on jan   with driving while intoxicated and refusing to take a sobriety test both misdemeanors and at the same time received a traffic ticket for driving outside his lane the records also show that on feb   justice thomas demayo approved a settlement in which mr shieldss dwi was reduced to a speeding ticket for which he was fined  and the other two charges were dismissed advertisement continue reading the main story in a march  letter mr shields an assistant state attorney general notified the board that he was withdrawing from consideration for the appointed town post a copy of an aborted town board resolution approving mr shieldss appointment was cosponsored by all the town board members except mr heaney in may stephen brown was appointed to the post on a parttime basis at a  annual salary and was reappointed on monday with a fulltime salary of  continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story on dec  five of the ethics boards six members resigned christine merser the boards former chairwoman said members tried for several months to interview mr heaney but were rebuffedwe really did have no choice but to resign she said it became about why the town should have an ethics board at all if it is going to be rendered completely uselessthe board is empowered to advise town employees on ethical questions and to report to the town board on whether an allegation of impropriety has merit deserves a full investigation or should be referred to law enforcementmr heaney called the resignations an empty gesture one might speculate he said that a majority of the ethics board at the time their departure occurred knew they were not likely to be appointed the terms of all six members were to have expired on dec  a new board was appointed last weekthe supervisor also contended that mr suskind was trying to position himself for a run for town supervisor in two years this was all about how can i embarrass my potential opponent mr heaney said mr suskind acknowledged that one of the resigned ethics board members ms merser worked as a strategist on his campaign two years ago and that another gail davenport is married to a town democratic committeeman but all three rebutted mr heaneys charge of a partisan setupwe were so careful to not be political ms davenport said we waited until after

mr suskind seek a criminal investigation by the district attorneys office last week he said he was still considering it he had filed a complaint with the da months ago but prosecutors said the matter could not be pursued because mr shields declined to help so mr suskind went to the ethics boardin his memo to the board he alleged that because mr heaney could not dissuade the four council members from appointing mr shields he threatened to ruin mr shieldss reputation embarrass his family and if appointed to not let him into the supervisors office advertisement continue reading the main story the memo goes on to say that when confronted in a closeddoor meeting mr heaney admitted saying those thingsin asking for a determination on whether the supervisor violated either the town or state ethics codes mr suskind wrote the issue is i believe whether his behavior was in excess of his authority perhaps illegal but clearly unacceptable behavior by an elected officialmr heaney vehemently denied making any threats he claimed mr shields failed to disclose pertinent informationmy crime is that i stood my ground and could not possibly support this individual he said of mr shields i only told him he was taking an extreme risk i told him i know more about you than you could ever want me to know and youre a damned fool if you go forward with thisthe town attorney mr brown wrote on dec  that he did not think mr heaney had violated any law even if mr suskinds allegations are true he wrote a threat to disclose factual matters breaches neither ethical nor legal proscriptionsmr shields who was a deputy town attorney before joining the state attorney generals office said he had become a political footballthis is a dispute between two people he said referring to mr heaney and mr suskind but im the one whos going to suffer from this the ramifications for me are so farreaching you cant even imagine he declined further comment continue reading the main story we’re interested in
