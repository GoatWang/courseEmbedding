served as a direct source for or influence on the books of kings and chronicles the prophets and the psalms as well as the new testament and references to david can even be found in gen  and num  as anderson has documented although  samuel begins with the death of his predecessor saul and follows through to davids old age the socalled succession narrative comprises most of the story in the book telling how david built his kingdom and survived all threats to its continuity it culminates in the final act of placing solomon on the throne which spills over into  kings  anderson considers the succession narrative to be an apologyan official interpretation of significant events not a eulogy written to the greater glory of either david or solomon rather it was intended to show that david in spite of a series of near disasters was not under a curse and it maintains that solomon was the rightful heir to davids throne even though popular expectations as well as solomons youth and parentage apparently led many contemporaries to question that judgment the issue was not who of davids sons will be king the author points out but more likely  is there any of davids sons fit to sit on the throne of david the commentary offers a full general bibliography with additional specialized listings of uptodate bibliographies at the beginning of each chapter and of each section of the introduction the introduction discusses the literary history of samuel samuels relation to the books of joshua judges and kings the succession narrative the text of samuel and its research the use of samuel in the scriptures the volume provides a fresh translation with detailed explanatory notes concerning original word choices carefully evaluating textual evidence from the masoretic text the septuagint qumran texts the targums and latin texts anderson holds that no one of these has a monopoly as the best witness to the original text each variation is thus evaluated for the contribution it

reasonable medical expenses mar    yesterday the president’s council of advisors on science and technology “pcast“ released a final report finding that many of the forensic science techniques used to prosecute criminal cases do not meet scientific standards  specifically the report raised issues with the use of toolmark analysis ballistics bite mark hair footwear and other evidence used in criminal cases all over the country  this is yet another critical look at the state of forensic science and the way it is used to convict people at a staggering rate the report said pcast concluded that there are two important gaps  the need for clarity about the scientific standards for the validity and reliability of forensic methods and  the need to evaluate specific forensic methods to determine whether they have been scientifically established to be valid and reliable our study aimed to help close these gaps for a number of forensic “featurecomparison” methods—specifically methods for comparing dna samples bitemarks latent fingerprints firearm marks footwear and hair despite the report’s recommendations the attorney general stated that the department of justice will not adopt the recommendations in relation to the admissibility of forensic science as evidence at trial  this comes only a few days after doj issued a memorandum addressing certain changes in their policy towards forensic evidence and releasing a code of professional conduct for forensic analysts the ongoing struggle of the validity of forensic science in the courtroom and ways to improve the reliability of the science is ongoing  this is an incredibly important topic in terms of criminal defense because of the likelihood that a jury will believe “scientific” evidence over other potentially more reliable evidence because they are told that it is in fact science  if you have been charged with a crime and the evidence includes any kind of forensic evidence it is important to
