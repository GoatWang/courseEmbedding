contain a slew of misguided admonishments regarding the technology bubble the capsule would probably include advertisements for daytrading from home claims that value investing was dead and a push to “fire your broker and open an online account” another might read “don’t worry about justifying valuations just buy large cap tech stocks and prepare to retire” depending upon how closely one had heeded them at the time one would either laugh or cringe we find similarities to that thinking today you can’t pick up a financial publication without finding articles calling for the death of active money management exchange traded funds etfs in countless flavors suiting every supposed need could be today’s equivalent the prevailing plan is to buy the cheapest or smartest beta exposure and
