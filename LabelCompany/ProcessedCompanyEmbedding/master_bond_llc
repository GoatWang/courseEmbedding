characteristic of being able to adjust the properties of the cured system by altering the mix ratio adding more of part a eg a two to one mix ratio gives a more rigid cure for enhanced machinability while adding more of part b eg a one to two mix ratio gives a more forgiving cure for greater impact resistance eplv produces high strength durable bonds which hold up well to thermal cycling and resists many chemicals including water oils fuels acids bases and salts it is serviceable over the wide temperature range of °f to °f it bonds well to a variety of substrates including metals glass ceramics wood rubbers and many plastics once cured eplv is an outstanding electrical insulator this coupled with its low viscosity makes it an excellent encapsulating and potting epoxy it meets fda requirements for indirect food contact eplv contains no solvents or diluents while the standard color of the cured material is amberclear a wide variety of additional color choices are also available
