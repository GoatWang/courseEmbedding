description statement regarding federally funded researchthis invention was made with government support under grant numbers gm gm and ca awarded by the national institutes of health the government has certain rights in this inventionbackgroundthe plasma membrane presents a major challenge in drug discovery especially for biologics such as peptides proteins and nucleic acids one potential strategy to subvert the membrane barrier and deliver the biologics into cells is to attach them to “cellpenetrating peptides cpps” despite three decades of investigation the fundamental basis for cpp activity remains elusive cpps that enter cells via endocytosis must exit from endocytic vesicles in order to reach the cytosol unfortunately the endosomal membrane has proven to be a significant barrier towards cytoplasmic delivery by these cpps often a negligible fraction of the peptides escapes into the cell interior elsayed a et al aaps j    varkouhi a k et al j controlled release

include a mammal such as a primate or a human thus the subject can be a human or veterinary patient the term “patient” refers to a subject under the treatment of a clinician eg physicianthe term “inhibit” refers to a decrease in an activity response condition disease or other biological parameter this can include but is not limited to the complete ablation of the activity response condition or disease this can also include for example a  reduction in the activity response condition or disease as compared to the native or control level thus the reduction can be a           or any amount of reduction in between as compared to native or control levelsby “reduce” or other forms of the word such as “reducing” or “reduction” is meant lowering of an event or characteristic eg tumor growth it is understood that this is typically in relation to some standard or expected value in other words it is relative but that it is not always necessary for the standard or relative value to be referred to for example “reduces tumor growth” means reducing the rate of growth of a tumor relative to a standard or a controlby “prevent” or other forms of the word such as “preventing” or “prevention” is meant to stop a particular event or characteristic to stabilize or delay the development or progression of a particular event or characteristic or to minimize the chances that a particular event or characteristic will occur prevent does not require comparison to a control as it is typically more absolute than for example reduce as used herein something could be reduced but not prevented but something that is reduced could also be prevented likewise something could be prevented but not reduced but something that is prevented could also be reduced it is understood that where reduce or prevent are used unless specifically indicated otherwise the use of the other word is also expressly disclosed for example the terms “prevent” or “suppress” can refer to a treatment that forestalls or slows the onset of a disease or condition or reduced the severity of the disease or condition thus if a treatment can treat a disease in a subject having symptoms of the disease it can also prevent or suppress that disease in a subject who has yet to suffer some or all of the symptomsthe term “treatment” refers to the medical management of a patient with the intent to cure ameliorate stabilize or prevent a disease pathological condition or disorder this term includes active treatment that is treatment directed specifically toward the improvement of a disease pathological condition or disorder and also includes causal treatment that is treatment directed toward removal of the cause of the associated disease pathological condition or disorder in addition this term includes palliative treatment that is treatment designed for the relief of symptoms rather than the curing of the disease pathological condition or disorder preventative treatment that is treatment directed to minimizing or partially or completely inhibiting the development of the associated disease pathological condition or disorder and supportive treatment that is treatment employed to supplement another specific therapy directed toward the improvement of the associated disease pathological condition or disorderthe term “anticancer” refers to the ability to treat or control cellular proliferation andor tumor growth at any concentrationthe term “therapeutically effective” refers to the amount of the composition used is of sufficient quantity to ameliorate one or more causes or symptoms of a disease or disorder such amelioration only requires a reduction or alteration not necessarily eliminationthe term “pharmaceutically acceptable” refers to those compounds materials compositions andor dosage forms which are within the scope of sound medical judgment suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity irritation allergic response or other problems or complications commensurate with a reasonable benefitrisk ratiothe term “carrier” means a compound composition substance or structure that when in combination with a compound or composition aids or facilitates preparation storage administration delivery effectiveness selectivity or any other feature of the compound or composition for its intended use or purpose for example a carrier can be selected to minimize any degradation of the active ingredient and to minimize any adverse side effects in the subjectthe terms “peptide” “protein” and “polypeptide” are used interchangeably to refer to a natural or synthetic molecule comprising two or more amino acids linked by the carboxyl group of one amino acid to the alpha amino group of anotherunless stated to the contrary a formula with chemical bonds shown only as solid lines and not as wedges or dashed lines contemplates each possible isomer eg each enantiomer diastereomer and

a variant of any of seq id no to seq id no peptide variants are well understood to those of skill in the art and can involve amino acid sequence modifications for example amino acid sequence modifications typically fall into one or more of three classes substitutional insertional or deletional variants insertions include amino andor carboxyl terminal fusions as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues insertions ordinarily will be smaller insertions than those of amino or carboxyl terminal fusions for example on the order of  to  residues deletions are characterized by the removal of one or more amino acid residues from the peptide sequence typically no more than from  to  residues are deleted at any one site within the peptide amino acid substitutions are typically of single residues but can occur at a number of different locations at once insertions usually will be on the order of about from  to  amino acid residues and deletions will range about from  to  residues deletions or insertions preferably are made in adjacent pairs ie a deletion of  residues or insertion of  residues substitutions deletions insertions or any combination thereof can be combined to arrive at a final construct substitutional variants are those in which at least one residue has been removed and a different residue inserted in its place such substitutions generally are made in accordance with the following table  and are referred to as conservative substitutionstable amino acid substitutionsexemplary conservative substitutionsala

glycosylationfor example the replacement of one amino acid residue with another that is biologically andor chemically similar is known to those skilled in the art as a conservative substitution for example a conservative substitution would be replacing one hydrophobic residue for another or one polar residue for another the substitutions include combinations such as for example gly ala val ile leu asp glu asn gln ser thr lys arg and phe tyr such conservatively substituted variations of each explicitly disclosed sequence are included within the peptides provided hereinit is understood that

stability and cytosolic deliverydespite three decades of investigation the fundamental basis for cpp activity remains elusive two distinct and nonmutually exclusive mechanisms have been proposed for the cpps whose primary sequences are characterized by having multiple arginine residues in the first mechanism direct membrane translocation the arginine guanidinium groups interact with phospholipids of the plasma membrane to generate neutral ion pairs that passively diffuse across the membrane herce h d and garcia a e proc natl acad sci usa    hirose h et al mol ther    or promote the formation

observations that nonamphipathic cationic cpps eg tat and r bind tightly with cell surface proteoglycans eg heparan sulfate but only weakly with membrane lipids ziegler a adv drug delivery rev    the insufficient number of positive charges of cfφris likely responsible for its lack of strong electrostatic interaction with heparan sulfate on the other hand the amphipathic nature and the more rigid cyclic structure of cfφr should facilitate its binding to neutral lipid membranes these data together with the inhibition pattern by various endocytic inhibitors described above suggest that cfφr can bind directly to the plasma membrane phospholipids and can be internalized by all of the endocytic mechanisms in a piggyback mannerintracellular delivery of peptidyl cargos since endocyclic delivery by cfφris limited to a heptapeptide or smaller cargos qian z et al acs chem biol    in this study the ability of cfφrto deliver cargos of varying sizes and physicochemical properties attached to the

peptide cfφra fig a or cfφrr fig b showed evidence of both punctate and diffuse fluorescence with the latter distributed almost uniformly throughout the cell in contrast the fluid phase endocytic marker dextranfitc displayed predominantly punctate fluorescence indicative of endosomal localization the diffuse rhodamine fluorescence suggests that a fraction of the peptides reached the cytosol

impermeable to the cell membrane kwon y u and kodadek t chem biol    rezai t et al j am chem soc    chatterjee j et al acc chem res    the attempt to deliver cyclic peptides by cfφr by the endocyclic method had only limited success increase in the cargo size from  to  residues led to progressively poorer cellular uptake likely because the larger more flexible rings bind more poorly to the cell membrane qian z et al acs chem biol    to overcome this limitation a bicyclic peptide system was explored in which one ring contains a cpp motif eg fφr while the other ring consists of peptide sequences specific for the desired targets fig c the bicyclic system should in principle be able to accommodate cargos of any size because the cargo does not change the structure of the cpp ring and should have less impact on its delivery efficiency the additional rigidity of a bicyclic structure should also improve its metabolic stability as well as the targetbinding affinity and specificity the bicyclic peptides were readily synthesized by forming three amide bonds between a trimesoyl scaffold and three amino groups on the corresponding linear peptide ie the nterminal amine the side chain of a cterminal diaminopropionic acid dap and the side chain of a lysine or ornithine dap imbedded in between the cpp and targetbinding motifs lian w et al j am chem soc    to test the validity of this approach fφr was chosen in the cterminal ring as the cpp moiety and peptides of different lengths and charges aaaaa aaaaaaa rarar or dadad were chosen as cargo table  compounds  for comparison two monocyclic peptides containing fφr as transporter and peptides a and a as cargos table  compounds  and  were also prepared all of the peptides were labeled at a cterminal lysine side chain with rhodamine b fig  and their internalization into hek cells was examined by livecell confocal microscopy treatment of cells with  μm peptide for  h resulted in efficient internalization of all six peptides fig  although facs analysis indicated that the uptake of bicyclofφrarho was ˜fold more efficient than the corresponding monocyclic peptide compound  the intracellular distribution of the internalized peptides was quite different between the bicyclic and monocyclic peptides while the four bicyclic peptides showed evidence for their presence in both the cytoplasmnucleus as indicated by the diffuse rhodamine fluorescence and the endosomes as indicated by the fluorescence puncta the monocyclic peptides exhibited predominantly punctate fluorescence that overlapped with that of the endocytic marker dextranfitc in all cases the endocytic marker displayed only punctate fluorescence indicating that the endosomes were intact in the cells treated with the peptides these results indicate that the increased structural rigidity of the bicyclic peptides facilitates both the initial uptake by endocytosis and endosomal release presumably because of their improved binding to the plasma and endosomal membranes the bicyclic system may provide a general strategy for intracellular delivery of cyclic and bicyclic peptidesintracellular delivery of protein cargos to test whether cfφr is capable of transporting fulllength proteins into mammalian cells gfp was attached to the nterminus of cfφr through a disulfide bond fig a andfig  gfp was chosen because of its intrinsic fluorescence the disulfide exchange reaction is highly specific efficient and reversible upon entering the cytoplasm the cppssprotein conjugate can be rapidly reduced to release the native protein although cfφr can be directly attached to a native or engineered surface cysteine residues on a cargo protein a gfp variant containing a amino acid ybbr tag at its nterminus was used and phosphopantetheinyl transferase sfp was used to enzymatically attach cfφrto the ybbr tag yin j et al proc natl acad sci usa    this permitted the attachment of a single cfφr unit to gfp in a sitespecific manner for comparison a tatssgfp conjugate was generated in the same manner incubation of hek cells in the presence of  μm cfφrssgfp resulted in accumulation of green fluorescence inside the cells fig b the fluorescence signal was diffuse and present throughout the entire cell volume but with higher concentrations in the nucleus some of the cells contained small spots of intense green fluorescence indicated by arrows infig b which may represent endosomally sequestered cfφrssgfp or aggregated gfp inside the cell the untagged gfp was unable to enter cells whereas tatssgfp entered cells less efficiently than cfφrssgfp fig b facs analysis of hala cells treated with  μm protein revealed a fold higher total intracellular fluorescence for the latter the fluorescence puncta in the cell periphery as well as lack of any detectable fluorescence in the nuclear region of tatssgfp treated cells indicate that tatssgfp is mostly entrapped in the endosomes in agreement with previous reports kaplan i m et al j controlled release    thus with a protein as cargo cfφr also has higher efficiency than tat with regard to both initial uptake and endosomal escapeto demonstrate the generality of cfφr for protein delivery a functional enzyme the catalytic domain of ptpb amino acids  was chosen to be delivered into the cell interior to show that a noncleavable linkage is also compatible with the delivery method cfφr was conjugated to ybbrtagged ptpb via a thioether bond cfφrptpb fig  in vitro assay using pnitrophenyl phosphate as substrate showed that addition of the cfφr tag does not affect the catalytic activity of ptpb table  nih t cells were incubated for  h in the presence of untagged ptpb or cfφrptpb and their global py protein levels were analyzed by antipy western blotting fig a treatment of the cells with cfφrptpb but not untagged ptpb resulted in concentrationdependent decrease in py levels of most but not all proteins the total cellular protein levels as detected by coomassie blue staining were unchanged fig b indicating that the observed decrease in py levels was due to dephosphorylation of the py proteins by cfφrptpb andor secondary effects caused by the introduction of cfφrptpb eg inactivation of cellular protein tyrosine kinases interestingly different proteins exhibited varying dephosphorylation kinetics several proteins in the  kd range were completely dephosphorylated upon the addition of  nm cfφrptpb whereas proteins of ˜ kd remained phosphorylated at  nm cfφrptpb the changes in the py pattern are consistent with the broad substrate specificity of ptpb ren l et al biochemistry    and very similar to that caused by overexpression of ptpb inside the cytosol of mammalian cells lamontagne jr k r et al proc natl acad sci usa    these results indicate that cfφr can deliver ptpb into the interior of nih t cells in the catalytically active form and to sufficient levels to perturb the cell signaling process cfφr thus

ren l et al biochemistry    stability and cytotoxicity of cfφr the relative stability of cfφr r tat and antp table  compounds  against proteolytic degradation was determined by incubating the cpps in  human serum at ° c and following the disappearance of the fulllength peptides by reversedphase hplc the cationic tryptophancontaining peptide antp was least stable among the four cpps it was degraded at a halflife of  min and was completely digested after  h fig a r and tat were slightly more stable than antp having halflives of ˜ min in contrast cfφrwas remarkably stable against serum proteases there was less than  degradation after  h of incubation after  h of incubation in the serum  of cfφr remained intact numerous other studies have also demonstrated that cyclization of peptides increases their proteolytic stabilities nguyen l t et al plos one   e the potential cytotoxicity of cfφr was assessed by mtt assays with five different human cell lines hek mcf a h and h after  or  h of incubation with up to  μm cfφr there was no significant growth inhibition for any of the cell lines fig b and fig  after  h a slight growth inhibition up to  was observed at  μm fig  thus cfφr is relatively nontoxic to mammalian cellsin this study it was demonstrated that cfφr can be effective for exocyclic delivery of smallmolecule peptide and protein cargos into the cytoplasm and nucleus of mammalian cells by using a pcapcontaining peptide as cargoreporter it was shown that cfφr can be fold more efficient than r tat and antp for cytoplasmic cargo delivery making cfφr one of the most active cpps known to date although modification of polybasic cpps such as addition of hydrophobic acyl groups has previously been reported to enhance cellular uptake by a similar magnitude pham w et al chembiochem    these previous studies have not established whether the enhanced uptake translates into a similar increase in the cytoplasmic cpp concentration the pcapbased reporter system described herein can provide a simple robust method to quantitatively assess the cytoplasmic delivery efficiency of other cpps several lines of evidence indicate that cfφr can enter cells through multiple endocytic mechanisms including its failure to enter cells at ° c or in the presence of sodium azide partial overlap between the fluorescence puncta of cfφrrho and the fluid phase endocytic marker dextranfitc colocalization of cfφrrho and endosomal proteins rab and rab and decreased cfφrdex uptake upon administration of endocytic inhibitors the minimal effect of the pik inhibitor wortmannin and the rab ql mutation on the cytoplasmic delivery of cfφr in addition to the strong colocalization observed between cfφr and rab endosomes suggest that cfφr can escape from early endosomes fig  in comparison tat has been demonstrated to enter cells through endocytosis and release from late endosomes while r escapes endosomes prior to rab recruitment appelbaum j s et al chem biol    early endosomal release can offer advantages especially for peptide and protein cargos since it can minimize cargo degradation by late endosomal and lysosomal proteases and denaturation caused by acidification during endosomal maturation indeed both gfp and ptpb delivered into the cytoplasm by cfφr were in their folded active forms as evidenced by the green fluorescence and the ability to dephosphorylate intracellular py proteins respectively additionally due to its more rigid structure cfφr can be more stable against proteolytic degradation than linear peptides and due to its smaller size cfφr can be less expensive to synthesize and potentially less likely to interfere with the cargo function these properties can make cfφr a useful transporter for cytosolic delivery of smallmolecule to protein cargos direct protein delivery can provide a useful research tool eg for studying the cellular function of a protein as it can offer improved temporal control over dna transfection and subsequent gene expression and can allow delivery of chemically modified proteins and proteins whose overexpression can cause toxicity the ability of cfφr to escape from early endosomes and its simple structure can also provide an excellent system for elucidating the mechanism of endosomal escape and the factors that influence the escape efficiencyexample cyclization of peptide ligands can be effective for improving their stability against proteolytic degradation and in some cases their cell permeability however this strategy is not compatible with proteins that recognize peptide ligands in the extended conformations eg βstrand and αhelix in this work a general strategy for intracellular delivery of linear peptide ligands was developed by fusing them with an amphipathic sequence motif eg rrrrφf where φ is lnaphthylalanine and cyclizing the resulting conjugate through a disulfide bond the cyclized peptides can have enhanced proteolytic stability and membrane permeability upon entering the cytoplasmnucleus of a cell the disulfide bond can be cleaved by the reducing intracellular environment to release the linear biologically active peptide this strategy was applied to generate cell permeable peptides as caspase substrates and inhibitors against the cal pdz domain for potential treatment of cystic fibrosisthe applicability of linear peptides as drugs is often limited by their susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage and poor membrane permeability cyclization of peptides can be effective for improving their proteolytic stability nguyen l t et al plos one   e moreover it was recently reported that cyclization of certain amphipathic peptides eg fφrrrr where φ is lnaphthylalanine can render them cell permeable through an active transport mechanism qian z et al acs chem biol    biologically active cyclic peptides can be delivered into the cytoplasm and nucleus of mammalian cells by incorporating into them these short sequence motifs qian z et al acs chem biol    however in many circumstances binding to a molecular target eg pdz doyle d a et al cell    morais cabral j h et al nature    and bir domains wu g et al nature    can require that the peptidyl ligand exist in its extended conformation eg αhelix and βstrand and cyclization may interfere with target binding herein a potentially general strategy for delivering linear peptide ligands into mammalian cells through reversible disulfide bondmediated cyclization is examined when present in the oxidizing extracellular environment the peptides can exist as macrocycles which can have enhanced stability against proteolysis and cell permeability upon entering the cell ie cytoplasm andor nucleus the disulfide bond can be reduced by the intracellular thiols to produce

activity by  and  respectively relative to peptide  whereas cyclization by thioether formation rendered the peptide inactive toward recombinant caspase  table  the activity of peptide  toward caspase  could not be reliably determined because the caspase assay required a reducing environment which would cleave the disulfide bond given the structural similarity between peptides  and  it can be assumed that peptide  in the cyclic form is also inactive toward caspases but has similar activity to peptide  after reductive cleavage of the disulfide bondtable in vitro activity of various

substrate peptide  produced little fluorescence increase over the h period fig  peptide  produced the fastest fluorescence increase reaching  fluorescence units fu followed by peptides  and  peptide  which is inactive toward caspase  also produced amc in a timedependent manner albeit at a much slower rate  fu this slow rate of amc release can be attributed to hydrolysis by other intracellular

released amc at a rate that was similar to that of peptide  alone one explanation of the above observations is that both peptides  and  can enter the cell interior efficiently but only peptide  can be

l et al biochemistry    fig a analysis of the same samples by coomassie blue staining showed similar amounts of proteins in all samples fig b indicating that the increased py levels reflected increased phosphorylation or decreased ptp reaction instead of changes in the total protein levels remarkably the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was already apparent at  nm inhibitor  interestingly further increase in inhibitor concentration beyond  μm reversed the effect on tyrosine phosphorylation an observation that was also made previously by zhang and coworkers with a

dosedependent increase in insulin receptor phosphorylation up to  μm inhibitor and the effect leveled off at higher concentrations figs c d taken together these data indicate that bicyclic inhibitor  can efficiently enter mammalian cells and can inhibit ptpb in vivo the decreased phosphorylation at higher inhibitor concentrations may be caused by nonspecific inhibition of other ptps which may in turn down regulate protein tyrosine kinases it may also reflect the pleiotropic roles played by ptpb which can both negatively and positively regulate the activities of different protein kinases

dnaphthylalaninef  dphenylalaniner  darginineq  dglutamine example cardiomyocytes are in general difficult to transfect with dna and delivering proteins into them by using previous cpps have not been successful there is therefore an unmet need for delivering therapeutic proteins into heart tissuesthe disclosed cyclic cpps are very effective in delivering proteins into cardiomyocytes fluorescein isothiocyanate fitclabeled cyclic cpps cfφrrrrqkfitcnh and cfφrrrrqkfitcnh were synthesized and their internalization into mouse ventricular cardiac myocytes was tested by treating the cells with  μm fitclabeled peptide for  h after washing away the extracellular peptides the internalization of cpps was examined by fluorescent livecell confocal microscopy both peptides exhibited significant and predominantly diffused fluorescence throughout the cells indicating efficient internalization of the cpps into cardiac muscle cells figs a and b whether the cyclic cpps are capable of transporting fulllength proteins into cardiac muscle cells was tested calmodulin with an engineered thrcys a multifunctional calciumbinding messenger protein was conjugated to cfφrrrrqc—nh at the cys residue near nterminus through a disulfide bond the disulfide exchange reaction is highly specific efficient and reversible further upon entering the cytosol of cells the disulfide linkage is expected to be reduced to release the native protein fig c the cppprotein conjugate was chemically labeled on aminogroups with cyanine which permits visualization of the internalized calmodulin mouse ventricular cardiac myocytes were incubated with  μm of the cppcalmodulin conjugate for  h and examined by livecell confocal microscopy the intracellular fluorescence signal was present throughout the entire cell volume and displayed a sarcomeric pattern fig d indicating the internalized calmodulin was properly integrated into the cellular machinery these data indicate that the disclosed cyclic cpps such as cfφrrrrq are uniquely capable of delivering small molecules as well as proteins likely in their native form into cardiomyocytes with high efficiency opening the door to future therapeutic applicationsexample pin is a phosphorylationdependent peptidylprolyl cistrans isomerase ppiase it contains an nterminal ww domain and a cterminal catalytic domain both of which recognize specific phosphoserine pserphosphothreonine pthrpro motifs in their protein substrates through cistrans isomerization of specific pserpthrpro bonds pin regulates the levels activities as well as intracellular localization of a wide variety of phosphoproteins for example pin controls the in vivo stability of cyclin d and cyclin e and switches cjun cfos and nfκb between their inactive unstable forms and active stable forms isomerization by pin also regulates the catalytic activity of numerous cellcycle signaling proteins such as phosphatase cdcc and kinase wee finally pincatalyzed conformational changes in βcatenin and nfκb lead to subcellular translocationgiven its critical roles in cellcycle regulation and increased expression levels and activity in human cancers pin has been proposed as a potential target for the development of anticancer drugs pin is also implicated in neural degenerative diseases such as alzheimers disease therefore there have been significant interests in developing specific inhibitors against pin smallmolecule inhibitors such as juglone pib dipentamenthylene thiauram monosulfide and halogenated phenylisothiazolone tme generally lack sufficient potency andor specificity a number of potent peptidyl pin inhibitors have been reported and are more selective than the smallmolecule inhibitors however peptidyl inhibitors are generally impermeable to the cell membrane and therefore have limited utility as therapeutics or in vivo probes a cellpermeable bicyclic peptidyl inhibitor against pin in which one ring a ring featured a pinbinding phosphopeptide motif dpthrpipnai where pip and nai are rpiperidinecarboxylic acid and lnaphthylalanine respectively while the second ring b ring contained a cellpenetrating peptide phenaiargargargarg is shown in fig  peptide  although the bicyclic peptidyl inhibitor is potent kd nm and active in cellular assays its dpthr moiety might be metabolically labile due to hydrolysis by nonspecific phosphatases the negative charges of the phosphate group might also impede the cellular entry of the inhibitor here a nonphosphorylated bicyclic peptidyl inhibitor against pin was prepared by screening a peptide library and hit optimization the resulting bicyclic peptidyl inhibitor is potent and selective against pin in vitro cellpermeable and metabolically stable in biological assaysalthough removal of the phosphoryl group of peptide  significantly reduced its potency against pin the nonphosphorylated peptide fig  peptide  was still a relatively potent pin inhibitor kd μm the potency of peptide  might be further improved by optimizing the sequences flanking the dthrpipnai motif so a secondgeneration bicyclic peptide library

peptides that showed ≧ fa increase relative to the noprotein control the corresponding beads  beads which still contained the linear encoding peptides were sequenced by pedms to give  additional complete sequences table  all  hit sequences contained a damino acid at the x position consistent with the previous observation that pin prefers dpthr over pthr at this position there is a strong preference for hydrophobic especially aromatic hydrophobic residues at the x position but no obvious selectivity at the x positionhit optimization the  hit sequences hits  and  have the same sequence were resynthesized with a lys added to their ctermini labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc and tested for binding to pin by fa table  peptides  all six peptides bound to pin with moderate affinities kd˜ μm but did not improve upon peptide  kd μm peptides  and  were used for structureactivity relationship analysis and optimization either expanding or contracting the size of the pinbinding ring a ring decreased the binding affinity table  peptides  replacement of the ala residue of peptide  with amino acids containing side chains of different physicochemical properties including arg asp ser tyr and val also failed to significantly improve the binding affinity table  peptide  on the other hand modification of the dala residue revealed that substitution of a dphe at this position increases the pin inhibitory activity by ˜fold kd μm for peptide peptide  was subjected to similar sar studies as observed for peptide  modification of the ala residue of peptide  into gly had little effect peptide  but replacement of the dala residue with dphe improved the binding affinity to pin by ˜fold table  kd μm for peptide  modifications of the fpa residue at the x position eg replacement with other halogenated phenylalanine analogs all decreased the inhibitor potency peptides  likewise removal of the aromatic side chain at the x position was detrimental to pin binding peptides  and  however substitution of halogenated dphe analogs improved the pin binding activity peptides  in particular replacement of dphe with dfluorophenylalanine dfpa resulted in the most potent pin inhibitor of this series kd μm for peptide  figs  and a further attempts to modify the dthr residue or the cpp motif failed to improve the pin activity table  peptides biological evaluation to determine whether peptide  binds to the catalytic site of pin its ability to compete with peptide  for binding to pin by fa analysis was examined peptide  had previously been shown to bind to the pin active site as expected peptide  inhibited the binding of peptide  to pin with an ic value of  nm fig b next the catalytic activity of pin toward a peptide substrate sucalagluprophepna in the presence of increasing concentrations of peptide  was monitored peptide  inhibited the pin activity in a concentrationdependent manner with an ic value of  nm fig c these results demonstrate that peptide  binds at or near the active site of pinthe selectivity of peptide  was assessed by two different tests first peptide  was tested for binding to a panel of arbitrarily selected proteins including bovine serum albumin bsa protein tyrosine phosphatases b shp and shp the grb sh domain ras and tumor necrosis factorα peptide  bound weakly to bsa kd˜ μm but not any of the other six proteins peptide  was next tested for potential inhibition of pin fkbp and cyclophilin a the three other common human peptidylprolyl cistrans isomerases although pin is structurally similar to pin and has partially overlapping functions with pin peptide  only slightly inhibited pin ˜ at  μm inhibitor with an estimated ic value of ˜ μm fig c peptide  had no effect on the catalytic activity of fkbp or cyclophilin a up to  μm concentration these data suggest that peptide  is a highly specific inhibitor of pinthe metabolic stability of peptide  was evaluated by incubating it in human serum for varying periods of time and analyzing the reaction mixtures by reversedphase hplc the pthrcontaining pin inhibitor  was used as a control after  h of incubation  of peptide  remained intact while ˜ of bicyclic peptide  was degraded after  h fig d loss of peptide  was accompanied by the concomitant appearance of a new peak in hplc mass spectrometric analysis of the new species identified it as the dephosphorylation product of peptide  peptide  this result is in agreement with our previous observation that the structurally constrained bicyclic peptides are highly resistant to proteolytic degradation the dpthr moiety remains susceptible to hydrolysis by the nonspecific phosphatases in human serumthe cellular uptake efficiency of peptide  peptide  and a previously reported membraneimpermeable monocyclic pin inhibitor table  peptide  was assessed by incubating hela cells with the fitclabeled peptides  μm for  h and quantifying the total intracellular fluorescence by flow cytometry analysis as expected untreated cells and cells treated with peptide  showed little cellular fluorescence having mean fluorescence intensity mfi values of  and  respectively fig a by contrast cells treated with peptides  and  gave mfi values of  and  respectively thus peptide  is internalized by hela cells ˜fold more efficiently than peptide  presumably the negative charged phosphate group of peptide  interacted electrostatically with the positively charged cpp motif and reduced the cellular uptake efficiency of the latterinhibition of pin activity has previously been shown to decrease cell proliferation the effect of peptide  on the growth of hela cells was examined by using the mtt cell viability assay the membrane impermeable peptide  and a cellpermeable but inactive defective in pin binding bicyclic peptide table  peptide  were used as controls peptide  inhibited hela cell growth in a concentrationdependent manner with an ic value of  μm fig b as expected neither peptide  nor  had any effect on cell growth a timecourse study also showed significant growth inhibition  after a day treatment with  μm peptide  but not with peptide  or  the phosphorylated bicyclic peptide  under similar testing conditions had an ic value of  μmfinally to ascertain that pin is the molecular target of peptide  in vivo the intracellular protein level of a wellestablished pin substrate promyeloretinoic leukemia protein pml was examined by western blot analysis pin negatively regulates the pml level in a phosphorylationdependent manner and inhibition of pin activity is expected to stabilize pml and increase its intracellular level indeed treatment of hela cells with peptide   μm resulted in concentrationdependent increases in the pml level figs c d the effect was already significant at  μm inhibitor fold increase in the pml level and plateaued at ˜ μm fold increase again bicyclic peptide  had no effect under the same conditions while peptide  the positive control at  μm increased the pml level by foldby screening a peptide library followed by conventional medicinal chemistry approaches the first potent selective metabolically stable and cellpermeable peptidyl inhibitor against human pin has
