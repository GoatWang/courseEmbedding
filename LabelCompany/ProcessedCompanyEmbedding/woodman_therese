gopro ceo nick woodman takes the stage during a press event in september  by theresepoletti columnist gopro inc seems to have found more fat in its organization just a few months after a round of job cuts with claims that more layoffs wont hurt its product development cycle earlier on wednesday gopro gpro   surprised investors with news that it was cutting  more jobs forecasting revenue on the high end of its guidance and profitability on an adjusted or ebitda basis in  the sent the stock soaring  in morning trade thursday putting it on track for the biggest oneday gain in  months about one hour after the open volume was already more the double the fullday average gopro’s shares are still worth about half what they were at their week high and last week goldman sachs downgraded the stock to a sell citing a number of its challenges including saturation in its core camera market a new competitor and worries about its cash flow graphic embed is no longer available gopro executives on a brief conference call with analysts said the additional job cuts were a result of a thorough review of all its business operations and procedures “we are confident that we are not making those tradeoffs” said charles “cj” prober who was named chief operating officer in january when asked whether the additional job cuts would affect new product development “by being more focused we feel we are improving our efficiency and doing fewer things better” executives also said gopro has enough cash and doesnt see a need to draw on its line of credit the news comes just a few months after gopro’s bombshell in late november that it was cutting  of its workforce including the closure of its oncevaunted entertainment division and a recall of its new karma drone gopro has since relaunched the karma drone but so far reviews have been tepid the verge surmised that karma is a good starter kit for current gopro users but if you don’t already own one “there is no reason to settle for a drone with a spotty track record and a total lack of cuttingedge features” the consumer drone market is dominated by dji technology of china and the number of players has been dwindling analysts and investors are counting on the company to keep on launching new products this year ceo and cofounder nick woodman told analysts on the call that last year the company went through herculean efforts launching new cameras editing software a drone and getting them all to work together “we have shifted from a revolutionary year to an evolutionary year” woodman said adding that its new products are reliable and are succeeding for customers “it is far less risky to evolve than to be revolutionary” but any investors hoping for major new products this year may have to reset their expectations it sounds like gopro is looking at incremental upgrades at least this year as it deals with an even more competitive market skepticism is probably the best bet until a turnaround is really evident

work primarily succeeds in revealing the incredibly talented musician burt bacharach as egocentric pompous and privileged bacharachs perspectives are voiced by tony call who does an adequate job in bringing the subject to life however his unadorned narration suffers from several instances of uninformed phrasing and pauses that make listeners contextual understanding more difficult jeff woodman expressively handles all the other male voices therese plummer voices the female interviewees such as exwife angie dickinson the interviews are topically and directly presented and excerpted the three voices each with its own merits make for a confusing excursion into the highs and lows of one of the most successful and prolific songwriters ever this is a flawed memoir from an undisputed major
