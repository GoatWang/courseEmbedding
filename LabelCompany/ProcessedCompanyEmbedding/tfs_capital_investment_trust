tfs capital about tfs capital home firm overview firm leadership guiding principles investment philosophy tfs in the news press releases our edge we believe there are many factors that give us a competitive advantage over other managers tfs utilizes a team approach which we believe greatly reduces the chance of irrational decisionmaking and limits dependence on a single individual we also have a stated principle to limit growth because we believe that managing a smaller pool of capital generally permits more attractive investment opportunities we believe that our innovative quantitative techniques expedite our evaluation of securities which allows us to make faster adjustments to the portfolios being managed finally our portfolio managers do not have traditional “wall street” backgrounds which we believe helps us to avoid overused analysis methods that may be losing their utility investment philosophy avoid the status quo tfs has found that the best opportunities exist where others do not think to look as such the firm seeks to employ creative portfolio managers with nontraditional backgrounds in an effort to avoid the pitfalls of relying on preconceived notions about what factors drive the securities markets ignore the style boxes tfs believes the best results are generated when a portfolio manager is given greater freedom in regard to the securities that may be chosen as such with many of our products we do not allow ourselves to be confined to a single style sector or market capitalization range rather tfs considers a broad universe of securities and selects positions based upon a detailed bottomup analysis use an academic approach to strategy research tfs manages funds using its own proprietary investment strategies that are developed by an experienced team of portfolio managers similar to academic research a candidate strategy must be supported by a solid foundation of qualitative research and must also through trading simulations empirically demonstrate an ability to produce positive abnormal return perform rigorous quantitative analysis tfs gains an edge through its exhaustive quantitative analysis of potential investment strategies upon developing a potential investment strategy tfs will perform a trading simulation of the strategy using actual historical data for the securities used through the simulation tfs is able to quantify whether or not certain factors have historically been predictive of security price movement embrace technology with the abundance of information that is available on the markets today it is critical to leverage the power of information technology for tradeexecution and ongoing research and development as such we are committed to incorporating technology in all aspects of our portfolio management process for example trades are executed using electronic routing technologies that are designed to obtain favorable executions in addition we use sophisticated optimization and analysis software along with proprietary computer programming to evaluate strategies and monitor risk strategically manage risk when managing investment funds our first consideration is capital preservation because we believe it is the most significant factor in generating enhanced longterm performance our entire portfolio management process is directed by a team of managers thereby reducing dependence on a single manager and facilitating rational decisionmaking this team establishes parameters for strategy implementation that are designed to mitigate exposure to certain risks parameters are then monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that certain thresholds are not compromised important notice you are about to leave the tfs funds website and are being redirected to the tfs capital

leadership guiding principles investment philosophy tfs in the news press releases our mission to manage superior investment products that improve client portfolios while establishing ethical and fiduciary standards that promote the positive evolution of the portfolio management industry through fair competition and by mitigating conflicts of interest guiding principles create valuable products tfs will only launch and manage funds that we believe add value to investment portfolios tfs does not create products based on potential asset flow instead we would manage only products that we think are valuable – ones we would put our own money into and would want our friends and family members to invest in as well align interests with investors tfs is a firm believer in the benefit of its owners and portfolio managers investing in the funds that the firm manages since it provides the clearest indication that our interest is directly aligned with that of our investors each portfolio manager has a meaningful allocation to all of our tfs products build trust through integrity and higher fiduciary standards customer trust is the most critical element to the success of our business and consequently we embrace the fiduciary responsibility we have to our clients this philosophy is apparent in all aspects of the organization where tfs seeks to be an industry leader by setting standards that are more stringent than required by law for example the mutual funds managed by tfs adopted a policy of maintaining a majority of independent board members before this practice became an industry standard as another example tfs greatly restricts personal trading by employees and requires that any employee trades are precleared by the firm’s chief compliance officer educate through clear disclosures and fee transparency in an industry wrought with hidden agendas and poor disclosure tfs has nothing to hide our disclosure documents are written to facilitate client understanding because we believe the key to building a longterm relationship is to establish a good product fit from the start the funds managed by tfs do not charge any type of sales loads tfs discourages these fees and believes that they are a threat to the interests of investors and also inhibit progress in the fund industry by allowing inferior products to survive in addition tfs does not participate in softdollar arrangements with brokerage firms although these arrangements are legal and accepted by many of our competitors tfs believes they do not allow investors to fully understand the costs of owning a mutual fund lastly tfs seeks best execution on behalf of its fund clients invest heavily in research  development given the increasingly competitive landscape in the financial services industry tfs knows that ongoing research and development is critical to our continued success tfs will continue to invest heavily each year in ongoing strategy research important notice you are about
