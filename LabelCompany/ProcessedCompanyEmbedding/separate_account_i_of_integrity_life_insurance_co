strategies used by the funds manager including its strategy of selecting securities of companies whose value it believes is not fully recognized by the public and its allocation of assets across market sectors  nothing stated in the dynamic capital appreciation prospectus or statement of additional information sai prohibits the use of these strategies by its manager  of the nine    the capitalization range for the russell midcap index is  million to  billion as of may    the capitalization range for the standard  poors midcap  index is  million to  billion as of june        fundamental investment policies and limitations set forth in the portfolios sai one differs slightly between these two portfolios in the measurement of investment concentration an investment in a fidelity central fund by the contrafund portfolio looks through to the holdings of the central fund whereas an investment in a fidelity central fund by the dynamic capital appreciation portfolio does not look through  of the nine nonfundamental investment policies and limitations set forth in the portfolios sai one differs between these two portfolios  the contrafund portfolio does not currently intend to invest in oil gas or other mineral exploration or development programs or leases whereas the dynamic capital appreciation portfolio does not include this nonfundamental limitation  these portfolios share a great deal of commonality including virtually all of their investment strategies policies and limitations  further each fund uses the sp  as its benchmark   replacements   and   the only differences in investment strategy between the fidelity vip growth  income portfolio and the fidelity vip balanced portfolio include a permitted investment of  of the balanced funds assets in bonds and other debt instruments when the outlook is neutral with a minimum investment of  in bonds at any time  the growth and income portfolio has no minimum investment in bonds though it is permitted to invest in bonds  the balanced portfolios prospectus states that it may also engage in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the fund including investment in derivatives and that it uses fidelity central funds to help invest the portfolios assets  the growth and income portfolio manager is not prohibited from this strategy  the growth and income strategies also    fidelity central funds are special types of investment vehicles created by fidelity for use by the fidelity funds and other advisory clients  fidelity management and research company fund manager uses central funds to invest in particular security types or investment disciplines or for cash management central funds incur certain costs related to their investment activity such as custodial fees and expenses but do not pay additional management fees to fidelity the investment results of the portions of the funds assets invested in the central funds will be based upon the investment results of those funds      include buying and selling futures contracts and exchange traded funds to increase or decrease the funds exposure to changing security prices the balanced portfolio is not prohibited from this strategy  of the nine fundamental investment policies and limitations set forth in the portfolios sai one differs between these two portfolios the balanced portfolio may invest all of its assets in the securities of a single openend management investment company with substantially the same fundamental investment objective policies and limitations  this investment policy does not apply to the growth and income portfolio  applicants note however that in the nonfundamental investment policies and limitations set forth in the portfolios sai it is indicated that the balanced portfolio does not currently intend to invest all of its assets in the securities of a single openend management investment company with substantially the same fundamental investment objective policies and limitations  these portfolios share a great deal of commonality including the fact that each portfolio uses the sp  as its benchmark   replacements   and   the only difference in investment strategy between the fidelity vip growth opportunities portfolio and the fidelity vip contrafund portfolio is the growth opportunities portfolios strategy of investing in companies the manager believes have aboveaverage growth potential  the contrafund prospectus indicates that the manager may invest in growth or value stocks  all other investment strategies outlined in the growth opportunities prospectus also appear in the contrafund prospectus except for a statement that although the fund focuses on securities of largersized companies it may make a substantial investment in medium and smaller companies  the contrafund prospectus describes additional strategies used by the funds manager including its strategy of selecting securities of companies whose value it believes is not fully recognized by the public and its allocation of assets across market sectors  nothing stated in either funds prospectus or sai prohibits the fund from using the strategies disclosed in the corresponding funds prospectus  of the nine fundamental investment policies      and limitations set forth in the portfolios sai two differ slightly between these two portfolios  in the measurement of investment concentration an investment in a fidelity central fund by contrafund looks through to the holdings of the central fund whereas an investment in a fidelity central fund by the growth opportunities portfolio does not look through and   the growth opportunities portfolio may invest all of its assets in the securities of a single openend management investment company with substantially the same fundamental investment objective policies and limitations this investment policy does not apply to contrafund  applicant note however that in the nonfundamental investment limitations set forth in the portfolios sai it is indicated that the growth opportunities portfolio does not currently intend to invest all of its assets in the securities of a single openend management investment company with substantially the same fundamental investment objective policies and limitations  these portfolios share a great deal of commonality including most of their investment strategies policies and limitations   replacement   the only differences in investment strategy between the fidelity vip value strategies portfolio and the fidelity vip mid cap portfolio are  the value strategies portfolio focuses on investing in companies the manager believes are undervalued whereas the mid cap prospectus indicates that the manager may invest in growth or value stocks and  although the managers of both funds focus on investing in securities issued by medium sized companies the mid cap prospectus indicates that the fund normally invests  of the funds assets in securities of medium sized companies generally defined as similar to the market capitalization of companies in the russell midcap index or the sp midcap  whereas the value strategies prospectus does not mandate a percentage normally invested in mediumsized companies  notably though approximately  of assets of the value strategies fund were invested in mid cap companies as of september   as measured by the russell midcap index  of the nine fundamental investment policies and limitations set forth in the portfolios      sai only three differ slightly between these two portfolios  the value strategies portfolio may not issue senior securities except in connection with an exemptive order  or as permitted under the  act whereas the mid cap portfolio may only issue senior securities as permitted under the  act  in the measurement of investment concentration an investment in a fidelity central fund by value strategies looks through to the holdings of the central fund whereas an investment in a fidelity central fund by the mid cap portfolio does not look through and  the mid cap portfolio may invest all of its assets in the securities of a single openend management investment company managed by fidelity management and research company fmr with substantially the same fundamental investment objective policies and limitations  this investment policy does not apply to the value strategies portfolio  applicants note however that in the nonfundamental investment policies and limitations set forth in the portfolios sai it is indicated that the mid cap portfolio does not intend to invest all of its assets in the securities of a single openend management investment company managed by fmr with substantially the same fundamental investment objective policies and limitations   applicants submit that the foregoing demonstrates that no material difference exists between each existing portfolio and the corresponding replacement portfolio and that the contract owners have a reasonable continuity in their investment expectation   the assets in each of the existing portfolios and the corresponding replacement portfolios for all classes as of october   are as follows   replacement   fidelity vip dynamic capital appreciation portfolio with assets of  will be replaced by fidelity vip contrafund portfolio with assets of       replacements   and   fidelity vip growth  income portfolio with assets of  will be replaced by fidelity vip balanced portfolio with assets of    replacements   and   fidelity vip growth opportunities portfolio with assets of  will be replaced by fidelity vip contrafund portfolio with assets of    replacement  fidelity vip value strategies portfolio with assets of  will be replaced with fidelity vip mid cap portfolio with assets of    each of the existing and replacement portfolios hold sufficient assets such that the substitution will be immaterial to portfolio management   iv                                 reasons for the substitution   a                                     efficiency   the proposed substitution will strengthen and streamline the fidelity fund offerings within the contracts fund lineup  the applicants expect the proposed substitution to provide benefits to the contract owners including better performing funds and simplification of fund offerings through the elimination of overlapping and duplicative portfolios in certain asset categories particularly the large growth category  fidelity has been consulted and has raised no objection to the substitution   the proposed substitution involves substituting a replacement portfolio for an existing portfolio with very similar and in most cases substantially similar investment objectives strategies policies and limitations  after the substitution contract owners will continue to be able to select among funds with a full range of investment objectives investment strategies and risks  of the  contracts affected by the substitution contract owners in subset   contracts will be able to select among  portfolios contract owners in subset  four      contracts will be able to select among  portfolios and contract owners in subset  two contracts will be able to select among  portfolios   following is chart a which contains the portfolios offered in the contracts by morningstar asset category comparing before and after the proposed substitution  the portfolios not available in the contracts in subset  are indicated by one asterisk and portfolios not available in the contracts in subset  are indicated by two asterisks  chart a depicts the consolidation of the large growth category and illustrates that after the proposed substitution all contract owners will continue to have three choices from two different fund companies in the large growth category  applicants have selected what they believe are superior large growth funds and winnowed the lesser offerings to provide a more streamlined selection of lower cost funds with better historical performance  chart a similarly illustrates that after the substitution all contract owners will continue to have three choices from two different fund companies in the mid blend category   with regard to the proposed replacement of fidelity vip value strategies a mid blend fund with fidelity vip mid cap a mid growth fund the applicants believe contract owners will experience a positive result and have reasonable continuity in investment expectations  both funds are primarily invested in medium capitalization companies the mid cap fund manager has greater flexibility in selecting the better opportunities among available growth and value stocks  further the mid cap portfolio has a better performance record average annual return of  over the life of the fund  years compared to  for the value strategies portfolio over the life of the fund  years and lower expenses      chart a  portfolios by morningstar asset category       before substitution

as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce the portfolios custodian expenses  including these reductions the total class operating expenses for the portfolio would have been as set forth in the net expense column in the above table  these offsets may be discontinued at any time      replacement portfolios in each class  in each of the existing and replacement portfolio

or such lesser amount as the trustees may determine from time to time  service class currently pays fdc a b service fee at an annual rate of  of its average net assets throughout the month  service

service class  currently pays fdc a b service fee at an annual rate of  of its average net assets throughout the month   there is no difference in the current or maximum service fees between each existing portfolio and each corresponding replacement portfolio   with regard to management fees the portfolios sai indicates that for the services of fmr each fund pays fmr a monthly management fee that has two components a group fee rate and an individual fund fee rate  the group fee rate is based on the monthly average net assets of all the registered investment companies with which fmr has management contracts  therefore the breakpoints are calculated on the total assets under fmr management not on a per fund basis  the second component is the individual fund fee rate which for each existing portfolio except one is the same as the rate for the replacement portfolio   in the one instance the rate paid on the fidelity vip balanced portfolio replacement portfolio is  which is lower than is paid on the fidelity vip growth and income portfolio existing portfolio of     fdc is fidelity distributors corporation distributor of the fidelity portfolios      c            performance

portfolios relative net asset values determined on the date of the substitution in accordance with section  of the act and rule c thereunder with no change in the amount of any contract owners cash value death benefit living benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the subaccounts  accordingly there will be      no financial impact on any contract owner  the substitution will be effected by having each of the subaccounts that invests in the existing portfolios redeem its shares at the net asset value calculated on the date of the substitution and purchase shares of the respective replacement portfolios at the net asset value calculated on the same date   the substitution will be described in detail in a written notice mailed to contract owners  the notice will inform contract owners of the integrity companies intent to implement the substitution and describe the substitution the reasons for engaging in the substitution and how the substitution will be implemented  details regarding the effect on any investment in a glwb will also be provided  the notice will be mailed to all contract owners at least  days prior to the substitution and will inform affected contract owners that they may transfer assets from the subaccounts investing in the existing portfolios at anytime after receipt of the notice and from the subaccounts investing in the replacement portfolios for  days after the substitution to subaccounts investing in other portfolios available under the respective contracts without the imposition of any transfer charge or limitation and without diminishing the number of free transfers that may be made in a given contract year  a supplement will be filed with the commission for all current prospectuses containing the information to be included in the notice   each contract owner will be provided with a prospectus for the replacement portfolios applicable to them  within five days after the substitution the integrity companies will send each affected contract owner written confirmation that the substitution has occurred   the integrity companies will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the substitution including all legal accounting and allocated brokerage expenses relating to the substitution  no costs will be borne by contract owners  affected contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the substitution nor will their rights or the obligations of the integrity companies under the contracts be altered in any way  the substitution will not cause the fees      and charges under the contracts currently being paid by contract owners to be greater after the substitution than before the substitution  the substitution will have no adverse tax consequences to contract owners and will in no way alter the tax benefits to contract owners   vi                                                                                 applicable law   a                                     requirements of section c   section c of the act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the commission approves the substitution  the commission will approve such a substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act   section c of the act was enacted as part of the investment company act amendments of   amendments  prior to the enactment of the  amendments section ab of the act only required that the trust instrument of a unit investment trust provide that the sponsor or trustee notify the trusts shareholders within five days after a substitution of the underlying securities  the legislative history of section c describes the underlying purpose of the amendment to the section   the proposed amendment recognizes that in the case of a unit investment trust holding the securities of a single issuer notification to shareholders does not provide adequate protection since the only relief available to the shareholders if dissatisfied would be to redeem their shares  a shareholder who redeems and reinvests the proceeds in another unit investment trust or in an openend company would under most circumstances be subject to a new sales load  the proposed amendment     the commission has interpreted section c of the act to apply to a substitution of securities in any subaccount of a registered separate account  investment company act rel no  sept   adopting rule c  the proscription of section c is addressed to the depositors integrity and national integrity and not the unit investment trusts the separate accounts for which the depositors serve  nevertheless the commission generally grants orders under section c in the name of the depositor and unit investment trust  see eg keystone provident life insurance company investment company act rel nos  nov   notice and  dec   order  in accordance with this precedent applicants here include the separate accounts      would close this gap in shareholder protection by providing for commission approval of the substitution  the commission would be required to issue an order approving the substitution if it finds the substitution consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act   the legislative history makes clear that the purpose of section c is to protect the expectation of investors in a unit investment trust that the unit investment trust will accumulate shares of a particular issuer by preventing unscrutinized substitutions that might in effect force shareholders dissatisfied with the substituted security to redeem their shares thereby possibly incurring either a loss of the sales load deducted from initial premium payments an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the redemption proceeds or both  moreover in the insurance product context a contract owner forced to redeem may suffer adverse tax consequences  section c affords this protection to investors by preventing a depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust that holds shares of one issuer from substituting for those shares the shares of another issuer unless the commission approves that substitution   b                                     basis for requested order of approval   each contract and its prospectus expressly disclose the reservation of the applicants right subject to applicable law to substitute shares of another portfolio for shares of the portfolio in which a subaccount is invested   substitutions have been common where the substituted portfolio has investment objectives and policies that are similar to those of the eliminated portfolio current expenses that     senate committee report no   p  house committee report no   p    house comm on interstate and foreign commerce report of the securities and exchange commission on the public policy implications of investment company growth hr rep no  th cong d sess        are similar to those of the eliminated portfolio and performance that is similar to or better than that of the eliminated portfolio   the investment objectives and policies of the replacement portfolios are similar to those of the corresponding existing portfolios such that contract owners will have reasonable continuity in investment expectations  accordingly the replacement portfolios are appropriate investment vehicles for those contract owners who have contract values allocated to the existing portfolios  further the replacement portfolios have lower expenses and significantly superior performance to that of the existing portfolios   in connection with assets held under contracts affected by the substitution the integrity companies will not receive for three years from the date of the substitution any direct or indirect benefits from the replacement portfolios their advisors or underwriters or their affiliates at a rate higher than that which they had received from the existing portfolios their advisors or underwriters or their affiliates including without limitation b fees shareholder service administration or other service fees revenue sharing or other arrangements in connection with such assets  indeed it is worth noting that under the proposed substitution each portfolio will be replaced by a portfolio within the same unaffiliated fund family fidelity and so there is no incentive or reason to contemplate such benefits applicants represent that the substitution and the selection of the replacement portfolios were not motivated by any

their advisors or underwriters or their respective affiliates   the substitution will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that section c was intended to guard against because the contract owner will continue to have the same type of investment choices with better potential returns and the same or lower expenses and will not otherwise have any incentive to redeem their shares or terminate their contracts   the purposes terms and conditions of the proposed substitution are consistent with the protection of investors and the principles and purposes of section c and do not entail any of the abuses that section c is designed to prevent                                      each replacement portfolio has significantly superior performance to that of the corresponding existing portfolio                                      current gross and net annual expenses in each replacement portfolio are lower than those of the corresponding existing portfolios                                      each replacement portfolio is an appropriate portfolio to move contract owners values currently allocated to the existing portfolios because the portfolios have similar investment objectives strategies and risks                                      all costs of the substitution including any allocated brokerage costs will be borne by the integrity companies and will not be borne by contract owners  no charges will be assessed to effect the substitution                                      the substitution will be at the net asset values of the respective portfolio shares without the imposition of any transfer or similar charge and with no change in the amount of any contract owners values                                      the substitution will not cause the fees and charges under the contracts currently being paid by contract owners to be greater after the substitution than      before the substitution and will result in contract owners contract values being moved to portfolios with the lower current total net annual expenses                                      notice of the proposed substitution will be mailed to all contract owners at least  days prior to the substitution  all contract owners will have an opportunity at anytime after receipt of the notice of the substitution and for  days after the substitution to transfer contract account value affected by the substitution to other available subaccounts without the imposition of any transfer charge or limitation and without being counted as one of the contract owners free transfers in a contract year                                      within five days after the substitution the integrity companies will send to its affected contract owners a written confirmation that the substitution has occurred                                      the substitution will in no way alter the insurance benefits to contract owners or the contractual obligations of the integrity companies                                the substitution will have no adverse tax consequences to contract owners and will in no way alter the tax benefits to contract owners   vii                             request for order   applicants request an order of the commission pursuant to section c of the act approving the substitution  section c in pertinent part provides that the commission shall issue an order approving a substitution of securities if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy

guaranteed annuitization that can provide income for life and offers an optional living benefit that can provide income for life   parties to the contract   ·                  integrity life insurance company  “we” “our” “us” “the company” and “integrity” mean integrity life insurance company ·                  owner  “you” and “your” mean the owner  this variable annuity contract is a contract between you and us  you as the owner have certain rights under the contract  because this contract is an ira joint owners are not allowed and you may not transfer ownership ·

contract allows you to accumulate money for retirement or other longterm goals  this contract is intended for longterm investing only and is not intended as a vehicle for frequent trading  transfers among subaccounts are strictly limited under the terms of this contract  see part  section titled “allocations and transfers”   an investment in any of the subaccounts carries with it certain risks including the risk that the value of your investment will decline and you could lose money  the subaccounts invest in etfs except the vanguard variable insurance fund money market portfolio many of which invest in common stocks  you could lose money if one of the issuers of the stocks becomes financially impaired or if the market as a whole declines  there is also the inherent risk that holders of common stock generally are behind creditors and holders of preferred stock for payments in the event of the bankruptcy of a stock issuer  some of the subaccounts invest in funds that invest in high yield securities that are rated below investment grade commonly referred to as “junk bonds”  high yield securities may be subject to greater levels of credit or default risk than higherrated securities  some of the subaccounts also invest in securities issued by companies in foreign countries which means that world events such as political upheaval financial troubles or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of these securities  foreign investments are also subject to currency risk which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment measured in us dollars will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates   shares of etfs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market  this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of the etf shares may decrease  the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors   the services of mid atlantic trust company matc and thirdparty brokerdealers underlie the process supporting this variable annuity and the subaccounts’ investments  if either matc or the thirdparty brokerdealers terminate or significantly modify the services provided to us we will seek to replace those services through other providers or through other methods  if suitable replacement services are not available we will take such other actions or make changes in how we operate as allowed by law and your annuity contract to mitigate any adverse effects on the separate accounts you and us to the greatest extent reasonably possible  these actions could include working directly with brokerdealers to purchase etfs bringing inhouse the services being provided by matc andor making available index mutual funds as underlying investment options  while we believe it is highly unlikely it is possible that under a worstcase scenario we would be required to disallow additional premiums into the contract and that transfers could only be made into the money market subaccount although your thencurrent allocations would not be affected  see more about mid atlantic trust company in part  section titled “etf custodian”   for a complete discussion of the risks associated with investing in any particular subaccount see the prospectus of the corresponding fund   account value and surrender value

above the minimum if you wish to keep your contract in force  the minimum account value does not apply if you have a glwb rider   if you take withdrawals other than the free withdrawal amount or rmd this contract also requires that you have a minimum account value of  remaining after the withdrawal  please note that you may fully surrender your contract at any time  this rule does not apply if you have a glwb rider  see part  section titled “withdrawals”   your right to revoke free look period   you may cancel your contract within  days after you receive it by returning it to our administrative office by mail postmarked within the day period  we will extend the day period if required by state law  if you cancel your contract we will return your account value which may be more

models in connection with your variable annuity at no extra charge and may do so in the future  asset allocation is the process of investing in different asset classes — such as equity funds fixed income funds and alternative funds — depending on your personal investment goals tolerance for risk and investment time horizon  by spreading your money among a variety of asset classes you may be able to reduce the risk and volatility of investing although there are no guarantees   we have no discretionary authority or control over your choice of subaccounts or your other investment decisions  we may make available educational information and materials such as a risk tolerance questionnaire that may help you select an asset allocation model but we do not recommend asset allocation models or otherwise provide advice about whether an asset allocation model may be appropriate for you   our asset allocation models are “static”  although we may change or terminate asset allocation models we are offering to new contract purchasers we will not change your allocations unless you advise us to do so  you will not be notified if the models are terminated or changed  you will not be provided with information regarding any terminations or changes to the asset allocation models  if you elect to invest using an asset allocation model and if you elect automatic rebalancing we will continue to rebalance your percentage allocations among the funds in your existing model   you should consult your investment professional periodically to consider whether any model you have selected is still appropriate for you  you may choose to invest in an asset allocation model or change your asset allocation at any time subject to the limitations stated in your contract and this prospectus  see part  section titled “allocations and transfers”   asset allocation does not ensure a profit guarantee that your account value will increase or protect against a decline if market prices fall  an asset allocation model may not perform as intended  any asset allocation models offered are based on thenavailable funds in this annuity  we may discontinue add eliminate or change the models at any time   the fixed account   our fixed account is offered through our general account which also supports any portion of the death benefit the annuity benefit and any guarantees under a rider that are in

provisions of the federal securities laws relating to the accuracy and completeness of statements made in prospectuses   vi     systematic transfer option sto   we offer a sto a fixed account that provides a fixed interest rate on each premium allocated to the sto  that interest rate is guaranteed for that premium while in the sto period selected  available sto periods are six months or one year  all sto premiums will be automatically transferred into the subaccounts within either six months or one year of your premium payment into the sto depending on which sto period you select  you can invest in either the sixmonth or oneyear sto at any one time but not both  we require a minimum premium to the sto of  to fund the sixmonth sto or  to fund the oneyear sto  we will automatically transfer equal amounts monthly for the sixmonth sto and either monthly or quarterly for the oneyear sto  once you have invested premium in a sto it cannot be transferred from the sto except as the automatic transfers described above   the sto is available for new premiums only  you cannot transfer from the subaccounts into the sto  see “systematic transfer program” in part  for more details on this program  if you elect a glwb rider the sto is only available for your initial premium received by us on or before the contract date   part  — deductions and charges   separate account charges   we deduct a daily charge equal to an annual effective rate of  of your account value in each of the subaccounts to cover our separate account charges which include   ·                  mortality and expense risk charge of  ·                  administration charge of  and ·                  distribution charge of    the mortality and expense risk charge pays us for assuming the mortality risk and the expense risk under the contract  the mortality risk as used here refers to our risk that death benefits are greater than anticipated or that annuitants as a class of persons will live longer than estimated and we will be required to pay out more annuity benefits than anticipated  the expense risk is our risk that the expenses of administering the contract will exceed the reimbursement for administrative expenses   the administration charge is used to reimburse us for administrative expenses including but not limited to processing applications issuing contracts processing customer orders and other requests making investments providing regular reports and confirmations to customers providing reports and updates to regulators maintaining accounting records for each contract owner administering income payments furnishing accounting and valuation services including the calculation and monitoring of the daily unit values reconciling and depositing cash receipts and providing forms   the administration charge also reimburses us for the cost and commissions associated with investing in the underlying etfs including brokerage commissions  the brokerage commissions associated with the etf trades will be paid directly by matc to the executing broker and indirectly by us under an arrangement with matc  see part  section titled “etf custodian”  this arrangement is a proprietary fee arrangement based on a percentage of assets invested in the etfs  ultimately this cost is passed along to you as part of this administrative expense   the distribution charge reimburses us for the costs of distribution of this variable annuity including commissions paid to our distributors   we expect to make a profit from the separate account charges   fund expenses   the net asset value of the fund shares reflects investment management fees and other expenses that have already been deducted from the assets of the funds  please refer to part  section titled “total   vi   annual fund operating expenses” and the individual fund’s prospectus for details on fund expenses   withdrawal charge   if you withdraw your premiums you may be charged a withdrawal charge of up to  of the premium  the amount of the withdrawal charge is a percentage of each premium withdrawn and not of the account value  the charge varies depending upon the “age” of the premiums included in the withdrawal  the “age” of a premium is the number of years that have passed since each premium was paid   premium year   charge as a percentage of the premium withdrawn                            thereafter        when you take a withdrawal the oldest premium is treated as the first withdrawn then next oldest and so on  any gain or earnings in your contract come out only after an amount equal to all your premiums and any applicable charges on those premiums is withdrawn  please note however that for tax purposes withdrawals are generally considered to be gain first  see part    because the withdrawal charge applies to each premium if your account value has declined due to poor performance of your selected subaccounts or you have taken previous withdrawals including the free withdrawal amount the withdrawal charge may be greater than the amount available for withdrawal  in some instances your account value may be positive but you will not have money available to withdraw due to the amount of the withdrawal charge still applicable to your premiums  a withdrawal charge applies to the withdrawal charge amount itself since this amount is part of the premium withdrawn   you may take your free withdrawal amount each contract year without paying a withdrawal charge  more details on the free withdrawal amount are in part  in the section titled “free withdrawal amount”   we will not deduct a withdrawal charge from   ·                  the death benefit or ·                  a withdrawal used to buy an immediate annuity from us after the first contract anniversary with either i life contingencies or ii a period certain that provides for fixed payments over  or more years   if you take withdrawals other than the free withdrawal amount or rmd this contract also requires that you have a minimum account value of  remaining after the withdrawal  please note that you may fully surrender your contract at any time  this rule does not apply if you have a glwb rider  see part  section titled “withdrawals”   for more information and examples of application of the withdrawal charge see appendix b   reduction or elimination of the withdrawal charge   we can reduce or eliminate the withdrawal charge for individuals or a group of individuals if we anticipate expense savings  we may do this based on the size and type of the group the amount of the premium or whether there is some relationship with us  examples of these relationships would include being an employee of integrity or an affiliate receiving distributions or making internal transfers from other contracts we issued or transferring amounts held under qualified plans that we or our affiliates sponsored  we will not unlawfully discriminate against any person or group if we reduce or eliminate the withdrawal charge   vi   commission allowance and additional payments to distributors   we generally pay a commission to the sales representative up to a maximum of  of premiums and up to a  trail commission paid on account value starting in the second contract year  commissions may vary due to differences between states sales channels sales firms and special sales initiatives   a brokerdealer or financial institution that distributes our variable annuity contracts may receive additional compensation from us for training marketing or other services provided  these services may include special access to sales staff and advantageous placement of our products  we do not make an independent assessment of the cost to the brokerdealer or financial institution of providing such services

firms are bbt investment services inc comerica securities inc cuso financial services lp fifth third securities inc frost brokerage services inc hancock investment services inc lpl financial corporation and mt securities inc   depending on the arrangements in place at any particular time a brokerdealer and the registered representatives associated with it may have a financial incentive to recommend a particular variable annuity contract  this could create a conflict of interest between the brokerdealer or the registered representative and the customer  these payments could provide incentive to a brokerdealer or registered representative to recommend a contract that is not in your best interest  you can find more about compensation in the sai   optional benefit charges   you may purchase one of the glwb riders offered with this contract which provide optional benefits for an additional cost  the additional cost of the riders along with complete details about their benefits is provided in part    tax reserve   in the future we may charge for taxes or set aside reserves for taxes which will reduce the investment performance of the subaccounts   state premium tax   we will

rules and limitations the tax code permits you to transfer or roll over money taxfree from one ira to another ira or from certain other qualified plans such as a k plan to an ira  see part    if you are transferring money from another annuity contract that is an ira to acquire this contract you should carefully compare this contract to your current contract  you may have to pay a withdrawal charge under your current contract to transfer to this contract and this contract has its own withdrawal charges that would apply to you  the other fees and charges under this contract may be higher or lower and the benefits may be different than those of your current contract  in addition you may have to pay federal income and penalty taxes on the transfer if it does not qualify for taxfree transfer or rollover treatment  you should not transfer from another annuity contract unless you determine that the transfer is right for you  please note that the person who sells you this contract generally will earn a commission on the sale  you should also consult a tax advisor before requesting a taxfree transfer or rollover   premium payments   minimum initial premium        minimum additional premium          maximum total premium without prior approval    maximum additional premium   up to applicable ira limits each calendar year plus permissible transfers and rollovers   because the initial premium must be  or more the contract can only be purchased by transfer or rollover from an existing ira or from certain other qualified plans such as a k or a b plan  you can make additional premium payments at any time before age  or earlier if limited by the tax code  for example you cannot contribute new premiums other than transfers and rollovers to a traditional ira for the calendar year in which you reach age ½ and thereafter   you must determine whether any premium qualifies as a permissible contribution subject to favorable tax treatment under the tax code  you must also determine whether such amount qualifies as a permissible transfer or rollover contribution under the tax code for example you cannot roll over from a simple ira during the first two years of participation in the simple ira and you cannot roll over aftertax contributions that are included in the other plans  you cannot roll over distributions that are part of a series of substantially equal payments made over your life expectancy distributions made for a specified period of  years or more rmd distributions or hardship distribution  for more information about limitations see part  section titled “rollovers and transfers”   if you transfer or roll over money into this contract in the calendar year on or after you reach age ½ you must take your rmd for the current calendar year before you purchase this contract   we may refuse additional premiums if  you have allocated some or all of the premium to an investment option to which we are no longer accepting additional premiums  the additional premium does not meet our minimum additional premium amount or exceeds our maximum premium amount for the annuity contract or for a specific investment option  the total premiums paid under all annuity contracts issued by us or our affiliates on your life exceed   we believe that the additional premium is being made by or on behalf of an institutional investor or  for any reason allowed by law  you cannot purchase this contract with a rollover or transfer of death benefits from another annuity   your premiums are invested in the investment options you select  each premium is credited as of the date we receive the premium in good order at our administrative office except that additional time is allowed for the application of the initial premium under rule c of the  act  good order means complete information we require to process your application or any request     the minimum initial premium is  if the annuity is purchased in certain distribution outlets currently at distribution outlets affiliated with us bancorp   vi   initial premium allocated to the subaccounts will be priced at the unit value determined no later than two business days after receipt of a completed application including all necessary related information  if the application is not complete we may retain the initial premium for up to five business days while attempting to complete it  if the application is not completed within five business days you will be informed of the reason for the delay  the initial premium will be returned unless you specifically allow us to hold the premium until the application is completed   once received in good order premiums allocated to subaccounts are used to purchase units at the unit value as of the next close of the new york stock exchange   each additional premium will be credited to your subaccount under your stated allocation as of the date we have received the premium in good order at our administrative office  if you submit a different allocation a day waiting period will start before you can make a subsequent transfer or allocation change  see part  section titled “allocations and transfers”   all premiums are deemed received when they are received in good order at our administrative office   units in our separate account   your investment in the subaccounts is used to purchase units  on any given day the value you have in a subaccount is the number of units you own in that subaccount multiplied by the unit value  the units of each subaccount have a different unit value   units are purchased when you contribute new premium to your contract or transfer amounts to a subaccount  units are redeemed sold when you make withdrawals or transfer amounts out of a subaccount into a different subaccount  we also redeem units to pay the death benefit or if you elect an annuity option or as permitted or required by law  the number of units purchased or redeemed in any subaccount is calculated by dividing the dollar amount of the transaction by the next computed unit value for that subaccount calculated as of the next close of business of the new york stock exchange   each unit represents a fractional undivided interest in the assets held in the related subaccount  if units of any subaccount are redeemed the fractional undivided interest represented by each remaining unit will be increased  if additional units are issued by any subaccount the fractional undivided interest represented by each remaining unit will be decreased  units will remain outstanding until redeemed by a contract owner   if we make a mistake in executing any purchase or redemption we will reprocess any trades made in error and ensure that you receive the correct unit values  we will put you in the same position you otherwise would have been in  depending on the change in unit values between the error and correction we may experience a gain or loss as a result of the reprocessing   the unit value of each subaccount will fluctuate with the investment performance of the corresponding fund which reflects the investment income realized and unrealized capital gains and losses of the fund and the fund’s expenses   how we determine unit value   we determine the unit value for each subaccount after the close of business of the new york stock exchange which is normally  pm eastern time on each business day  to value your subaccount units invested in etfs we use the daily closing price of each etf on its primary exchange  note that the etf shares may trade at a discount from the net asset value of the etf  to value your subaccount units invested in the vanguard variable insurance fund money market portfolio we use the daily net asset value provided by vanguard for the money market portfolio  in addition to the fund shares the subaccounts that invest in the etfs also hold an accrual for any dividends or other distributions declared by the etf which will be reinvested in the etf on the next business day after payment   vi   the unit value of each subaccount for any business day is equal to the unit value for the previous business day multiplied by the net investment factor for that subaccount on the current business day  the net investment factor measures the investment performance of a subaccount from one business day to the next   we determine the net investment factor by dividing the net asset value of the subaccount for that valuation period by the net asset value of the subaccount for the preceding valuation period  we subtract from that result the daily equivalent of the annual separate account charges for each calendar day since the last day that a unit value was determined for example a monday calculation will include charges for saturday and sunday   generally this means that we adjust unit values to reflect the change in value of the fund shares for the separate account charges and if elected the glwb rider charge   allocations and transfers   only one investment allocation to the subaccounts may be in place at any time on your contract  this allocation applies to your current investment future premiums and rebalancing  in addition to your one allocation to the subaccounts you may allocate some or all of your initial premium and additional new premium to the sto  transfers from the sto to the subaccounts must be according to your one investment allocation to the subaccounts   you may reallocate all or part of your account value among the subaccounts however each reallocation triggers a day waiting period before you can make another allocation change  a transfer between or among subaccounts is an “allocation change”  here are the details   ·                  a day waiting period applies after your initial allocation on the contract date  this means you must wait  days after the contract is issued before you make an allocation change ·                  a day waiting period applies after any voluntary allocation change  this means you must wait  days after the date you make an allocation change before you make another allocation change ·                  the following allocation changes will not trigger the day waiting period   ·                  automatic rebalancing ·                  automatic transfers from the sto ·                  reallocation as a result of any material change in a fund or a subaccount see part  section titled “changes in how we operate” ·                  automatic transfers that take place upon cancellation of a glwb rider unless you make additional voluntary allocation changes in connection with the glwb rider cancellation   allocations and transfers are restricted further if you have a glwb rider  see part    to request a reallocation you may write to our administrative office at the address in the glossary  mail sent to any other address may not be in good order  you may also contact your sales representative to request a reallocation  each request for a reallocation or transfer must specify   ·              the contract number and ·              the subaccounts and allocation percentages stated in whole percentages   if one portion of a reallocation request involving multiple subaccounts violates our policies or is not in good order the entire request will not be processed  you will need to resubmit a request that is in good order for your reallocation to be processed   you may also request a reallocation through our telephone transfer service using your personal identifiers  we will honor telephone instructions from any person who provides correct identifying information  we are not responsible for fraudulent telephone requests we believe to be genuine according to these procedures  accordingly you bear the risk of loss if unauthorized persons make   vi   reallocations on your behalf  telephone reallocations may be requested from  am to  pm eastern time on any day we are open for business   if we receive your request in good order at our administrative office before  pm eastern time or the close of the new york stock exchange if earlier on a business day you will receive the unit values for the subaccounts as of the close of business on the day you call   requests received at our administrative office at or after  pm eastern time or the close of the new york stock exchange if earlier on a business day or received on a day other than a business day will be processed using unit values as of the close of business on the next business day  we will confirm all reallocations in writing   detrimental effect of trading on unit values   this contract is intended for longterm investing only and is not intended as a vehicle for frequent trading  reallocations transfers among subaccounts are strictly limited under the terms of this contract  see part  section titled “allocations and transfers”  we may refuse any reallocation request for an owner or certain owners if we believe in our sole discretion that a specific request or group of requests may have a detrimental effect on unit values  we will notify you or your designated representative if your requested reallocation is not made   specific notice regarding the use of this annuity for market timing or frequent trading   this contract is not designed to serve as a vehicle for trading in response to shortterm fluctuations in the market  you cannot engage in intraday trading of the etfs available through the subaccounts  any person that intends to engage in stale price arbitrage utilize market timing practices or make frequent transfers for any reason should not purchase this contract   if we determine in our sole discretion that a contract owner is attempting to engage in improper trading we may revoke their sameday

this rule does not apply to a withdrawal of your free withdrawal amount your rmd or if you have a glwb rider   unless you request a withdrawal from a specific investment option we will take the withdrawal from your investment options pro rata in the same proportion their value bears to your total account value  for example if your account value is divided in equal  portions among four subaccounts when you make a withdrawal  of the account value will come from each of your four subaccounts   withdrawals are processed when a request is received in good order at our administrative office  when you take a withdrawal from a subaccount units are redeemed at the unit value as of the next close of the new york stock exchange   the total amount deducted from your account value will be the withdrawal amount requested plus any withdrawal charge that applies see part  section titled “withdrawal charge”  the amount you receive will be the amount you requested less any applicable tax withholding  withdrawals are handled differently if you elect a glwb rider  see part    vi   withdrawals are attributed to your account value in the following order   any remaining free withdrawal amount  premiums that are no longer subject to a withdrawal charge and have not yet been withdrawn  premiums subject to a withdrawal charge and  any gain interest or other amount that is not considered a premium  your investment comes out first beginning with the oldest premium first then next oldest and so on  any gain or earnings in your contract come out only after an amount equal to

the withdrawal minus any partial withdrawals taken during the current contract year or ·                   of your account value at your most recent contract anniversary minus any partial withdrawals taken during the current contract year  during your first contract year this amount is  of your initial premium received on the contract date   if your rmd based on the fair market value of this contract only as calculated by us is greater than your free withdrawal amount we will allow you to take the rmd as your free withdrawal amount but only once each contract year  because your rmd is based on a calendar year you should plan in advance to coordinate your rmd with your available free withdrawal amount   if you do not take the free withdrawal amount in any one contract year you cannot add it or any unused portion of it to the next year’s free withdrawal amount   the free withdrawal amount does not apply to a full surrender  taking your free withdrawal amount will not reduce the total withdrawal charge applicable to your premium  if you take a subsequent withdrawal for more than the free withdrawal amount or if you surrender the contract we will assess any applicable withdrawal charge on the amount of your premiums withdrawn which are not reduced for any free withdrawal amount you have taken   the free withdrawal amount is available for withdrawal only  the free withdrawal amount is not available for transfer to another ira or other qualified contract or account   timing of payment of a withdrawal or surrender   we normally send you partial or full withdrawals or apply your account value to the purchase of an annuity option within seven days after receipt of the required form at our administrative office  however we can defer our action for any period during which            the new york stock exchange has been closed other than a weekend or holiday or trading on it is restricted            an emergency exists as determined by the sec so that disposal of securities is not reasonably practicable or it is not reasonably practicable for the separate account fairly to determine the value   vi   of its net assets or            the sec by order permits us to defer action in order to protect persons with interests in the separate account   assignments   this contract is an ira and you are not legally permitted to assign pledge or otherwise transfer the contract  pledging or assigning an ira can cause loss of qualified status and result in some or all of the account value being included in your income  a  federal tax penalty also may apply   death benefit   we will pay the death benefit to your properly designated beneficiary if you die before the annuity date   the death benefit amount will be the greater of                 the account value on the death benefit date and               your total premiums minus proportionate adjustments for partial withdrawals including any withdrawal charge  a proportional adjustment means that your death benefit will be reduced by the same percentage as your withdrawal bears to your account value at the time of withdrawal   example of the effect of withdrawals on the death benefit   ·                  if your death benefit is  and your current account value is  ·                  and you take a withdrawal of  ·                  we will reduce your death benefit by  because that is the same percentage that your withdrawal bears to the account value at the time of the withdrawal    ·                  therefore your death benefit is reduced by    because the account value at the time of the withdrawal in this example is less than the death benefit the death benefit is decreased by a larger dollar amount than the partial withdrawal amount   this example is for illustrative purposes only and does not predict results   your beneficiary generally has a choice of how to receive the death benefit                 the beneficiary may take a lump sum  if the beneficiary elects this option we will pay the death benefit to the beneficiary                 the beneficiary may defer for up to five years  if the beneficiary elects this option we will allow the beneficiary to keep the death benefit invested in the available subaccounts for a period of up to five years  separate account charges will continue to apply  at the end of five years the entire amount must be paid to the beneficiary                 the beneficiary may treat the contract as an inherited ira  if the beneficiary elects this option we will allow the beneficiary to keep the death benefit amount invested in the available subaccounts  separate account charges will continue to apply  the beneficiary must choose to receive the death benefit as either   a             an immediate annuity with a life contingency or b             substantially equal payments over his or her life expectancy as defined by the tax code  the beneficiary may choose the longer of his or her life expectancy or the deceased owner’s life expectancy both as defined by the tax code if the owner dies after the required beginning date  for roth iras the owner is presumed to have died before the required beginning date   vi   distributions must begin by december  of the calendar year after the owner’s death however if the beneficiary is your spouse and has elected this option distributions may begin at the end of the calendar year in which the owner would have reached age ½ if later  a spouse also may elect to continue the contract as described below in the section titled “spousal continuation”  if the beneficiary fails to make an election within a reasonable time we may automatically process the claim as if option two were elected   the following restrictions apply to the inherited ira contract i the inherited ira owner may not add premium to the contract ii the death benefit available to the beneficiary of the inherited ira owner is the account value on the death benefit date after the death of the inherited ira owner and iii the beneficiary of the inherited ira owner will be required to receive the remaining account value either in a lump sum over five years or over the life expectancy of the inherited ira owner as determined by the tax code   for more information on inherited iras see part  section titled “inherited iras” and irs publication   you should seek independent tax advice   if your beneficiary is not a human being the beneficiary must elect either a lump sum or deferral for up to five years  if the owner is a trust custodian or other entity the owner must name itself as the sole beneficiary   spousal continuation   if your sole primary beneficiary is your spouse the contract may be continued in your spouse’s name as the owner  if spousal continuation is elected we will increase the continued contract’s account value to the same amount that would have been paid to your surviving spouse had he or she taken the death benefit as a lump sum distribution  this increase will be added to the subaccounts you have selected on a pro rata basis  for example if the account value at death was  but we would have paid out a death benefit of  the surviving spouse’s contract will continue with  as the account value   all terms and conditions of the contract continue to apply including the withdrawal charge  when the surviving spouse dies the death benefit will be paid to the beneficiary named by the surviving spouse   a samesex surviving spouse is recognized as your spouse under the tax code and will qualify for the federal tax advantages of spousal continuation   the survivor of a civil union or domestic partnership is not recognized as your spouse under the tax code and the federal tax advantages of spousal continuation are not available  the survivor of a civil union or domestic partnership may elect to continue the contract under its terms  the continuation of the contract by such surviving civil union or domestic partner however is treated as an ordinary transfer of ownership and will be a taxable event   selecting and changing your beneficiary   you may name one or more beneficiaries as primary or contingent beneficiaries  the death benefit will be paid to your primary beneficiaries who are alive at the time of your death  if no primary beneficiary survives your death then the death benefit will be paid to your contingent beneficiaries if any  if no beneficiary survives your death primary or contingent or none has been named the death benefit will be paid to your estate   if multiple beneficiaries in either category primary or contingent are named the death benefit will be split into equal shares among the beneficiaries in that category who are alive at the time of your death unless you specify otherwise in your beneficiary designation   vi     if you die on or after the annuity date and before the entire interest in the contract has been distributed then the rest of the annuity must be distributed to the beneficiary at least as quickly as the method in effect when you died   you may change any beneficiary by sending the appropriate form in good order to the administrative office  we may limit the number of beneficiaries you can have at one time  please consult your financial professional and tax advisor to properly identify your beneficiaries so that the death benefit is paid as you intend  please be sure to name your spouse as your sole primary beneficiary so that spousal continuation of the contract can occur if that is your intention  you may wish to name a contingent beneficiary in case your spouse dies before you if the owner is a custodian the owner must name itself as the sole beneficiary   filing death claims   to file a death claim the beneficiary must promptly submit an original certified death certificate and company death claim paperwork that is in good order including the beneficiary’s election of how they wish to receive the death benefit proceeds  on the date we first receive notice of the owner’s death we will stop all pending automatic transactions including rebalancing and systematic withdrawals however any money in the sto will be transferred to the subaccounts according to the owner’s allocation   during the period from the date of death until we receive all required paperwork in good order the account value will remain invested in the subaccounts as allocated by you at the time of your death  as a result the account value continues to reflect the investment performance of the subaccounts during this period and will be subject to market fluctuations  separate account charges will continue to apply   if there are multiple beneficiaries after one beneficiary submits death claim paperwork the death benefit will be calculated and the first beneficiary will receive payment according to his or her election  the remaining beneficiaries’ share of the death benefit will be invested in the subaccounts as allocated by you at the time of your death and subject to market fluctuations   maturity date and annuity option   your annuity option is available anytime on or after your first contract anniversary until the maturity date  you may elect your annuity option by writing to the administrative office any time on or after your first contract anniversary and before the maturity date  upon the maturity date you may elect to receive a lump sum of your account value or you may elect an annuity option   an annuity option can provide for fixed payments which may be made monthly quarterly semiannually or annually  for any annuity the minimum payment must be at least   if the minimum monthly payment under a guaranteed annuity option would be less than  we will pay you a lump sum of your account value instead  all annuity options are funded through our general account   the amount applied toward the purchase of a guaranteed annuity option under the contract will be the account value less any premium tax  the guaranteed annuity options are single life and ten years certain or joint life and ten years certain  these options provide a fixed life income annuity with  years of payments guaranteed   we will also use the account value less any premium tax to determine your annuity payments if you select a nonguaranteed annuity option with either i life contingencies or ii a period certain that provides for fixed payments over ten or more years   we currently offer the additional annuity options listed below however we may eliminate or change the nonguaranteed options available at any time   ·                  periodcertain annuity which provides for fixed payments for a fixed period  the fixed periods available may vary from time to time and the fixed period selected may not extend past your life   vi   expectancy  the amount is determined by the period you select  if the annuitant dies before the end of the period selected the beneficiary will receive the remaining periodic payments ·                  periodcertain life annuity which provides for fixed payments for at least the period selected and after that for the life of the annuitant or the lives of the annuitant and any joint annuitant under a joint and survivor annuity  the fixed periods available may vary from time to time  if the annuitant or the annuitant and the joint annuitant under a joint and survivor annuity dies before the fixed period selected ends the remaining payments in the fixed period will go to the beneficiary ·                  life only annuity which provides fixed payments for the life of the annuitant or until the annuitant and joint annuitant both die under a joint and survivor annuity  once the annuitant or last joint annuitant dies no further payments will be made and no value remains for any beneficiaries   if you have not already selected a form of annuity option we will contact you prior to your maturity date  you can tell us at that time if you would like a lump sum payment or select the type of annuity you want  if we do not receive your election on or before your maturity date you will automatically receive the single life and tenyear certain annuity option guaranteed under the contract   annuity payments   once payments begin under an annuity option payments will not change  the size of payments will depend on the amount applied to the annuity option the form of annuity option you chose and in the case of an annuity option with life contingencies on the annuitant’s age and sex where permissible   if the age or sex of an annuitant has been misstated you will receive the benefits that would have been purchased at the correct age and gender  any overpayments or underpayments made by us will not be charged or credited with interest unless required by your state  if we have made overpayments because of incorrect information about age or gender we will deduct the overpayment from the next payment or payments due  we add underpayments to the next payment   how you make requests and give instructions   when you write to our administrative office use the address listed in the glossary of this prospectus  we cannot honor your requests unless they are in proper and complete form  whenever possible use one of our printed forms which may be obtained from our administrative office   abandoned or unclaimed property   every state has laws that generally provide for payment to the state of unclaimed property including proceeds of annuity contracts under various circumstances  this is called escheatment  in addition to the state unclaimed property laws we may be required to escheat property pursuant to regulatory demand finding agreement or settlement to help prevent escheatment it is important that you keep your contact information on file with us up to date including the names addresses phone numbers social security numbers and dates of birth for owners annuitants beneficiaries and other payees  such updates must be communicated in good order to our administrative office   part  — optional benefits   you may purchase one of the optional glwb riders offered with this contract which provides additional benefits for an additional charge  you may only elect a rider at the time of application  benefits under a rider will replace or supplement the standard contract benefits  charges for an optional benefit rider are in addition to the standard contract charges  be sure you understand the charges  carefully consider whether you need the benefit and whether it is appropriate for your particular circumstances  also consider whether you can buy the benefit more cheaply as part of the variable annuity or with a separate contract   vi   guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit   each guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit glwb is an optional rider you may purchase for an additional charge  you may select the individual glwb rider or the spousal glwb rider   the glwb rider guarantees lifetime payments for you or you and your covered spouse if you elect the spousal glwb rider regardless of how your investments perform as long as the rider is in effect  you are the covered person under the individual glwb rider  you and your spouse are the covered persons under the spousal glwb rider  if you take nonguaranteed withdrawals as explained below your benefit base will decrease immediately your lifetime payments may decrease and the rider may terminate   lifetime payout amount lpa   the lpa is the amount we guarantee you can receive each calendar year for your lifetime or for as long as either you or your covered spouse is alive if you elect the spousal glwb rider  you are eligible to begin receiving your lpa on the lpa eligibility date   for the individual glwb rider the lpa eligibility date is the earlier of the following   ·                  january st after the calendar year in which you turn age  if you turn age  on january st your lpa will be available beginning on that day or ·                  the contract date if you are age  or older at the time you purchase your contract  the lpa available during the calendar year in which you purchase your contract will be prorated for the portion of the calendar year remaining   for the spousal glwb rider the lpa eligibility date is the earlier of the following   ·                  january st after the calendar year in which the younger of you or your spouse turns age  if the younger of you or your spouse turns age  on january st your lpa will be available beginning on that day or ·                  the contract date if the younger of you or your spouse is age  or older at the time you purchase your contract  the lpa available during the calendar year in which you purchase your contract will be prorated for the portion of the calendar year remaining   the lpa is equal to the applicable withdrawal percentage multiplied by the benefit base on january st each year on or after the lpa eligibility date  for the spousal glwb rider that amount is then multiplied by  this  is called the spousal factor   withdrawal percentage  the applicable withdrawal percentage is determined by the following formula   a  b  c where   a       is the age based percentage stated on the chart below   age   age based percentage                          the age based percentage is determined by your age or the age of the younger of you or your spouse if you have elected the spousal glwb rider  the age based percentage is locked in on the date of the first withdrawal from the contract on or after the lpa eligibility date   b       is the cumulative deferral percentage  the cumulative deferral percentage begins at zero and increases by  for each complete calendar year that you do not take a withdrawal   vi   c       is a first year deferral percentage stated on the chart below   contract date   first year deferral percentage   january march      april june      july september      october december        the first year deferral percentage is a onetime addition to your withdrawal percentage that varies based on your contract date provided you do not take a withdrawal in the calendar year containing the contract date   benefit base  your initial benefit base is equal to your initial premium received by us on the contract date  your benefit base will be adjusted as follows                 on each contract anniversary your benefit base will be compared to your account value and if the account value is greater than the benefit base we will step up your benefit base to equal the account value               if you take a nonguaranteed withdrawal we will immediately decrease your benefit base as described in the section titled “nonguaranteed withdrawal” below               on the date we receive an additional premium during the first contract year we will immediately increase your benefit base by the amount of the additional premium  additional premiums received after the first contract year will not increase your benefit base  they will however increase the account value which is used to determine if a step up applies on the next contract anniversary   the benefit base is used only to measure the lpa and is not available for withdrawal or payable as a death benefit   if you or the younger of you and your spouse if you have elected the spousal glwb rider have reached the lpa eligibility date on the contract date your lpa for the calendar year that contains the contract date will be prorated for the portion of the calendar year remaining  the factor used to prorate the lpa is the number of days remaining in the calendar year not including the contract date divided by the number of days in the calendar year   if you withdraw less than the lpa in any calendar year you cannot carry over or add the remaining lpa to withdrawals made in future years   if your rmd is greater than the lpa for any calendar year the rmd will be the lpa for that calendar year   nonguaranteed withdrawal   before your lpa eligibility date a nonguaranteed withdrawal is the total amount of any withdrawal including any withdrawal charge   on or after your lpa eligibility date a nonguaranteed withdrawal is all or a portion of any withdrawal including any withdrawal charge that when combined with your total withdrawals for that calendar year exceeds your lpa   if you take a nonguaranteed withdrawal your benefit base will immediately decrease by the adjusted nonguaranteed withdrawal amount  the adjusted nonguaranteed withdrawal amount is defined as the nonguaranteed withdrawal amount multiplied by the greater of  and the ratio of benefit base to account value benefit base divided by account value where both values are determined immediately before the nonguaranteed withdrawal  the account value immediately before the nonguaranteed withdrawal means that the account value will be reduced by any remaining lpa prior to the calculation   vi   taking nonguaranteed withdrawals could reduce your future benefits by more than the dollar amount of the nonguaranteed withdrawals   the example below demonstrates how a nonguaranteed withdrawal affects the benefit base using the following assumptions   ·                  individual glwb in effect ·                  benefit base   ·                  account value   ·                  lpa   ·                  one withdrawal is taken during the calendar year   ·                  withdrawal taken after lpa eligibility date ·                  no withdrawal charge applies   the nonguaranteed withdrawal amount is  which is equal to your total calendar year withdrawals  minus your lpa   the adjusted nonguaranteed withdrawal is       nonguaranteed withdrawal amount x the greater of  or  benefit base immediately before the nonguaranteed withdrawal   account value immediately before the nonguaranteed withdrawal   your benefit base will be reduced by  to    this example is for illustrative purposes only and does not predict results   other important facts about withdrawals   ·                  you will not receive the intended benefit of this rider if you take nonguaranteed withdrawals  nonguaranteed withdrawals can have a significant negative effect on your benefit base and your lpa   ·                  a withdrawal charge may apply  if you withdraw more than your free withdrawal amount  of the account value in any contract year but the withdrawal does not exceed your lpa any applicable withdrawal charge will be waived  if you withdraw more than the free withdrawal amount and any portion of the withdrawal is a nonguaranteed withdrawal a withdrawal charge if any will be applied on the entire amount that is greater than the free withdrawal amount  see part  “withdrawal charge” and part  “withdrawals”  following is an example of how a withdrawal charge may apply   assume   individual glwb in effect       premium       account value before withdrawal       withdrawal charge percentage applicable to premium     lifetime payment amount         case  owner requests withdrawal of  lpa   the free withdrawal amount is calculated as  x     the  requested withdrawal is greater than the remaining free withdrawal amount however it does not exceed the lpa  no withdrawal charge will apply   vi   case  owner requests withdrawal of    the free withdrawal amount is   since the requested withdrawal exceeds the lpa withdrawal charges will apply  after applying the withdrawal first to the free withdrawal amount this leaves     which will be subject to a withdrawal charge of   x    ·                  withdrawals must be taken pro rata from your investment options  you cannot make a withdrawal from specific investment options   ·                  you may not take a withdrawal on your contract date   ·                  if you request a withdrawal we will withdraw the total amount you requested from your account value however the amount you receive will be net of tax withholding and withdrawal charge if applicable   ·                  you must use our withdrawal form to request withdrawals  contact our administrative office to obtain the form   glwb rider charge   the glwb rider charge is a daily charge taken from the account value in your subaccounts  the charge is in addition to the separate account charges for the contract and reduces your unit values  the charge varies depending on which glwb investment strategy you choose  the following table shows the effective annual rates for the rider charge   glwb investment strategy   current glwb charge   current glwb charge with total separate account expenses   strategy  — basic allocation       strategy  — self style allocation         we may increase the annual charge for the glwb rider up to the maximum of   the maximum glwb charge plus total separate account charges would be  for either glwb investment strategy   if we do increase the charge we will give you prior written notice of each increase  if you do not wish to accept an increase you may elect to either   ·                        cancel the rider or ·                        continue the rider with a reduction in the withdrawal percentage as determined by us effective at the time of the rider charge increase may not be available in ca and ct  the maximum reduction in the withdrawal percentage is  regardless of the number of rider charge increases   we do not deduct the rider charge during the guaranteed payment phase   the glwb rider charge is the same for the individual glwb rider and the spousal glwb rider  the lpa is adjusted downward — by the spousal factor of  — for the spousal glwb rider instead of an additional charge   glwb investment strategies   if you purchase the glwb rider you must allocate your premium to only one of the two glwb investment strategies described below  once you select a glwb investment strategy you cannot switch to another glwb investment strategy  as a result of the glwb rider investment restrictions you will always have some degree of exposure to the market  you cannot eliminate this exposure even during periods of market volatility  these glwb investment strategies are designed for longterm investors seeking withdrawal guarantees  note that the subaccounts available in the glwb investment strategies are also available without the rider   vi   the glwb investment strategies are intended in part to reduce the risk of investment losses that could require us to use our own assets to make payments under the glwb rider the glwb investment strategies are designed to lower the volatility of returns from your subaccounts subaccounts that are available without limitation if the glwb rider is not selected may offer the potential for higher returns before you select the glwb rider you and your financial representative should carefully consider whether the glwb investment strategies available with the rider meet your investment objectives

fee to be deducted from your contract  such fees are considered withdrawals and could cause a nonguaranteed withdrawal  therefore if you purchase a glwb rider we do not recommend using this annuity contract to pay for such services   withdrawal protection for required minimum distributions   if your contract is a traditional ira or a sep ira you may be required to withdraw money in order to satisfy irs minimum distribution requirements after you reach age ½   we will calculate the rmd for this annuity contract based on its prior calendar yearend fair market value  we do not consider your

that case due to your age difference you will be required to take your rmd for this annuity contract before the lpa eligibility date if you take your rmd from this contract’s account value each withdrawal will be a nonguaranteed withdrawal until the lpa eligibility date is reached  you are solely responsible for meeting all requirements of the tax code   after the lpa eligibility date you may take the greater of your lpa or your rmd each calendar year  in the year you turn ½ the tax code provides that you may take your first rmd prior to april st of the following calendar year however

to elect the individual glwb rider  in order to elect the spousal glwb rider both you and your spouse must be between  and  years old on the contract date ·                  the company may refuse to accept additional premiums on a nondiscriminatory basis at any time ·                  we may require proof that you or your covered spouse are living at any time ·                  you cannot switch from an individual glwb rider to a spousal glwb rider or vice versa ·                  income plus withdrawal program is not available ·                  choices plus required minimum distribution program is not available ·                  customized asset rebalancing program is not available ·                  systematic withdrawal of rmd only is not available   additional rules that apply to the spousal glwb rider                 only your legal spouse as defined by applicable state law on the contract date may be named as a covered person under the spousal glwb rider               you must name your spouse as your sole primary beneficiary               you cannot add or change a spouse as a covered person               if your marriage is terminated such as by divorce or dissolution or your spouse dies your spouse is automatically removed as a covered person  if you subsequently remarry you cannot add the new spouse               you must provide us with notice of the divorce or termination of marriage               once the spouse is removed as a covered person lifetime withdrawals under the spousal glwb rider are no longer guaranteed for the lives of both you and your spouse  if a spouse is removed you can name a new beneficiary to receive the death benefit               if a spouse is removed and is no longer a covered person the lpa eligibility date and the age based percentage are still based on the younger of you or your now removed spouse               if a spouse is removed and is no longer a covered person the spousal factor of  will continue to apply to your lpa calculation   should you purchase the glwb rider   the addition of a glwb rider to your annuity contract may not be right for you  for example   ·                  if you are purchasing the glwb rider to meet income needs you should consider whether an immediate annuity is better suited to your situation ·                  if you do not expect to take withdrawals while this rider is in effect you do not need a glwb rider because the benefit is accessed through withdrawals or ·                  if you are likely to need to take withdrawals prior to your lpa eligibility date or in an amount that is greater than the lpa or rmd for this contract only you should carefully evaluate whether a glwb rider is appropriate due to the negative effect of nonguaranteed withdrawals on your benefit base ·                  if your spouse is  or more years younger than you the spousal glwb rider may not be suitable for you   at older ages benefits paid may not exceed the charges associated with the rider depending on how long the covered person lives   vi   you should consult with your tax advisor and financial representative and carefully consider your alternatives before deciding if a glwb rider is suitable for your needs   examples   please see appendix c for hypothetical examples that illustrate how the glwb riders work   part  — voting rights   how fund shares are voted   integrity is the legal owner of the fund shares held by the separate account  as a shareholder we have the right to vote on certain matters with respect to the funds  among other things we may vote to elect the fund’s board of directors to ratify the selection of independent auditors and on any other matters described in a current prospectus or statement of additional information for each fund or any matter requiring a vote by shareholders under the  act   whenever a shareholder vote is taken we will give you the opportunity to tell us how to vote the number of shares attributable to the units in your contract  we will send you proxy materials and a form for giving us voting instructions   if we do not receive instructions in time from all contract owners we will vote shares for which we have not received instructions in the same proportion as we vote shares for which we have received instructions  as a result of this proportional voting the vote of a small number of contract owners may determine the outcome of a proposal  we may vote any shares that we are entitled to vote directly because of amounts we have accumulated in our separate account as we deem appropriate  if the federal securities laws or regulations or interpretations of them change so that we are permitted to vote shares in our own right or to restrict contract owner voting we may do so   fund shares are sold to investors other than us  therefore the shares voted by all shareholders will dilute the effect of voting instructions received by us from our contract owners   how we determine your voting shares   you vote only on matters concerning the funds that correspond to the subaccounts in which you are invested on the record date set by the trust  we determine the number of shares you vote by dividing your account value in each subaccount by the total value of assets in the subaccount multiplied by the number of shares in the subaccount   part  — tax aspects of the contract   tax status of the contract   this contract is only available as a traditional ira roth ira or sep ira  if you were able to purchase this contract as other than an ira the contract would not satisfy the diversification requirements under federal tax law to be treated as an annuity contract for federal income tax purposes and you would be currently taxed on your investment and gain   variable annuity contracts other than certain pension and qualified retirement plan contracts including iras are generally not treated as annuities for federal income tax purposes and thus lose their taxdeferred character if they do not satisfy certain diversification requirements set forth in section h of the tax code  investing in the etf shares that are “publicly available” ie that can be purchased directly without purchasing a variable annuity or life insurance contract is incompatible with these requirements  accordingly standing alone the contract would not be treated as an annuity contract for   vi   federal income tax purposes  however we believe that an individual purchasing a contract as an ira will not be taxed currently on the investment and gain   contracts that qualify as iras are not subject to restrictions against investing in publicly available investments if the contracts meet certain requirements set forth by the irs  we believe this contract will meet those requirements although there is no guarantee that this will be the case  if this contract is not maintained as an ira the taxes on the premiums and any gain will not be deferred or for a roth ira taxes on the gain will not be free from federal income tax and the tax treatment will be uncertain   types of iras   traditional iras   section  of the tax code permits eligible individuals to contribute to an individual retirement program known as an ira  an ira can be in the form of a trust or custodial account or an annuity  an individual may make annual contributions to an ira of up to the lesser of the limit specified in the tax code  for  and  plus cost of living adjustment in  and beyond or  of compensation includible in the individual’s gross income  for an individual age  or older the limit is increased by   the premiums may be deductible in whole or in part depending on the individual’s income and whether the individual or spouse participates in an employer sponsored retirement plan  contribution limits set by the tax code are cumulative limits that apply to all traditional and roth iras owned by an individual distributions from another ira or certain eligible employer plans may be transferred or “rolled over” into an ira on a taxdeferred basis without regard to these limits  amounts in the ira are taxed when distributed from the ira at ordinary income tax rates  a  penalty tax discussed below generally applies to distributions made before age ½ subject to certain exceptions  iras have minimum distribution rules also discussed below that govern the timing and amount of required distributions from traditional iras   sep iras   section  of the tax code permits sep iras which are a type of iras that allows employers to contribute to iras on behalf of their employees  employer premiums made to an employee’s sep ira cannot exceed the lesser of   of the employee’s compensation and  a limit specified in the tax code  for   distributions from sep iras are subject to the same restrictions and rules that apply to ira distributions   roth iras   section a of the tax code permits certain eligible individuals to make nondeductible contributions to a roth ira in cash or as a rollover or transfer from another roth ira or other ira  only individuals with income below certain amounts specified in the tax code may contribute to a roth ira  an eligible individual may make annual contributions to a roth ira of up to the lesser of the limit specified in the tax code  for  and  plus cost of living adjustment in  and beyond or  of compensation includible in the individual’s gross income  for an individual age  or older the limit is increased by   contribution limits set by the tax code are cumulative limits that apply to all traditional and roth iras owned by an individual a rollover from or conversion of an ira to a roth ira is generally subject to tax on the full amount rolled over or converted   you should consult a tax advisor before converting amounts to a roth ira or combining any converted amounts with any other roth ira contributions including any other conversion amounts from other tax years   distributions from a roth ira generally are not taxed except that once aggregate distributions exceed premiums to the roth ira income tax and a  penalty tax discussed below may apply to distributions made  before age   subject to certain exceptions or  during the five taxable years starting with the year in which the first contribution is made to any roth ira   vi   rollovers and transfers   in many circumstances you may move money taxfree from one ira to another ira or from certain other qualified plans such as a k plan or b tax sheltered annuity to an ira by means of a direct rollover or a transfer  you may roll over directly or indirectly any eligible rollover distribution  an eligible rollover distribution is defined generally as any distribution of all or part of the balance from a qualified plan except you cannot roll over the following taxable distributions from another plan   ·                  any distribution that is part of a series of substantially equal payments made over your life expectancy ·                  any distribution made for a specified period of  years or more ·                  any distribution that is an rmd or ·                  any hardship distribution   also you cannot roll over from a simple ira during the first two years of participation in the simple ira and you cannot roll over aftertax contribution that is included in the other plans   you can make only one rollover from an ira to another or the same ira in any month period regardless of the number of iras you own  the limit will apply by aggregating all of an individual’s iras including sep and simple iras as well as traditional and roth iras effectively treating them as one ira for purposes of the limit  trusteetotrustee transfers between iras are not limited  rollovers from traditional to roth iras “conversions” are not limited   tax laws are complex and your individual situation is unique  you should always consult a tax advisor before you move or attempt to move assets between any ira or qualified plan and another qualified contract or plan   early distributions   premature distributions are subject to an additional penalty tax equal to  of the amount of any payment from your ira that is includible in your income  this penalty is in addition to ordinary income tax  amounts paid from your ira before you reach ½ are considered premature distributions unless                 the distribution is paid due to your death or disability               the distribution is the result of an internal revenue service levy on the ira               the distributions do not exceed your deductible medical expenses               you have received unemployment compensation under a federal or state program for at least  consecutive weeks and the distributions do not exceed the amount paid for health insurance coverage for yourself your spouse and your dependents               a tax free rollover of the distribution is made               the distribution is part of a series of level periodic payments made over your life expectancy or joint life expectancy of you and your beneficiary               the distribution is used to cover certain qualified education expenses or               the distribution is used to cover qualified firsttime home purchase expense up to a lifetime maximum of    required minimum distributions rmd   for traditional and sep iras rmds generally must commence no later than april  of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the owner reaches age ½   the distribution required by april  is the distribution required for the year in which the owner actually turns ½ years old  you must take distributions for each calendar year after the year the owner turn age ½ by december  of that year  the amount of the rmd is based on the prior yearend fair market value of your contract   if your contract provides an additional benefit such as the optional glwb rider the fair market value of your contract may increase by the actuarial present value of the benefit  therefore the amount of the rmd you must take may increase   vi   if you have more than one ira the distributions required by the tax code for all iras in the aggregate may be met by taking distributions from one or more of your iras  please note however that only the rmd as defined in the glossary for this contract only one time each contract year is protected from a withdrawal charge see part  section titled “free withdrawal amount” and from being a nonguaranteed withdrawal if you have a glwb rider see part  section titled “withdrawal protection for required minimum distributions   failure to comply with the rmd rules applicable to qualified contracts may result in the imposition of an excise tax  this excise tax generally equals  of the amount by which an rmd exceeds the actual distribution from the contract   roth iras do not require distributions at any time prior to the owner’s death   inherited iras   the death benefit paid under this contract may be extended by the beneficiary as an inherited ira  however the contract cannot be initially issued as an inherited ira  this occurs if after the death of the owner the owner’s beneficiary directs that the death proceeds be titled as an inherited ira  see part  section titled “death benefit”  the owner’s beneficiary of the original ira contract will become the inherited ira owner and may name his or her own beneficiary in the event of death   the inherited ira owner may invest in the subaccounts then available under the contract  separate account charges will continue to apply  the inherited ira owner must take rmds beginning on or before december  of the calendar year after the original owner’s death  if the beneficiary is a spouse and has elected this option distributions may begin at the end of the calendar year in which the owner would have reached age ½ if later   if the original owner dies before the required beginning date the inherited ira owner must take rmd over his or her life expectancy as defined by the tax code  if the owner dies after the required beginning date the inherited ira owner may choose the longer of his or her life expectancy or the deceased owner’s life expectancy both as defined by the tax code  for roth iras the owner is presumed to have died before the required beginning date   the following chart summarizes the date when rmds must begin and the life used to measure the rmds   death of owner   spouse   nonspouse before required beginning date   distributions must begin by the later of i  of year after the calendar year of owner’s death or ii  of the year when the deceased owner would have reached age ½   rmd based on beneficiary life expectancy   distributions must begin by  of year after the calendar year of owner’s death         rmd based on beneficiary life expectancy           after required beginning date  traditional and sep iras only   distributions must begin by  of year after the calendar year of owner’s death   rmd may be based on longer of the owner’s or beneficiary’s life expectancy   distributions must begin by  of year after the calendar year of owner’s death   rmd may be based on longer of the owner’s or beneficiary’s life expectancy   vi   the following restrictions apply to the inherited ira contract i the inherited ira owner may not add premium to the contract ii the death benefit available to the beneficiary of the inherited ira owner is the account value on the death benefit date after the death of the inherited ira owner iii the beneficiary of the inherited ira owner will be required to receive the remaining account value either in a lump sum over five years or over the life expectancy of the inherited ira owner as determined by the tax code   a tax penalty applies if the inherited ira owner fails to take the rmd  the tax penalty equals  of the excess of the rmd over the amount actually withdrawn from the inherited ira during the calendar year   for more information on inherited iras see part irs publication   seek independent tax advice   federal and state income tax withholding   we may be required to withhold federal income taxes on all distributions unless the eligible recipients elect not to have any amounts withheld and properly notify us of that election   certain states have indicated that pension and annuity withholding will apply to payments made to their residents  generally an election out of federal withholding will also be considered an election out of state withholding  for more information concerning a particular state call our administrative office listed in the glossary   tax status of the company   under existing federal income tax laws we do not pay tax on investment income and realized capital gains of the separate account  we do not anticipate that we will incur any federal income tax liability on the income and gains earned by the separate account  the company therefore does not impose a charge for federal income taxes  if federal income tax law changes and we must pay tax on some or all of the income and gains earned by the separate account we may impose a charge against the separate account to pay the taxes  we can also set up reserves for taxes  we receive a tax deduction for dividends received by the funds   transfers among subaccounts   there will not be any current tax liability if you transfer any part of the account value among the subaccounts of your contract   seek tax advice   integrity does not act as your tax or legal advisor  this discussion of the federal income tax treatment of the contract is not designed to cover all situations and is not intended to be tax advice  it is based upon our understanding of the present federal income tax laws as currently interpreted by the internal revenue service irs and various courts  the irs or the courts may change their views on the treatment of these contracts  future legislation may have a negative effect on annuity contracts or iras  also we have not attempted to consider any applicable state or other tax laws   because of the complexity of the tax laws and the fact that tax results will vary according to the particular circumstances anyone considering buying a contract selecting an annuity option under the contract or receiving annuity payments under a contract should consult a qualified tax advisor   you should carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of owning a variable annuity as an ira or taxqualified plan as well as the costs and benefits of the contract including the death benefits income benefits and other nontaxrelated benefits before you purchase the contract as an ira   vi   this contract includes an enhanced death benefit and offers an optional living benefit  the irs requires an actuarial present value of enhanced benefits to be added to the account value for purposes of calculating the fair market value of the annuity and determining the rmd   the irs has not reviewed the contract for qualification as an ira and we make no guarantees that the contract will so qualify  integrity does not guarantee the tax status federal state or local of any

to request withdrawals  in the first method you receive the amount requested and any withdrawal charge is taken from the account value  this reduces your account value by the amount of the withdrawal charge in addition to the amount you requested  this is the method used unless you request otherwise or unless you have elected one of the glwb riders  in the second method you receive less than you requested if a withdrawal charge applies because the account value is reduced by the amount of the requested withdrawal and any withdrawal charge is taken from that amount   for both methods withdrawals are attributed to amounts in the following order                 any free withdrawal amount except in the case of a surrender               premiums that are no longer subject to a withdrawal charge and have not yet been withdrawn premiums are withdrawn from oldest to youngest               premiums subject to a withdrawal charge that have not yet been withdrawn premiums are withdrawn from oldest to youngest               any gain interest or other amount that is not considered a premium   example assumptions   assume one premium is paid no previous withdrawals have been taken and the account value at the time of the withdrawal is higher than the account value on the most recent contract anniversary   premium       account value before withdrawal       requested withdrawal       withdrawal charge percentage applicable to the premium       taxes are not considered in this example   using the first method   the free withdrawal amount is calculated as      account value on the date of the withdrawal x  free withdrawal percentage   previous partial withdrawals during the current contract year   after first applying the withdrawal to the free withdrawal amount the amount of the withdrawal still to be applied is      requested withdrawal   free withdrawal amount   there are no premiums that are no longer subject to a withdrawal charge so the withdrawal is next applied to the premium subject to a withdrawal charge  the withdrawal charge for this method is calculated as      portion of the withdrawal still to be attributed x  withdrawal charge percentage   –  one minus the withdrawal charge percentage   using this method you will receive  however the total account value withdrawn is      requested withdrawal   withdrawal charge   the amount of premium still subject to a withdrawal charge is      premium   portion of withdrawal attributed to premium including the withdrawal charge   vi   note the withdrawal charge does not just apply to the premium withdrawn  x   it also applies to the withdrawal charge itself indicated by the   factor in the withdrawal charge formula   using the second method   the free withdrawal amount is calculated as      account value on the date of the withdrawal x  free withdrawal percentage   previous partial withdrawals during the current contract year   after first applying the withdrawal to the free withdrawal amount the amount of the withdrawal still to be attributed is      requested withdrawal   free withdrawal amount   there are no premiums that are no longer subject to a withdrawal charge so the withdrawal is next applied to the premium subject to a withdrawal charge  the withdrawal charge for this method is calculated as      portion of the withdrawal still to be attributed x  withdrawal charge percentage   using this method the total account value withdrawn is  however you will receive      requested withdrawal   withdrawal charge   the amount of premium still subject to a withdrawal charge is      premium   portion of withdrawal attributed to premium including the withdrawal charge   note the second method will produce the same withdrawal charge as the first method if the requested withdrawal under the second method is the same as the total account value withdrawn in the first method  for example a requested withdrawal of  using the second method produces the same  withdrawal charge as shown in the first method above   this example is for illustrative purposes only and does not predict results   vi   appendix c   illustrations of guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit   the following examples demonstrate how the glwb riders work based on the stated assumptions  these examples are for illustration only and do not predict future investment results   example    this example illustrates the individual glwb rider where withdrawals equal to the lifetime payout amount lpa as well as a nonguaranteed withdrawal have been taken additional premiums have been added and increases to the withdrawal percentage and stepups have been applied  it also illustrates payments for the life of the covered person even though the account value has been reduced to zero  all amounts in the table are rounded to the nearest  in this example   assumptions ·                  the contract date is june  ·                  the owner’s age on contract date is  years ·                  the initial premium was  additional premiums of  were paid in calendar years  and  ·                  a nonguaranteed withdrawal equal to  is taken in calendar year  ·                  withdrawals equal to lpa are taken in calendar years  and calendar years  ·                  no withdrawals are taken that would result in withdrawal charges under the contract ·                  the rmd is not higher than the lpa in any calendar year ·                  the rider remains in effect during the period covered in this example       as of january  a

the applicable withdrawal percentage multiplied by the benefit base   b   in any year that an additional premium is added it is assumed to be added on february   for purposes of this example we selected february  as the assumed date of additional premium payments  since premiums may be paid throughout the year we hoped to accurately demonstrate the effect on the contract values by using a date other than the contract anniversary and january  which are the two key dates in the glwb rider calculations   c   any stepup is applied on the contract anniversary which is june  of each year   d   any withdrawal is assumed to occur one time per year on october   for purposes of this example we selected october  as the assumed date of withdrawals since withdrawals may be made throughout the year we hoped to accurately demonstrate the effect on the contract values by using a random date other than the contract anniversary and january  which are the two key dates in the glwb rider calculations   e   the hypothetical account value on the contract anniversary and on the date of the withdrawal includes deduction of all separate account charges and is before any withdrawal   f   the first calendar year begins on june  the contract date  on this day the benefit base  is set equal to the initial premium  the withdrawal percentage  is equal to the age based percentage  plus the cumulative deferral percentage  plus the first year deferral percentage    vi   since the covered person is at least age  on the date the rider is issued the lpa is available  it is calculated as the withdrawal percentage multiplied by the benefit base   ·                    withdrawal percentage x  benefit base   lpa   since this is the first calendar year the lpa is multiplied by a pro rata portion of the calendar year that remains  the pro rata factor is the number of days remaining in the calendar year divided by the total number of days in the calendar year   ·                    days remaining in calendar year   total days in calendar year assuming a nonleap year x  lpa   st year lpa   g        since no withdrawal was taken in calendar year  and since the contract date was june  the first year deferral percentage is determined as   the withdrawal percentage  is equal to the age based percentage  plus the cumulative deferral percentage  plus the first year deferral percentage    the lpa is determined as the withdrawal percentage multiplied by the benefit base   ·                    withdrawal percentage x  benefit base   lpa   h        an additional premium of  is made during calendar year   since this premium is during the first contract year the benefit base is increased by the amount of the premium   ·                    benefit base   additional premium amount   benefit base after the additional premium   i            in calendar year  the benefit base increases to  because the hypothetical account value on the contract anniversary  is larger than the benefit base   in calendar years  and  the benefit base again increases to the account value because the account value on the contract anniversary is larger than the benefit base  in calendar years  and later the benefit base is always larger than the account value on the contract anniversary and thus is not stepped up   j            since no withdrawal was taken in calendar year  the cumulative deferral percentage is increased by   the withdrawal percentage  in calendar year  is equal to the age based percentage  plus the cumulative deferral percentage  plus the first year deferral percentage    the lpa is determined as the withdrawal percentage multiplied by the benefit base   ·                    withdrawal percentage x  benefit base   lpa   since no withdrawal was taken in calendar year  the cumulative deferral percentage is again increased by   the withdrawal percentage  in calendar year  is equal to the age based percentage  plus the cumulative deferral percentage  plus the first year deferral percentage  the lpa is determined as the withdrawal percentage multiplied by the benefit base   ·                    withdrawal percentage x  benefit base   lpa   since no withdrawal was taken in calendar year  the cumulative deferral percentage is again increased by   the withdrawal percentage  in calendar year  is equal to the age based percentage  plus the cumulative deferral percentage  plus the first year deferral percentage  the lpa is determined as the withdrawal percentage multiplied by the benefit base   ·                    withdrawal percentage x  benefit base   lpa   k        since no withdrawal was taken in calendar year  the cumulative deferral percentage is again increased by   the age based percentage has changed to  because the covered person is now   the withdrawal percentage  in calendar year  is equal to the age based percentage  plus the cumulative deferral percentage  plus the first year deferral percentage    vi   the lpa is determined as the withdrawal percentage multiplied by the benefit base   ·       withdrawal percentage x  benefit base   lpa   because there is a withdrawal during calendar year  the age based percentage is locked at    l   an additional premium of  is made during calendar year   since this premium is paid after the first contract year the premium has no impact on the benefit base  all premiums received are immediately applied to the account value  for this example we have used hypothetical account values in an effort to reflect market fluctuations between  and  annually  in the case of this  additional premium in contract year  the premium was applied to the account value but because the hypothetical account value also reflects market losses the  additional premium assumed to be made on february  had declined in value by the contract anniversary on june   the evolution of the hypothetical account value can be seen by tracking the account value from june  of year  to year   the account value goes from  to  throughout the year an increase of   during that contract year there is a  withdrawal taken on october  and a  premium applied the following february  the premium is  larger than the withdrawal  that means the market experience resulted in a downward movement of     throughout the year   ·    account value on june  of year  ·     withdrawal on october  ·  premium on february  ·     market experience ·   account value on june  of year    m  in calendar year  a nonguaranteed withdrawal in the amount of   amount withdrawn   lpa is taken  the adjusted nonguaranteed withdrawal amount is the nonguaranteed withdrawal amount multiplied by the greater of  and the ratio of the benefit base to the account value where both values are calculated immediately before the nonguaranteed withdrawal for this calculation the account value before the nonguaranteed withdrawal is  equal to the account value before any withdrawal  minus the lpa  it is calculated as follows   ·       nonguaranteed withdrawal amount x the greater of  and   benefit base divided by  account value   adjusted nonguaranteed withdrawal amount   the benefit base is reduced by the adjusted nonguaranteed withdrawal amount   ·       benefit base   adjusted nonguaranteed withdrawal amount   benefit base after the nonguaranteed withdrawal   n   in calendar year  the account value is reduced to zero after the withdrawal however the benefit base is greater than zero  therefore the rider enters guaranteed payment phase and payments of the lpa continue   vi   example    this example illustrates the spousal glwb rider where withdrawals equal to the lpa as well as nonguaranteed withdrawals have been taken and increases to the withdrawal percentage have been applied  it also illustrates the termination of the rider if the account value is reduced to zero by a nonguaranteed withdrawal  all amounts in the table are rounded to the nearest  in this example   assumptions ·

also each january  on or after the lpa eligibility date the lpa is equal to the applicable withdrawal percentage multiplied by the benefit base   vi     b         any applicable stepup is applied on the contract anniversary which is august  of each year   c         any applicable withdrawal is assumed to occur one time per year on october   for purposes of this example we selected october  as the assumed date of withdrawals  since withdrawals may be made throughout the year we hoped to accurately demonstrate the effect on the contract values by using a random date other than the contract anniversary and january  which are the two key dates in the glwb rider calculations   d        the hypothetical account value on the contract anniversary and on the date of the withdrawal includes deduction of all separate account charges and is before any withdrawal   e         the first calendar year begins on august  the contract date  on this day the benefit base  is set equal to the initial premium   since the lpa is not available until the lpa eligibility date the withdrawal percentage and the lpa are not applicable   f          in calendar year  the benefit base increases to

thus the lpa is now available  since no withdrawal was taken in calendar year  and since the contract date was august  the first year deferral percentage is   since no withdrawal was taken in calendar year  the cumulative deferral percentage is   the age based percentage  is based on the age of the younger covered person  the withdrawal percentage  is equal to the age based percentage  plus the cumulative deferral percentage  plus the first year deferral percentage    the lpa is determined as the withdrawal percentage multiplied by the benefit base multiplied by the spousal factor   ·                    withdrawal percentage x  benefit base x  spousal factor   lpa   because there is a withdrawal during calendar year  the age based percentage is locked at    i            a

may be based on historical returns of the subaccounts  at any time in the future performance will likely be higher or lower than in the past  historical performance does not predict future results   performance data   in advertisements or in information furnished to you we may provide the average annual total return and the cumulative total return of the units of the subaccounts the money market option may also from time to time include the yield and effective yield of its units  performance information is computed separately for each subaccount in accordance with the formulas described below   total return reflects all aspects of the return of a subaccount including the automatic reinvestment of all distributions and the deduction of all charges that apply on an annual basis  performance represents annualized percentage change in net assets of a subaccount based on a hypothetical  investment the performance of the underlying portfolios and the charges that would have been made during the periods shown  premium taxes if applicable are not reflected   average annual total returns are calculated by determining the growth or decline in value of a hypothetical investment in the subaccount over certain periods including    and  years and then calculating the annually compounded percentage rate that would have produced the same result if the rate of growth or decline in value had been constant over the period   investors should realize that a subaccount’s performance is not constant over time but changes from year to year and that the average annual returns represent the averages of historical periods as opposed to the actual historical performance of a subaccount during any portion of the period shown  average annual returns are calculated using this formula   p tn  erv where p is a hypothetical initial payment of  t is the average annual total return n is      the number of years and erv is the redeemable value at the end of the period   standardized returns are average annual total returns calculated from the subaccount inception date which represents the date the subaccount was available in the contract  standardized returns reflect the deduction of all contract expenses including underlying fund expenses the annual separate account charges and the withdrawal charge the cost of the optional guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit rider is not included  if the cost of the rider were included the returns would be lower   nonstandardized returns are calculated from the fund inception date which represents the inception date of the underlying fund rather than the date it was included in the contract  performance that predates the inclusion in the contract is hypothetical and has been adjusted to include contract expenses  two sets of nonstandardized returns may be presented each reflecting the deduction of underlying fund expenses and the annual separate account charge  one set also reflects the withdrawal charge  the cost of the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit rider is not included  if the cost of the rider were included the returns would be lower   cumulative total returns are unaveraged and reflect the simple percentage change in the value of a hypothetical investment in the subaccount over a stated period of time  in addition to the period since inception cumulative total returns may be calculated on a yeartodate basis at the end of each calendar month in the current calendar year  the last day of the period for yeartodate returns is the last day of the most recent calendar month at the time of publication   yields quoted in advertising reflect the change in value of a hypothetical investment in a subaccount over a stated period of time not taking into account capital gains or losses or any withdrawal charge  yields are annualized and stated as a percentage   current yield and effective yield are calculated for the money market option  current yield is based on the change in the value of a hypothetical investment exclusive of capital changes over a particular day period less contract charges that would have applied during the period the base period and stated as a percentage of the investment at the start of the base period the base period return  the base period return is then annualized by multiplying by  with the resulting yield figure carried to at least the nearest hundredth of one percent   effective yield assumes that all dividends received during an annual period have been reinvested  this compounding effect causes effective yield to be higher than current yield  calculation of effective yield begins with the same base period return used in the calculation of current yield which is then annualized to reflect weekly compounding pursuant to the following formula   effective yield  base period return   –    individualized illustrations   integrity may provide computergenerated illustrations using programs available through third party firms to provide

charges made directly to contract owner accounts through the redemption of units and expenses of the underlying fund are excluded   total return amounts represent the total return for the periods indicated including changes in the fair value of the underlying fund which includes expenses assessed through the reduction of unit values  the ratio does not include any expenses assessed through the

otherthantemporary securities that are in an unrealized loss position which the company intends to sell or does not have the intent and ability to hold until recovery are written down to fair value as a realized loss securities that are in an unrealized loss position which the company has the intent and ability to hold until recovery are written down to the extent the present value of expected

lower than the amortized cost if high credit quality securities are adjusted the retrospective method is used   the company monitors other investments to determine if there has been an

hold the security long enough for it to recover its value to bookadjusted carrying value and   ·                  for all other debt securities with interestrelated declines in fair value the company’s intent to sell the security before recovery of its bookadjusted carrying value   if the decline is judged to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge to fair value is recorded as a net realized capital loss in the period the determination is made under gaap if the decline is judged to be otherthantemporary because the company has the intent to sell the debt security or is more likely than not to be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery an impairment charge to fair value is recorded as a net realized capital loss if the decline is judged to be

is the risk of loss from a counterparty failing to perform according to the terms of the contract that exposure includes settlement risk ie the risk that the counterparty defaults after the company has delivered funds or securities under terms of the contract that would result in an accounting loss and replacement cost risk ie the cost to replace the contract at current market rates should the counterparty default prior to settlement date to limit exposure associated with counterparty nonperformance on its option positions the company limits its exposure to individual counterparties to  of

values of financial instruments   included in various investmentrelated line items in the financial statements are certain financial instruments carried at fair value other financial instruments are periodically measured at fair value such as when impaired or for certain bonds and preferred stocks when carried at the lower of cost or market   the company uses fair value measurements to record the fair value of certain assets and liabilities and to estimate the fair value of financial instruments not recorded at fair value but required to be disclosed at fair value certain financial instruments particularly policyholder liabilities other than investmenttype contracts are excluded from this fair value discussion fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date   the company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value have been classified for disclosure purposes based on the following hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels the company’s policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out of levels at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period   ·                  level  — quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities the company’s level  assets and liabilities primarily include exchangetraded equity securities and mutual funds including those which are part of the company’s separate account assets   ·                  level  — inputs other than quoted prices included in level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly the company’s level  assets and liabilities include naic  industrial and miscellaneous bonds and residential mortgagebacked securities representing subordinated tranches in securitization trusts containing residential mortgage loans these securities are currently rated below investment grade the company determined fair value through the use of thirdparty pricing services utilizing market observable inputs also included in level  assets and liabilities are call options the fair values of these instruments are determined through the use of thirdparty pricing services utilizing market observable inputs   ·                  level  — significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability the company’s level  assets and liabilities primarily include certain call options the fair values of these instruments are determined through the use of valuation models that utilize significant unobservable inputs      integrity life insurance company   notes to financial statements statutorybasis continued    fair values of financial instruments continued   fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on available market information and judgments about the financial instrument including discount rates estimates of timing amount of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer such estimates do not consider the tax impact of the realization of unrealized gains or losses   for level  investments the fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets in addition the disclosed fair value may not be realized in the immediate settlement of the financial instrument   as described below certain fair values are determined through the use of thirdparty pricing services management does not adjust prices received from third parties however the company does analyze the thirdparty pricing services’ valuation methodologies and related inputs and performs additional evaluation to determine the appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy the company performs annual due diligence of thirdparty pricing services which includes assessing the vendor’s valuation qualifications control environment analysis of asset classspecific valuation methodologies and understanding of market observable assumptions and unobservable assumptions if any employed in the valuation methodology care should be exercised in deriving conclusions about the company’s business its value or financial position based on the fair value information of financial instruments presented below the following discussion describes the valuation methodologies utilized by the company for assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value   debt securities   the fair values of debt securities and assetmortgagebacked securities have been determined through the use of thirdparty pricing services utilizing market observable inputs private placement securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information are valued using either broker quotes or by discounting the expected cash flows using current marketconsistent rates applicable to the yield credit quality and maturity of each security   equity securities   the fair values of actively traded equity securities have been determined utilizing publicly quoted prices obtained from thirdparty pricing services the fair values of certain equity securities for which no publicly quoted prices are available have been determined through the      integrity life insurance company   notes to financial statements statutorybasis continued    fair values of financial instruments continued   use of thirdparty pricing services utilizing market observable inputs actively traded mutual funds are valued using the net asset values of the funds   mortgage loans   the fair values for mortgage loans consisting principally of commercial real estate loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates currently being offered for similar loans collateralized by properties with similar investment risk the fair values for mortgage loans in default are established at the lower of the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell or the carrying amount of the loan   cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments   the fair values of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are based on quoted market prices or stated amounts   derivative instruments   the fair values of freestanding derivative instruments primarily call options are determined through the use of thirdparty pricing services utilizing market observable inputs or valuation models incorporating significant unobservable inputs including projected cash flows applicable swap curves and implied volatilities   securities lending reinvested collateral assets   the fair values of securities lending reinvested collateral assets are determined through the use of thirdparty sources utilizing publicly quoted prices   other invested assets   other invested assets primarily include surplus debentures for which fair values have been determined through the use of thirdparty pricing services utilizing market observable inputs      integrity life insurance company   notes to financial statements statutorybasis continued    fair values of financial instruments continued   assets held in separate accounts   assets held in separate accounts primarily include debt securities equity securities mutual funds and mortgage loans the fair values of these assets have been determined using the same methodologies as similar assets held in the general account   life and annuity reserves for investmenttype contracts and deposit fund liabilities   the fair value of liabilities for investmenttype contracts is based on the present value of estimated liability cash flows which are discounted using rates that incorporate riskfree rates and margins for the company’s own credit spread and the riskiness of cash flows key assumptions to the cash flow model include the timing of policyholder withdrawals and the level of interest credited to contract balances fair values for insurance reserves are not required to be disclosed however the estimated fair values of all insurance reserves and investment contracts are taken into consideration in the company’s overall management of interest rate risk   securities lending liability   the liability represents the company’s obligation to return collateral related to securities lending transactions the liability is shortterm in nature and therefore the fair value of the obligation approximates the carrying amount   separate account liabilities   certain separate account liabilities are classified as investment contracts and are carried at an amount equal to the related separate account assets carrying value is a reasonable estimate of the fair value as it represents the exit value as evidenced by withdrawal transactions between contract holders and the company      integrity life insurance company   notes to

value other financial instruments are periodically measured at fair value such as when impaired or for certain bonds and preferred stocks when carried at the lower of cost or market   the company uses fair value measurements to record the fair value of certain assets and liabilities and to estimate the fair value of financial instruments not recorded at fair value but required to be disclosed at fair value certain financial instruments particularly policyholder liabilities other than investmenttype contracts are excluded from this fair value discussion   fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value have been classified for disclosure purposes based on the following hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels the company’s

and private equity securities within the company’s separate account that must be priced using nonbinding broker quotes or other valuation techniques that utilize significant unobservable inputs   fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on available market information and judgments about the financial instrument including discount rates estimates of timing amount of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer such estimates do not consider the tax impact of the realization of unrealized gains or losses   for level  investments the fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets in addition the disclosed fair value may not be realized in the immediate settlement of the financial instrument   as described below certain fair values are determined through the use of thirdparty pricing services management does not adjust prices received from third parties however the company does analyze the thirdparty pricing services’ valuation methodologies and related inputs and performs additional evaluation to determine the appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy care should be exercised in deriving conclusions about the company’s business its value or financial position based on the fair value information of financial instruments presented below the following discussion describes the valuation methodologies utilized by the company for assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value      the western and southern life insurance company   notes to financial statements statutorybasis continued    fair values of financial instruments continued   debt securities   the fair values of debt securities and assetmortgagebacked securities have been determined through the use of thirdparty pricing services utilizing market observable inputs private placement securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information are valued using either broker quotes or by discounting the expected cash flows using current marketconsistent rates applicable to the yield credit quality and maturity of each security   equity securities   the fair values of actively traded equity securities have been determined utilizing publicly quoted prices obtained from thirdparty pricing services the fair values of certain equity securities for which no publicly quoted prices are available have been determined through the use of thirdparty pricing services utilizing market observable inputs actively traded mutual funds are valued using the net asset values of the funds   mortgage loans   the fair values for mortgage loans consisting principally of commercial real estate loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates currently being offered for similar loans collateralized by properties with similar investment risk the fair values for mortgage loans in default are established at the lower of the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell or the carrying amount of the loan   cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments   the fair values of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are based on quoted market prices or stated amounts   derivative instruments   the fair values of freestanding derivative instruments primarily call options and interest rate swaps are determined through the use

private debt fund investments the fair values of debt securities equity securities and mutual funds have been determined using the same methodologies as similar assets held in the general account  the fair values of private equity and private debt fund investments have been determined utilizing the net asset values of the funds   life and annuity reserves for investmenttype contracts and deposit fund liabilities   the fair value of liabilities for investmenttype contracts is based on the present value of estimated liability cash flows which are discounted using rates that incorporate riskfree rates and margins for the company’s own credit spread and the riskiness of cash flows key assumptions to the cash flow model include the timing of policyholder withdrawals and the level of interest credited to contract balances fair values for insurance reserves are not required to be disclosed however the estimated fair values of all insurance reserves and investment contracts are taken into consideration in the company’s overall management of interest rate risk   securities lending liability   the liability represents the company’s obligation to return collateral related to securities
