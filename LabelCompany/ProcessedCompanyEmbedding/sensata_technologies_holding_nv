technologies st sanjit deepalam longshort equity deep value midcap longterm horizonsummarysensata technologies has had relatively volatile earnings over the past few yearsthe company is also highly leveraged and has nearly half its total assets in good willhowever the industry the company operates in offers it many competitive advantagesultimately the disparity between the companys performance and the industrys advantages mean that investors cannot expect a large margin of safety or much certainty in the futureinvestment thesis although sensata technologies holding nv nyse st is in a great industry its mediocre performances and high leverage mean that investors cannot expect much safety or certainty in their investment overview sensata technologies is a global technology company that manufactures and sells sensors and controls as the company notes in its most recent k its primary products include pressure sensors speed and position sensors bimetal electromechanical controls temperature sensors power conversion and control products thermal and magnetichydraulic circuit breakers pressure switches and interconnection products their products are used for a variety of different applications including in automotives airplanes and electric motors the company is based in the netherlands but operates worldwide in  the americas asia and europe accounted for   and  of total revenue performance sensing segment this segment is a leading supplier of automotive sensors including those focused on pressure speed and position temperature operator controls and pressure switches this is the companys largest segment and accounted for roughly  of total net revenue in  the company believes this segment of its business which essentially only sells products to the automotive industry will be helped in the future by three trends steadily rising demand for automobiles a greater number of sensors per vehicle and a shift from electromechanical products to electronic solidstate sensors the company also notes that customers prefer to buy from sellers with an established track record and usually buy in large scale both of which benefit its market position the segments revenues have also steadily grown over the years net revenues went from  billion in  to  billion in  and then to  billion in  mostly as a result of an increase in the number of sensors per vehicle and increasing global vehicle sales sensing solutions segment this smaller segment of the company focuses on producing electromechanical controls circuit breakers conversion and control products industrial and aerospace sensors and interconnection products unlike the other segment this segment sells products to a variety of industries and sectors including aerospace the military healthcare and residential real estate net revenue for this segment has increased overall over the past few years although net revenue decreased from  to  going from  million to  million it increased sharply in  at  million earnings net revenue as indicated before has increased steadily over the past few years from  billion combined in  to  billion combined in  to  billion combined in  understanding the companys income however is not so simple the companys net income has been volatile over the past few years going from  million in  to  million to  and then back down to  million this past year the reason for these fluctuations despite rising revenues is this income tax in  the company gained  million from income taxes and in  it gained  million in  while it was charged  million in income taxes during the same year the company benefited from income taxes whenever a portion of its us valuation was released as a result of an acquisition the companys income before income taxes however is also volatile dipping from  to  and then rising back up in  this is due to a higher than average interest expense in  profits from operations however paint a prettier picture as the graph below shows st operating income annual data by ycharts operating income has grown steadily over the past few years following revenues lead based on the companys income statement two conclusions can be drawn  in recent years the companys core profits have been growing but only after accounting for expenses that are recurring by their very nature and  a solid investment thesis can only be reached after we have a way of evaluating the companys future income tax situation and future debt cash flow st cash from operations annual data by ycharts cash flows decreased slightly from  to  mostly as a result of an increase in inventory as the company notes in its latest k filing but overall as the graph above shows cash from operations has been increasing relatively steadily over the longterm and will likely continue to do so book value and indebtedness as the company openly acknowledges in its latest annual filing it is heavily leveraged the companys total debt stands at roughly  billion with total interest expenses at  million however investors can find some solace in the fact that most of the companys debt   billion  matures over  years from now still the companys debt to equity ratio is an extremely high  the companys book value is also less than savory although total assets are roughly  billion  slightly lower than  billion in   goodwill accounts for  billion of total assets which is an extremely disproportionate amount total liabilities did decrease as a result of lower current debt levels however overall shareholders equity increased from  billion to  billion the companys pb ratio is currently  which is not especially low st book value annual data by ycharts as the graph above shows however book value has increased steadily over the past few years conclusion overall sensata seems to be a mediocre company in a great field on the one hand the company is heavily leveraged has way too much of its book value attributed to goodwill has fluctuating earnings overall and fluctuating cash flows on the other hand the field the company puts it in an inherently strong position as the company notes in its most recent annual filing there are very high barriers of entry in the sensors and controls industry since customers often find it hard to switch between manufacturers due to design and also need large companies that can scale production to meet their demand it is also very difficult for customers to switch sensor manufacturers without going through a lot of red tape with government agencies or without redesigning much of the system the sensor is going to be used in all these factors seemingly give sensata a large moat that they can work off of however this is not how things stand there is still uncertainty in the future regarding the companys income tax charges and debt expenses is the company doomed absolutely not even though the company is highly leveraged and not booming its operating profits have still been rising in the aggregate the company however is definitely not undervalued by any stretch of the imagination and investors cannot expect a great margin of safety or great certainty about the future disclosure iwe have no positions in any
