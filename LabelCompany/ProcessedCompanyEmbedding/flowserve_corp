secondquarter  adjusted earnings of  cents per share missed the zacks consensus estimate of  cents by half on a reported basis the companys earnings per share plunged  to  cents on a yearoveryear basis precipitous topline decline owing to macroeconomic volatility as well as foreign currency headwinds proved to be major drags for the bottom line quarter in detail revenues fell  year over year to  million and also missed the zacks consensus estimate of  million sluggish progress of the industrial product division turnaround customer delays in product pickup and significantly high tax rate proved to be a drag on the revenues also foreign currency headwinds eroded sales by  million the companys bookings totaled  million in secondquarter  up  year over year at constant currency cc aftermarket bookings totaled  million and were down  at cc while original equipment bookings were up  at cc to  million growth in bookings came on the back of modest recovery in the oil  gas industry and higher original equipment bookings operating income of the company came in at  million up  from the yearago period foreign currency headwinds and lower sales acted as major dampeners for operating income performance also adjusted gross margin expanded  bps to  segmental results engineered product division revenues were down  year over year to  million in the quarter negative currency

outlook flowserve reduced its  guidance and now expects adjusted earnings per share guidance to lie in the band of  previous guidance  it estimates revenues to decline in the range of  the company does not anticipate any major turnaround in the current geopolitical environment and end markets for  factors including currency rates commodity prices expected bookings and market volatility are likely to put pressure on both the top and bottomline performances for this year however in light of the continued stability of the companys bookings and modest sequential improvement in operations flowserve anticipates its performance to improve in the second half of the year particularly in the fourth quarter to conclude flowserve had a choppy first half of the year its biggest challenge comes in the form of capital spending constraints and aftermarket push outs in the recent past the companys operations have suffered from project delays rolling maintenance deferrals and extended timelines for both order placement and delivery acceptance we believe flowserve will continue to witness challenging times in the second half of the year on the other hand relative stability of oil at around the level of  over the past couple of quarters is a major positive for the company it appears that flowserves orders are finally showing signs of bottoming out signaling brighter days ahead going forward we believe stabilization in core aftermarket activities bode well for longterm growth of the company other key strengths include strong operational model solid productivity and considerable aftermarket content and geographical diversity in particular the diligent restructuring efforts are starting to manifest themselves in substantial savings despite these positives there is no denying the fact that the companys waning topline performance remains a major concern zacks rank  stocks to consider flowserve presently carries a zacks rank  hold some betterranked stocks in the broader

“flowserve delivered fourth quarter and full year  results inline with our expectations supported by continued progress on our realignment program” said mark blinn flowserve’s president and chief executive officer “our focus on disciplined cost management and efficiency enhancing initiatives helped mitigate what continues to be a challenging industry environment we were pleased to have experienced another quarter of generally stable crude prices and are encouraged by the general increased sense of optimism about the macroeconomic environment these factors however have yet to translate into increased bookings levels as customers remained cautious in new project awards and maintenance activities during the fourth quarter and in their acceptance of completed project work importantly for both the fourth quarter and for the full year our aftermarket bookings stabilized relative to prior year levels which is a positive development for flowserve we continue to achieve meaningful cost savings from our transformational realignment program and look forward to completing the vast majority of the  million program in  “while we are cautiously optimistic that certain energy and industrial customers’ budgets may improve off current low levels we are not anticipating a recovery in our  planning due to continued geopolitical end market and macro uncertainties accordingly our near term focus remains on controlling what we can by improving our speed to market enhancing our project execution and completing our strategic realignment program we believe that these initiatives will position the company successfully through cycles regardless of market conditions we will remain disciplined in our approach to the work we pursue and are confident that our actions will drive a leaner and more efficient operating platform flowserve remains well positioned to drive value for our shareholders over the long term”  initial guidance  flowserve is providing reported and adjusted eps guidance for  as well as certain other financial metrics as shown in the table below              target range revenues down  to  reported earnings per share    adjusted earnings per share    net interest expense    million tax rate approximate  –  flowserve’s  adjusted eps target range excludes expected realignment charges of approximately  million as well as the potential impact of belowtheline foreign currency effects and certain other discrete items both the reported and the adjusted eps target range includes the expected revenue decline of approximately  to  percent yearoveryear and is based on yearend  foreign currency rates current commodity prices expected bookings levels and market conditions the reset of annual incentive performance goals and an expected merit compensation increase an abovetheline foreign currency headwind  of approximately  cents per share net interest expense in the range of  to  million and a tax rate of  to  percent under current us tax and regulatory policies “flowserve’s  guidance reflects our beginning backlog entering the year an expected increase in manufacturing facility underabsorption customer’s continued emphasis on price and annual compensation headwinds” said karyn ovelmen flowserve’s executive vice president and chief financial officer “partially offsetting these items we expect incremental cost savings from our realignment initiatives and relatively stable to increasing yearoveryear aftermarket and bookandship work we expect the quarterly phasing of our  reported and adjusted eps target ranges to reflect seasonality although the traditional second half weighting is anticipated to be more pronounced this year as the first quarter is expected to represent a substantially lower percentage of full year earnings than in past years due to expected lower revenues and elevated sga as compared to remaining  quarters despite the current market challenges we will continue to invest in our business including executing on our realignment initiatives to better position the company to drive longterm shareholder value” realignment programs in full year  flowserve expensed approximately  million including approximately  million in the fourth quarter and recognized approximately  million of incremental savings bringing the full year incremental savings to  million we expect to largely complete the  million program in  including approximately  million of expense and approximately  million of additional savings with total program savings of  million expected to be
