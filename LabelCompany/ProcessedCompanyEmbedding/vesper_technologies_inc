vm  vesper vm piezoelectric mems microphone create the most acoustically rich consumer products for all sound environments from smartphones and wearables to smart home devices consumers use soundenabled products in the real world that’s why mems microphones have to work in realworld environments not just some of the time but all of the time vesper’s vm does just that robust and reliable as the industry’s first piezoelectric mems microphone vm is the most robust and reliable mems microphone for consumer products it is waterproof dustproof particleresistant and shockproof so you can immerse it in water bathe it in dust expose it to particulate matter or drop it on the ground and it keeps working properly it’s a microphone on which you can depend and although your customers won’t recognize it with their bare eyes they will appreciate it with their ears vm gallery reliability specifications stress test description water immersion ipx  hours drying time normal dry environment

devices they want to record from across the room and use voice to control their smart tv it is farfield audio applications like these that are making microphone arrays so popular but there’s a problem microphone arrays require microphones that are carefully matched in terms of phase and sensitivity here again capacitive mems microphones fall down once they leave the factory floor they are prone to “drift” so their performance is unstable as a piezoelectric mems microphone vm uses a much simpler and more consistent manufacturing process as well as easier less expensive asic calibration — ensuring that phase and sensitivity are well matched very stable over time and in harsh environments vm microphones in an array always stay matched in all environmental conditions ambient noise cancellation and audio zoom as a very high snr microphone vm delivers an acoustically rich experience for a range of applications vm offers better ambient noise cancellation so phone calls and recordings sound clearer it also provides superior “audio zoom” – giving consumers more accurate soundselection when they are recording technical specifications vm is an omnidirectional singleended

with the new designers have used capacitive mems microphones in their smartphones tablets laptops and digital cameras for almost  years even though they use silicon processing capacitive mems microphones operate using the same physical principle as condenserstyle microphones that have been around for almost  years they measure sound with a capacitor condenser made of a flexible diaphragm and a rigid backplate as multimembrane capacitive structures they trap air in between layers which prevents the sound transducer from moving freely in response to sound pressure limiting performance in contrast piezoelectric mems microphones do not trap a stiff air mass between two plates vesper’s diaphragm can move freely in response to sound waves to capture the maximum signal and provide better performance the old capacitive mems microphones are prone to reliability issues as well water dust solder flux vapors and other common contaminants can damage them so they lose up to  of their signal or stop working altogether microphonematching is more timeconsuming because of parttopart variation which requires handcalibration of microphones once they leave the production line vesper uses piezoelectric materials to create the most advanced mems microphones on the market this is a marked shift from capacitive mems microphones because piezoelectric microphones operate upon a completely different physical phenomenon – the direct conversion of mechanical sound energy into electrical energy vesper’s piezoelectric design is a single diaphragm that is immune to dust water solder flux vapors and other similar environmental contaminants in fact vesper’s has the world’s only mems microphones rated at ip making them the most waterproof mems microphone available and unlike capacitive mems microphones which require soundmuffling waterproof meshes and protective layers to have a chance against water our microphones don’t require special packaging so they preserve acoustic integrity find a reseller how it works vesper uses piezoelectric cantilever structures as our sound transducer eliminating the dual or triplemembrane layer structures used in capacitive devices vesper uses piezoelectric cantilever structures as our sound transducer eliminating the dual or triplemembrane layer structures used in capacitive devices as singlelayer devices piezoelectric structures can move freely in response to sounds to create the highest fidelity signal possible as a result vesper microphones provide very high snr this means that our microphones can capture sound clearly and at great distances while remaining immune to dust particles or water     here’s how all other mems microphones work   here’s how vesper’s microphone works minimizing parttopart variation in addition our piezoelectric mems microphones utilize a proven highly reliable and controlled manufacturing process and material aluminum nitride which major semiconductor companies have used to ship billions of rf filters for mobile phones this tight manufacturing process control means that our microphones are remarkably consistent in manufacturing with little variation from microphone to microphone this

enough to withstand water dust and particle contaminants they’re highperformance and enable acoustically rich experiences for any application – from smartphones and wearables to internet of things iot devices and connected automobiles what we do technology changes but the natural human preference for communicating by voice is constant as the number of electronic devices in our world grows our need for natural communication is even greater and whether we are communicating with people or machines the quality and reliability of the voice interface becomes increasingly critical microphones are the gateway between the digital world and the natural world of human voice vesper’ mission is to dramatically improve the reliability of the voice user interface for smartphones smart speakers connected automobiles and any connected device using our proprietary piezoelectric mems technology invented by our founders at the university of michigan the piezoelectric difference vesper piezoelectric microphones operate on a completely different physical principle from all other mems and electret condenserstyle audio devices using the piezoelectric effect first discovered by jacques and pierre curie vesper’s mems microphones directly convert sound wave energy into an electrical signal beyond just delivering an excellent signaltonoise ratio snr vesper microphones are stably matched making them uniquely suited for large array applications in smartphones tablets smart home devices and other connected products vesper’s are the most durable waterproof shockproof and both dust and
