engineering date friday february  0   pm location mcdonnell douglas engineering auditorium chems seminar prof blaine pfeifer department of chemical and biological engineering the state university of new york at buffalo   using experience and insight gained from previous attempts at producing complex natural products through heterologous hosts this presentation will describe new initiatives to access and evaluate the chemicals encoded by responsible genetic pathways  the basis for the work presented is the production of compounds associated with the polyketide nonribosomal peptide and isoprenoid classifications  the heterologous production processes for these molecule types has presented challenges in metabolic engineering to provide precursor biosynthetic support gene expression to account for the coordinated production of multiple enzymes dedicated to biosynthesis and analytical chemistry to assess intermediate and final product levels  addressing each challenge is now positioning new technology to better access and test the capabilities of complex natural products by using heterologous biosynthesis       bio dr pfeifer earned his bs degree in chemical engineering from colorado state university in   he earned ms degree in  and phd degree in  both in chemical engineering from stanford university  he is an associate professor in sunnybuffalo since 0 share

or electric he chose electric and asked the teacher if he could build a heathkit radio rather than the simpler crystal radio the other kids were making he followed the instructions with soldering iron in hand connecting a to b b to c and so on burning himself several times in the process at the end of the semester he brought his radio to class five vacuum tubes on board and a dial to tune in different stations the radio was designed to receive am fm and shortwave signals he plugged it in sound came out the experience forever changed his life the radio he built with his own hands worked but henry samueli had no idea why ‘connecting everything’ samueli finds it difficult to disconnect the inbox is open fullscreen on the computer in his modest corner office but that’s just a start he’s always plugged in whether in london at the olympics or his owner’s box at a ducks game even on safari in africa samueli’s hotels have wifi and the villages he visits are covered by at least g cell service and at home every day and every place he goes from the moment he wakes up until he goes to bed at night his phone is with him connected “that’s my life” samueli says “that’s all i do all day” he is not the only one for the first time internetconnected handhelds are outselling phones that make only calls and send text messages in other words everyone is becoming just as connected as the billionaire cofounder chief technical officer and chairman of the board at broadcom corp it’s his own fault in  samueli and another inquisitive engineer henry nicholas cofounded broadcom their goal was simple connect everything and they did the company started by doing something revolutionary at the time – connecting computers to the internet at previously impossible speeds the slow dialup voice modems of the day were quickly replaced by fast cable modems powered by broadcom’s chips initially broadcom’s world – cable modem connectivity – was more expensive than old loud glacially slow dialup but as dialup connections got cheaper and even after they became free computer users – ie virtually every human on earth – wanted the speed provided by samueli and nicholas movies downloaded in minutes songs played in seconds websites loaded instantly a whole new interactive internet was born and in the next decade connectedness went wireless leaping from the home and office to every single person’s pocket the pace of this revolution surprised even its leaders “fifteen years ago we didn’t really have an appreciation we would reach a point everyone would have multimegabit connections with them at all times” samueli says “you don’t really know what the impact is going to be on society” but a few years ago – for a brief period – the pace might’ve been too quick in  samueli was investigated for allegedly partipating in the backdating of  billion worth of stock options issued to broadcom employees within a year under investigation by the securities and exchange commission samueli temporarily stepped away from key positions at broadcom eventually criminal charges against samueli and nicholas were thrown out the sec dropped its civil case and samueli resumed his current active roles at broadcom but during that period samueli’s company seemed to make a misstep broadcom’s connectivity chips weren’t in the first iphone which debuted in  “i don’t know if anybody thought about how much impact the iphone could have on society” samueli says “i was caught by surprise by the iphone quite frankly” since then that’s changed broadcom’s chips were in the past four generations of iphone as well as ipad and most of apple’s other products they’re in the guts of many apple competitors too samueli doesn’t see the need for faster speeds and more connectivity ever abating the next decade might see the “internet of things” with connectivity spreading from every person to everything from your car to your toilet “for better or worse we truly are now always connected” samueli says “there are obviously pluses and minuses to such extreme connectivity but i think the pluses outweigh the minuses” ‘always thinking’ in the late 0s susan samueli was a rarity a woman with the word “engineer” in her job title she worked as a systems engineer at ibm she suspects it’s why henry samueli liked her when in  they met at a jewish singles dance he was tall she was tall he was shy she wasn’t and she asked him to dance she also jokes that her ownership of ibm’s first personal computer also in  was a reason for their marriage henry would use that computer to test programs that would run all night one day in the late ’0s samueli came home from work to his wife and young children – and a computer that was missing its keyboard “i wanted him to spend more time with the kids” susan samueli says adding that she eventually gave it back because henry was moping around but such tricks couldn’t always bring henry back even before broadcom built a world of nonstop connectivity samueli seemed connected to problem solving and that’s still true there isn’t a moment his mind isn’t on engineering in midconversation susan samueli sometimes has to bring him back to the subject at hand during a twohour car ride with his wife samueli can be quiet his mind fully occupied on workrelated problems “there’s always something to focus on” he says a silicon chip is composed of hundreds of millions or even billions of tiny transistors each is basically an onoff switch the task for chip designers is to connect these switches together to perform some function – a simple computation like two plus two equals four or advanced algorithms that turn a tv signal into blazing fast internet access samueli compares the engineering of such chips to telling a designer to build not just a house or a building or a street but instead to build an entire city – in a single shot “you need to be a very meticulous detailedoriented person which i am” he said “i’m a perfectionist and that’s served me very well in my career it allows me to handle these large complex problems without letting things fall through the cracks … that is the mentality you have to have to attack these complex problems of chip design for example when you’re overwhelmed with complexity “you have to come up with a very structured way of managing complexity” that day with the radio in th grade sparked an “intense curiosity to figure out how it worked” henry samueli said it set him on a mission to become an electrical engineer “you can’t believe something like that is working that you put it together” he said “how is this thing working” that curiosity drove samueli – a son of holocaust survivors who owned a liquor store in los angeles – to go to college at ucla while there he was pursuing his doctorate in electrical engineering even before completing his undergraduate work he took the first graduatelevel digital signal processing class from alan willson an engineer and researcher from bell labs who would eventually become samueli’s mentor when samueli began to pursue a phd – in his case a dissertation about an engineeringrelated math problem — willson offered samueli a possible path toward a solution but samueli dismissed his mentor’s idea it wouldn’t work he spent years figuring out a different way to solve the problem “when you’re diligent and you explore all the different avenues and… “ at this samueli snaps his fingers “just magically it happens” “for me it’s almost a  process” he said “it’s not like i only think when i’m in the office sitting at my desk “i think all the time” marconi prize henry samueli  figured out a long time ago why his radio worked he’s figured out how and why a lot of things work in his office among all the awards and achievements near some books on electrical engineering from his college days a certificate commemorates samueli’s 0th patent soon a new award will join the rest on sept  he will be given the prestigious marconi prize named after the inventor of the radio guglielmo marconi the marconi comes with a 0 award but more importantly samueli joins an engineering pantheon of sorts by winning it previous marconi winners include the inventors of the internet and the founders of google among others samueli will give the 0 to charity dispatching it to causes that support science technology engineering and math education it’s a process he knows well samueli and his wife have given away more than 0 million to causes as disparate as education alternative medicine and the jewish community the man worth  billion has pledged to give at least half his money to charity in his lifetime when samueli gets the marconi he’ll be introduced by his former teacher willson the speech will come after a day of presentations about the future of technology vint cerf google’s chief “internet evangelist” and a fellow marconi winner will talk about the future of social networking larry smarr founding director at the calit research institute will explore “life chips” aka using the internet to track every bodily function samueli himself will give a speech about the kinds of chips expected to be designed in the coming decades but at the end of the technology speeches willson will talk about samueli “he was in the right place at the right time” willson says “and the right guy” contact the writer  or ihamiltonocregistercom get
