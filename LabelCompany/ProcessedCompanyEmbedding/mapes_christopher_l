over to chris mapes chris christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you vince and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today moving to slide three im pleased to report that we finished  with record results and operating income margin on an adjusted basis earnings working capital and cash flow performance we did this even with relatively flat sales reflecting uneven market conditions a challenging yearoveryear comparison from our venezuelan business and rising foreign exchange headwinds we also increased returns with a  roic up  basis points yearoveryear and returned approximately  of our cash flow from operations or a record  million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we feel these results give us continued confidence in our  vision and strategy and our ability to execute on the plan so i would like to thank our employees partners and customers around the world for another solid year for lincoln electric moving to slide four which highlights key income statement items reported fullyear  sales declined  to  billion gains from our automation acquisitions and from pricing actions were offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and lower unit volumes volume weakness was predominantly in south america in our venezuelan operation and from weak export sales from our north american segment reflecting slowing or delayed project activity in key international regions despite these challenges we achieved solid results in key areas we achieved solid organic growth in north america excluding exports which reflect solid demand for our innovative solutions from both our commercial and industrial customers as well as benefits from the ongoing recovery in the domestic market in north america consumable and equipment demand remained strong most of the year and we achieved record results from the launch of our new power mig  welder which has been a breakthrough new product in the light industrial and commercial segment additionally our recent automation acquisitions burlington automation and easom automation are exceeding plan and we are excited about the growth opportunities in structural steel and heavy fabrication that these engineered solutions offer the company longterm we also achieved good unit volume growth in europe driven by a strong increase in equipment volumes in  following the successful launch of our nextgeneration equipment platform in europe and finally our harris products group achieved volume growth in  on strong equipment sales moving to profitability we achieved increases in both gross profit and operating income margins on an adjusted basis due largely to improve mix and steady cost control excluding venezuelan operations our adjusted operating margin would have increased  basis points versus the prioryear this increase reflects favorable product in geographic mix and the benefits of our internal initiatives and productivity improvements moving down the page we reported diluted earnings per share of  in  which includes the unfavorable impact of a  million rationalization and asset impairment charge primarily related to a planned divestiture of manufacturing capacity in the asiapacific welding segment adjusted eps increased to  compared with  in  we consider our adjusted eps performance be good given the challenging comparison we faced from the  eps contribution generated by our venezuelan business in  excluding our venezuelan results  adjusted eps would have increased  to  reflecting solid operational execution and the benefit of our share repurchase program moving to slide five which highlights end sectors we serve over the course of the year we saw general improvement across most of the end sectors notably in the rail portion of heavy fabrication and in transportation and automotive we also saw a positive uptick in long challenged areas such as shipbuilding and structural applications this general improvement was a positive trend given the extended flat to declining demand trends we experienced across some of our end markets for several quarters while you note that the energy sector stayed reasonably strong for  we do expect contraction in  as lower oil prices begin to impact capital projects in up and midstream sectors which we estimate represent approximately  of our consolidated sales while still in early stages nonresidential construction or structural appears to continue to pick up activity while we expect to see some slight moderation in the heavy fabrication sector as construction machinery should be steady to flat while ag equipment is expected to contract slightly yearoveryear lastly we continue to remain cautious on any substantial improvement in the mining sector for  we remain focused on executing our  initiatives as we continue to emphasize engineered valueadded solutions as part of our  plan we are investing in advancing our automation portfolio this includes not only an active acquisition program but also broadening our automation portfolio to serve a wider base of users this now includes solutions for the novice entry level user with our simplified turnkey automate solution to leveraging unique capabilities offered by our burlington automation and easom automation acquisitions to further penetrate the lincoln brand in structural steel applications and in heavy fabrication automation another area of growth is in equipment and in alloys area where lincoln already has strong positions and where we are extending our international markets and applications and lastly we are focused on richening our mix across product areas and geographies as we target achieving higher operating income margins by  operationally we continue to reposition our asiapacific platform to support engineered valueadded solutions in areas such as equipment automation and alloys as well as productivity programs and improved processes across our global footprint which will continue to deliver incremental efficiencies in  and beyond we are also driving cost out of the business with our new centers of excellence such as our new printed circuit board manufacturing platform here in cleveland ohio where centralized production and economies of scale are providing us with a competitive advantage these efforts combined with the hundreds of lean projects and ehs initiatives are expected to drive  performance above prioryear achievements the lincoln electric business model and our global systems are continuing to drive value for our shareholders so ill wrapup by saying that we are executing with confidence we have solid momentum from  and are executing on initiatives pacing to plan and are looking forward to another strong year of product innovations higher returns and delivering ongoing value for all of our stakeholders and now ill pass the call to vince to cover our segments financial performance balance sheet items and uses of cash in more detail vince vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer thank you chris we finished the year strongly by continuing to improve the quality of our earnings in the face of a challenging topline environment and global economic uncertainty turning to slide seven you will see that our consolidated sales were down  compared with the fourth quarter of  volume decreased reported sales by  and acquisitions increased sales by  foreign exchange had a  negative impact on sales in the fourth quarter excluding the challenging comparisons from our venezuelan business volumes were flat on a yearoveryear basis our fourth quarter gross profit margins decreased slightly to  compared with  in the comparable prioryear period lifo credits in the quarter totaled  million compared with the lifo credit of  million in the prioryears fourth quarter the slight decrease in gross margins was primarily caused by lower volumes and a contraction in our venezuelan business excluding venezuela and special items from both periods gross margin would have been  in  and  in  our sga expense as a percentage of sales for the fourth quarter increased  basis points contributing to the increase in sga expenses were higher foreign exchange transaction losses increased incentive compensation costs and sga related to recent acquisitions operating income for the quarter decreased  basis points venezuela contributed  to adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of  compared with  million of adjusted operating income in the comparable prioryear period excluding our venezuelan operations from both years fourth quarters would have resulted in operating margins of  in  and  in  interest expense increased  million in the quarter mostly due to additional accruals associated with contingent consideration related to a recent acquisition the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was  compared with  in the prioryear the primary factors driving this lower effective tax rate were the renewal of the rd tax credit and the favorable resolution of tax litigation our  effective tax rate should increase into the highs subject to the mix of earnings by jurisdiction our diluted earnings per share decreased  for the fourth quarter compared with the prioryear this decline reflects the yearoveryear effect from our venezuelan operations the prioryears adjusted diluted earnings per share include  per share from our venezuelan operations in the fourth quarter of  venezuelan operations were breakeven in the fourth quarter of  if venezuelan results and special items were excluded from both periods our adjusted eps would have increased over  now moving to the geographical segments on slide eight our north american welding segment improved adjusted ebit margins by  basis points in the fourth quarter higher volumes and improved mix and good cost control drove the increase in europe our adjusted ebit margin improved  basis points in the quarter the increase was attributable to improved mix and operational improvements our volumes were slow across the continent but the middle east had a very strong quarter the asiapacific segment produced a  adjusted ebit margin in the fourth quarter after a breakeven position in the prioryear sales in asiapacific were down  due to volume the volume decreases were generally caused by the continued softness in china as well as our ongoing repositioning of the portfolio there south america welding was breakeven for the quarter because of the significant contraction in our venezuelan operations the volume decrease again was primarily experienced in venezuela south american segment does include  million in  and  million in  in sales from venezuela and adjusted ebit of  in  and  million in s fourth quarter the harris products group expanded fourth quarter ebit margins by  basis points pricing decreased because of lower metals cost primarily sliver volumes improved across both the equipment and consumable product categories with equipment positing a doubledigit increase from the prioryear our cash flow from operations increased  million in the quarter primarily from the receipt of a significant portion of a tax refund our net operating working capital to sales improved to a record  compared with  at the prioryear end fullyear operating cash flows increased to a record  million from  million achieved during  during the quarter we paid cash dividends of  million which resulted in dividend payments for the fullyear of  million and our dividend payout rate was increased by  for the first quarter  payment we spent  million for capital expenditures in  our current  capital spending plan is estimated at  million to  million primarily associated with significant reinvestment projects in our north american business during the fourth quarter we spent  million repurchasing about  shares for treasury for the year we spent  million on share repurchases for a total share repurchase of  million shares we have now targeted  million for share repurchases in  we ended the year with  million of cash on our balance sheet and  million of debt we will continue to invest in the business for the longterm and prudently return cash to our shareholders now just a couple of comments on our  outlook as you know the us dollar has strengthened significantly during the last half of  and into  this us dollar strengthening will negatively impact our  reported revenue and earnings based on  yearend exchange rates and assuming no additional significant movements in the us dollar for the remainder of this year we expect an estimated mid singledigit headwind to both revenue and earnings from foreign exchange translations in  with that i would like to turn the call over for questions syed questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from schon williams from bbt capital markets your line is open please go ahead c schon williams  bbt capital markets hi good morning vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer good morning schon christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning schon c schon williams  bbt capital markets i wonder if we could maybe start with asiapacific thats been a region thats been targeted for restructuring and obviously you made some significant progress in the margin profile this quarter can you just talk about whats still left to be done in asiapacific if anything and then what can be expectations as we move into  could we start to see more kind of mid singledigit margins more consistently out of this segment christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer schon this is chris look i think that we were happy with the initial results from some of the activities from the strategies were trying to drive in that particular segment im certainly looking for expansion of equipment sales and some automation work in that region but i still view that  will be a pretty transitional year for us in china as we execute on those strategies so again very happy that were seeing some of the impact although that impact is off a small base really hoping that in  we can continue down that path in execution on those strategies continue to show the improvements were looking forward in that business but i still expect that  will have some choppiness to it and really probably just want to continue to see the execution of the strategies the improvements but i dont think were going to have a significant shift in that model in  c schon williams  bbt capital markets okay and then are you still trying to divest some assets in that region vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer yes we have a facility that is for sale in the region today c schon williams  bbt capital markets okay thank you and then maybe just a followup on the interest expense jump it sounds like that may be related to the i guess to the easom acquisition you said to a recent acquisition could we just talk about exactly what that is and when would that potentially get paid out and then maybe as a followup the acquisition revenue is certainly above my expectations can you talk about exactly – you mentioned maybe slightly better than expectations out of some of the automation can you just talk about whats really moving the needle is it easom is it revolution is it burlington is it all of the above just some comments around what youre seeing on volume trends and automation would be helpful vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer hey schon ill start with the accounting for contingent consideration on acquisitions so were required to update our forecasts of the sales and earnings of an acquisition that weve executed on in the previous year that will determine the final contingent consideration thats paid and those payments will occur over the next couple of years as we move through our contract agreement with the target company and that – will class b – the significant change in the fourth quarter was classified within the interest expense line item and thats where adjustments will be made in the future related to that acquisition in terms of our automation business all the acquisitions are performing in line with our expectations we have good results coming out of our burlington acquisition in canada and our us acquisitions have performed well since weve acquired them over the course of the past two or three years so were pleased with the progress that were making we look forward to continuing to integrate those businesses within the lincoln electric platform to continue to drive higher growth trajectories on a global basis so were very pleased with that strategy where we stand today c schon williams  bbt capital markets all right thanks guys ill get back in the queue vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from mark douglass from longbow research your line is open please go ahead mark douglass  longbow research llc hi good morning everyone christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning mark vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer good morning mark douglass  longbow research llc can you discuss the underlying trends in north america both equipment and consumables and what were the exports what was the export number in the quarter vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer yeah so exports were down on a yearoveryear basis by about  for the fullyear we were down about  and exports yearoveryear out of the us from a product category standpoint weve seen a bit more strength on the equipment side of our business than on the consumables side but our domestic business was up mid singledigits in the fourth quarter compared to the prioryear so were seeing some greater strength domestically than were seeing in the export markets and its largely been a little bit better on the equipment side than consumables christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah mark as you would expect we continue to see real strength in the heavy fabrication side especially on the rail portion of heavy fab transportation and automotive has stayed strong and as much as were concerned about the potential impacts of the recent shift in oil pricing in the marketplace especially here in north america we havent seen a lot of that within the business certainly in the fourth quarter so i think again it just shows the continued improvements in the general north american economies and certainly lincoln participating significantly in that space mark douglass  longbow research llc but i think if i look at the slides general fab was mediocre kind of low growth in north america given the relatively strong pmi can you square that circle christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer my only comment mark would be look out for us in that particular data point we didnt see general fab having much strength for us within our portfolio but again seeing the strengths in the other area wouldnt necessarily identify that as a longterm trend but within our business portfolio the way we looked at it within the quarter we saw general fab as smallish mark douglass  longbow research llc okay and then just lastly you mentioned oil and – let me just clarify oil and gas is  of total sales or was that just upstream and midstream or is that all of the above vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer thats correct thats what we would define as upstream midstream thats going to be more largely exposed to the oil price declines mark douglass  longbow research llc is that mostly in north america for you vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer no thats global but north america has – certainly its share of oil exposure in line with its relative size for the total corporation so the bulk of our oil and gas – or oil exposure would be north america simply because of its size relative to the consolidated group mark douglass  longbow research llc okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from rob wertheimer from vertical research your line is open please go ahead rob c wertheimer  vertical research partners llc thank you good morning christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer morning rob c wertheimer  vertical research partners llc lets see i think i heard the headwind to revenue earnings from fx im not sure i heard a growth range for  i think you gave one last year i dont know if you have an outlook youre willing to share on revenue growth in total christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer we wouldnt provide that kind of an outlook at this point in time we would say that the year  has started out relatively flattish with the prioryear so thats maybe the best that we can give you at this point in time rob c wertheimer  vertical research partners llc thats perfect thank you and then just in general the comment on midstream is that customer feedback youre hearing that it might be weaker or industry projections or whats the source of thinking that the weakness in upstream which is pretty obvious i suppose will fully come into midstream vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer weve simply looked at the customers in those categories and looked at what they are saying about their capex and spending trends for  and consider upstream and midstream to be the areas that are going to be most affected by the price of oil in  rob c wertheimer  vertical research partners llc okay thanks ill get back in line operator thank you our next question comes from steve barger from keybanc capital your line is open please go ahead steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc hey good morning christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer morning steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc vince you called out that mid singledigit headwind for revenue for  from fx you also talked about contraction in energy can you point to any positive revenue offsets or are you thinking mid singledigit revenue decline is kind of best case for  given what you see right now vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer from a positive standpoint we think our north american business domestically will continue to do well we think certain product segments that chris outlined a little earlier in his comments including automotive should remain strong for the bulk of the year we see good momentum in nonres construction or what we might refer to as structural we see some pockets of strength from a geographical standpoint but we do know that the foreign currency translations based on where current exchange rates are will have that negative impact on the business as well as the often discussed oil price impact on capex expenditures so there certainly are bright spots during the course of  but we also see a mixed type of environment from an outlook perspective this year christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer steve i would also add that we expect to see continued improvement in our harris business in  and one of the values of our investments and execution in the automation portfolio is that we believe strongly that business has the ability to grow at a much faster base than the global core welding market and that business with its current concentration in the north american market does not have a heavy concentration of oil and gas exposure so im also expecting continued improvement in our automation businesses as we move through  steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc to that point you guys have done a great job of reducing inventory as a percentage of revenue if revenue is flat to slightly down next year can you get inventory below the current  million and is that decline that weve seen really a function of the revenue mix towards more services vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer well the answer to your first question is yes we expect to continue to improve our working capital metrics over the long term part of that lower  million inventory number is caused by foreign currency translations as well as the lower requirements in the automation business but we have as part of our performance metrics working capital measure and were very focused on freeing up cash out of our working capital for investing in the business or returning that cash to shareholders so we expect continuous improvement and we will set targets that require that continuous improvements into the future steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc so your  operating cash flow target is presumably better than the  million you ended up this year with or  with vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer we expect continuous improvement in our business steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc got it and one more and ill get back in line you talked about the capex reinvestment in north american business what are the priority projects there and what do you expect to gain from them christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer well first id say two things steve one is weve invested an enormous amount of capital over the last two years or three years as weve been executing on the strategy examples like the new print circuit board manufacturing facility that we have here in our cleveland operations so weve deployed a lot of capital over the last couple of years that were executing on today and certainly should see the benefits from that i would say our focus on capital as were moving into the year is we have some areas of our business that we need to expand some capacity to meet some of the needs the demands globally were also looking at a couple of new product development initiatives that may require some capital were increasing although not capital the expense in our rd area to continue to try to drive more solutions to the marketplace so as we look into  i think the first is continuing to execute on the capital we have deployed and then capital that we will be deploying in automation and some new product initiatives that we have moving into  steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc very good ill get back in line thanks operator our next question comes from tom hayes from northcoast research your line is open please go ahead tom lloyd hayes  northcoast research partners llc thanks good morning gentlemen vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer morning tom tom lloyd hayes  northcoast research partners llc hey i was just wondering if maybe we could talk a little bit about south america now that weve kind of washed venezuela through i was just wondering what are your thoughts on the outlook and the opportunity in south america going through  christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer well this is chris i think  is going to be a pretty challenged window for our south american businesses so those businesses from an overall revenue percentage are smallest of the total corporation but brazil is a very significant and strategic market for us we like some of the strategic initiatives were building into that marketplace and some of the capabilities not only with our core products and technologies but also with the greenfield automation facility that we placed down into brazil but the brazilian economy has its challenges right now as well as some challenges associated with oil and gas in that marketplace with some governmental issues that are going on with the stateowned enterprise so were just expecting as we look at that marketplace in  that that will be one of the challenges that we have in the portfolio we like our strategy we like our management team we are certainly committed to the brazilian business over the longerterm but dont have great expectations for there being any significant changes as it relates to financial performance in  tom lloyd hayes  northcoast research partners llc okay great and then maybe as a followup please what are your thoughts on the ability to achieve pricing gains in  maybe specifically in kind of the north american market vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer tom as weve talked about in the past pricing has a number of dynamics that affect the ability to move prices and those dynamics include the strength of the underlying demand in the portfolio the input costs that are either rising or falling in the current environment as well as your portfolio positioning in any particular geography that youre doing business in the way that i see our environment now is going to be relatively stable with maybe the potential for slight pricing but nothing significant either way tom lloyd hayes  northcoast research partners llc good thank you operator our next question comes from joe mondillo from sidoti  company your line is open please go ahead joe l mondillo  sidoti  co llc hi guys good morning christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer morning joe l mondillo  sidoti  co llc i just wanted to talk about the european segment just for a bit i know  was a pretty good year certainly on the margin side of things and i think you guys called out that there was potentially sort of a mix issue regarding stronger equipment sales i think in  if you can verify that but just looking at the margin improvement that you saw over  im just wondering how youre looking at  do you think thats sort of sustainable in what you saw in  regarding the margin there christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer we do believe the margin is sustainable in our european business as we move into  so we launched an upgraded equipment profile and some new technologies in the equipment space in europe at the global essen show in late  started to execute on bringing those products to market throughout  and still have some opportunities to expand portions of that product portfolio in the marketplace we also believe our european business should be able to continue to show the type of market share gains its been showing in the european market its performed very well over the last  months and  months and were expecting continued performance from our european business so i think were doing a very nice job executing on our strategies its really beyond equipment weve also got some new alloys that were moving into the marketplace in europe and really believe that that business has made nice step change and looking for continued improvement with that business certainly though one of the challenges that we have in europe are the geopolitical issues centered around greece and russia and just my expectations is as we think about  are really without any significant changes to those particular issues in that economy joe l mondillo  sidoti  co llc so to sustain those margins that you saw in  are you modeling in or do you need to see volume growth to sustain those or can you manage some sort of a volume headwind if the markets turn badly christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer we believe that we can maintain those margins without any volume leverage in the current business model joe l mondillo  sidoti  co llc okay great all right thanks a lot thats all for me operator thank you our next question comes from jason rodgers from great lakes review your line is open please go ahead jason a rodgers  great lakes review good morning i wonder if you could talk about the hardfacing thermal spray market and ma opportunities you might be seeing there christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer well we certainly have expanded into the hardfacing technologies lincoln has been in hardfacing technology for decades but you saw us make a moment last year with some licensing technology from nanosteel which expanded the portfolio of highend technologies on the hardfacing space so certainly one way to apply hardfacing is through a thermal spray application so thats a viable alternative from a process perspective into that space our commitment is that we see hardfacing as a very intriguing market a market we participate in that we like to expand our capabilities and with that we look at the various options both from a process as well as a product technology as we continue to execute on our  vision strategy longerterm jason a rodgers  great lakes review and then youd mentioned so far in  kind of flattish performance would that be including foreign exchange impacts vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer yes that would jason a rodgers  great lakes review okay and then finally are you seeing any benefits or do you expect to see benefits from lower steel pricing vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer well its too early to really talk about what the impact of some lower steel prices might be at this point in time but certainly were seeing some moderation and pricing in that environment and i wouldnt want to make any predictions at this point on what steel prices do on average during the course of  jason a rodgers  great lakes review thank you operator our next question comes from stanley elliott from stifel your line is open please go ahead stanley s elliott  stifel nicolaus  co inc great good morning everyone and thank you for taking my question a quick question on europe and i apologize if you already said this but the volumes being down  was that more reflective of whats happening in russia where you could say that some of the new product platforms you have in germany and elsewhere were actually obviously better than that christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah a portion of those volume contractions that we saw were related to our ability to move products into the russian marketplace from our european businesses stanley s elliott  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and turning to the balance sheet and i guess the pension outlook what are your thoughts on kind of debt levels where youd like to be by the end of the year any new thoughts by the board on what to do with the overfunded pension plan thank you vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer well as far as the pension plan is concerned we did finish the year slightly underfunded in our pension plan stanley as interest rates moved down relatively significantly during the course of  as the use of a new mortality table that was required by the american association of actuaries drove up our obligation we did fall to a slightly underfunded position as far as our debt is concerned we will continue to follow our previously announced capital allocation strategy which means we will spend  million on share buybacks this year we will pay a dividend that is  higher rate than the prioryear we will also invest  million to  million in capex and we take whatever opportunities we believe are appropriately priced and fit our strategy in the ma side at the end of the day our cash flows will be ample but we would expect that our investment plans will likely require some additional debt raising over and above how we ended the year with  million of debt whatever we do in  however will be i believe relatively modest when we look at the capital structure in the balance sheet of lincoln electric with over  million of ebitda and significant equity in the business so itll be a modest change in respect of the total capital structure of a lincoln electric stanley s elliott  stifel nicolaus  co inc thank you operator next question comes from justin bergner from gabelli  company your line is open please go ahead justin l bergner  gresearch inc good morning and thank you for taking my questions christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer morning justin l bergner  gresearch inc my first question relates to fx i believe you mentioned that there would be a mid singledigit headwind to revenue and earnings related to fx translation is there an additional impact on the transactional side given sort of the cost and revenue geographic split in your business vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer there isnt an impact that i would be able to estimate for you at this time justin i will tell you that lincoln electric very actively and in a sophisticated way hedges all transaction risks to the corporation so we attempt to mitigate any moves in foreign exchange rates with an active hedging program so i wouldnt predict at this point in time that wed have any higher or lower for that matter foreign exchange losses borne by the business justin l bergner  gresearch inc okay thank you another question i had relates to your acquisition revenue contribution in north america was there a margin headwind in the fourth quarter associated with the revenue growth from acquisitions and if so could you quantify that vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer no there wasnt the acquisitions in the fourth quarter contributed margins in line with our consolidated group total so there was no disadvantage from the acquisitions in the fourth quarter justin l bergner  gresearch inc okay thank you and then lastly with respect to revenue growth that youre seeing in your markets yeartodate would you be willing to sort of add some color on how north america is tracking yeartodate vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer i would tell you that north america is similar what we said as far as the group is concerned its relatively flattish type of environment in january so far justin l bergner  gresearch inc thank you for taking all my questions this morning vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer youre welcome justin operator thank you weve a followup question from schon williams from bbt capital markets your line is open please go ahead c schon williams  bbt capital markets hi guys i wonder if you could just comment are you seeing any impact from the slowdown on the ports on the west coast is that impacting either components coming into north america or product going outside of north america christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer its not impacting us relatively to there being any detrimental impact to the performance of the company although we have been having to make some adjustments to our supply chain models to look at potential reroutes or other transportation vehicles to be able to continue to be able to receive the components and raw materials that were looking for as well as our exporting strategy so we see the challenges associated with port issues on the west coast today were managing those issues and do not expect there to be any detrimental financial or operational impact from that c schon williams  bbt capital markets okay and then just a little housekeeping i think the last call you mentioned youre expecting some potential refund from the canadian government on a tax issue can you just give us an update on where that stands vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer yes we received over  million of that refund during the course of the fourth quarter and weve received notice that the remaining c million will be received in the first quarter of this year so  of refund we expect to be received by the end of the first quarter  c schon williams  bbt capital markets perfect thanks guys operator thank you and we have a followup question from steve barger from keybanc capital your line is open please go ahead steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc yeah just one quick followup can you talk about how much energy contributed to volume growth in  or maybe what you expect for the rate of contraction in  christopher l mapes  chairman president  chief executive officer steve this is chris i would not say that energy was a huge contributor to the volume relative to  and as it relates to the expectation of the contraction were certainly aware that its going to be a headwind for us and were certainly talking to our customers and channel partners the other side of that contraction is that those consumer dollars that might be saved at the pump are going to migrate their way somewhere within the economy and whether those will move into automotive or appliance or some other spaces that might provide us an additional lift within those segments so at this point in time in the cycle its just difficult for us to place an estimate on the level of headwind that we may see from that space in  hopefully well see a little more clarity of that as move through the year steve barger  keybanc capital markets inc understood thank you operator im showing no further questions at this time gentlemen vincent k petrella  executive vice president chief financial officer  treasurer thank you syed and thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest in lincoln electric again our fourth quarter and fullyear record results demonstrate the companys ability to execute on improving its operations for more profitable growth even in a challenging market condition we believe that we continue to be wellpositioned in  to take advantage of the opportunities that are available in the marketplace and we expect our competitive advantages to drive a continuing earnings and cash flow growth through the cycle thank you again for joining us today
