httpwwwyumcom ■ david c novak was the chairman and ceo of yum brands an independent publicly owned fastfood franchiser that in  was made up of six subsidiaries organized around five core restaurants pizza hut kfc taco bell long john silvers and aw allamerican food pizza hut kfc taco bell and long john silvers were the global leaders in the quickservice pizza chicken mexican and seafood categories respectively serving its signature frostymug root beer drinks since  aw allamerican food was the longestoperating quickservice us franchise chain due greatly to novaks creative management and organizational style yum brands global sales totaled more than  billion in  from pepsico to tricon to yum brands novak started his career in the advertising field holding leadership positions over a year period primarily with the david c novak john chiassongetty images  advertising agency traceylocke bbdo now tlp tracey locke partnership there he eventually reached the position of executive vice president as which he supervised client relationships including those with pepsico and fritolay novak later held similar positions at pizza hut pepsico and kfc starting in  he became senior vice president of marketing at pizza hut reaching the same position at pepsico in  in  he became chief operating officer of pepsicola north america novak became president of kfcs north american operations in  and group president and ceo of the north american operations of both kfc and pizza hut in  he became president and vice chairman of the board at tricon global restaurants when it came into existence on october   as a result of a spinoff from pepsico which had owned and franchised the kfc pizza hut and taco bell brands worldwide novak served in these capacities until december  novak at the helm novak was named the chief executive officer of tricon global restaurants in january  succeeding tricons first ceo andy pearson a year later on january   novak became tricons chairman during pearsons time as ceo he and novak worked together closely in focusing on three main goals to correct the management problems left over from the companys time under pepsico to increase the competitiveness of its four operating companies and to capitalize on opportunities for multibranding international growth and increased scale during this time span first under pearson and later under novak tricons performance dramatically increased with respect to profit and sales growth debt payment margin improvement return on investment and employee commitment in fact novaks excellent grasp of the nature of the ceo position allowed pearson to bring him up to the top management spot earlier than had been expected pearson called novak a driving force behind tricons great performance—with a remarkable grasp of the companys business outstanding skills as a conceptual management leader and superior operating expertise appropriately in a  press release upon stepping down from the top position pearson said of novak david is the most effective leader i have ever worked with november   uniting a new company novak immediately faced an ominous challenge in uniting the global fastfood brands of kfc pizza hut and taco bell the three individual companies were floundering and just as seriously were mutually suspicious of each others management styles by utilizing the same peoplefriendly attitude qualityservice standards comprehensive vision and product innovations that he had used to help turn kfc around in the mids novak took and molded the three restaurants into a cohesive partnership with division leaders who cooperated with rather than competed against one another novak was able to transform the company with regards to its franchisee relationships in retrospect novak was considered to be the mastermind and architect of tricons successful and profitable onesystem company in the first five years following the spinoff tricon increased systemwide sales by  percent more than doubling operating earnings per share and improved return on invested capital by  percentage points hypercompetitive and generous novaks skillful management tactics were credited with influencing the cultural shift that was eventually incorporated into tricon he was characterized as wearing many hats during the changeover those of captain friend mentor politician and team player novak was described by many observers as a man so hypercompetitive that he frequently went for the jugular when urgency called for such action as quoted in an article in brandweek  john neal the president of jrn who operated one hundred kfc units said of novak he is one of the most competitive leaders that i have ever sat across the table from he will beat you whether in golf poker or basketball he just isnt going to lose october   novaks competitiveness however was grounded in a leadership style that was also generous when it came to recognizing and rewarding individuals who had performed well rather than dictating the manner in which work should be done novak used a buyin approach to accomplish projects with a team attitude in  when he was working exclusively for kfc he used one thousand autographed rubber chickens to generate employee supplier and manager support around a new employeerecognition program pizza hut and taco bell then instituted their own employeerecognition programs centered around the big cheese and the royal order of the pepper awards respectively such concepts according to novak helped company employees create positive experiences each and every time a customer entered their restaurants novak remarked that these tactics which he constantly reinforced had far greater longterm impact on brand perceptions than even television advertisements in general novak called this approach customer mania saying that it improved the method with which each restaurant interacted with its customers and put a yum on their faces all around the world yumcom yum brands created in march  tricon declared that it would be acquiring the lexington kentucky–based yorkshire global restaurants as well as its two brands long john silvers and aw

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
