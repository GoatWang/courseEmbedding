john has made a career of representing “the little guy” ordinary people against large institutions and insurance companies for  years john has practiced personal injury litigation — almost all of them representing regular people against whichever goliath crosses their path oddly enough it is his desire that the regular people of tamarack be protected that draws him to seek a position on the board – that is to say that for john protection of the homeowners in their dealings with the tma is as important as protecting the tma in its dealings with its own goliaths  john brings a unique set of skills and knowledge to the board he is an excellent communicator understanding that honest open communication results in satisfaction in each process for example he understands what information is important as well as the importance of how it is presented to those adverse that allows them to justify resolution of disputes over the course of years he has developed relationships founded on experience and trust with those whom he opposes professionally one of the biggest sources of john’s new clients are the very lawyers and adjustors whom he opposes daily john spent  years teaching law related courses at boise state university and uses his teaching and persuasion skills to help adverse parties and companies develop a full understanding of arguments or positions of his clients john holds firm to the belief that the vast majority of disputes when properly presented result in an informed resolution without litigation john’s background provides insight into his approach to helping others he remains active in his community through memberships and participation in service youth athletic and professional organizations he graduated from vallivue high school in what was then very rural canyon county idaho john grew up working in a small familyowned grocery store in wilder idaho learning valuable lessons about the importance of honesty integrity hard work and giving back to community he attended

education and men’s health issues–topics upon which he frequently lectured john attended the university of san diego school of law where he graduated in  with honors john’s focus on individuals and their specific needs provides a unique approach to problem resolution which will benefit both the tma and its individual members john comes to the board with no preordained agenda his training requires that each issue be examined and resolved in the most appropriate way what john does promise is to be open available and to handle each issue presented to the board by fully exploring all
