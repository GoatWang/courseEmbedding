news strategies entrepreneurs industries government companies opinion legal notices industry insights  ·  print  ·  comment companies  strategies risky businesses by mark gordon  managing editor june   george sanchez an executive with sarasotabased uniroyal engineered products is leading the company through the recession partially by introducing new products the company manufactures a patented coated artificial leather fabric under the naugahyde brand name in a squarefoot factory in wisconsin a costly gamble to grow sales via the auto industry hasn’t panned out yet for a million gulf coast manufacturer but the company no stranger to big risks isn’t giving up george sanchez sitting in his sarasota office one day in early  recalls feeling a bit excited when he heard a tidbit of news normally thought of as negative sandusky athol a leading niche player in manufacturing upholstery and fabrics for the auto industry was filing for bankruptcy  nothing against the people of sandusky but to sanchez that company’s troubles presented an opportunity for his firm uniroyal engineered products sarasotabased uniroyal which manufactures a patented artificial leather fabric for recliners and a variety of other products had been seeking a way into the auto business for years “automotive is huge” says sanchez a uniroyal executive and partial owner “that can triple your sales overnight” and sandusky was the perfect opportunity to aid such lofty goals so sanchez armed with the company’s positive cash flow led uniroyal on a sanduskyinduced binge by the summer  uniroyal with  million in  revenues bought  million of equipment at a sandusky auction it also hired some of the company’s former employees including a top chemist uniroyal spent another  million retrofitting its wisconsin factory so it could ready itself for the auto industry the plan worked too — save for the pesky recession that began mucking thinks up last year in a prime example of the world’s worst timing uniroyal signed a major gm supplier to a provisional contract for  million in september  the deal would have pushed uniroyal well into  million annual revenue territory but literally days after that deal the bottom began to fall out of the national auto industry within weeks sanchez says the supplier had completely bailed on the deal despite that knockdown uniroyal has soldiered on the company’s annual revenues dropped  to  million in  and sanchez projects the percentage drop in  revenues will be at least as big still sanchez says “we’re not sitting here waiting for the auto industry” for starters the company has invested in two new products it also has completed a widescale costcutting program which included slashing its employee base from  to  and cutting half of a factory shift in the squarefoot factory in wisconsin where it makes of all its product lines  sanchez says the company also has repaid much of its debt and was slightly profitable last year the main issue now not surprisingly is finding actual paying customers says dan bornemann uniroyal’s sales and marketing vice president “the challenge is that everyone is pulling back” a big gamble big risks surviving challenges and bankruptcies are nothing new to uniroyal a predecessor to the current version of uniroyal initially filed for bankruptcy in  when the business was connected to the larger nationally known uniroyal tire brand  that bankruptcy was tied to pension liabilities according to sanchez the company resurfaced in sarasota in  as uniroyal technology a publicly traded company run by howard r curd a sarasota businessman and entrepreneur that company grew by riding the success of naugahyde the patented coated fabric used in dozens of products from recliners to dental chairs to the seats of john deere tractors the first five years were slow going however it didn’t post of a profitable year until  the company reported in its public filings that year it produced a net income of  or three cents a share but growth was coming much faster by  when it reported net income of  million or  a share about  of that could be traced to its naugahyde products line then in summer  the company took a big gamble it decided to put naugahyde in the background so it could move into a sexier line of business lightemitting diodes the energyefficient highbrightness leds were to be used in everything from taillights to traffic signals and company executives were convinced the line would be a hot seller indeed executives were so confident in leds that uniroyal opened a manufacturing facility for the products in a  million sqaurefoot facility in tampa it hired  people to staff the plant the company even discontinued most of its coated fabric product lines essentially dropping everything but the naugahyde name the decision was a failure the market proved to be too competitive which cut into sales margins drastically and the post stock market drop put the company in a deeper bind as its shares dropped from more than  to  cents a share within a few months the answer was the company’s second bankruptcy which it filed in august  a group of sarasota investors including curd and his son howard f curd ultimately bought what was left of the company  the elder curd who lives in sarasota declined to comment on the company’s second bankruptcy period referring all calls to sanchez bar stools and handbags the new significantly leaner version of uniroyal went back to its naugahyde product line by late  — just in time to ride the wave in consumer and corporate spending that was part of the thriving nationwide economy the company’s revenues grew about  per year from  to  sanchez says the housing boom was especially good to uniroyal as more people bought homes more companies needed the naugahyde products for home furnishings such as sofas bar stools and recliners naugahyde first patented by us rubber for use in handbag manufacturing was invented in  and is considered to be the first rubberbased artificial leather ever made it was called naugahyde because the material looked like a hide and it was made in naugatuck conn now uniroyal is getting ready to market its new naugahydebased products the first one is a fabric for many of its product lines that is free of phthalate phthalate is a substance added to plastic to increase flexibility and durability that some studies have shown to have a harmful health effect on children it made the news a few years ago after california and later the federal government passed laws requiring retailers to sell toys with a nonphthalate material sanchez led a uniroyal delegation in debuting its phthalatefree product lines at the hospitality design expo and conference in las vegas earlier this month says sanchez “we feel that will be a big hit for us” the second new product uniroyal is set to begin selling later this year is its graffitiproof material it will allow ink or magic marker blotches to come off one of its products by using just soap and water a big advancement in the upholstery market  sanchez says he has little regrets about the timing of the company’s effort to grab a piece of the auto parts industry for starters the investment in sandusky athol’s equipment and employees although high wasn’t nearly as high as if uniroyal had outright bought the business — an option it had considered he says sanchez also says the move allowed the company to improve its manufacturing process for its other lines an overdue overhaul finally sanchez says he’s confident that the american car industry will eventually make a comeback “and when it does come back it will take uniroyal to another level” says sanchez “we will have the best of both worlds”   related headlines new in town wired in train rolling play it cool comments “automotive is huge” says sanchez a uniroyal executive and partial owner “that can triple your sales overnight” and sandusky was the perfect opportunity to aid such lofty goals so sanchez armed with the company’s positive cash flow led uniroyal on a sanduskyinduced binge extenze added by javascript must be enabled to view this email address on thursday jun  add a

sergio heiber special situations eventdriven newsletter provider smallcapsummaryuniroyal technical products manufacturer of naugahyde is now a publicly traded companyfinancial information was released in their first kuniroyal technical products has a plan to capture global dominance in a fragmented industryuniroyal engineered products a producer of coated fabrics is temporarily a publicly traded company under the name invisa incorporated otcqbinsa insa had been a listed stock and almost a shell company with very limited sales by being acquired by insa uniroyal became a publicly traded stock information about this transaction is contained in the k filing the acquisition was completed in november and a k was filed today howard curd uniroyal engineered products ceo plans to grow the company into a global entity by acquisition and to develop market leadership in a fragmented sector by cross selling products gaining exposure for uniroyal engineered products and its acquisitions to new oems i spoke to mr curd and to vic allgeier a spokesperson for insa and was told that the upcoming k will state that the components of the new insa had revenues of around  million for the prior year and a profit margin of about  mr curd said that he aims to change the name of the stock to uniroyal engineered products sometime this year and outlined his plan uniroyal engineered products is a producer of cast vinyl coated fabrics including the iconic naugahyde brand providing solutions for the automotive healthcare hospitality marine recreational furniture and transportation markets the company is a piece of the uniroyal company started as the united states rubber co in  the uniroyal tire business was acquired by michelin in  in  howard curd bought uniroyal engineered products the remaining piece of the original company which was trading for a fraction of a penny and under bankruptcy protection curd successfully brought the company out of bankruptcy uniroyal engineered products remained a private company and entered the automotive sector in  about the same time as the auto industry went into a tailspin uniroyal engineered products was not totally dependent on the automotive market but what happened then was instrumental in expanding their products into the global market rather than just the us market one of uniroyal engineered products largest customers was ford nysef similarly to many other us manufacturers ford was looking for cost cutting solutions and decided to implement just in time inventory from local suppliers on a global basis ford decided that each model car would be built with the same components despite being built in different countries they were looking for companies that were able to supply the same product to their manufacturing facilities in europe asia and the us on an as needed basis ford had a relationship with uniroyal in the us and in england with wardles storeys limited and suggested that the two companies discuss partnering up the companies merged in  and that merger created the spark for uniroyal engineered products growth strategy uniroyal engineered products sales were predominantly in the us with  of revenues in the automotive industry wardle storeys sales were mostly in europe with  of revenues in the automotive industry to customers including range rover fiat nissan and jaguar uniroyal engineered products has benefited from the connection with wardle and has secured a contract with ford in europe in the production of the ford escort as well as entry into the german automotive market since companies are now competing globally entry into the german market means that the new uniroyal engineered products expects to gain german automakers business not only in germany but in the us as well entry into europe is expected to also benefit uniroyals sales efforts in the healthcare hospitality marine recreational furniture and transportation markets the curd family made incremental purchases of insa stock and once they had a controlling interest engineered insas acquisition of uniroyal engineered products which they also had a majority ownership position in completed in november with the curd family owning about  of the insa shares after the transaction there was no dilution of shares created by the insa acquisition of uniroyal engineered products the curd family received non convertible preferred shares bearing interest at around  the company expects that there will be at least one and maybe more acquisition this year funded by their lines of credit and that at some point in the not too distant future a secondary offering will be implemented to add shares to the float allowing institutional investors to scoop up shares mr allgeier believes that microcap funds will begin taking an interest after the first k verifies what he has been reporting about this new stock the market for coated fabrics is highly fragmented and expected to continue to grow the top six companies in the market had a combined share of only  of the overall market which makes mr curds plan to grow by acquisition to offer just in time supply internationally and to gain market exposure and market share by cross selling products a very logical conclusion due to the large stake that the curd family owns this stock will be a small floater which is subject to wider spreads and greater volatility than otherwise despite the inherent risks due to low volume it is interesting to note that the curd family has no immediate plans to sell shares this is a ground floor entry point for investors who agree with this companys
