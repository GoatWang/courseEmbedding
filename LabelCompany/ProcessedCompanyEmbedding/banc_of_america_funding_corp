underlying pools and reflect moodys updated loss expectation on the pools the rating upgrades are a result of the improving performance of the related pools and  or an increase in credit enhancement available to the bonds the rating downgrades are due to the weaker performance of the underlying collateral and  or the erosion of enhancement available to the bonds the principal methodology used in these ratings was us rmbs surveillance methodology published in january  please see the rating methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology additionally the methodology used in rating chevy chase funding llc mortgagebacked certificates series  cl nio was moodys approach to rating structured finance interestonly securities published in october  please see the rating methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology please note that on february   moodys released a request for comment rfc in which it has requested market feedback on potential revisions to its crosssector rating methodology for rating structured finance io securities please refer to moodys rfc titled moodys proposes revised approach to rating structured finance interestonly io securities  for further details regarding the implications of the proposed methodology revisions on certain credit ratings factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings ratings in the us rmbs sector remain exposed to the high level of macroeconomic uncertainty and in particular the unemployment rate the unemployment rate fell to  in march  from  in march  moodys forecasts an unemployment central range of  to  for the  year deviations from this central scenario could lead to rating actions in the sector house prices are another key driver of us rmbs performance moodys expects house prices to continue to rise in  lower increases than moodys expects or decreases could lead to negative rating actions finally performance of rmbs continues to remain highly dependent on servicer procedures any change resulting from servicing transfers or other policy or regulatory change can impact the performance of these transactions a list of these actions including cusip identifiers may be found at excel httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf a list of updated estimated transaction pool losses and bond recoveries are being posted on an ongoing basis for the duration of this review period and may be found at excel alta httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf option arm httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf for more information please see wwwmoodyscom regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form the analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments as a second step moodys estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement loss allocation and other structural features to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows moodys weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring for ratings issued on a program series or categoryclass of debt this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to each rating of a subsequently issued bond

announcement moodys no negative ratings impact from amendments to  bank of americaserviced rmbs deals global credit research   jun  new york june    moodys investors service stated today that proposed amendments to servicing agreements of the affected transactions listed below will not in and of themselves and at this time result in a reduction or withdrawal of moodys current ratings of the securities issued by the affected transactions bank of america na bana the servicer for the affected transactions requested that moodys provide its opinion on whether the ratings of the securities issued by the affected transactions would be downgraded or withdrawn as a result of three amendments that are being made to the servicing agreements for the affected transactions the first series of amendments will allow servicing advances in the affected transactions to be funded by an advance facility the second amendment will require that the account used by the servicer to hold monthly collections from borrowers be held at a depository institution whose longterm unsecured debt obligations are rated at least a by moodys and whose commercial paper shortterm debt obligations demand deposits or other shortterm deposits are rated at least p by moodys the final amendment modifies a servicer replacement event in several of the affected transactions listed below currently the master servicer and the trustee have the option to terminate the servicer if its servicer rating falls below the servicer rating as of deal closing the amendment changes the reference date from closing date to a servicing transfer date should there be a transfer of servicing moodys view is based primarily on its opinion that a including an option to fund the advances in the transaction through an advance facility will not have a negative impact on servicers ability to perform its servicing duties and therefore will not affect the affected transactions performance b the new ratings requirements for depository institutions are consistent with moodys guidelines the temporary use of cash in structured finance transactions eligible investment and bank guidelines published in march   and c changing the reference date for the servicer termination event does not have a negative credit impact because it is a conforming change in the event servicing transfers moodys believed that the amendments did not have an adverse effect on the credit quality of the securities such that the moodys ratings were impacted moodys did not express an opinion as to whether the amendments could have other non creditrelated effects deals with amendments for advance facility depository institution rating and servicer termination event csfb mortgagebacked passthrough certificates series  csfb mortgagebacked
