chairman mats pettersson has said he will not seek reelection at the companys annual general meeting on march   pettersson has been in the role for two years and looks likely to be replaced by independent board member hakan bjorklund  who has agreed to step up to the chairman position and has the backing of the danish companys board of directors bjorklund has been a member of the board at lundbeck since march  and was formerly chief executive of denmarks nycomed before it was taken over by japanese pharma group takeda news of the switch comes as lundbeck is in the midst of a difficult period precipitated by the loss of patent protection on the antidepressant lexapro escitalopram and alzheimers treatment ebixa memantine in the us where they are sold by partner forest laboratories lundbeck faces even more difficult times ahead when escitalopram loses patent protection next year in europe where it is sold as cipralex while the company is also facing patent expiries for parkinsons disease treatment azilect rasagline from  at a time when bringing new products through the pipeline is the clear priority bjorklunds rd experience  including a long stint as head of research at astra ab now astrazeneca  seems to be a good option the company could secure us approval for a longacting depot formulation of its otsukapartnered schizophrenia drug abilify aripiprazole by the end of this month but the highlight in the pipeline is its newgeneration antidepressant brintellix vortioxetine which could be launched later in the year following behind are two other phase iii candidates  brexpiprazole for schizophrenia and clotbuster desmoteplase  that if successful could also help the company recover from its patent cliff lundbeck holds a unique and strong position in the development of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of brain disorders which is one of the greatest health challenges of the st century says bjorklund i look forward to contributing to lundbecks

bjorklund ceo of nycomed talks growth this interview was conducted by adam burns on behalf of meettheboss tv adam burns so nycomed reported a solid start to 0 and then sustained profits in the second quarter i have a quote here you said ‘the trading environment will remain challenging for the year but we believe in our strategy of identifying and inlicensing promising new products and expanding our focus on emerging markets’ in light of the sort of current economic conditions how flexible has that strategy needed to be hakan bjorklund i think its important to think of the strategy as a longterm or a midterm strategy where you don’t make dramatic changes because of shortterm changes in the environment we haven’t changed it but of course the strategy is also there for you to be able to improvise around it so a certain degree of flexibility is of course necessary but a situation like this with an economic crisis does not only provide you with challenges it also provides you with opportunities adam burns so how about the senior team in tough times everybody perhaps needs an arm around him or her how have you been keeping the energy up there hakan bjorklund

seniorteam in tough times everybodyperhaps needs an arm around him or herhow have you been keeping the energyup therehakan bjorklundwell ﬁrst of all most of the seniormanagement team has been together forquite some time we know one anothervery well we have developed a strategytogether and that i think is veryimportant this is not a strategy which iscoming from above and which is sort ofpresented to people ‘this is the way youshould do it’ everyone has been part ofdeveloping it and i think that makespeople motivatedthen at the end of theday it’s also a question of how youmanage people i think i have amanagement style which is based onempowerment and delegation i thinkthat is essential for motivation at the endof the dayadam burns you say that most of theteam has been together for a long timeit’s interesting because there are sort ofvarious schools of thought around thatsome people say ‘no teams need to bekept fresh so they’re energetic’ andother people say ‘no no no keep themtogether because you develop anempathy’hakan bjorklund well when i say thatmost of the team has been together for along time i guess maybe you shouldtake that with a grain of salt half of ushave been together for probably aboutseven eight ten years but we also havethe head of rd who has been with usfor three years head of sales andmarketing who has been with us forabout  months so i think we have agood combination of people who havebeen in the company for quite some timeand people who come from the outsidebut still very experienced people in theindustry but with a differentbackground i think that is a goodcombination‘‘i believe in a lot of interaction andi believe in a lot of informal interaction’’adam burns of course and what aboutyourself this is your th year atnycomed how do you keep it fresh isit still a challenge for youhakan bjorklund well it’s been  yearswith nycomed that’s true and when iget this question which happens nowthat i’m a ceo i get a little surprisedthat it is  years because it doesn’t feellike  years maybe it looks like yearsi think the difference betweennycomed  years ago and today isdramatic i mean it’s not the samecompany that i came into in ‘ as it istoday which also means that not only theperspectiveinterviewdrug discovery todayvolume  numbers july  perspective‘‘the pharmaceutical market is totally different today than it was  years agoand that of course also brings challenges and opportunities and i guessmotivation’’  see front matter doijdrudis00wwwdrugdiscoverytodaycom loading next page
