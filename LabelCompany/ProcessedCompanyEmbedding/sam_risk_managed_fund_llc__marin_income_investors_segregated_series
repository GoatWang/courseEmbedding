institutional investors on one side are the traditional products designed for middleincome individual investors like the retail classes of mutual funds these have modest initial investment requirements on the other side are managed strategies for institutions with imposing minimum requirements of  million or more in between these however is the growing universe of separately managed accounts smas targeted at wealthy but not necessarily ultrawealthy individual investors this article will examine the world of smas and what investorsor their financial advisorsshould keep in mind when considering these investment vehicles see separately managed accounts a boon for alldefining managed separate accountsa sma is a portfolio of assets under the management of a professional investment firm in the united states the vast majority of such firms are called registered investment advisors and operate under the regulatory auspices of the investment advisors act of 90 and the purview of the us securities and exchange commission sec one or more portfolio managers are responsible for daytoday investment decisions supported by a team of analysts operations and administrative staff smas differ from pooled vehicles like mutual funds in that each portfolio is unique to a single account hence the name in other words if you set up a separate account with money manager x then manager x has the discretion to make decisions for this account that may be different from decisions made for other accounts say for example that a manager operates a diversified core equity strategy including  stocks the manager decides to launch a mutual fund containing these stocks and also a separately managed account offering assume that at the outset the manager invests all portfolios with the same weightboth the mutual fund and the smas from a clients perspective the beneficial interests in either vehicle are identical at the outset but the statements will look different for the mutual fund client the position will show up as a singleline entry bearing the mutual fund tickermost likely a fiveletter acronym ending in x the value will be the net asset value from the close of business on the statements effective date the sma investors statement however will list each of the equity positions and values separately and the total value of the account will simply be the aggregate value of each of the positions from this beginning point things will begin to diverge decisions the manager makes for the mutual fundincluding the timing for purchase and sale of shares dividend reinvestment and distributionswill affect all fund investors in the same way for smas however the decisions are at the account level and will therefore vary from one investor to another see wrap it up the terms and benefits of managed money mass customizationthe high level of customization is one of the main selling points of smas particularly when it comes to individual taxable accounts portfolio transactions have expense and tax implications with managed accounts investors can feel like they have a greater degree of control over these decisions and that they are more closely attuned to the objectives and constraints set forth in the investment policy statement so what is the price of entry for this extra level of customized attention there is no single answer for the several thousand managers that make up the sma universe as a general rule of thumb the price of entry starts at 00 smas targeted to high net worth retail investors tend to set account minimum balances between 00 and  million for strategies designed especially for institutional managers minimum account sizes may range from 0 million to 00 million for stylebased investors who seek exposure to several different investment styles eg largecap value smallcap growth the price of entry goes up as there will be a separate sma and a separate account minimum for each style chosen for example an investor seeking stylepure exposure in the four corners of the style boxlarge cap small cap value and growthmight need to have at least  available to implement an smabased strategy other investors may prefer an allcap blend or core approach that could be found through a single manager fee structuresone of the difficulties inherent in making an applestoapples comparison among investment offerings is that fee structures vary this is even trickier for smas than for mutual funds for reasons we will explain here mutual fund fees are fairly straightforward the key number is the net expense ratio including the management fee for the professional services of the team that runs the fund miscellaneous ancillary expenses and a distribution charge called a b fee for certain eligible funds many funds also have different types of sales charges funds are required to disclose this information in their prospectuses and show explicitly how the fund expenses and sales charges would affect hypothetical returns over different holding periods investors can easily obtain these prospectuses from the funds parent company either online or through the mail separate accounts do not come with prospectuses managers list their basic fee structures in a regulatory filing called a form adv part  an investor can obtain this document by contacting the manager but they tend not to be as widely available through unrestricted online downloads as mutual fund prospectuses moreover the published fee schedule in the adv part  is not necessarily firm  it is subject to negotiation between the investor or the investors financial advisor and the money manager often it is not a single fee but a scale in which the fee expressed as a percentage of assets under management decreases as the asset volume the amount invested increases the importance of due diligencebecause smas do not issue registered prospectuses investors or their advisors need to rely on other sources for investigating and evaluating the manager in investorspeak this is referred to as due diligence a comprehensive due diligence will elicit sufficiently detailed information regarding all of the following areas performance dataa manager should be prepared to share performance data annual and preferably quarterly returns achieved since inception of the strategy the information is contained on a compositea table showing aggregate performance for all feepaying accounts in that strategy a good question to ask here is whether the composite complies with the global investment performance standards set by the cfa institute and whether a competent thirdparty auditor has provided a letter affirming compliance with the standards philosophy and approacheach manager has a unique investment philosophy and way of going about applying that philosophy to an investment approach you will want to know whether the manager has a more active or passive style a topdown or bottomup approach how he or she manages alpha and beta risk the strategys performance benchmark and other similar information investment processfind out who makes the decisions and how they get carried out the roles and responsibilities of portfolio managers analysts support staff and others who comprises the investment committee and how often it meets and the sell discipline and other key aspects of the process operationssome managers have extensive inhouse trading platforms while others outsource all noncore functions to thirdparty providers like schwab or fidelity you also need to understand transaction expenses and how they can affect your bottom line another useful area of information here is client and account services among other things here you can find out about net client activityhow many new clients did the firm originate and how many left over a defined time period what were the circumstances surrounding those who left organization and compensationhow the firm is organized and how it pays its professionalsespecially the managers whose reputations and track records are the big drawis an extremely important area to cover understand the calculations behind incentive compensation are the managers incentives aligned with those of the investor this is a must compliance historyred flags include prominent infractions with the sec or other regulatory bodies fines or penalties levied and lawsuits or other adverse legal situations the sec considers separate account managers to be investment advisors subject to the provisions of the investment advisors act of 90 much of this information can be obtained from the managers form adv parts  and  with part  having more of the details on strategy approach fees and biographical information on the principal team members performance data should be available directly from the manager either online or through personal contact with a manager representative the representative should also be able to coordinate phone or inperson meetings with key team members and direct your questions appropriately on compliance and other issues the bottom lineby virtue of the account minimums separately managed accounts are certainly not for everybody if you have the means they can be a useful alternative to mutual funds or other pooled vehicles and more closely align with your own specific return objectives risk tolerance and special

lower investment fees than investors might be able to obtain on their own types of investment funds include mutual funds exchangetraded funds money market funds and hedge funds breaking down

fund manager oversees the fund and decides which securities it should hold in what quantities and when the securities should be bought and sold an investment fund can be broadbased such as an index fund that tracks the sp 00 or it can be tightly focused such as an etf that invests only in small technology stocks while investment funds in various forms have been around for many years the

of investment fund assets belong to openend mutual funds these funds issue new shares as investors add money to the pool and retire shares as investors redeem these funds are typically priced just once at the end of the trading day closedend funds trade more similarly to stocks than openend funds closedend funds are managed investment funds that issue a fixed number of shares and trade on an exchange while a net asset value nav for the fund is calculated the fund trades based on investor supply and demand therefore a closedend fund may trade at a premium or a discount to its nav emergence
