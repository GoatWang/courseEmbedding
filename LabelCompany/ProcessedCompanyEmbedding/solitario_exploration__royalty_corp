profitable gold and zinc production is coming soonsep  about solitario exploration xpl gold mining bull long only gold  precious metals oil  gas contrarianmarketplacethe gold bull portfoliosummarysolitario exploration  royalty is advancing the economically sound mt hamilton gold project in nevada which will produce  ounces annually at low cash coststhe company also owns a  interest in the highgrade bongara zinc project in peru which is joint ventured with a major zinc producersolitario currently has a market cap of just  million but its assets could be worth several times that figure as it reaches the production stagei think solitario presents a compelling buy at current prices and investors should be adding shares on any future weakness in the share pricesolitario exploration  royalty nysemktxpl is a natural resource company that owns several exciting developmental projects mainly the mt hamilton gold project located in eastern nevada with initial production scheduled for early  and the highgrade bongara zinc project in peru which is joint ventured with votorantim metals the fifth largest zinc producer in the world solitarios  ownership is fullyfunded to production which could come in  the companys focus is on gold silver and zinc but it also has other advancedstage projects with platinum and palladium and lead with nearly  million ounces of gold resources in the measured and indicated categories a deposit nearing initial production and an exciting highgrade zinc project in peru with solitarios interest fullyfunded to production plus other interesting development projects i believe the company is a buy at current prices since its market cap sits at a paltry  million solitario exploration  royalty corp recent stock price  shares outstanding  million market cap  million week range  credit yahoo finance mt hamilton attractive economics the mt hamilton mine is located in the southern portion of the prolific mountain gold trend in nevada which is arguably the best mining jurisdiction in the world home to such gold deposits as the bald mountain mine and the cortez mine owned by barrick gold nyseabx the emigrant mine owned by newmont mining nysenem the fire creek mine owned by klondex the marigold mine owned by silver standard nasdaqssri and the round mountain mine owned by barrick and kinross gold nysekgc among many others a feasibility study completed in  showed the project carries very strong economics the mine should produce  ounces of gold annually at cash costs of just  an ounce however the company feels there is excellent potential to expand resources and increase annual production at the mine currently solitario is evaluating the possibility of a year  ounce a year production schedule with initial production coming as early as the second half of  with the addition of the new seligman resource and additional drilling conducted since the feasibility was first completed the new resource base resulted in a  increase in contained gold to  ounces with inferred resources increasing  to  one of the reasons i like mt hamilton so much is that the initial capital requirements to build the mine are estimated at just  million which is quite low given the amount of cash flow the mine could end up producing for example the company estimates that with a gold price of  the life of mine aftertax cash flow will equal  million or  million per year which results in yearly returns on the initial investment of   million capital costs and  million aftertax profits a year with aftertax returns of  million and a projected share count of  million  million shares issued to help fund construction with some debt also issued it is reasonable to expect earnings per share of  to   which would give the company a forward pe ratio of just  average annual ebitda with a gold price of  comes in at  million a year or  million over the life of the mine which means the company could earn nearly its entire current market cap in ebitda in the first year of full production alone of course this also assumes the company could raise enough capital to get mt hamilton into production  something i believe it can and i will touch upon this below how will mt hamilton be financed at the end of the last quarter solitario had cash equivalents and investments at fair value of  million with  in current liabilities and  million in longterm debt while i dont think the debt poses an issue currently and while the mt hamilton mine needs a very reasonable amount of initial capital to get into production the company will still need to raise a significant amount of money to finance construction of the mine investors should be aware that the streaming and royalty company sandstorm gold nysemktsand purchased a  net smelter royalty on the mt hamilton gold project for  million in june of  however i think its highly possible that the royalty will be converted into a stream  solitario still has the option to repurchase  of the royalty for  million if the company enters into a gold stream agreement with sandstorm that has an upfront deposit of no less than  million with a  million gold stream minus  million paid it would net solitario  million a stream of this size could reasonably see sandstorm take  of the annual production from mt hamilton at ongoing costs of  per ounce at  ounces of annual production this means  ounces to sandstorm with  per ounce paid to solitario this would be a smart move by solitario in my opinion as nearly half of the initial capital requirements would be solved and its a small enough sized gold stream that it wouldnt affect profitability too much below is how a gold stream could affect the companys earnings assuming a spot price of  and allin sustaining costs of   ounces at spot price  results in  margins or  million in ebitda annually  ounces at  per ounce  allin costs results in  margins or  million yearly revenue  million ebitda  million the company could then issue  million debt and raise  million in equity  million shares roughly at current levels to fund the remaining upfront costs the end result would see solitario with total shares outstanding in the  million range with  million in total debt however this would transform the company from a nonproducer into a  ounce a year gold producer and give them a cashflowing asset note of course a higher share price couldnt hurt as  million shares at  per share is  less dilution than  million shares at  the end result would be solitario having  million shares outstanding and a fullyfinanced gold mine producing  ounces of gold annually with  million in annual ebitda at  gold estimated under this scenario the company would trade at nearly x its annual ebitda which is very low assuming the company can report earnings aftertax of  million on this figure based on reasonable estimates of taxes depreciation and amortization it would report earnings per share in the neighborhood of  at current share prices this gives them a forward pe ratio under  environmental assessment completed at mt hamilton the company recently announced that the environmental assessment process undertaken by the us department of agriculture and forest service has been completed this represents the most important permit approval for initiating development and operations for the mine according to the company the permit evaluated the environmental impacts of the project solitario also announced that it has received final approval of the water pollution control permit from the nevada department of environmental protection and a right of way grant from the bureau of land management three other key permits are still outstanding but nearing completion two reclamation permits and an air quality permit which are all issued by the state of nevada this is exciting news for shareholders as the most important project milestone has been completed and paves the way for development and construction of the mine bongara zinc project as mentioned the highgrade bongara zinc project is joint ventured with vororantim metals which is the fifth largest zinc producer in the world nearly  million has been spent on the property to date according to solitario an initial ni  resource estimate for the project reported measured and indicated resources of  million tonnes grading  zinc equivalent plus inferred resources totaling  million tonnes grading  zinc equivalent this results in  million lbs of zinc measured and indicated plus  billion inferred plus an additional  million lbs of lead measured and indicated and  million lbs inferred and  million ounces of silver in all categories the fact that this project is fullyfunded to production means solitario can focus its efforts on mt hamilton and does not have to issue equity or debt to fund the project this reduces the companys overall financial risk and minimizes shareholder dilution votorantim continues to advance the project and is in the process of conducting advanced engineering studies according to solitario a prefeasibility study should be released shortly after a positive report could send shares of solitario much higher what are the risks there are a number of risks investors should be aware of before investing in solitario  the development of mining properties involves a high degree of risk in general including the requirement to obtain a number of permits and the need for financial resources for the construction and development of a mine there is no guarantee that solitario will be granted its remaining permits for the mt hamilton project nor is there a guarantee that the company will be able to raise the required funds to develop the deposit and initiate production  the company does not have a history of developing or operating gold mines and will most likely need to acquire additional staff and personnel to manage the operations  the development and operational plans for mt hamilton as well as the projected economic results depend upon results of the feasibility study which makes certain assumptions regarding the costs of mining and processing gold the estimation of resources the availability of personnel to operate the mine as well as the initial capital costs all these figures could end up higher than expected  significant additional expenses including drilling and determining the feasibility of a project are required prior to the establishment of reserves according to the companys k  the companys debt balance could affect its financial condition and theres no guarantee the company will be able to pay it back especially if mt hamilton does not become a profitable operation  the price of gold silver zinc and other metals could fall further making mt hamilton and bongara economically unviable  operating a gold mine is not an easy business and there are a number of risk factors to be aware of including but not limited to mine closures due to weather mine strikes mine failures government regulations and more the bottom line solitario has huge upside potential despite the abovelisted risks of owning a nonproducing junior gold miner i think solitario is a strong buy at current levels the companys mt hamilton project carries strong economics and should turn into nevadas next lowcost gold mine i dont think the company will have too much trouble raising money to fund construction meanwhile the companys  interest in bongara is fullyfunded by its partner which limits shareholder dilution and financing risk i intend to purchase shares of solitario under  per share if the company can successfully bring mt hamilton to production and its partner can advance bongara successfully i think shares could be several times higher than current

on the bongarÃ¡ zinc deposit the pea is still on track to be completed by the end of the second quarter  in february  solitario  milpo significantly increased joint venture property holdings in northern peru by acquiring  hectares  acres of new mineral concessions in early january  the acquired property fills an ownership gap in our consolidated claim position held by the bongarÃ¡ and chambara joint ventures both of which are mutually owned by solitario and milpo click here the newly acquired concessions were previously held by a third party for approximately the past  years but the claims recently expired allowing milposolitario to acquire the property the first day it became available for stakingÂ  with these new mineral rights the joint ventures have secured the most

asset it is an advanced exploration stage highgrade zinc project located in northern peru we are fully carried to production by our joint venture partner milpo mining we are not required to contribute any funds prior to the completion of a feasibility study and our share of mine construction costs will be funded by a loan from milpo and repaid from  of the net proceeds from production attributable to our  interest based on the highgrade zinc content of the defined resources and the fact that the deposit remains open to expansion we believe it is one of the best undeveloped zinc projects in the world although the price of zinc fell significantly during  our partner milpo mining still elected to advance the project thus far in  six more kilometers of access road have been completed and an additional four kilometers is expected by the end of the year this will complete the  kilometer access road from the main highway to the project site and represents a major milestone for the project significant progress was also made to further refine the resource estimate as well as additional engineering studies milpo is planning on constructing  to  kilometers of drill access roads these roads will be used for testing the extension of san jorge zone to the south and the karenmilagros zone to the northeast on november   solitario announced that compania minera milpo saa âmilpoâ lima stock exchange milpoci has announced its intent to acquire from its parent votorantim metais âvotorantimâ an interest in solitarioâs bongarÃ¡ zinc project in peruÂ  milpoâs board of directors approved the purchase of an interest in bongarÃ¡ and another significant zinc project in brazil from votorantimÂ  a combined valuation of us million was placed on the two projectsÂ  milpo will assume operatorship in the project from votorantim under its joint venture agreement with solitarioÂ  votorantim owns slightly more than  of milpoâs publically traded sharesÂ  milpo is the second largest zinc producer in peru operating three of the largest underground zinc mines in peruÂ  in milpoâs initial filing the percentage interest it intends to purchase from votorantim in each of the two projects is undisclosed at this timeÂ  additional information will be provided to the market by milpo when the transaction is concludedÂ  from the second half of  to the end of  votorantim reported that it has expended approximately us million on exploration and development at bongarÃ¡Â  terms of the bongarÃ¡ joint venture with milpo currently solitario owns  of the bongarÃ¡ projectÂ  since inception of the joint venture in  votorantimmilpo has funded  of project expendituresÂ  milpo can earn up to a  interest in the project by continuing to fund all project expenditures and committing to place the project into production based upon a positive feasibility studyÂ Â  after earning  milpo has further agreed to finance solitarios  participating interest for constructionÂ  solitario will repay the loan facility through  of its net cash flow distributions on june   solitario announced the initial ni  compliant resource estimate for its highgrade bongarÃ¡ zin project in northern peru the mineral resource statement and technical report was prepared on behalf of solitario by srk consulting us inc an independent and internationally recognized mining engineering firm srk verified and validated a comprehensive resource model previously developed by solitarioâs joint venture partner votorantim metais the full technical report has been filed on sedar and can be accessed by clicking here highlights of the bongarÃ¡ resource estimate measured and indicated resources total approximately  million tonnes grading  zinc  lead and  gt silver or  zinc equivalent inferred resources total approximately  million tonnes grading  zinc  lead and  gt silver or  zinc equivalent the resource was reported using net smelter return nsr cutoff grades by material type determined by current metals prices zinc and lead  lb and silver oz and projected mining processing transport and smelting costs the resource reported in this statement is contained within a footprint of drilling of approximately one by three kilometers with opportunities for expansion through infill and stepout exploration both laterally and vertically zinc mineralization occurs as a mississippi valley type âmvtâ deposit and is contained in carbonate rocks of the pucara rock formation the hostrock for the many of peruâs zinc mines peru is the third largest zinc producing country in the world the bongarÃ¡ resource estimate was based on a database that includes drilling campaigns of two different companies a total of  drill holes were completed by cominco totaling  meters drilled from  to  and  drill holes completed by votorantim including  meters drilled from  to  the drill data were verified and validated by srk in compliance with ni  guidelines the mineral resource statement for the bongarÃ¡ zinc project is presented in table  cutoff grades and their derivation are provided in the resource table notes an important component of srkâs technical report was to differentiate three types of mineralization present within the bongarÃ¡ deposit defined to dateÂ  these are sulfide mixed and oxide zinc mineralizationÂ  sulfide mineralization dominates the currently estimated resources totaling approximately  of the resource with oxide accounting for  and mixed resources making up the remaining Â  in addition srk has acknowledged a significant amount of technical work completed by votorantim which has advanced the project well into prefeasibilitylevel of study in some areas of development the bongarÃ¡ technical report and resource statement was prepared by srk consulting us inc and provides a classification of resources in accordance with the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum standards on mineral resources and mineral reserves definitions and guidelines november   development activities our joint venture partner milpo mining has advanced engineering and other development activities during the past several yearsÂ  Â most notably was the completion of a  compliant resource estimate Â in  by solitario based upon milpoâs detailed resource workÂ  another substantial metallurgical study was completed and demonstrated excellent metallurgical recovery averaging  for zinc additional permitting was undertaken to allow completion of the access road to the florida canyon area to date approximately  of the approximately kilometer long access road has been completedÂ  currently milpo is permitting additional surface drill sites and negotiating a new agreement with the local communityÂ  significant progress was also made to further refine the resource estimateÂ Â   drilling results on august   solitario reported further outstanding drilling results on its highgrade bongarÃ¡ zinc project in peru included in these results are core holes v that intersected  meters grading  zinc  lead and  gpt silver and hole v that intersected  meters grading  zinc  lead and  gpt silver all of these newly reported drill hole intercepts were underground core holes drilled from the san jorge tunnel the drilling program was managed and entirely funded by solitarios joint venture partner votorantim metais votorantim better intercepts in this round of underground drilling are presented below click here to view the other important mineralized intercepts reported underground drilling began in the first quarter of  and was completed in the second quarter during this period  core holes were drilled from the san jorge tunnel votorantim is incorporating these results into a new resource model as part of their effort to complete a prefeasibility study on bongarÃ¡ by mid on august   solitario announced continued outstanding drilling results on its highgrade bongarÃ¡ zinc project in peru included in these results are core holes v that intersected  meters grading  zinc  lead and  gpt silver and hole v that intersected  meters grading  zinc  lead and  gpt silver all drill holes reported were drilled from the surface in the karen milagros mineralized area kmzone the drilling program was managed and entirely funded by solitarios joint venture partner votorantim metais better intercepts in this round of surface drilling are presented below both the km and san jorge mineralized zones are contained within the florida canyon mineralized system which remains open to expansion in all directions a drill hole map can be accessed here surface drilling began in the first quarter of  and was completed in the second quarter during this period  core holes were drilled totaling  meters four of the holes did not reach the target depth of the  drill holes that reached their target depth  holes intersected mineralization grading in excess of  zinc  lead over at least two meters or equivalent this latest round of surface drilling was focused in the central portion of the kmzone that had previously been sparsely drilled a complete listing of all kmzone surface drill holes reported on august   can be accessed here  activity exceptional drilling results underground drilling on the san jorge zone and surface drilling on the karenmilagros zone yielded exceptional assay results presented in the tables below the san jorge mineralized area and the florida canyon deposit in general remain open to expansion in all directions of particular importance is the discovery that zinc grades at san jorge increase to the south in fact the southernmost area tested by the underground drilling program contains some of the highest zinc grades ever encountered on the property based on these results votorantim has proposed extending the san jorge exploration tunnel a further  meters to the south where highgrade mineralization remains wide open projects  prospects zinc bongarÃ¡ peru Â  lik alaska royalties pedra branca
