investment portfolio when you become a client of shine we start by getting to know you so we can understand your “big picture” – your needs your dreams your goals and even your fears we have to know where you’re going before we can properly start the journey to get there a customized plan that’s right for you the goal of our planning process is to create a “map” of investing and financial actions that will get you safely from point a where you are now to point b where you want to be in the nearterm and to point c where you want to be in the longterm future we provide personalized attention to the details of the plan so it fits with who you are and what you want to accomplish and also so you experience the least amount of stress  we make sure that it gets done along the way we coordinate with your other advisors – your accountant attorney and insurance agent—to make sure everybody is on the same page and the overall plan is consistent and efficient your total financial wellbeing is our most important concern our investment strategies are longterm in nature based on the most compelling academic and scientific literature and also grounded on our decades of experience with the everfluctuating investment markets we do not engage in market timing because the evidence—and our experience—strongly suggests that jumping in and out of the market not only doesn’t work it’s dangerous to your financial health and wellbeing look back move forward we believe every financial plan should be a living document that serves your changing needs as you move forward in your journey your circumstances will inevitably change  you’ll achieve shortterm goals and need to make new ones  the unforeseen will happen there may be pleasant surprises there may be setbacks you may need to change direction to get back on course or you may find yourself making new better goals financial planning is an ongoing process that adjusts with your circumstances  as we work together we’ll revisit and review your life changes and help update your goals strategies and objectives as needed putting your interests ahead of all others key to our business philosophy is a professional commitment to the wellbeing of everyone with whom we work  you will never have to question our loyalties or wonder if our advice is related to product sales or other financial conflicts of interest we put your interests first when we answer questions when we give advice and when we work with you to map out a plan in the profession this is called the “fiduciary standard” of practice we call it the right way to provide advice for our community why do people hire us people come to shine with important questions about their financial lives we engage in meaningful conversations and offer guidance in making

april  newsletter now availablesaturday april th view all › about us  shineshine about us back our team services philosophy why shine insights about us our story our company started because our founder judy shine couldn’t find a financial advisory firm that would provide the advice she wanted and needed  in fact they didn’t exist as a highlysuccessful sales professional at xerox judy needed unbiased professional advice on how to invest her money and make good financial decisions  but where could she turn for objective advice  with whom could she feel comfortable talking about her financial success and the challenges it presented after several disappointing investment losses due to selfserving sales agendas judy decided to take matters into her own hands  she enrolled in the certified financial planner® cfp® certification program in  once certified judy took a job writing financial plans for a new division of new england life  before long she decided to step out and create the firm she had hoped to find years earlier  in  shine investment advisory services inc was born over the years our firm has expanded to include a team of likeminded cfp® professionals sharing the same commitment to provide the care and advice that judy once sought for herself today our nationally recognized firm exceeds judy’s original vision as a safe haven of investment advice for people like her  we are proud to set the standard for excellence in the denver market by integrating the highest level of institutional portfolio management with deep broad financial planning expertise we are committed to being the kind of advisor that we would seek ourselves and that we would recommend to our family members  over the last two decades we’ve enjoyed many productive and interesting relationships with people in our community  our strategies continue to evolve and grow as new generations of people seek objective advice and a safe place to discuss their own challenges why do people hire us people come to shine with important questions about their financial lives we engage in meaningful conversations and offer guidance in making the right choices for future success and wellbeing

all › faq  shineshine about us back our team services philosophy why shine insights faq whether you’re ready to get started or have an additional question we can answer please give us a call and let’s start the conversation how are you paid for your servicesour clients pay us a single fee for comprehensive customized advice this includes answering your most important financial questions creating a customized plan that addresses the challenges you’re facing now plus managing your investments within your comfort zone on an ongoing basis the fee to create an initial financial plan will be based on complexityour ongoing financial planning and investment management services are charged as a percentage of the total assets we manage for you under our typical fee arrangement the first  million in assets is billed at a  annual rate and amounts above  million are billed on a declining rate schedule our engagement letter including a detailed fee schedule is available upon request what if i have questions between formal meetingswe do not charge separately for calls updating your situation or asking questions we want to encourage rather than discourage communication with the people we serve once we start working together who will i be working withshine takes a team approach to serving you that means that you will be working with different members of our staff depending on the issues that arise and who is best suited to provide answers and service you will work with a primary advisor as well as a backup advisor who also is intimately familiar with your personal situation what is a fiduciary why does it matter to me that you function as fiduciariesmost people who call themselves ‘advisors’ are really sales agents who work in the best interests of their brokerage firm or insurance company they won’t tell you this but they’re held to a much lower standard of care than fiduciaries they can legally recommend investments that pay them and their company high commissions and make it seem like they’re offering advice in your best interests as fiduciaries under the law we are required to always put your best interests first the advice we give doesn’t ever get tainted by any outside compensation—no commissions sales prizes trailing compensation or revenue sharing this is our choice and we wouldn’t want to work in any other way with the people we serve we believe it provides important protections for your financial wellbeing can you work with my cpa and attorney to coordinate estate and tax planning issuesabsolutely we do this for most of our clients which ensures that all parts of your overall plan are working together how do you manage my investmentswe start by working with you to determine your comfort zone in the ups and downs of today’s investment markets only then can we appropriately recommend a mix of investments that will work together—making your money work for you we select the individual investments from “institutional” mutual funds exchangetraded funds and other investments which in many cases are not available to the general public and which often charge lower operating expense ratios the savings are passed on to you is there any reason why i couldn’t use index funds and manage my own investment portfolioyou could manage your own nest egg and many people do—with mixed results using index funds is a great strategy for minimizing the drag of yearly portfolio costs and we do it ourselves where appropriate the first challenge of investment management is hard wired into our brains some of the most costly mistakes people make in our experience have to do with normal human behavior when markets go down sometimes dramatically there is a natural impulse to sell this behavior locks in losses and few people know when to get back into the market to catch the next upturn when the markets are roaring ahead there is a natural tendency to want to double down and pour more money into the hot investment like a mutual fund or class of investments like us or foreign stocks often these periods of high returns are followed by inevitable declines all of us are subject to these natural human tendencies all of these natural human tendencies can lead to costly investment mistakes a second challenge of investment management is constructing an appropriate mix of different assets many people unknowingly create portfolios that are concentrated in one or two asset types industry sectors or even individual company stocks they experience much more portfolio risk than necessary how do you avoid the behavioral pitfallsover the past  years we’ve seen a lot of market turbulence and learned a lot about what does and doesn’t work in investing we know the different asset classes and have stayed abreast of academic research into what kinds of portfolios deliver the highest returns per unit of risk and we have the advantage of looking at your investments objectively the index funds don’t provide you with financial advice or information about how to proceed when the investment ride gets bumpy will you help me understand my investmentsyes as you ask questions during our meetings we’ll share our professional knowledge about everything from the particular investments we recommend to broader savings and financial issues—in plain english rather than industry jargon can i view my accounts onlineyes we primarily use charles schwab  co as the custodian for our clients’ accounts you can view your account information and activity at wwwschwaballiancecom you will also be given access to a
