another company and they were wrong i googled batterys and came up with battery sharks after emailing back and forth i purchased the batteries from them i had my batteries within  days i wiil be using them agian report is this review helpful cool    sparky    inferior batteries i purchase two battery from this company for my fathers wheelchair in feb  and they were useless by oct  they had voltage but no amps they would fail under load i followed all of their request to prove that batteries were defective and they did send two more to replace them but they did not last as long as the first ones these are very “inferior” batteries so save your money and buy from a company that will stand behind their products i use a lot of batteries in my profession for golf carts lifts boats wheelchair standby generators computer back up system emergency lights and more most batteries last two to three years not  to  months these are not “high quality batteries” as stated on their web pagetheir name says it all “sharks”  report is this review helpful cool    autokraftersmd   terrible foreign reseller  avoid at all costs walmartcom is a real company offers free shipping final pay screen wont calculate  phone calls  emails giving screen shots  minutes of excuses that their website is wrong  i should keep reentering my shipping info that is already shown with zip under the calculationthey wont process order without adding  to total cost because their website is stuck in default mode they refuse to sell what their website offers at the price shown on the screen  report is this review

battery i needed was a stxlbs my order arrived quickly but i did not have time to work on my bike immediately a couple days later i opened my package and was surprised that the battery didnt look like it would fit my bike i checked everything out and discovered the battery i received was not the same as the battery i ordered the battery i received was a stxabs the battery nomenclature is very similar only off by one letter but the form factor is much different i contacted battery shark customer service and they asked me to send a picture of the battery i received which i promptly did they very quickly emailed me back confirmed that they sent me the wrong battery and notified me that the correct battery has already been sent and gave me the tracking number for the new battery the new battery came quickly i was happy to see i received the right battery i installed it the next day and the bike started right up life is goodso my overall impression of battery sharks is they do right

steve knauss left john kurth and nan hillmeyer are up to their necks in connollys tom  jerry batter used in a traditional winter holiday cocktail the three took over production for upper lakes foods the current holders of the connollys recipe they make it in a large kitchen in superior and sell it at local super one and liquor stores bob king  rkingduluthnewscomits about this time of year when mark connolly gets a few messages from enthusiasts around the country looking for a product he hasnt been associated with for years but that still bears his family name connollys tom  jerry batter mark connollys father jack created the recipe in the back of his shop  connollys bakery a mainstay on belknap street in superior from the late s until the midslast week i just got a facebook message from someone in tennessee said connolly father of  hobey baker memorial award winner jack connolly he also hears from batter fans in las vegas and of course in duluth and superiorthe batter recipe which traditionally is mixed with a jigger of rum a jigger of brandy and hot water has been passed around a few industrial kitchens since the connolly family sold it in  the winter of  was the first since  without a fresh stock of connollys in the refrigerator case at local liquor and grocery storesnow its backa trio of local families has joined forces to whip the ingredients into frothy peaks at a kitchen in the superior business center steve knauss who owns thirsty pagan brewing in superior said he was approached by upper lakes foods the current holders of the recipe the cloquetbased company is in the distribution business and wanted someone to take on production of the batter john kurth and nan and michael hillmeyer also signed onits crazy good knauss saidthe product is made in batches that include  pounds of sugar mix and three gallons of eggs whipped in quart batches between august and the end of the holiday season they will have made  containers of the batter which is then distributed to super one and liquor storesas for comparisons to the original its the same recipe that has been used all along this crew isnt in the product development business knauss saidbelieve me he said we arent that creative its an excellent product created by people who knew what they were doing the wheels already been invented why redo itas a kid mark connolly put dollops into his hot chocolate as a teenager he made deliveries to local stores and as an adult just he and his father had the recipe committed to memory between november and new years eve connolly said the batter was in constant production at the back of the bakery and in a kitchen at the superior iga grocery store they were always aware of the competing brandsevery year there would be one or two new ones he said wed buy the other brand and check it out connollys had such a cult following it was so much better than anyone elses it had to do with the ingredients they had tweaked it to do it right what they had stumbled on was just a really good recipedespite his connection to the product connolly said he doesnt make it at home its a baking project and its better in bulk he saidthe science doesnt break down right he said i know whats in it i could take the ingredients and experiment with it and come up with something closejack connolly sold the recipe to paul heytens thenowner of the shack in superior upper lakes foods bought the recipe in the mids and it was produced by their ice cream manufacturer in alexandria minn eventually production went to cedar crest ice cream which is based in cedarburg wiswhen cedar crest stopped making it after the  season they were without a producerthe connollys tom  jerry batter from a superior standpoint is a wellknown product said susan ryan president of upper lakes foods and the recipe is very good people in this area really know it and like it and mr connolly who started it he really made a name for it in our communitiesthe new recipeholders had to go through trial and error with early batches and they checked in with heytens for tipsweve gotten a lot faster toward the end kurth saidnan hillmeyer said you know the batch is done when it shines and looks ready to crest over the top of the gallon mixerconnolly didnt know the product was back the batter reminds him of the years he spent working alongside his father and the busy holiday season for a small hometown bakery he saidfrom a nostalgia standpoint even though my family  other than the name  isnt part of it ive got a lot of good memories for sure explore related
