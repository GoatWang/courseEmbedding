i am asea craig lindner asea double diamond executive craig lindner was born raised and now lives on the big island of hawaii a custom home builder and real estate broker by profession craig has weathered the storms of being involved in both the real estate and construction industries in hawaii for him asea is a solid foundation because he knows that his returns will equal or exceed his efforts more importantly craig knows that with asea his ability to help others is magnified living on the beautiful island of hawaii is a dream come true however living in a place that’s a prime tourist destination also creates a unique economic climate with its own set of challenges “we’re isolated on a little island and the only way to generate enough income is to go out of state or to work more than one job” says craig for  years he was a custom home builder and real estate broker “i worked too much drank too much slept too little ate poorly and didn’t enjoy my work or the people i was working with it didn’t seem like there was any way out” he says for those  years craig was in a cycle—he would build a house sell it and then have to start over again “then the housing market changed and we couldn’t get loans or lines of credit and mortgages were impossible to get” he adds that’s when everything began to change for craig he was at a materials supply store and the store representative who was a friend of his told him about a new product “i had never seen her that excited about anything” he says “she gave me a bottle of asea and i signed up” after just three weeks craig noticed improvements in his health that’s when he got serious about the business potential of asea in november  he and a group of his colleagues flew in and met with asea founders verdis jim and gary and although craig’s initial draw to asea was based on his experience with the product his decision to become a business builder was rock solid after meeting with the founders “they shared their vision with us and i knew that i had the chance to get in at the starting gates with this company this meant there would be growing pains but it’s also the most rewarding time” he adds craig returned to hawaii and began sharing asea with others “the great thing about living in hawaii is that we’re a tight community and everyone here has connections to friends and family on the mainland or other parts of the world” he says those connections are strong and helped craig to reach out to his own community and beyond in february  craig and his team opened an asea training center in hilo for their weekly meetings he says “we also got involved locally by having booths at concerts and fairs and participating in the walks for cancer awareness” as craig focused his efforts and time on helping others with their health and new asea businesses he noticed something—his own life was transforming the changes for good in craig’s life have created a ripple effect throughout his entire family and for that reason he affectionately calls asea hope in a bottle “life before asea wasn’t too good now my life has completely changed—there’s no way to explain it i have total time freedom i met a good woman i have good relationships with my family members and many of them are in the business now” when craig’s dad was sick he was able to go home and spend six weeks with him before he passed away all while his asea business continued to grow “there’s no way i could have ever been able to do that when i was building homes i’m just so grateful” craig adds “i’ve always wanted to be a part of something where i could make a difference and now i can with asea i never had that opportunity with real estate you sell a house you help one family you help people with asea you help a community it makes a big difference” asea’s business model of helping others is an environment in which craig thrives and he is thankful for the mentoring he received from his upline leader paul taira “paul has traveled with me to help me build my business and he has taught me a lot about network marketing and health i’ve gone from drinking too much and eating poorly to now being conscious about my habits and i’ve lost  pounds” craig also appreciates the training and focus on personal development that asea has provided him “reading the book the anatomy of peace was a big deal for me because it allowed me to negotiate my way out of a partnership of  years and get to where i am now i’ve discovered that life is a lot of fun if you don’t make yourself miserable and don’t get in your own way” now craig’s ambition is to help others to experience the freedom and happiness that comes from increased health wellness and a solid income stream from asea he and asea leader merle lam are working with a local preacher to help single moms build a successful income “we have set up a training center and a store at the church so when the women bring their children in for preschool they have the opportunity to be trained and work in the store sharing asea with others” he continues “with this product and technology i can teach my team that they can reach people all over the world” for craig telling others about asea can be summed up in three words—drink care share “if you drink asea and care about people then you’ll start sharing it with them if you don’t drink it then you have nothing to begin with everyone can recommend their favorite restaurant this is the same thing” craig also tells his team members “don’t ever quit we were at a concert the other night and we saw people who were  feet away from enjoying a free concert because they got tired and stopped walking it’s the same with this business—people quit too soon oftentimes when they’re only one or two people away from complete freedom” with asea this double diamond executive is finally able to build something he is excited about putting his whole heart into—a future of helping others build a solid foundation with asea “my outlook has never been better” he exclaims “i have experienced more happiness freedom and personal growth in these last three years than i ever imagined asea has transformed my life and to see how asea is transforming the lives of others is a really emotionally rewarding thing it’s a great celebration” related american financial group coceo craig lindner insurance reimbursements for

coceo of american financial group inc a cincinnatibased insurance company said today that it was shocking and illogical that reimbursements from most major insurance carriers and the federal government dont come close to covering the cost of treating people with mental illness lindner the founder and chairman of the board of uc healths lindner center of hope a nonprofit mental health hospital in mason said the economic impact of mental illness is staggering enlarge craig lindner is coceo of american financial group he added that cincinnati might have trouble attracting the best doctors possible if insurance reimbursements remain low not just for treating mental illness but also cancer and heart disease cincinnatibased american financial group specializes in property and casualty insurance as well as annuities not health insurance as the coceo of a major company i am well aware of the need to control health care costs lindner said but there is a fine line beyond which we are not taking appropriate responsibility for our employees health i am hopeful that our business leaders understand where that line is lindner addressed the topic while giving the keynote speech during this years duffey conway ethical leadership series breakfast at the westin hotel downtown which was sponsored by mount st joseph university the lindner center which opened in  and is the rd largest hospital in the tristate draws patients from throughout the country and around the world it recently kicked off a  million capital campaign to expand programs and services the business side of a mental health hospital has been shocking to me lindner told the audience of about  people reimbursements from most major carriers and the federal government do not come close to covering the real cost of treatment lindner said there is no relationship between demand for services and reimbursement rates the quality of care does not impact reimbursement rates as a businessman none of this is logical to me lindner said cincinnati has excellent medical care available but lags behind much of the rest of the nation is reimbursement rates in cincinnati mental health care reimbursements are in the bottom  percent in the nation lindner said and it is my understanding that reimbursements for many other medical services … such as care for heart disease cancer et cetera are in the bottom  percent if that continues i believe it will be difficult long term to attract the top doctors and to have facilities that are competitive with other cities that have much stronger reimbursements he said in may the lindner center of hope completed a  million addition which opened up space to begin a shortterm residential program to diagnose and treat children with mental health and addiction issues the center which partners with cincinnati childrens hospital medical center offers a similar program for adults low reimbursements make it very challenging to provide quality care and have a sustainable business model lindner said i now understand why mental health care is so deficient in this country he called psychiatric disorders the nations no  public health problem affecting an estimated  percent of americans  or older depression alone affects  million americans the economic impact of mental illness in terms of direct and indirect costs in lost productivity is staggering lindner said mental illness is highly treatable but undertreated thats principally due to stigma and the lack of access to quality mental health services the goal of the lindner center of hope is to address the unmet need in greater cincinnati he said i believe that excellent health care is vital to a strong community and an important consideration when people are deciding where they want to live or when companies decide where to locate lindner said after his speech lindner told me that business leaders should work with politicians to try to rectify the problem of low reimbursements while acknowledging that most members of congress appear disinclined to spend more on health care lindner said the cost of not giving proper care and treatment is far higher than giving a good quality of care cincinnati oh industry news  cincinnati business courier menu select a city national albany albuquerque atlanta austin baltimore birmingham boston buffalo charlotte chicago cincinnati columbus
