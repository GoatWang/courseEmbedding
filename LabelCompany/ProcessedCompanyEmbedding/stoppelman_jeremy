case to launch an online successor to the yellow pages but something funny happened shortly after jeremy stoppelman’s project yelp went live its users embraced the site’s “write a review” feature to a degree far greater than anticipated a few weeks of hasty recoding later yelp was reconfigured to make reviewing its raison d’être and stoppelman has never looked back ten years after its founding yelp

reviewing under the profile name big papa he has waxed enthusiastic over the renaissance salon in his current hometown of san francisco “my last haircut generated mucho complimentos”  and panned frankfurt’s airport an “authentic interpretation of dante’s inferno” among the happiest discoveries he has made by perusing yelp reviews is the existence of the seward street slides in san francisco’s castro district “it’s basically these two concrete slides in a quiet residential neighborhood” he says “you zip down them sitting on top of flattened cardboard boxes i’d be curious to learn the history of these slides because they’re like not at all safe”he initially resisted the push to name his company yelp because to him it sounded like “a sad cry for help” he preferred the name yocal rhyming with “local” he grew up in the virginia suburbs of washington dc the son of a securities lawyer and a teacher and attended langley high school just down the road from the headquarters of the

representatives shake down smallbusiness owners offering better placement of positive reviews andor the burying of negative reviews in exchange for ad purchases—a charge that stoppelman flatly denies

anything session last year he did not respond in kindhe accepts the invective hurled his way as the cost of creating a “disruptive gamechanging service or product” likening the heat yelp takes to that

tuesday june   in san francisco calif photo russell yip the chronicle yelps jeremy stoppelman a profile    back to gallery jeremy stoppelman was on a conference call with venture capitalists when an assistant slipped him a note steve jobs is on the line stoppelman quietly left the room at yelp headquarters in downtown san francisco it was january  and google wanted to buy yelp the online crowdsourced review site on the phone jobs urged stoppelman who revered the apple chief as a visionary to stay independent and not sell out to google jobs was not a fan of google and had accused the search giant of stealing apples smartphone and tablet technology at that point we had already turned down google stoppelman said but steve liked yelp and wanted to make sure about google it was a moment where i said this is crazy what just happened  latest news videos for stoppelman who is  and cofounded yelp in october  the crazy moments have only continued after his company went public this spring when the young entrepreneur pushed the button to ring the opening bell on the new york stock exchange stoppelman received another call  this one from president obama congratulating him today yelp has a market capitalization of about  billion and stoppelmans  percent stake is valued at more than  million the company which started in san francisco as a vague idea about local now has  million unique monthly visitors and has expanded to  countries stoppelman is an undisputed junior titan of silicon valley soughtafter nerd he also has the canonical startup story he was the kid who loved to tinker who inadvertently blew a few things up and charred the walls with his experiments who learned programming in middle school earned his bachelors degree in computer engineering and then headed west  arriving in san francisco at the start of the dotcom boom he was the kid who became a soughtafter nerd and was  after his second job out of college  given  million to sit around a soma loft with a dozen people and a dog and dream up the next big thing the rule in the incubator was that wed play around and come up with crazy ideas said max levchin a ukraineborn computer scientist who cofounded the online payment system paypal where stoppelman worked as his second job out of college it was a hacker commune and the idea was to build great products levchin whose paypal was sold to ebay for  billion in  remembers the day stoppelman and another former paypal engineer russ simmons landed on the concept that would become yelp it was my th birthday and we were at the slanted door in the ferry building levchin said jeremy and russ had been talking about doing something with local review or local search and were asking questions like how do you get your friends to help you find the best plumber or doctor or nicest restaurant close by over lunch i could see russ and jeremy at the other end of the table just scheming after lunch they said they thought theyd figured it out ranking of businesses returning to the incubator on mission near third street levchin listened as stoppelman and simmons explained their inchoate idea of an email type of product where you ask your friends to help you come up with a ranking of businesses i thought it might work but it might not levchin said i backed them because i believed in russ and jeremy russ is an amazing developer and engineer and jeremy is just really smart and really tenacious with a lot of good stubbornness their idea was good but of course it was not what yelp ended up being which is very common with startups elon musk another paypal founder said he always considered yelp a cool idea musk had done something similar with a company called zip which he founded after dropping out of stanford graduate school to provide local online content to news organizations someone needed to do user reviews right said musk who went on to run tesla motors and cofound spacex which recently made history by having the first commercial spaceship complete a mission to the international space station effectively yelp is fulfilling a much better function than the yellow pages ever did musk said what jeremy did was come up with an unmet need to know about local businesses and services stoppelman who spent his early childhood in arlington va before his family moved to nearby mclean  his middle school was next to cia headquarters  said his interest in computers started in the fifth grade his mother lynn was an english teacher before she began a marketing business out of their home and his father john was a securities lawyer i think my dad did legal work for someone who had a packard bell  and they couldnt pay him so they gave him a computer stoppelman said sitting in a yelp conference room his vizsla named darwin at his side i was initially not allowed to touch it but that didnt last long i started tinkering with it and there were many times i screwed up the computer he got his own personal computer an amiga  when he was in the th grade and he was soon convinced that hed be a video game programmer when he grew up in high school he took programming classes in turbo pascal a software development system but the young stoppelman was equally interested in business and investing his father took small companies public and talked about stocks jeremy was  when he opened a schwab account and bought stocks with money earned mowing lawns or picking up pinecones when he arrived at the university of illinois he was interested in both finance and engineering he thought the business majors looked like they were having fun and the engineering majors looked like they were enduring torture he chose engineering and graduated in  arriving in the valley i was interviewing for jobs really as the bubble was getting started stoppelman said when he came out for an interview at a startup calledhome network a highspeed cable internet service he was struck by what he saw driving to the interview i was driving down highway  and id see these billboards for engineering tools like fpga an integrated circuit i thought this is a very hardcore place if people can afford billboards to advertise esoteric technologies that the average person would have no clue about within three weeks of being hired as a software engineer athome hed finished his work and found there was nothing else for him to do id go to my boss and say i was done hed say ok come back at  id come back and hed be gone it was a messedup company he stayed for four months all the while having his phone ring every day with recruiters i thought it was stupid to be with a big company stoppelman said i found my way to xcom the precursor to paypal where i interviewed with elon musk i didnt know these guys existed yet the yearold ceo this senior guy who has the crazy twinkle in his eye and hes telling me how his company is going to take down visa and mastercard id just never seen this before i thought of companies as big organizations that hired grayhaired ceos i was like whoa i want to learn from this guy so i ended up as the third engineer hired i stayed for   years when ebay purchased paypal stoppelman was ready for something different and he enrolled at harvard business school i came back to san francisco for the summer after my first year at harvard and was originally going to work for peter thiel the third paypal founder who had started a hedge fund called clarium capital we had been in touch and he said well find something for you to do so i went to his office and was filling out paperwork and peter said i was talking to max levchin and he has this new incubator thing brewing so i went over to  mission and max said great hang out here just brainstorm until you come up with something  stoppelman had every intention of returning to harvard in the fall jeremy was doing well in business school and his goal was to get under his belt the basics of business theory so he could be a wellrounded ceo to start his own company levchin recalled but when jeremy and russ had this idea that came together over my birthday lunch i said to jeremy you can hit the snooze button on the alarm clock of life or this can be the big alarm i told him he was ready and that this was a huge opportunity that  if he hit the snooze button  it would go away stoppelman said when max committed  million to us to basically two guys with an idea we had our are you for real or are you a phony moment stoppelman dropped out of harvard when yelp was started in  it was a social network built around asking friends for recommendations we got some early press on it stoppelman said but mostly people said its a cool concept but in practice its still easier just to email your friends directly while disappointed stoppelman and simmons began to look at how people had used the new site they landed on something interesting a change in plans we had added a feature literally as an afterthought stoppelman said russ asked me should we have a way people can write a review without being asked a question i said sure no one is going to use it but sure tuck it in there what we found after the failed launch was that writing reviews was popular we realized we had missed something there we began to build a new site that was all about making review writing fun the new yelp was launched in february  and began to take off immediately by june  it had  million unique visitors per month the site became popular in san francisco but then came the question of scalability stoppelman recalled people told us oh this will work in san francisco but not in a place like new york  yelp was rolled out in boston then chicago then los angeles and new york very early on they hit on the idea of a yelp elite squad where the most prolific yelpers were invited to social events the gatherings held sometimes once a week at bars and restaurants turned an online experience into a community of like minds the problem yelp faces today stoppelman noted is the same problem that google faces in its rankings several lawsuits have been filed by business owners against yelp reviewers and allegations of illegitimate reviews have dogged the company you are going to have people who are unhappy with the reviews or the placement stoppelman said rest assured our engineers are working every day to make sure reviews are unbiased and accurate daily routine unchanged on a recent day stoppelman who is unmarried and lives in the marina heads out on a walk along crissy field with darwin in slimfitting jeans slim blazer a checked buttondown and aviator shades he said that while his life is dotted with crazy moments  the calls from steve jobs or the president  his daily existence hasnt changed much his small desk at work is set in the midst of everyone elses he still likes checking out new bars and restaurants is a voracious reader of nonfiction a recent book was moonwalking with einstein the art and science of remembering everything and hes taking an online course to learn how to play the guitar his yearold brother michael is vice president of engineering at yelp and his mother was recently out for a visit his father died in  walking along the windswept path of crissy field stoppelman said he is looking now at how big yelp can be we are a successful us company but can we be global will the things that work here work in japan in china they all represent a different challenge looking out at the sweeping golden gate bridge stoppelman said as a kid i harbored this fantasy of starting a company i looked at the entrepreneur column in forbes i looked at it every month and thought i want to be that guy  the day yelp went public is a day hell never forget it was this euphoric feeling of pushing the button to turn on the bell and it was like that moment on the roller coaster going chaching chaching chaching and then im on squawk box and jim cramer is yelling at me and three panelists are hitting me with questions it was high stress but fun my mom was up there with me on the platform she was pretty fired up i dont know if it gets much better than that julian guthrie is a

cofounder of yelpupdated w ago · featured in forbes and inc · upvoted by saravanan ganesh software engineer at google present and jesse collins former software engineer intern at yelp i think at this point everyone can agree that google search and it’s associated adwords business is a monopoly in every sense of the word on the web they’re probably well over  of the market and on mobile it’s nearly  while operating a monopoly is not illegal it does mean your operations and conduct are subject to additional rules regulations and scrutiny primarily to ensure you’re not maintaining that monopoly illegally from my perspective there is no question that google is both harming consumers and illegally defending their monopoly by restricting distribution of key comp more in what areas does yelp have the most room for growth   jeremy stoppelman ceo and cofounder of yelpanswered w ago · featured in huffpost · upvoted by laurence wilson general counsel at yelpconsumer adoption and advertiser growth remain low hanging fruit while most of us here know yelp and well yelp only has unaided brand awareness of about  among digital adults in the us similarly we only have about a third penetration among smartphone users and we have about  million monthly users of our mobile app that is a lot of opportunity to make more consumers aware of yelp and get them using the yelp appon the local business front there are about  million local businesses in the us and about  million in the countries where yelp exists only  businesses currentl more how would you compare yelps product development team to others google facebook etc   jeremy stoppelman ceo and cofounder of yelpanswered w ago · upvoted by jesse collins and kelvin ho former product manager at google in a recent internal engagement survey  of our employees said yelp was a great place to work im really proud of the culture weve built and imho its a very special place almost all of our managers and leadership team has been home grown and we pride ourselves on developing our own talent whenever possible our engineering internship program has been a huge success through the years and i think our oncampus reputation at top universities backs that up generally product and engineering folks would have wider ranging responsibilities than at other major tech brands for example whe more given the seemingly arbitrary yelp sorted reviews how can they prove that yelp doesnt rate paid advertisers preferentially   jeremy stoppelman ceo and cofounder of yelpanswered w ago · featured in huffpost · upvoted by laurence wilson works at yelpevery day our automated software goes through the more than  million reviews that have been submitted to yelp to select the most useful and reliable content unlike many other sites our stance is quality over quantity when it comes to reviews as a result we only recommend about  of the reviews that are submitted if advertisers could control their reviews then you’d expect them all to have perfect star ratings on yelp spoiler alert they don’t to test this do a few searches in broad categories in your area  maybe for a dentist mattress or locksmith you’ll find ads for busi more has any rogue yelp salesman ever been caught extorting a small business   jeremy stoppelman ceo and cofounder of yelpanswered w ago · upvoted by luther lowe works at yelp and andrew martinezfonts works at yelpno we’ve never caught a sales rep threatening to lower a business’s rating if the business didn’t buy advertising that may surprise conspiracy theorists who love the yelp extortion meme but it doesn’t really surprise us we have a range of controls in place to prevent this sort of thing and my best guess is that we are far ahead of anyone else in the industry on this issue precisely because we’ve been in the spotlight for so long  many of our controls are obvious like making sure that sales reps don’t have administrative access to post and remove reviews  others are a little less obv more whats the solution to san franciscos housing shortage   jeremy stoppelman ceo and cofounder of yelpanswered w ago · upvoted by andy anderson lives in san francisco ca and jay wacker lived in the bay area since build baby build nimbys have dominated the development conversation in major cities across the nation this problem is particularly acute in san francisco where economic and population growth have been robust but building hasnt remotely kept up while antidevelopment groups and voices often older and wealthier have long been heard both at various city meetings and through voting young people often dont vote and arent particularly well organized this ultimately means their views arent fairly represented which is why ive financially backed sfbarf a prorenters group that advocate more are restaurants afraid to be unique and take risks because theyre slaves to yelp reviews   jeremy stoppelman ceo and cofounder of yelpanswered w agonate silver did a study comparing yelp restaurant ratings to michelin which relies on professional critics and found them to be quite similar while yelp represents a new way to get reliable recommendations on restaurants and other businesses the idea of publicly critiquing is nothing new and yelp is unlikely to have had a negative impact on the creativity of chefs and food entrepreneurs if anything it gives a new and powerful way for nontraditional food providers like food trucks to market themselves since yelp isnt limited to the high endk views ·  upvoteswhat do you think of google my business listings and reviews   jeremy stoppelman ceo and cofounder of yelpanswered w agoi think its a weak product that generally does consumers a disservice there are much more trusted and reliable ratingsreview resources available across the web and mobile and its a real shame that those options are buried under inferior houseowned google results perhaps its easiest to show by example lets take a popular newish restaurant in san francisco liholiho yacht club yelp has  detailed reviews our ratings have meaty text explaining whats behind the stars and over  photos of the food drinks and business google locals page has  reviews and  of these have more what is yelps strategy for addressing businesses that offer incentives for positive reviews   jeremy stoppelman ceo and cofounder of yelpanswered w agowe have a number of ways of attacking this the first line of defense is our recommendation algorithm it can spot unusual activity and reviews are automatically moved to the not recommended section off the page obviously if youre a business owner providing a valuable incentive for a positive review and those reviews dont stick to your business page you wont be happy with the outcome and most likely will stop doing it we also run sting operations and will post evidence and a prominent consumer alert on the business pagek views ·  upvoteshow can yelp positively affect small business and help them grow

customers on their platform such as a dashboard filled with analytics online ordering with no setup fee a great mobile app and more if your business has a poor yelp rating because of a few biased reviews here are three steps you can take to improve itaddress the “heavily biased” reviews below are my recommendations for addressing negative reviews depending on the reason you feel they’re “heavily biased”the review is fake not only is the author not a customer you believe they are a competitor disgruntled employee etcrespond to the review publicly with proof that the review is fake your reply should be professional  matteroffact take the highroad and don’t write anything that reflects negatively on you or your business remember you’re composing this response to inform your customers not to insult your competition or former employeeflag the review by logging into either the yelp for business owners mobile app or website and clicking “report this review” provide as much relevant and factual information for the moderator that will be evaluating the validity of your claim follow up with an email to feedbackyelpcomthe review is from an actual customer although you feel the review is totally biased and nottrue it was written by a one of your leads or customerssend a private message to the customer who left the review respond diplomatically and thank the reviewer for their feedback perhaps this is a simple misunderstanding that can be rectified and possibly lead to the customer leaving an updated reviewif that doesn’t work respond publicly potential customers will

serving up this steaming pile of celebrity gossip gay politics gay news and pointless bitchery since  toggle navigation how yelp ceo jeremy stoppelman created a revolutionary product he was just another gangly web  kid with a good job in silicon valley at paypal and a big dream in his case to launch an online successor to the yellow pages but something funny happened shortly after jeremy stoppelman’s project yelp went live its users embraced the site’s “write a review” feature to a degree far greater than anticipated a few weeks of hasty recoding later yelp was reconfigured to make reviewing its raison d’être and stoppelman has never looked back ten years after its founding yelp is the web’s premier site and app for customer reviews—not just of restaurants but of shops kiosks food trucks parks bus lines funeral homes dmv offices and even human attractions the naked cowboy in times square was averaging four stars out of five at press time herewith some info gleaned from a meandering conversation with the yelp ceo who turns  this novemberhe is himself an avid yelper reviewing under the profile name big papa he has waxed enthusiastic over the renaissance salon in his current hometown of san francisco “my last haircut generated mucho complimentos”  and panned frankfurt’s airport an “authentic interpretation of dante’s inferno” among the happiest discoveries he has made by perusing yelp reviews is the existence of the seward street slides in san francisco’s castro district “it’s basically these two concrete slides in a quiet residential neighborhood” he says “you zip down them sitting on top of flattened cardboard boxes i’d be curious to learn the history of these slides because they’re like not at all safe”he initially resisted the push to name his company yelp because to him it sounded like “a sad cry for help” he preferred the name yocal rhyming with “local” he grew up in the virginia suburbs of washington dc the son of a securities lawyer and a teacher and attended langley high school just down the road from the headquarters of the cia among his schoolmates were a son of antonin scalia’s and some kids who were curiously vague about what their parents did for a livinghe is—notwithstanding the fact that google’s autocomplete function suggests the words “jeremy stoppelman indian” when you enter his name into the search field—a jewish american of european ancestry who attended a reform temple as a child and had a bar mitzvah he attributes the frequent misperception of his ethnicity to his “black hair and dark skin tone”he played tennis as a youth and was often told that he looked like pete samprashis first computer—his family’s actually—was an amiga  a littleremembered lates highend pc with “unbelievable sound and graphics capabilities” that to this day he feels doesn’t get its duehis younger brother michael is yelp’s vice president in charge of engineering his older brother andy two years his senior died abruptly on the eve of his highschool graduation in  of a rare heartrhythm disorder that experience jeremy says made him realize that “life is very short and you have to make the most of it”he is frequently vilified by critics who claim that yelp is a protection racket whose sales representatives shake down smallbusiness owners offering better placement of positive reviews andor the burying of negative reviews in exchange for ad purchases—a charge that stoppelman flatly denies noting that all the lawsuits brought against yelp to this effect have been dismissedhe was called a “scumbag” a “dick” and “full of shit” among other things when he participated in a reddit ask me anything session last year he did not respond in kindhe accepts the invective hurled his way as the cost of creating a “disruptive gamechanging service or product” likening the heat yelp takes to that felt by airbnb visàvis the hotel industry and uber visàvis the taxicab industryhe has met three current or former heads of state two us presidents barack obama and bill clinton and the taoiseach of ireland enda kennyby anonymousreply  thats uhmaaaaazingby anonymousreply  purple gang by anonymousreply  yelp sucks
