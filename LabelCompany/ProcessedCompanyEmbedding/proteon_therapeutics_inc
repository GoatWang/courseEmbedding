use privacy policy back to top our programs proteonsearch our programs we are developing investigational therapies to address some of the most urgent needs of hemodialysis and peripheral artery disease patients with the goal of redefining how these diseases are treated technology overview based on clinical and nonclinical studies we believe that a onetime local application of investigational vonapanitase to the external surface of the blood vessels during fistula surgical creation may enhance outward vascular remodeling and inhibit neointimal hyperplasia thereby reducing the risk of fistula failure for a fistula to become usable for hemodialysis the outflow vein experiences an increase in diameter and blood flow this process known as vascular remodeling involves proliferation of cells in the vessel wall secretion of proteases that degrade extracellular matrix and synthesis of new extracellular matrix by these cells fistulas fail to become usable for dialysis or experience patency loss most commonly due to progressive scarring of the interior wall of the outflow vein near the lumen resulting in stenosis of the vein lumen and obstruction of blood flow in the fistula this form of vascular scarring known as neointimal hyperplasia typically occurs in response to vessel injury such as manipulation of blood vessels during fistula creation the mechanical stress to the vein wall from the sudden and turbulent increase in blood flow or from corrective procedures to restore blood flow the response of the vein to these injuries results in activation and recruitment of scar forming cells which multiply and migrate from the outside wall to the inside wall of the blood vessel and produce a layer of tissue creating a narrowing in the vein lumen and a reduction in fistula blood flow we demonstrated through nonclinical studies that vonapanitase at the concentrations being studied in arteriovenous fistulas causes partial fragmentation of elastin fibers primarily in the adventitial outer layer of the vessel wall elastin fragmentation generates peptides in the adventitia that are chemoattractants for cells possessing elastin receptors including cells involved in vascular remodeling and the formation of neointimal hyperplasia the generation of chemoattractant peptides in the adventitia may thereby increase cells in the adventitia promoting outward vascular remodeling in experiment models fragmentation of elastin is an early and essential event in outward vascular remodeling the generation of chemoattractant peptides in the adventitia may also reduce cell migration to the vessel lumen focusing the healing response to vessel injury to the adventitial layer and inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia vonapanitase has also been shown to lead to vessel dilation when administered at a sufficient concentration programs investigational vonapanitase in chronic kidney disease investigational vonapanitase in peripheral artery disease our lead drug

vascular access patients with chronic kidney disease ckd requiring hemodialysis must have a functioning vascular access that provides sufficiently high blood flow to complete a dialysis session in approximately four hours vascular access is a hemodialysis patient’s lifeline without which a patient cannot receive this lifesaving treatment the preferred form of vascular access is a radiocephalic

inadequate blood flow or cannot be successfully cannulated up to  will experience either a thrombosis or undergo a corrective procedure to restore or maintain blood flow primary patency loss in

abandonment are severe including a reduction in dialysis adequacy one or more surgical procedures to create a new vascular access and prolonged exposure to dialysis catheters the worst form of vascular access due to the increased risk of infection hospitalization and death we are currently conducting a pivotal phase  clinical trial evaluating whether a single topical administration of investigational vonapanitase can improve radiocephalic fistula outcomes we are not aware of any products approved in the us or europe that would compete with vonapanitase for the improvement of

improvement and healthcare professionals have the tools they need to improve patient outcomes overview proteon therapeutics is a latestage biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of patients and families affected by kidney and vascular diseases our goal is to address some of the most urgent needs of patients by developing potentially transformative solutions that redefine how these diseases are treated our lead product candidate vonapanitase is a firstinclass investigational drug intended to treat vessel injury that leads to blood vessel blockage and reduced blood flow vonapanitase is currently being evaluated in a pivotal phase  clinical study in hemodialysis vascular access vonapanitase has received breakthrough fast track and orphan drug designations from the us food and drug administration fda and orphan medicinal product designation from the european commission for hemodialysis vascular access indications for people with chronic kidney disease ckd requiring hemodialysis a functioning vascular access is their lifeline to care enabling connection to a dialysis machine three times per week for lifesaving blood cleansing the preferred form of vascular access is a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula created in the forearm unfortunately up to  of radiocephalic fistulas will be abandoned within one year of surgical creation and more than  will fail to be used for hemodialysis the clinical consequences of fistula abandonment are severe including a reduction in dialysis adequacy one or more surgical procedures to create a new vascular access and prolonged exposure to dialysis catheters the worst form of vascular access due to the increased risk of infection hospitalization and death we are currently conducting a pivotal phase  clinical trial evaluating whether a single topical administration of investigational vonapanitase can improve radiocephalic fistula outcomes we are not aware of any products approved in the us or europe that would compete with vonapanitase for the improvement of secondary patency time to abandonment and fistula use for hemodialysis vonapanitase is also being studied in patients with peripheral arterial disease pad patients with pad suffer from a blockage in the arteries providing blood to the legs which may result in impaired walking ability leg pain and gangrene and ultimately amputation many patients undergo invasive revascularization procedures to treat the blockage but these procedures have poor longterm durability resulting in the potential for repeat interventions symptom recurrence and disease progression building on prior phase  results our current phase  clinical trial is evaluating whether a single local administration of vonapanitase can reduce the symptoms of pad in patients
