your animalchoosing the right vet for your pet can be tough after all your furry friend cant tell you how he or she feels about the doctor even though youre not the one treated by the vet whoever your animal sees is obviously your decision since many veterinary diseases and injuries can turn into emergencies very quickly its important to have a goto vet this way you can ensure youll know whom to see when your animal needs carespeak to your friends and family about vets whove treated their pets you can even talk to your groomer or an animal shelter worker for referrals when you visit the clinics youve been referred to check that the facility is clean animals are separated and the staff is calm and courteous not all clinics are american animal hospital association accredited this accreditation isnt a legal necessity though a clinic thats aahaaccredited is guaranteed to offer highquality medical care to receive accreditation the clinic has to meet the aahas standards in the areas of facility equipment and quality careif youre looking for a specialist you want to make sure he or she is boardcertified to practice in that specific area of animal medicine youll want to make sure your vet is also convenient to visit so there are factors to take into accountlook for a vet whos close to your house as many animals dont like being in the car for a long time if theres an emergency you want to make sure you can get your pet to the vet as quickly as possible though all veterinary clinics must be able to make arrangements to see their clients pets outside of office hours if theres an emergency these arrangements may not always be at the facility youre used to double check with the office to see where the emergency facility issome clinics have longer hours than others if you work a  schedule make sure the office is open on nights and weekendswhether you have pet health insurance or not its still worth checking what the regular costs for typical procedures are at the vets office there isnt a set standard when it comes to price so its good to know that youre not looking into a clinic thats beyond your meansthe type of animal you own should play a part in which vet you choose as well while your options are vast if you have a dog or cat you may have to visit an avian clinic for your bird or an exotics clinic for your snaketypes of vetsjust as there are many types of doctors there are many types of vets some focus on livestock or house pets while others may specialize in dentistry or surgery they may work in a veterinary clinic or zoo working specifically with the animals housed there or travel to farms to work with livestock since horse racing and other equestrian activities are so popular some vets are trained to work just with horsesdiseases like malaria and yellow fever are also transmitted through animals some vets have insight to diseases that affect both humans and animals vets have contributed to the treatment and cure of many diseases that plagued both humans and their furry friendsgovernment agencies employ veterinarians as well when an animal comes from a foreign land these vets quarantine them and check for any diseases that may be present in an effort to control new diseases that can be brought into the country other specific types of vets includeprivate practice veterinarians this is the most popular type of veterinarian and many of these professionals work at clinics they may also go to farms to care for livestock that cant be transported to the clinicteaching and research these vets work at veterinary schools training students who are planning on joining the veterinary field they may also work in college labs conducting research pertaining to animal healthregulatory medicine these vets work closely with diseases rather than animals themselves their responsibilities include controlling or eliminating illnesses and protecting the public from diseases in animals they may also work with the us department of agricultures food safety and inspection servicespublic health these vets are also known as epidemiologists they work for cities counties states or federal agencies to help control and prevent animal and human disease public health vets may work for the fda to determine the safety of medicines and food additivesuniformed services the us army veterinary corps employ these vets theyre responsible for biomedical research and developmentprivate industry these vets go to school solely for positions in pharmaceutical and biomedical research they work in labs that produce chemicals drugs and vaccines for both humans and animalswhat do veterinary assistants doa vet assistant works alongside the veterinarian and helps out around the clinic in some cases they may assist vets in surgery or restrain struggling animals during tests or lab work the everyday duties of a veterinary assistant include monitoring and caring for animals after surgery keeping medical records cleaning animals teeth feeding and bathing them cleaning cages sterilizing surgical equipment giving animals medication collecting samples for testing and performing laboratory tests and offering grief counseling to pet ownerswhat to expect at the vets officeits a good idea to bring your pet to the vet regularly this way he or she becomes familiar and comfortable with the care providers and you can stay on top of your pets preventative care if the animal is small enough bring it to the office in a carrier just as you visit the doctor for a yearly check up you should bring in your pet for regular check ups as well during a routine veterinary visit the vet will probably begin by asking you if there have been any changes in your pets behavior or habits the vet will then take your pets vitals like weight temperature pulse and respiration rate and perform a physical examination of the pet during a physical exam the vet checks the abdomen for swollen organs and the legs feet and joints for any potential problems depending on the age breed or condition of your pet your veterinarian may also check the eyes ears and mouthwhen your vet conducts a full body examination he or she will check out your pets coat and skin noting any hair loss itchy spots or lumps keep note of your animals shedding habits so you can let the vet know if anything seems abnormal the vet will check for parasites fleas ticks mites and heartworms as well  vaccinations are also important to your pet especially if you have a cat or a dog and your vet will suggest that you make sure theyre current keeping up to date with vaccinations can prevent your furry friend from getting distemper rabies hepatitis and lyme disease some vaccinations last longer than others so speak to your doctor about staying caught up with your animals shots cost and insurancejust like your own health insurance you want to make sure your animal is covered before he or she needs veterinary services some common animal surgeries can cost thousands of dollars and you dont want to end up having to foot a surprise bill that costs more than your paycheck theres no set price for pet health insurance costs can depend on factors such as where you live the age and breed of your pet and how much coverage you want before you take out a pet insurance policy youll want to meet with your vet to go over what he or she thinks your animal should be covered for many vets believe that you should make sure cancer chronic disease hereditary and congenital disease and common breedrelated medical conditions are all addressed in your policysome pet owners cant afford insurance for their pet so there are other options to make paying for surprise pet visits as easy as possible some pet stores have wellness plans  which tend to be much cheaper than an insurance policy  that offer shots check ups screenings and discounts on various procedures your pet may need a lot of veterinary offices offer payment plans for pricey procedures as well as long as you have decent credit history for a lastditch option there are even privately funded organizations that offer pet owners financial aid for their pets treatments

clinweve been coming to this clinic since it was a small little building the staff is nice and helpful i dont know why people complain they probably have attitudes with the staff or something well aside from the staff being nice and helpful the doctors there are great if you know who to choose ive had the same  doctors for years great amazing people and they scolded us too about feeding our pets human food but hey you know what they are right human food is very bad for your pets so if your dogcat is dying and your too stubborn to stop spoiling it with human food well then its probably your fault its dying in the first place they saved our  year old chihuahua who had failing kidneys she is still with us thanks to them and for those who lost pets do not blame a vet for being terse and uncaring they are vets do you want them to lie and say quotshell livequot instead of hurting your feelings by saying quotshe wont make itquot honestly losing a pet is terrible but dont say theyre quotuncaringquot just because they wont give a dozen roses and a tearful apology i would recommend this place and if your unsure just go and check it out its more of a hispanic place so if people that complained about this place arent hispanic then their reviews do not surprise me also my dog got parvo when he was about a year old if they had been the terrible uncaring doctors people said they were then my dog wouldnt be  years old and crazy today banfield pet hospitalivy ratedfirst off i had scheduled a sfirst off i had scheduled a same day appointment for morgan who is a collie mixolder not only did they schedule it for the same day but they also squeezed in my other dog daphne a rottweilerlab mix daphne is not very social but after getting to know you will love you forever from the moment we walked in the door the receptionist welcomed us greeted the dogs then went to get them a water bowl daphne was comfortable yet excited as a matter of fact other professionals came up to greet us and introduced themselves to all of us this is one of the few times i havent had to worry about either dog barking or becoming defensive the staff was wonderful and worked around my schedule even in such short notice the girls needed vaccinations and i was up against a time crunch because i was boarding the dogs and needed to take care of this anyway theyre both very spoiled indoor dogs whom i absolutely adore and love with all my heart for the first time in years im going on vacation and cannot bring my babies with me this will be the first time weve been apart for a day much less a week lol but just wanted to thank the staff and anyone looking for a affordable yet professional clinic to take your pet i would highly recommend the folks at banfield i smiled the whole time i was there long drive dog  cat hospitalslinkiee ratedi have been taking my pets to dr shelby and his staff for over  years i see some reviews that say that this clinic is uncaring but believe me this is

always been courteous to me and those that have been in the clinic with me at the time i am there i have sat waiting for testing results many times and observed their customer service techniques they are sweet compassionate people who see so much ugliness come off the streets having to deal with people who dont realize that pets are living creatures who deserve good vet treatment they see neglect abuse apathy they take all of this in stride and do the best they can to see that every pet is taken care of and every customer is satisfied to the best of their ability dr shelby is the best and his staff a close second they will not sugar coat things and yes they tell you like it is people need to leave their sensitivity behind when it comes to the well being of their pets we need to hear the truth about our pets so that we can be better pet owners south belt animal hospitalsarahmarietravis ratedi love south belt animal hospitali love south belt animal hospital i brought  dogs i found on

mouth and after reading all the great reviews for this company i decided to take my cat to this facility they located a lump in his mouth and i was advised it was either feline himotitis or possible cancer they provided a dose of steroid and a antibiotic  hours later my cat had severe breathing issues due to fluid from the medication filling up his lungs and he very sadly passed away i then called the clinic and left a voicemail to let them know to cancel the follow up appt due my cat passing away they never called back with any condolences which i was not shocked as i am sure they knew it was the medication that killed him i am tremendously dissapointed with all of this as i am sure you know that these animals we own are truly are family may you all please be cautious and ask the vets a it all possible risks when they provide medication to your animals sadly i learned the hard way take caresouth belt animal hospitalmamta y ratedi live in katy and our caucasian shepherd which

francis animal hospital  resortjennifersturch ratedwhen we moved from houston a month ago our biggest concern was about being able to find the kind of veterinarian and boarding care for our dog that we got at st francis animal hospital first of all dr sherry corona is a fantastic doctor our dog bella is aging and dr corona picked up on some major health issues that no other vet picked up the care dr corona and her staff gave extended to us bellas parents as well she would be sure to check in every now and then to make sure bella was doing okay dr corona is the rare type of doctor who gets involved in the life of her patient and the staff is equally as caring the facilities are topnotch you wont find anything like it elsewhere i guarantee it you will not be disappointed oh one more thing  dr corona will not nickle and dime you i told you shes rarewest oaks animal hospitalcarlene b ratedthey were extremely nice and caring and very welleducated they examined my new formerly stray  week old kitten they tested her for worms any possible diseases and helped me learn how to trim her nails they also laid out a clear development plan for my kitten explaining how i should expect to see her developing and what to do in each stage of her development the plan was communicated to me extremely well and helped me greatly as a first time young kitten owner the veterinarian was honest and did not try to con me into paying for unnecessary products or treatments which has happened to me with different vets in the past with different pets the cost of the visit was very reasonable and cheaper than other vets would have beendid you knowhow to find the right vet or clinic for your animalchoosing the right vet for your pet can be tough after all your furry friend cant tell you how he or she feels about the doctor even though youre not the one treated by the vet whoever your animal sees is obviously your decision since many veterinary diseases and injuries can turn into emergencies very quickly its important to have a goto vet this way you can ensure youll know whom to see when your animal needs carespeak to your friends and family about vets whove treated their pets you can even talk to your groomer or an animal shelter worker for referrals when you visit the clinics youve been referred to check that the facility is clean animals are separated and the staff is calm and courteous not all clinics are american animal hospital association accredited this accreditation isnt a legal necessity though a clinic thats aahaaccredited is guaranteed to offer highquality medical care to receive accreditation the clinic has to meet the aahas standards in the areas of facility equipment and quality careif youre looking for a specialist you want to make sure he or she is boardcertified to practice in that specific area of animal medicine youll want to make sure your vet is also convenient to visit so there are factors to take into accountlook for a vet whos close to your house as many animals dont like being in the car for a long time if theres an emergency you want to make sure you can get your pet to the vet as quickly as possible though all veterinary clinics must be able to make arrangements to see their clients pets outside of office hours if theres an emergency these arrangements may not always be at the facility youre used to double check with the office to see where the emergency facility issome clinics have longer hours than others if you work a  schedule make sure the office is open on nights and weekendswhether you have pet health insurance or not its still worth checking what the regular costs for typical procedures are at the vets office there isnt a set standard when it comes to price so its good to know that youre not looking into a clinic thats beyond your meansthe type of animal you own should play a part in which vet you choose as well while your options are vast if you have a dog or cat you may have to visit an avian clinic for your bird or an exotics clinic for your snaketypes of vetsjust as there are many types of doctors there are many types of vets some focus on livestock or house pets while others may specialize in dentistry or surgery they may work in a veterinary clinic or zoo working specifically with the animals housed there or travel to farms to work with livestock since horse racing and other equestrian activities are so popular some vets are trained to work just with horsesdiseases like malaria and yellow fever are also transmitted through animals some vets have insight to diseases that affect both humans and animals vets have contributed to the treatment and cure of many diseases that plagued both humans and their furry friendsgovernment agencies employ veterinarians as well when an animal comes from a foreign land these vets quarantine them and check for any diseases that may be present in an effort to control new diseases that can be brought into the country other specific types of vets includeprivate practice veterinarians this is the most popular type of veterinarian and many of these professionals work at clinics they may also go to farms to care for livestock that cant be transported to the clinicteaching and research these vets work at veterinary schools training students who are planning on joining the veterinary field they may also work in college labs conducting research pertaining to animal healthregulatory medicine these vets work closely with diseases rather than animals themselves their responsibilities include controlling or eliminating illnesses and protecting the public from diseases in animals they may also work with the us department of agricultures food safety and inspection servicespublic health these vets are also known as epidemiologists they work for cities counties states or federal agencies to help control and prevent animal and human disease public health vets may work for the fda to determine the safety of medicines and food additivesuniformed services the us army veterinary corps employ these vets theyre responsible for biomedical research and developmentprivate industry these vets go to school solely for positions in pharmaceutical and biomedical research they work in labs that produce chemicals drugs and vaccines for both humans and animalswhat do veterinary assistants doa vet assistant works alongside the veterinarian and helps out around the clinic in some cases they may assist vets in surgery or restrain struggling animals during tests or lab work the everyday duties of a veterinary assistant include monitoring and caring for animals after surgery keeping medical records cleaning animals teeth feeding and bathing them cleaning cages sterilizing surgical equipment giving animals medication collecting samples for testing and performing laboratory tests and offering grief counseling to pet ownerswhat to expect at the vets officeits a good idea to bring your pet to the vet regularly this way he or she becomes familiar and comfortable with the care providers and you can stay on top of your pets preventative care if the animal is small enough bring it to the office in a carrier just as you visit the doctor for a yearly check up you should bring in your pet for regular check ups as well during a routine veterinary visit the vet will probably begin by asking you if there have been any changes in your pets behavior or habits the vet will then take your pets vitals like weight temperature pulse and respiration rate and perform a physical examination of the pet during a physical exam the vet checks the abdomen for swollen organs and the legs feet and joints for any potential problems depending on the age breed or condition of your pet your veterinarian may also check the eyes ears and mouthwhen your vet conducts a full body examination he or she will check out your pets coat and skin noting any hair loss itchy spots or lumps keep note of your animals shedding habits so you can let the vet know if anything seems abnormal the vet will check for parasites fleas ticks mites and heartworms as well  vaccinations are also important to your pet especially if you have a cat or a dog and your vet will suggest that you make sure theyre current keeping up to date with vaccinations can prevent your furry friend from getting distemper rabies hepatitis and lyme disease some vaccinations last longer than others so speak to your doctor about staying caught up with your animals shots cost and insurancejust like your own health insurance you want to make sure your animal is covered before he or she needs veterinary services some common animal surgeries can cost thousands of dollars and you dont want to end up having to foot a surprise bill that costs more than your paycheck theres no set price for pet health insurance costs can depend on factors such as where you live the age and breed of your pet and how much coverage you want before you take out a pet insurance policy youll want to meet with your vet to go over what he or she thinks your animal should be covered for many vets believe that you should make sure cancer chronic disease hereditary and congenital disease and common breedrelated medical conditions are all addressed in your policysome pet owners cant afford insurance for their pet so there are other options to make paying for surprise pet visits as easy as possible some pet stores have wellness plans  which tend to be much cheaper than an insurance policy  that offer shots check ups screenings and discounts on various procedures your pet may need a lot of veterinary offices offer payment plans for pricey procedures as well as long as you have decent credit history for a lastditch option there are even privately funded organizations that offer pet owners financial aid for their pets treatments  we just redesigned ypcom do you like it× likenot a fan× thank youfeedback
