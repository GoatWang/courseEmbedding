instructions so now you should be on slide  and with that id like to turn the call over to joe devivo president and chief executive officer of angiodynamics joseph m devivo all right bob well thank you very much as we get started i appreciate everyone  first of all i have a cough i apologize for that so ill try to keep that to a minimum we appreciate you joining midday i know its probably an unusual time to do a call and i apologize if that disrupted your day but we got this transaction closed last night and we felt that it was absolutely important given the amount that we value our employees to have the opportunity to speak to our employees first i have had the opportunity to meet facetoface with teams from both angiodynamics and navilyst and also on the call with them this morning to let them all know how excited joe and i are about this transaction how valuable we believe it is for the future foundation of our company and i was thrilled to see how well this was received from both sides but before i get into the specifics of the transaction and of giving you my view and thoughts as to why we made this decision i just want to reflect on a moment on my first  months here with angio as you all know the company has been going through some changes and we have been looking for opportunities to put our balance sheet to work while we have a very strong balance sheet we have not been providing the type of return for investors with that balance sheet and so ive mentioned in the past that we were looking at small la ph deals tuckin acquisitions ways to deploy the capital and ill say that joe and i have looked at and for that matter are continuing to actively look at all different types of ways where we can enhance the value for our shareholders we believe when we had the opportunity to look at navilyst and understand its legacy with boston scientific to understand the technology the deeper we looked at this company the more that we realized that this is a significant opportunity to build a truly special company many people would think of something like this as transformational for us to do such a deal like this but i dont view it that way i view it as foundational at every level when you put the navilyst organization together with angiodynamics it builds a better company from the top to the bottom from left to right theres not a department in the combined organization thats not going to be better not going to be stronger and not going to be more valuable for  or the overall  for our shareholders versus what were ultimately working towards so we believe this acquisition creates that foundation or that new platform for many things to come for many things that we are excited about and as a first step in a long journey of building a worldclass company so first of all let me introduce you to navilyst navilyst enjoys product leadership in several key markets and has a wellearned reputation for manufacturing and operational excellence as i said the company is formerly part of boston scientific was acquired by avista capital in  the company operates a state of the art manufacturing facility just  miles down the road its very easy for me today to go see them and the company maintains an incredibly skilled rd team and management team at marlborough mass and a wonderful sales and marketing team that operates out of marlborough and around the world both of these assets become now a very important and strategic part of angiodynamics in calendar  navilyst generated  million in sales there are many similarities between these businesses were both in the vascular access market we both serve interventional radiologists nurses and surgeons are similar in size of our vascular businesses again manufacturing facilities being very close in the beautiful northern new york state and we have very similar cultures very similar aspirations and very similar challenges so what do the  joe will go through the numbers in a bit but from an overall business standpoint when we look at how many different areas this transaction improves and affects angiodynamics in my view i can put it into  different buckets when we look at other small la ph deals we can bolt on things to the core business but this had the opportunity of across the company fixing or dealing with issues that youve all been aware of for a long period of time and ill go through those first of all scale let me go to slide  so slide  visually talks about scale in the vascular access portfolio this is a broad portfolio of respected brands enhances our competitor position and creates a clear  vascular access franchise with very competitive product lines when compared with the market leader we believe that customers are looking for a comprehensive alternative and that this vascular access resource which is capable of meeting all of the needs that weve just created in one single offering angiodynamics will double its market presence in the vascular access market and as you can see from this chart well be very well positioned next slide please so we are also thrilled by adding one of the most trusted brands in the interventional cardiology market the namic brand has been very highly regarded as the gold standard in fluid management for the last  years its dominant market position brings angiodynamics leadership in an area that we think is important to grow for the company we believe that this leadership in the cath lab helps angiodynamics round out and build into the future a strong peripheral vascular channel that will call on the cath lab will call on the vascular surgeons and radiologists importantly this critical mass will give new life to products in our portfolio where historically weve had a challenge in focus the ability to create a sales channel in vascular access and then a sales channel specifically for peripheral vascular we think is an enormous benefit of this transaction next slide please we will also now have the patented pressureactivated safety valve not only will we be improving our scale in vascular access and our scale in peripheral vascular we will be adding some very compelling technologies to the company the first being that im mentioning here is our pasv valve it has a significant sustainable competitive advantage valve catheters are an important part of the vascular access market and to be quite honest its been a struggle at times for angiodynamics to add value and compete with technologies as such so this is a very important technology and with over  years of performance were very excited to have it its also combined with our vortex port sometime down the road we believe would prove to be a formidable in the marketplace next slide please from a technology perspective we are also very excited about a new product that navilyst is bringing to market and that is called bioflo bioflo is a novel material that minimizes the accumulation of thrombus for piccs ports and dialysis catheters its approved currently in canada and in europe and is pending clearance in the united states i think the picture in the upper right provides an excellent illustration of the contrast that we can draw between bioflo and many current technologies this is a compelling and enabling technology that navilyst brings to angiodynamics with bioflo we believe that there can be a significant reduction in thrombus accumulation which as you know has significant clinical benefits having bioflo to improve our picc line our port line and our dialysis catheters at some point in the future we believe will create a marketsustainable competitive advantage in this segment next slide please so now lets look at the third benefit which is operational excellence as i mentioned navilyst operates a worldclass facility in glens falls new york again within close proximity of our queensbury facility they employ lean and six sigma best practices and focus on and have a significant core competency in operational excellence the  as you see on the chart we believe that both companies have a significant benefit to each other where angiodynamics has core competencies in our catheter assembly electromechanical assembly and extrusion where navilyst has a very powerful verticallyintegrated injection molding core competency which will help us rationalize our vendor base and also be able to improve on our cost navilyst has very strong and robust erp and document management system barcoding through manufacturing something our sales force would be very excited about is in the custom kitting competencies theyre very well known for their lean practices six sigma operations and a wonderful quality management system we believe together that we would be able to build a very strong company especially during a time when weve been dealing with some challenges we most certainly  we know that navilyst and a part of boston scientific made significant investments years ago in this infrastructure in these processes in their it and it is something that  a combination will save years of evolution for the core part of the angiodynamics to get to where i believe it needs to be so in many senses it will improve our scale it will improve and create more technology in our offering and it will also significantly and immediately add to our operating efficiency as i mentioned i view that as a foundational deal where we are investing in the core of the business to become a better company and as a first step as we are evolving towards growth so with that i will now turn it over to joe gersuk who will walk you through the financials joe d joseph gersuk thank you as joe said we are very excited about this transaction and believe it will deliver both immediate and longerterm results for our shareholders which we anticipate closing in the fiscal fourth quarter of our  for analysis purposes we assume a may  transaction closing date slide  reviews the key elements of the transaction weve indicated pro forma sales expectations of  million in fiscal year  this figure reflects no sale synergies or for that matter lost sales that could result from the combination of the companies on balance we think there could be some real leveraging of sales as we take advantage of the new sales call points but it will take some time to fully assess the sales potential of the combined company weve indicated pro forma nongaap ebitda of  million in fiscal  this includes the benefit of  million to  million of net cost savings that we see clearly at this time but it excludes transactionrelated and nonrecurring costs the  million to  million in first year savings will double by fiscal  we will also benefit significantly from the tax assets we are acquiring and they represent a significant portion of the purchase price by our calculation about  million on a present value basis these arise from the asset value of the acquired business as well as nols that will be available these tax benefits will save us approximately  million in cash tax savings every year for the next  years for a cumulative tax savings of  million note however the tax rate you will see on our pl will reflect a tax rate of approximately  as the tax benefits will run through the balance sheet importantly we will be providing more detailed guidance when the transaction is finally closed which as i said we expect to occur in may slide  reviews the key elements of the transaction the total value of the acquisition is approximately  million were paying  of the purchase price in cash or a total of  million and the remaining  of the acquisition price will be paid through the issuance of  million angiodynamics common shares to avista capital partners at the closing avistas ownership position in angiodynamics will be  and they will have  seats on our board of directors which will increase the total size of the board to  to finance the cash portion of the purchase price as well as related transaction costs we will use approximately  million of our current million cash position in addition we have received a fully committed million bank financing facility from jpmorgan bank of america and keybanc in the form of new debt issuance the bank loan will have a year term and a liborbased variable interest rate that stands today at approximately  the  banks have also extended a million revolving credit facility on top of the  million term loan both companies boards of directors have approved unanimously the proposed transaction and as i said we expect to close it during our fiscal fourth quarter and the acquisition will be subject to customary closing conditions clearance under certain antitrust guidelines and the approval of angiodynamics shareholders we currently expect to file the proxy statement with the sec by the end of february now id like to turn the call back to joe for a quick summary and then on to your questions joe joseph m devivo thanks joe so over the past  months ive shared with you our intention to use the strong balance sheet to fund acquisition opportunities that would be accretive to earnings and enhance our future growth prospects we were very diligent in analyzing each of these opportunities we believe we found an excellent partner in navilyst medical and id like to be able to summarize again what we believe were creating on this transaction now first were bringing to angiodynamics scale technology and operational excellence that will result in short and longterm accretive financial performance for our shareholders second we significantly enhanced our current business while building a solid platform to pursue future growth opportunities third we continue to have a strong balance sheet and capital structure flexible to pursue other acquisitions and licensing deals our business development efforts remain active and expansion of the number of oncology products that we offer remains a key goal of the organization fourth weve acquired a company that is a strong cultural fit with ours the close proximity of these facilities will simplify the integration process were very excited about the potential of this acquisition and have assembled a team of experts to maximize the opportunity that lies ahead so now operator i would like to open it up for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of jason mills of canaccord jason r mills  canaccord genuity research division im wondering at this point if you could give us a bit better feel for the likelihood of sale synergies and what areas are you focused most on to derive those synergies joseph m devivo thanks for the question when we put our numbers together for this call we wanted to be able to give everyone a perspective of what this looks like kind of day one weve not yet given really  guidance but we did want to say here is where if we just put them together the revenues would be and here is the financial performance and also our first cut at the synergies the  it does not factor in yet the revenue synergies and in my view we have the opportunity to drive revenue synergies first of all by having a more complete vascular access portfolio is going to improve our position in the marketplace just clearly will so the ability to drive penetration in existing accounts that may be using competitor products that were not in the other companys portfolio is some low fruit the ability to call on accounts to be an alternative to the leader in the marketplace to show the offering i think has as good an opportunity as any to drive share and thatll be a focus of the organization third to be able to have a focused selling effort one of the challenges and one thing that i know my sales force has told me time and time again is we have too many different competing opportunities in the bag we need focus well you got it and not only do we have focus but we have focus with creating a very strong market position so i have a tough time thinking that our  that the quality of our combined organizations arent going to be able to drive positive market share and also they the navilyst business grew very nicely in vascular access last year from a peripheral vascular standpoint its the same thing as i mentioned on focus instead of having a mixed bag we now can have an organization focusing on vascular surgeons and interventional cardiologists many products that were in the bag that were not getting enough attention are now going to become more important to those sellers and were going to have the opportunity to build new relationships with interventional cardiologists and also help interventional cardiologists believe it or not who are interested in venous ablation build their venous ablation practices so there  were not yet ready to give guidance we have a lot of work to do between now and then but there is no way we are not going to see a positive impact in the marketplace due to the synergies of these products and the renewed focus in those organizations jason r mills  canaccord genuity research division okay thats very helpful joe i appreciate that my followup is as it relates to the potential cost synergies what sort of ebitda growth we could see going forward it sounds like the  million that youve given us is at least the first cut today as what you see just putting in these  businesses together without any synergies or lack thereof im wondering is that a level from which you would grow more predicated on your ability to drive sales synergies or are there step functions as you get a year or so postdeal where ebitda will go to a level of equilibrium from which you would grow at a higher level than  million i dont know if the question is clear or not im just getting a sense  i mean clearly youve taken  the enterprise value of the combined business is much higher than the current business so the multiple on the combined business is much higher so im wanting to get a sense for really downstream a little bit what sort of levels of ebitda youre thinking about in terms of the potential for this deal d joseph gersuk yes so in terms of ebitda margins were looking at starting at something in the range of  and then growing that by doubledigit dollar amounts and then on a marginal basis as a percentage of sales expanding that by at least a percentage point a year each year going forward based on our current projections for the business operator and our next question comes from the line of thomas kouchoukos with stifel nicolaus thomas kouchoukos  stifel nicolaus  co inc research division maybe we can step back bigger picture just on the transaction itself and joe i was wondering if you could talk about the growth trajectory of the navilyst business and some of the past challenges theyve had and then maybe discuss how you arrived at the deal valuation in general joseph m devivo sure well first of all the trajectory of the business its been kind of over the last  years a mixed bag theyve had some challenges in fluid management with implementation of an erp system that i guess gave them a little bit of a challenge and aside from that the fluid management has been pacing at flat to growing slightly the vascular access business has been growing nicely and the  theres a supply agreement between another company that has been declining over time and so when you add the pieces up its been over the last  years a pretty flat business but that doesnt concern me ive looked at it ive looked at it closely and i think navilyst has had the same type of focus issues that angiodynamics has had and i believe with the combination of their very successful vascular access business with ours and as i mentioned what we can do in peripheral vascular for ourselves and for them i think we can change that trajectory this  when we look at the valuation first of all its important to note that theres a significant tax asset that comes with the acquisition where on a cash basis is worth  million or from a present value we value it at  million so you net that up to  million and thats just about  million and change is what we believe our purchase price is which is less than x revenue and given the synergy that we believe we can drive given the overall improvement operationally we actually think weve  its a very fair valuation for the business and before we end on the topic i know joe also wants to make a couple of comments d joseph gersuk yes so i would just say as joe said we look at it as about  million in a purchase price x the tax attributes and so that would be a purchase price of about x their revenues and then in terms of ebitda the business has reported on a gaap ebitda basis in the vicinity of  million a year but those results included various charges and other arguably onetime items and so if you strip all of that out the business has produced about a  million a year adjusted ebitda rate over the last  years again unevenly over those  years but thats what it has averaged and on that basis were talking about a bit over x that ebitda adjusted ebitda figure in terms of valuation and so we thought that was a fair price it was the price that it took to get the deal done weve had a number of conversations with the principals that own this  the company over the years and finally got to a price that worked and that we thought was in the best interest of angiodynamics shareholders so very confident about the financial projections that weve put forward here as joe said there could well be revenue opportunities above this million figure and were highly confident in the savings projections that weve built into here and think there could be some upside to those but need to get through the diligence  further through the diligence process and well offer the further guidance on all of this when we ultimately close the transaction thomas kouchoukos  stifel nicolaus  co inc research division okay thats helpful and then just one quick followup joe gersuk if you could talk about the differing margin profiles of the company maybe touch on gross margins for navilyst and then maybe gross margins by fluid management versus their vascular access division d joseph gersuk yes i can speak to it in the aggregate for the whole company and their gross margins have been in the lows and that primarily reflects the nature and the competitiveness of the fluid management business and their vascular business has margins that are not too far away from our own gross margins but in the aggregate then youre at a low gross margin business we do think that when we put the  businesses together well begin to start to drive some improvements in the gross margin by virtue of sourcing parts and component parts to each others facilities there are things that we build ourselves that they dont have and they buy from other vendors and vice versa and so we think we can start to drive the gross profit margins up at least a percentage point a year and when you blend the  together we start off at about a grossmargin combined enterprise and then from that level add at least a percentage point a year to those gross margin numbers based on the immediate opportunities that we see to save some money and the last point i would make is that there is a supply arrangement with boston scientific which is an artifact of the acquisition of this business several years ago and that that is a low margin  relatively low margin piece of business its a contract that will expire in february of  and our planning assumptions are that that would not be renewed and that there will be no revenue there and the absence of that will also add a little bit to gross margins as well operator our next question comes from the line of matt hewitt with craig hallum matthew hewitt  craighallum capital group llc research division two quick questions first of all on the bioflo product when was that application filed where does that fit from a timing perspective i mean is that something we can anticipate here before the end of your fiscal year joseph m devivo well thats really something for  i dont want to get too far ahead for navilyst but my understanding is is that the k has been filed as you know in this space matt a lot of companies are trying to get this type of clearance and so i dont see this as just a checkthebox type of clearance so the degree of difficulty is pretty high in this area we really like what we see and are encouraged by the initial international results but i dont want to set an expectation for the team yet but it is filed there is dialogue and we hope for the best matthew hewitt  craighallum capital group llc research division all right understood without  given the size of the  vascular businesses is there any risk from dojs standpoint or not really joseph m devivo no well we dont believe so were barred with  market share basically   share plus or minus a few points whoever is running the numbers get into the lows i dont think is going to scare the regulators matthew hewitt  craighallum capital group llc research division all right and then i guess one more looking at the sales force  and youve done a good job i think of highlighting the opportunities once youve had a chance to integrate and kind of get things designed how youd like how many separate like sales forces will you have i mean will it be each will it be  or will you have  main call points with some overlap with different market segments joseph m devivo well first of all our oncology business will remain as it is and being led by rick stark there are a couple of products potentially in microcatheters that will come over into that business the other business is being run by alan panzer who has had a significant amount of experience in his days with kendall tyco covidien and who knows how to integrate businesses and integrate sales forces hell be doing a lot of work to optimize the best structure i do think we will have a set of focused salespeople focusing on vascular access and i do think we will have a set of salespeople focusing on peripheral vascular and then alan will decide how that rolls up into his organization but the importance for today and the ability to drive revenue synergies is to know that were going to give the sales force what its been asking for and thats the focus and the ability to be successful operator and our next question comes from the line of jayson bedford with raymond james jayson t bedford  raymond james  associates inc research division i guess my first question is why now meaning this is an asset thats been out there for a few years whats changed why did the board decide to do it now versus  months ago a year ago joseph m devivo i dont know joe i guess  joes been around longer than i i think he has been in discussions in the past i think  i dont know joe  i can extrapolate on the past but i think we joe and i have been able to sit with the team at avista and in looking at what can  the amount of value that can be created in this transaction the amount of synergies the ability to reaccelerate revenue growth the complementary nature of how its a game changer in the marketplace i believe has persuaded avista that being an owner of these shares has the greatest value creation for them than going it alone and it took on their part some faith in our management team some faith in the combination of the businesses and were excited to have them on our board were excited to have them as our partners going forward so i think they saw the value creation they saw a new management team with a lot of fire in our belly and know that we can pull it off and they placed a big bet on us joe any other things you want to mention d joseph gersuk yes and certainly weve had a number of discussions with them in the past and the issues really have not been about the strategic or industrial logic of putting the  companies together it really has been about the price and i think within about a week or  days of when joe started in september he called me up and said have we ever had any conversations with the folks from navilyst and i said well sure we have and  but the issue had been price and so the following week he and i went to new york city and met with the principals at navilyst and i think joe was very persuasive and i think convinced them that he would indeed be a great leader for this business to take it forward i think they came to understand joes vision for what he wanted to do with angiodynamics and how that could be successful and how combining the  companies really would make a great deal of sense so the discussions have then taken place over the last several months we did come to realize that there was significant tax attributes here that were quantifiable and valuable to us and i would say there was just great chemistry i think with the principals at avista and that we believe theyll be people that will be great and valuable shareholders to the company excellent board members and add value at the board level as well and so it all seemed to line up very well and it all came together at about  in the morning last night jayson t bedford  raymond james  associates inc research division okay and just as a followup when i look at the  segments vascular and fluid management what do you think the end market growth rates are for those  business segments not so much for navilyst just the kind of market growth rate joseph m devivo i actually dont have that third party in front of me wed have to follow up with you on that jason d joseph gersuk yes i mean our overall expectation is that the acquisition will enable us to accelerate the longterm growth rate of our revenues by about  basis points and we have thought about it in terms of being the growth rate before in the midsingle digits  to   range and so wed add about  basis points to that in the aggregate but i dont have any more granularity than that at the moment jason operator and our next question comes from the line of charles croson with sidoti  company charles croson  sidoti  company llc i just have a couple of quick questions here a lot of mine have been asked joe can you give me an idea  i know you cant give guidance or anything but can you give us directionally in terms of  and im just trying to account for any sort of seasonal factors i can imagine there really arent too many but in terms of projecting for revenue on a quarterly basis and then just expenses and everything i mean should it be in line with what  relatively in line with how your income statement looks d joseph gersuk well a little early to have assessed that i mean i dont know that their business would be any different than ours seasonally in particular the summer months are typically slow in their business and in ours and our fiscal years are different were a may  company so based on our sales commissions plans we typically have our best quarter of the year in our may fiscal quarter theirs would be similar but around the december  fiscal year end but beyond that well just have to see through the further process here and in our future guidance well give you some sorts of view on that although i would not expect that well continue with the quarterly guidance next fiscal year we did that this year as a onetime event based on the lc beads contract going away so we would expect to be offering full year guidance starting next fiscal year charles croson  sidoti  company llc okay no thats helpful joe and then just a couple more quick items here what was the interest rate on the debt d joseph gersuk were talking about something on the order of  based on the current formula its a libor plus margin above libor so something like  would be the range if we were borrowing today charles croson  sidoti  company llc okay thats helpful and then any inventory purchase accounting that might have not been accounted for in that  or was that in there d joseph gersuk no its largely taken into account there but i would have to caveat that by saying there will be a evaluation of all of the assets that were acquiring here the entire business and out of that would come surely some changes in asset values and different levels of amortization and much accounting but in any event we think the figures that we gave you as the basic guidance here will stand the test of time operator and our next question comes from the line of larry haimovitch with hmtc larry haimovitch  haimovitch medical technology consultants joe gersuk whats the percentage of international sales for navilyst d joseph gersuk theirs is about  which is a little bit higher than ours ours runs about  and their  that  of the revenue stream is dominated by the fluid management business i think the other difference is the fact that our international business has been growing very rapidly as you know last quarter it grew  yearoveryear weve got a great team on the ground in europe and in asia as well and navilysts international business has not been growing fast so we see that as a gray area for some natural growth and accelerate the growth as we fully integrate the international businesses together larry haimovitch  haimovitch medical technology consultants second question is on fluid management joe gersuk what percent roughly is that of the total worldwide sales of navilyst d joseph gersuk yes it is on the order of about  of the total larry haimovitch  haimovitch medical technology consultants  of the total okay d joseph gersuk yes something like that and youve got about  close to  of the businesses would be in the venous access business and call it  or so for fluid management and the balance would be that supply agreement with boston scientific larry haimovitch  haimovitch medical technology consultants and then joe devivo i know you know the picc business well in having acquired horizon when you were at rita one of the things that i think that it seems to be important in picc technology these days is technology that identifies the proper placement of the picc itself i dont think angiodynamics has that in its own portfolio and im not aware that navilyst does is this a hole in the portfolio joe that you need to fill joseph m devivo well its definitely been a hole for angiodynamics for a while there is a device called a navigator which they  which navilyst has with corpak that focuses on tip location were going to do a good deep dive on that technology we think theres some additional improvements that are out in the marketplace but its not the type of glaring hole that it was in the past larry haimovitch  haimovitch medical technology consultants yes so thats something that you need to add onto to strengthen the picc business joseph m devivo i think its something that we need to keep focusing on yes i think theres a product there i think its a good product but i think theres also some new innovations that we need to  especially now that weve doubled down the segment that we need to make sure that we keep our eyes on operator operator instructions and our next question comes from the line of robert goldman with cl king robert m goldman  cl king  associates inc a couple of financial things joe first what will be the annual amount of intangible amortization expenses resulting from the acquisition d joseph gersuk yes too early to tell weve got to calculate all of that interestingly historically theirs has been similar to ours but everything will be studied through a new valuation based on this purchase price and a new assessment of all of their assets robert m goldman  cl king  associates inc okay and then on the synergies of at least  per share just so im clear this is prior to those amortization expenses prior to the incremental interest expense and includes the additional shares from the deal is that all correct d joseph gersuk yes well it includes the additional shares in the deal and would reflect the synergies and interest expense on the transaction and so forth yes and thats  accretive to earnings is what were talking about yes robert m goldman  cl king  associates inc okay and then finally on gross margin at least in my analysis thats where the synergies would likely be coming from do you view it that way and i know you spoke about sort of conceptually what the opportunities are on improving gross margin but for fiscal  what will you be focused on to increase gross margin d joseph gersuk yes so really the synergies are not believed to be coming from gross margin we would expect to continue to operate the facilities in glens falls and in queensbury and the only synergies there would be through sourcing primarily through sourcing of products mutually to each other rather than from thirdparty vendors would be the bulk of it as well as the absence of the boston scientific supply agreement that is low margin the rd organization we will continue to operate the facility in marlborough and actually continue to invest in rd there and so we will be looking at the sga line for the bulk of the synergies that we would expect operator and at this time im not showing any further questions you may continue with any closing remarks joseph m devivo great well obviously as you can see joe and i are very excited about this next phase in angiodynamics future we believe we have a transaction that fixes many of the legacy issues within angio as far as driving scale bringing new technology into the pipeline helping and driving enhanced operational excellence we believe this is the first of many things to come we believe this is a new platform that will help us invigorate our growth i think our team in the first half of fiscal  has done an excellent job reinvigorating growth with our  and  growth rates that weve shown our people and our team are ready to go were excited about bringing navilyst in and we are  and while we believe there are some very material and lowfruit synergies for us to enhance shareholder value make no question we will grow we will take share and this will be successful thank you operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen
