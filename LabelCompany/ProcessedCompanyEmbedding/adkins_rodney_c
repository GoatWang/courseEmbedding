interview rodney c adkins ibms futurist multiplatform systems will proliferate jul   rodney c adkins rodney c adkins ibm corps general manager for web servers has spent his entire career with big bluein  he joined ibm as an engineer after completing his second bachelors degreeafter a short break for graduate school he worked in product development business operations and general management and eventually became ibms vice president of development for commercial desktop computersin  adkins was named general manager of commercial desktop systems in ibms personal systems group in  he took over his current post in which he manages the unix workstation and server product lines of ibms enterprise systems groupwithin ibm adkins serves on the worldwide management committee and the board of governors of the ibm academy of technology he is also cochairman of ibms multicultural people in technology initiative adkins has a bachelors degree in physics from rollins collegehe received a second bachelors and a masters degree in electrical engineering from the georgia institute of technologygcn associate editor patricia daukantas interviewed adkins by telephone gcnwhat lines of servers and workstations fall under your purview adkins as part of our web server business unit we focus on unix products that range from workstations all the way up to largescale supercomputers the brands are called rs and numaq numaq is a brand that we added to our portfolio last september when we merged with sequent computer systems inc of beaverton ore gcnibm corp is working on a couple of the energy departments accelerated strategic computing initiative supercomputers asci blue pacific and asci white what other big rs installations are there within the government adkins oak ridge national laboratory recently upgraded theirs the national weather service has a big machine thats looking at climate control  gcn feb  page   the national center for atmospheric research has another and the national energy research scientific computing center is another example gcnare the rs machines mainly for scientific computing or are agencies using them for data warehousing or hosting large web sites adkins the most visible application is clearly in the scientific and technical computing area but we have a number of government personnel who are using the machines for typical business purposes that would include databases business intelligence and other commercial applications given the size of many of these machines the scientific and technical uses tend to get a lot more of the visibility gcnare there any practical limitations on rs multiprocessing adkins with any technology you approach a point where potentially youre dealing with physical barriers but the design and the architecture of our offerings pretty much provide what i would describe as unlimited scalability ibm has eight research labs around the world that look at advanced technologies and highperformance computing techniques as best as most of our top scientists can tell there is considerable leeway before we have to worry about hitting some theoretical limit in terms of the scalability of the processors or interconnect technology or even the software gcnin the relatively near term wont you bump up against the limits of fabricationmaking spacing between transistors any smaller adkins weve been looking at that for a number of years and every time we get to that point theres always some technology breakthrough we did two innovative things related to processors and fabrication technology last year we introduced copper as part of our microprocessor technology road map  gcn may  page   we also came up with something called silicon on insulator soi which insulates transistors on a chip to reduce power leakage and improve performance  gcn july  page   this leads into a set of offerings that we will announce in the second half of  and the first half of  called power iv in that architecture were taking the ibm innovations like copper and soi and adding highspeed highperformance capabilities gcnyou mentioned the acquisition of sequent last year what is ibm doing with the numaq technology that you got from sequent adkins were doing two things with sequent one as part of the acquisition we picked up a new class of server offerings the best way to describe them is as large servers that can start off with a building block through interconnection technology you can make a small server a bigger server just by adding a number of building blocks thats what nonuniform memory access technology is about it lets you scale from a small symmetric multiprocessing server to a larger smp server while maintaining the same programming model we will extend that across all our unix servers from entry to midrange and largescale that will give us capabilities across the entire product line with the ability to interconnect a number of servers and make them look like one big
