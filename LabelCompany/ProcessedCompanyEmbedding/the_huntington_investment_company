banking commissioner is charged with the administration of chapter a of the connecticut general statutes the connecticut uniform securities act the act and sections b et seq of the regulations of connecticut state agencies the regulations promulgated under the act   whereas on february   the huntington investment company huntington of  south high street seventh floor columbus ohio filed an application for registration as a brokerdealer under the act and disclosed in such application that it had effected a limited number of securities transactions for connecticut customers at a time when huntington was not registered as a brokerdealer in connecticut   whereas the commissioner through the securities and business investments division of the department of banking the division conducted a followup investigation pursuant to sections b and b of the act into the activities of huntington to assess the accuracy of the information provided by huntington as well as the firms compliance with the act and the regulations thereunder   whereas the commissioner ascertained as a result of such investigation that   from at least october  through february  huntington transacted business as a brokerdealer absent registration in contravention of section ba of the act  at various times from october  through february  huntington employed between one and ten unregistered brokerdealer agents in contravention of section bb of the act and  the trading activity largely consisted of sell transactions and transactions effected for customers whose accounts were opened in another state prior to the customers moving to connecticut   whereas huntington  produced to the division email correspondence showing that in one instance during  a back office employee of the firm circumvented internal procedures governing connecticut brokerdealer registration requirements and  huntington represented to the division that such employee had received a reprimand as a result of such conduct   whereas in  and immediately prior to the onset of its unregistered activity in connecticut huntington was sanctioned by the states of arizona massachusetts and new jersey for failing to register as a brokerdealer in those jurisdictions   whereas on june   the national association of securities dealers the nasd censured huntington and fined it  for violating nasd rules   and  in conjunction with a sales contest that weighted the firms proprietary mutual fund and variable annuity products more than other investment products offered by huntington acceptance waiver and consent case no ca   whereas huntington maintains that several connecticut securities transactions were liquidating transactions conducted in order to recover annual custodial and ira fees that one connecticut account was established solely to facilitate the liquidation of positions inherited by the beneficiary of a deceased huntington account holder and that huntington had implemented enhanced procedures to improve its blue sky compliance systems   whereas huntington neither admits nor denies any of the commissioners allegations but expressly consents to the commissioners jurisdiction in this matter and to the entry of the sanctions in this consent order   whereas section ba of the act provides in part that  the commissioner may by order deny    any registration or by order restrict or impose conditions on the securities or investment advisory activities that an applicant    may perform in this state if the commissioner finds that  the order is in the public interest and  the applicant    or in the case of a brokerdealer or investment adviser any partner officer or director any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions or any person directly or indirectly controlling the

otherwise    h has engaged in    dishonest or unethical practices in the securities    business including abusive sales practices in the business dealings of such applicant    with current or prospective customers or clients    or k has failed reasonably to supervise  i the agents    of such applicant    if the applicant    is a brokerdealer       whereas section bab of the regulations under the act explains that  in construing the term dishonest or unethical practices in the securities    business as used in    section ah recodified as section bah of the general statutes the commissioner may consider whether the conduct in question is proscribed by any rule of a    selfregulatory organization organized under registered under federal securities laws administered by the united states securities and exchange commission   whereas section b of the act authorizes the commissioner to enter an order to cease and desist and to impose a fine of up to  per violation after granting huntington an opportunity for a hearing   whereas section ba of the act provides in part that  a no person shall transact business in this state as a brokerdealer unless such person is registered under sections b to b inclusive    no individual shall transact business as an agent in this state unless such individual is  registered as an agent of the brokerdealer    whom such individual represents in transacting such business or  an associated person who represents a brokerdealer in effecting transactions described in subdivisions  and  of section h of the securities exchange act of    whereas section bb of the act provides in part that  no brokerdealer shall employ an agent unless such agent is  registered under sections b  to b inclusive or  an associated person who represents a brokerdealer in effecting transactions described in subdivisions  and  of section h of the securities exchange act of    whereas an administrative proceeding initiated under sections b and b of the act would constitute a contested case within the meaning of section  of the connecticut general statutes   whereas section c of chapter  of the connecticut general statutes provides thatunless precluded by law a contested case may be resolved by stipulation agreed settlement or consent order or by the default of a party   whereas section ba of the act provides in part that the commissioner may from time to time make amend and rescind such  orders as are necessary to carry out the provisions of sections b to b inclusive of the connecticut uniform securities act   whereas the commissioner finds that the entry of this consent order is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act

sections bf ba bd and b of the connecticut general statutes  to present evidence and argument and to otherwise avail itself of section ca of the connecticut general statutes  to present its position

challenge or contest the matters described herein including the validity of this consent order findings of the commissioner as to evidentiary sufficiency to initiate administrative proceedings whereas the commissioner finds that sufficient grounds would exist to initiate administrative proceedings against huntington including proceedings to deny or condition huntingtons registration as a

throughout varying degrees of circumstances which in the absence the plan would otherwise disrupt hic’s ability to conduct business in the plan hic has endeavored to consider and prepare for a broad range of scenarios of varying severity preparation includes the establishment of arrangements for alternative facilities systems and staffing to strive to minimize the impact of any such event resumption of service is dependent on nature of the incident at hand for example should there be an event that would prevent hic from conducting business in its primary operational facility the plans are designed to enable resumption of essential functions in a backup facility within the same business day as to the matter of client’s ability to place trades through redirection of phone lines and client’s access to internet trading capabilities our expectation is that so long as the securities markets remain open trading would not be disrupted while there can be no guarantee to its effectiveness hic has a high level of confidence that through its careful planning and periodic testing the firm’s preparation provides a reasonable strategy to effectively manage a business recovery
