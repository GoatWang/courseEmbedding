transaction and other fees including monitoring fees are fees charged directly to managed funds and portfolio companies the investment advisory agreements generally require that the investment adviser reduce the amount of table of contents management fees payable by the limited partners to the partnership by an amount equal to a portion of the transaction and other fees directly paid to the

certain fund structures specifically in private equity real estate and certain hedge fund solutions and creditfocused funds carry funds performance fees carried interest are allocated to the general partner based on cumulative fund performance to date subject to a preferred return to limited partners at the end of each reporting period the partnership calculates the carried interest that would be due to the partnership for each fund pursuant to the fund agreements as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized as the fair value of underlying investments varies between reporting periods it is necessary to make adjustments to amounts recorded as carried interest to reflect either a positive performance resulting in an increase in the carried interest allocated to the general partner or b negative performance that would cause the amount due to the partnership to be less than the amount previously recognized as revenue resulting in a negative adjustment to carried interest allocated to the general partner in each scenario it is necessary to calculate the carried interest on cumulative results compared to the carried interest recorded to date and make the required positive or negative adjustments the partnership ceases to record negative carried interest allocations once previously recognized carried interest allocations for such fund have been fully reversed the partnership is not obligated to pay guaranteed returns or hurdles and therefore cannot have negative carried interest over the life of a fund accrued but unpaid carried interest as of the reporting date is reflected in investments in the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition

results as such the accrual for potential repayment of previously received carried interest which is a component of due to affiliates represents all amounts previously distributed to table of contents
