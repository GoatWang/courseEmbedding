the right technology people and institutions today can still solve hard problems and change the world for the better in  when we looked at the available technology we saw products that were too rigid to handle novel problems and custom systems that took too long to deploy and required too many services to maintain and improve we saw automated approaches that failed against adaptive adversaries and allornothing access controls that forced organizations to make unacceptable tradeoffs between collaborating and securing sensitive data from misuse we saw a need for a different kind of technology and
