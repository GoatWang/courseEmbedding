and true forms of picking the right kind of developmental biotech investment is following those who have success in investing in themthe most successful small cap biotech investors understand that those with a top track record of success tend to repeat this same pattern of success over and overrandal j kirk has a solid record of successful investments in developmental biotech companies today we will look at some of his current investments and offer commentary on themmany might not be familiar with who randal j kirk is but he is an influential man in the small cap biotech investment world he got his start in business in the early s and is now chairman and chief executive officer nyseceo of intrexon xon in  kirk founded general injectables and vaccines giv giv is a privately held company that essentially acts as a next day supplier of medical products for various outlets in  kirk and his ownership team sold giv to henry schein inc for approximately m aferwards kirk founded new river pharmaceuticals inc and took the company public in  not long after taking the company public new river received food and drug admininstration fda approval for vyvanse an attention deficit disorder treatment in  not long after this approval kirk sold the company and his  stake to shire plc for b in  kirk turned his attention to venture capitalism and founded third security llc which invests in startup developmental biotech companies its through third security llc that kirk currently invests in small cap developmental companies one of kirks most successful investments over the last year has been halozyme halo in  halozyme was trading around  and less than a year later the stock currently trades around  which represents well over a  gain much of the buzz and potential with halozyme is around its proprietary enhaze technology enhaze technology consists of a recombinant enzyme called hylenex rhuph it enables better absorption of existing drugs into the body subcutaneously halozyme is developing pegph nysepeg which is a pegylated recombinant human hyaluronidase form of hylenex in combination with gemcitabine chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with stage iv metastatic pancreatic cancer positive results were released at asco in june of last year pertaining to the phase ib trial studying pegphgemcitabine we are most excited about peg as its potential is virtually limitless in our opinion if successful peg can treat cancers that are currently considered untreatable and provide the hope to patients diagnosed with such cancers that their diagnosis is not an automatic death sentence peg is designed to target cancers that contain high levels of hyaluronan nasdaqha such as for an example pancreatic cancer hyaluronan obstructs the blood vessels in a tumor which makes nearly impossible for current treatments to be delivered into these tumors in simpler terms halozyme believes it will show in clinical testing that peg opens up these obstructed blood vessels which will allow treatments and therapies to target what are now untreatable cancerous tumors kirk has gained a lot of positive attention from his investment in halozyme as third security llc owns  with kirk owning  shares directly which represents over  ownership in halozyme we think kirks investment in halozyme will pay off in huge way if peg ultimately proves to be successful however we feel its a good possibility the company will be acquired long before the final verdict on peg materializes intrexon the company where kirk is chairman of the board and ceo has seen a stock increase from  to  year over year and currently trades near  intrexon specializes in the field of synthetic biology synthetic biology focuses on synthesizing life on a cellular basis and seeks to use this synthesis to potentially discover new ways to benefit society as a whole such examples of this include dna sequencing fabrication of genes and gene modeling intrexons platform in part aims to repairreplace defective genes with functioning genes to more effectively treat and potentially cure a broad range of diseases intrexons top developmental technology is called rheoswitch rheoswitch is a gene switch activated by a small molecule ligand which can be used to regulate the timing location and concentration of gene expression with potential applications in human animal and plant systems the rheoswitch technology is currently in phase  clinical trials for melanoma and breast cancer in laymans terms rheoswitch is designed to more effectively time and deliver small molecules ions andor proteins when and where needed ligand administration rheoswitch could allow drug developers and physicians the ability to control the levels and timing of these small molecules ions andor proteins in certain drugs and therapies more accurately basically rheoswitch aims to help make existing drugs and therapies more precise effective and safer if proven successful in clinical trials rheoswitch has the potential to be a big money maker for the company third security llc owns  shares of intrexon representing the number one holding for kirks company and nearly  ownership of intrexon intrexon has multiple partnerships with other companies that kirk holds through third security some of them mentioned here intrexon is certainly engaging in very interesting and cutting edge technology with high potential with m shares held by kirks third security if in fact the intrexons platform finds success kirk will be hitting yet another stock jackpot synthetic biologics inc syn is a company kirks third security also holds a large position in with an important data release coming in april of this year the company is scheduled to present this week at the th annual roth conference on tuesday march   the top line data release will be from synthetics evaluation of trimesta oral estriol in combination with copaxone glatiramer acetate injection in a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled phase ii clinical trial for the treatment of relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis nysems in women synthetics holds the patent license to the trimestacopaxone combination we found an interesting write up that seems make a connection between women who use oral contraceptives birth control pills for an extended period of time and the possible onset of ms symptoms and even a higher risk for those who stop taking the pills this is interesting because birth control pills use estradiol and estrone along with progesterone yet contain very little estriol  all of these are different forms of the hormone estrogen estriol has been said to give relief to women from ms symptoms while pregnant we think this bodes well for synthetics phase ii trial mentioned above to produce positive results as estriol accounts for  to  of circulating estrogen which is what these women might lack after discontinuing their use of birth control ms is a rare disease and birth control pills have not been shown to be conclusively connected to the onset of ms but studies show it could be synthetic is also developing a betalactamase enzyme syn to target the prevention of clostridium difficile c difficile or c diff infections the company aims to show that when coadministered with certain intravenous betalactam antibiotics syn can degrade the antibiotic that is excreted in the gastrointestinal nysegi tract additionally the company believes that syn will be able to degrade a broader spectrum of betalactam antibiotics including both penicillins and cephalosporins in   million americans were administered betalactam antibiotics this bodes well for companies developing a drug like syn as president obama is proposing to double spending on these types of drugs in the future synthetics with a market cap of around m is the only company we can find that is developing a c difficile drug with a market cap under m kirks third security llc owns  shares of synthetic which represents nearly  of the company its also interesting to note that michael dells affiliate investment adviser firm msdc management lp owns  shares in synthetics synthetics could pay off nicely for kirk and dells affiliate investment firm in time especially if the nearterm data release shows to be successful in april and its our opinion that the data will be positive kirk also owns a large position in ziopharm oncology inc ziop ziopharm is employing novel gene expression and control technology to deliver dna for the treatment of cancer its technology platform employs intrexon corporations rheoswitch therapeutic system platform to turn on and off and modulate gene expression at the cancer site in order to improve the therapeutic index last march the company experienced a significant setback when its lead drug palifosfamide failed to show any statistically significant improvement in progression free survival in soft tissue sarcoma however ziopharm seems to be back on track with its adrtsil which is a novel dnabased therapeutic candidate that is being evaluated with the oral activator veledimex in patients with advanced melanoma in december of last year ziopharm reported positive interim results from the ongoing phase  melanoma study which showed good safety and tolerability additionally in december of last year ziopharm initiated a phase  study of adrtsil in subjects with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma or grade iii malignant glioma brain cancer fellow seeking alpha contributor chemistfrog explains this treatment in an article from june  adrts il employs the use of an adenoviral vector to deliver into patients cells the il dna plasmid instructing the cells to produce the il cytokine interleukin is a protein cytokine known to trigger an immune response to cancer cyotines are very important in the immune system as they modulate the balance between humoral and cellbased immune responses and they regulate the maturation growth and responsiveness of particular cell populations interestingly enough ziopharm licenses adrts il from intrexon kirks largest investment to date if adrts il ultimately proves to be a success kirk will be rolling in the money in a big way kirks third security llc owns  shares of ziopharm which represents a little over  of the company fibrocell science inc fcsc is another company kirk and his company owns a good amount of shares in fibrocells flagship product is laviv a personalized and fda approved aesthetic cell therapy for the improvement of smile line wrinkles in adults the company is also engaging in various clinical and preclinical programs which include treatments for restrictive burn scars vocal cord scars and acne scars fibrocells platform includes using a patients own skin cells in order to produce collagen lost through trauma or natural aging process the company also develops fibrocell science autologous crème a cell transplantation skin care cream randal kirk seems to do a nice job leveraging his assets in a way that is beneficial to all of the companies he has interest in fabrocell is partnered with intrexon corporation where as previously mentioned kirk is chairman and ceo in january of this year this relationship was expanded in order to develop a treatment for ehlersdanlos syndromehypermobility type edsht a rare genetic disorder resulting in weakened connective tissue fibrocell and intrexon will endeavor to engineer autologous fibroblast cells genetically corrected to produce tenascinx tnx a protein that is deficient in the connective tissue of a subset of edsht patients patients with edsht often experience significant musculoskeletal complications including frequent joint dislocations subluxations and early onset osteoarthritis fibroblast is a type of cell that synthesizes the extracellular matrix and collagen and are the most common cells in connective tissue in laymans terms fibroblast synthesizes a reaction outside a damaged cell activating structural and biochemical support outside the plasma membranes causing the cell to repair itself after injury kirks third security llc owns  of fibrocells stock or about  million worth important clinical results from an ongoing phase ii trial in the burn contracture setting are expected in the first quarter of  in addition the phase ii trial in the vocal cord scarring setting is also expected to release topline data in q  we can see kirk appears to invest in companies with potential cutting edge technology his investment in intrexon seems to be supportive of the other companies mentioned here that he has also invested in we like to follow successful money and randall kirk has proven himself over time as being a successful investor in these types of companies similar to how the baker brothers llc has had top success in the developmental biotech space technology always advances and we believe the companies we mention here have the potential for major breakthru in this advancement  obviously so does

trading topstockanalysts toggle navigation    login sign in remember me forget username or password subscribe now a legendary biotech investor just spent  million on this stock tuesday april    am by david sterman randal j kirk is beside himself right now the legendary biotech investor who is now worth more than  billion made a rare misstep by plunking down  million at  a share on halozyme therapeutics nasdaq halo in february only to see that investment lose a quarter of its value on monday april    his nearly  stake in the company is now worth roughly  million down from nearly  million before mondays plunge thats when the food  drug administration fda told halozyme  along with key partner baxter nyse bax  that further clinical testing for a key drug would be required this put an abrupt end to a solid upward move in the stock which only recently saw the companys value move past the  billion mark but kirk figures to still profit handsomely as halozymes biotechnology platform should still reap solid rewards in the years to come halozyme has been garnering a steadily rising buzz in biotech circles thanks to the impressive action of its key product hyalurodinase the drug mimics hyoluric acid which is naturally produced by the body as a gellike substance halozymes hyalurodinase has proven quite effective at helping drugs to be absorbed into the bloodstream baxter and roche holdings pink sheets rhbby have poured money into halozyme in exchange for the rights to market several drugs that are currently before the fda in both instances those two big pharma players want to use hyalurodinase to convert existing intravenous iv drugs into subcutaneous injectable drugs roche for example has paired up halozymes drug with its own herceptin and rituxan drugs both of which are seen as key parts of roches future sales growth analysts at brean murray have repeatedly suggested that roche might look to buy halozyme at around  a share if the fda issues a full set of green lights for the drug combinations shares had been surging in recent months on news that clinical trials pairing hyaluronidase with other drugs were going very well biotech investors first began chatting about halozyme in late  when the company brought in a new business development team that subsequently initiated several new key partnerships in june  halozyme signed a development deal with privatelyheld intrexon to develop a subcutaneous version of aat a protease inhibitor used to stop inflammation in respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis and emphysema a partnership with viropharma nasdaq vphm was also launched and clinical tests are now underway for pairing hyalurodinase and viropharmas cinryze which treats a fairly obscure genetic blood disease these partnerships are being pursued in tandem with halozymes own proprietary drugdevelopment efforts for example the company recently announced solid phase i testing data for hti which treats extreme cellulite the opportunity in the cosmetic market possibly holds even higher potential than halozymes multiple partnerships lastly halozyme is also developing pegph to treat pancreatic cancer and eli lilly nyse lly is looking at using it in tandem with its gemcitabine drug which is used in chemotherapy parsing the fdas response so does the fdas move to ask baxter and halozyme to submit more longterm data render hyalurodinase much less worthwhile not at all to be sure a possible  product launch is now unlikely to happen and conservative investors may wish to assume that that the baxterhalozyme drug known as hyq wont get approved at all analysts at goldman sachs still think hyq will get approved though that may come as late as  if a new clinical trial is required heres the key takeaway the fda has not cast doubt on hyq but says the companies should be providing more longterm clinicaltesting data so shares were dumped on monday because halozymes expected revenue ramp will be pushed out by at least several quarters and as is the case with many biotech stocks this quickly leads to concerns about financial strength while the move to profitability is delayed halozyme was fortunate to raise roughly  million in february which is when randal kirk bought his shares the company now has an estimated  million in the bank which is likely sufficient to fund operations for another  months in the interim the company may also receive royalty payments from other partners as key drugs advance in the clinical testing process taking account of the fda setback analysts at brean murray lowered their target price from  to  although some biotech investors including randal kirk presumably believe halozymes biotechnology platform could be worth much more than that risks to consider halozyme is expected to report a range of other clinicaltesting information in the coming  months and will need to show continued positive results before shares can rebound action to take this is all about risk and reward mondays setback has removed much of the nearterm risk from the stock shares may simply tread water in the absence of nearterm catalysts but shares would quickly spike well north of  again if the cellulite drug opportunity starts to heat up or if roches marketing efforts start to pay off and halozyme starts to report an impressive sales ramp as is the case with any biotech stock investors should only accord a smaller portion of funds to this speculative type of business model but mondays selloff looks like a great opportunity to step in as other investors step away note if you havent

written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans

specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
