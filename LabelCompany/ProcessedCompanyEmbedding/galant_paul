about high level financial results second the progress with our next generation solutions and third the divestiture activities we announced in our press release issued today the verifone team delivered second quarter results at the highend of our revenue projection and above our nongaap earnings per share guidance revenue momentum was driven by doubledigit sequential growth in our north america retail and smb business verticals and by strong demand for devices in india and in other countries executing their payment electronification and fiscalization programs verifones most important strategic goal for  remains the successful launch of our next generation solutions and im encouraged by our progress and the growth of the sales pipeline for our new engage carbon and mobile platforms now specific to engage we have recently achieved pci certification on the current lineup of this device family and have numerous committed client certifications and pilot programs launched across the globe clients are selecting engage and our services platform to upgrade and enhance security and transform consumer experiences in their stores in germany for instance six of the top eight payment service providers have now certified engage and started rolling it out to their merchants our early successes in germany and in other first out engage markets such as france india japan and south africa give us confidence in our future revenue and margin growth on the carbon front we recently announced our second device the carbon  and we are continuing to develop a full line of this androidbased device family to enable integrated point of sales solutions globally carbon leverages our growing services platform and integrates consumer check out with advanced business software and an ecosystem of vertical applications that help merchants run and grow their businesses the recent and steady rise in popularity of ipos solutions is driving banks and acquirers globally to work with verifones carbon platform to deliver these capabilities to their small and mediumsized merchants our firstout carbon pilot with vantiv is progressing in north america and we now have new client engagements underway in all of our regions verifones mobile devices are increasingly in demand by our tier clients who are supplementing their existing verifone terminals with our mobile devices to enhance the consumer checkout experience with endless aisle and linebusting capabilities inside their stores our large market share in tier retail in north america ensures that as clients make the decision to add mobile verifone will capture a large portion of this upside we have also recently announced a new midrange mpos solution based on the carbon platform that will position us well to compete for smb and emerging markets business given that the tam for mpos is growing faster than traditional payment terminals we are committed to further developing our mobility product portfolio to address this growing demand on the services front we continue to win the vast majority of qsr clients in north america verifones payment as a service platform used widely by qsrs is now being extended to serve new verticals such as lottery where we recently formed a new strategic partnership with one of the largest suppliers of lottery systems in the us in emea we are aggressively expanding our omnichannel service offering and have won first time mandates with large southern european clients our increased investment in payment services will help us to capture greenfield growth and market share gains made possible by pan european regulatory changes such as psd which mandates the acceptance of bank accounts through account payments at the point of sale we have already launched this acceptance functionality through widely used mobile phone apps such as wips ph and mobilepay prompting merchants throughout the nordics to shift their services business from competitors to verifone and in latin america the team recently won new strategic service contracts with some of the largest banks and acquirers the steadily growing appeal of emerging ipos solutions and other startup payment innovations is proving to be a significantly positive driver for verifones future market expansion clients experiment with solutions from niche players but they are increasingly turning to verifone to develop  to deliver superior solutions at scale more than anything they are choosing to scale with verifone because they trust that our solutions are delivered with the security global domain expertise and broad services they’ve counted on from us for decades our growing services platform connects to all of our next generation devices and opens up a large annuity revenue and profit pool for verifone it is helping us to pivot our business from payment devices to vertically specialized payments in commerce solutions that incorporate our broad universe of point of sales software and capabilities such as powerful estate management robust payment and security services and a rich software tool set aimed at developers acquirers and merchants as a result of this our sales pipeline of next generation solutions is growing steadily and this requires us to really focus more of our existing resources and our capital on our core business and on the client execution we have in front of us to this end we are optimizing our business portfolio and executing plans to divest nonstrategic assets including our petro media and taxi businesses additionally we are restructuring our china operations into a minority holding in light of these markets increasingly challenging outlook let me provide appropriate detail first i will discuss petro media on our previous call we announced the formation of our joint venture with gas station tv in which verifone contributed our petroleum media business this transaction closed in early april we believe this joint venture creates advantages in scale and the quality of consumer experience achieved through a consolidated national media platform and it allows us to focus our resources and capital on our payments and commerce business next let me discuss taxi we previously stated that the taxi business was under review our taxi team has made good progress in developing a service oriented taxi platform and launching our curb hailing and ride sharing application to compete and grow this business on a global basis requires focus and additional resources and capital as such we believe that we are not the ideal steward to drive the next chapter growth of the taxi business given our strategic priority to scale our next generation solutions after evaluating several options we have concluded that selling the business ensures the best potential value creation for all of our constituents including our clients and shareholders and active sales processes underway we have received indications of interest and we expect to complete this divestiture in the coming quarters finally after a strategic review of the china market we made the decision to divest control a verifones china business into a minority interest in a chinaowned entity despite achieving recent share gains with the top chinese banks and the largest iso we see increasing barriers to doing business in china as a public us technology company furthermore we now see a greater than expected slowdown in demand for payment terminals and unacceptable longterm profitability marc will discuss the financial impact of our actions in more detail in this section in closing we are pleased with our q results and our clients growing commitment to our next generation solutions our execution roadmap for the second half of our fiscal year will set us up for return to growth in  the team here is operating with discipline and a sense of urgency to deliver the growth plans we outlined at our analyst day back in january with that let me now hand the call over to my partner marc for his comments marc marc rothman thank you paul and good afternoon everyone for the second quarter net revenues of  million matched the topend of guidance and grew  from the prior quarter the topline results in q benefited from standout strength in our asia pacific region with seasonal rebalance in emea and latin america offsetting anticipated q weakness within our north america petro vertical driven by the threeyear postponement of the emv liability shift deadline our consolidated gross margin in q was  consistent with our expectations and  basis points above q levels with respect to our operating costs we continue to invest in our next generation growth platforms but a disciplined focus and efficiencies and continued restructuring efforts are enabling us to drive lower run rate expenses and as a result we exceeded nongaap eps guidance and delivered  per share for the quarter let me now discuss our results by business q revenues for our systems business was  million an increase of  from the prior quarter and down approximately  yearonyear inline with expectations the yearonyear decline primarily reflects the difficult comp created by the prior year surge in us emv related demand systems margins of  in q were higher sequentially by  basis points driven by continued cost reductions in operations and supply chain and to this end we are forecasting improved product margins in the second half of  driven primarily by cost reductions and new product introductions our services business delivered revenue of  million in q slightly lower versus the prior year services strengthened in latin america was offset by lower sales of petro media our gross margins and services were  as expected and up slightly from the prior quarter the yearoveryear comparison was impacted by a reduction in petro media revenue where margins fluctuate on volume changes given our fixed cost infrastructure additionally now as a result of our divestiture and restructuring activities we expect our services margin percentages to improve meaningfully and i will discuss that in just a moment our q consolidated operating expenses were  million down sequentially on lower ga cost and reflect a decrease of  million compared with the prior year driven by our focus on reducing costs in the quarter total restructuring and related charges of  million in the quarter were attributable primarily to our petro media business where we recorded  million in net charges related to terminating certain customer agreements and other activities associated with forming the joint venture additionally for taxi we recorded a  million goodwill impairment related to the planned divestiture let me now discuss performance by geography in north america we deliver revenue of  million representing a  decline yearoveryear and down  sequentially this sequential decline was limited to our petro vertical which is impacted by the emv delay at the pump and the deconsolidation of our petro media revenues despite the results in petro our performance in north america during q was encouraging our retail vertical grew by  sequentially benefiting from several large qsr deployments onboarding of new payment as a service clients as well as refresh business with early tier retail adopters of emv importantly our small business vertical grew sequentially for the first time in the past five quarters as channel inventories began to reach more normalized levels consistent with the timing we recently expected and finally in north america our taxi business was down  sequentially in latin america revenues for q were  million down  yearoveryear and up  sequentially we benefited from strong yearonyear growth in brazil but this was offset by indiscernible challenges in mexico and argentina though we believe most of the shortfall is timing related key recent highlights for brazil include market share gains with the major acquirers and uptrended margins due to improved mix from new service wins in new york middle east and africa revenues of  million were down  from the prior year and up  sequentially despite lower sales yearonyear in germany and parts of south europe which is created by a tough comparison from a pci related upgrade cycle in  we delivered sequential improvements in these markets versus q and specifically eastern europe and russia turned in solid performance versus q where our team is executing on a growing deal pipeline and secured several important client wins and finally in asia q revenues of  million are up more than  yearoveryear and up more than  sequentially demand for devices in india was once again a main driver of growth in fact our q india revenues surpassed our total sales in this country for all of fy although we do expect our second half results to be more normalized after the first half demand surge created from the start of demonetization in addition several asia pacific emerging markets including thailand and malaysia grew by low doubledigit yearonyear turning now to the balance sheet and then to cash flow where we delivered solid performance in q we ended the quarter with total cash of  million gross debt of  million and net debt of  million our debt levels continued to trend lower driven mainly by consistent free cash flow generation within our working capital metrics our cash conversion cycle was  days in q versus  days in q this metric is helped by a day increase in days of accounts payable through the timing of payments and improved terms driven by supplier consolidation as well as strategic supply chain initiatives we reduced inventory levels by  million sequentially driven substantially by our divestiture activities for the quarter we delivered cash flow from operations totaling  million and free cash flow of  million yeartodate our free cash flow conversion ratio was approximately  additionally we have continued to reduce our capex with total outlays of  million during q as compared to  million in q of  and now to our financial outlook as paul commented we are seeing an increase in business momentum successfully executing operational improvements and reallocating resources in capital to our core payments and commerce business in support of this we are divesting three businesses additionally we are updating our outlook for our north american petro vertical and let me now provide additional financial details first petro media as previously announced we formed a petro media joint venture in q as a result our petro media revenues for the second half of  will no longer be consolidated in our financial results our full year guidance reflects this divestiture second china we are planning to divest our china business in which verifone will retain a minority interest this reconstituted local chinese entity is expected to be funded by third parties and we also expect our transaction to be completed this quarter and our financial guidance now reflects a  million reduction in revenue associated with this transaction for the second half of  third taxi we are actively engaged in discussion to sell our taxi operations we will continue to report operating results and our financials until disposition which we expect to be completed in the coming quarters our expectations for taxi in the second half of  are included in our current guidance and totaled approximately  million in revenue with a modest earnings contribution let me discuss a guidance bridge on our slide page  we are bridging the impact of the nongaap revenue and eps related to the divestiture activities just discussed as well as the incremental impact of the pushout of client demand for emv petro solutions for the second half of  the delay in the liability shift is impacting revenues by approximately  million to  million relative to our prior projections with that background let me now provide the consolidated financial guidance for the full year and the third quarter for the full year  we now expect gaap revenue of  billion to  billion and comparable nongaap revenue of approximately  to  billion additionally we expect the gaap loss per share of  to  and for nongaap eps for the full year we expect the  to  for q we expect both gaap and nongaap revenues of  million to  million and expect gaap eps of  to  and nongaap eps of  to  free cash flow from operations for the full year is expected to be approximately  million now and includes now approximately  million for restructuring related activities additionally please refer to slide  of our earnings presentation for other supplemental forwardlooking financial information including updated revenue gross margin operating expense operating margin eps targets in q q and for the full year and these do reflect the china and petro media divestitures we believe this information will be very helpful for modeling purposes for the remainder of  and beyond thank you and with that we will now open up the call to take your questions austin questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question comes from tientsin huang with jp morgan i apologize one moment tientsin huang can you hear me operator sure your line is fine paul galant i believe youre fine tientsin tientsin huang hey guys thanks for the details it’s actually coming on from the airport just  i guess the china stuff i will ask about not too surprised to hear the divestitures out there but im curious are you going to be closer to a  stake here or closer to a single digit and i guess paul you mentioned something about longterm structural or some longterm close of terminals in china can you maybe elaborate on that im trying to understand how much of this is sort of country specific versus maybe something different going on from a technology point of sales standpoint in china paul galant let me take that tientsin first and then i will roll it over to marc for his comments on percentages i think you know that china has been on pretty much a tear for some period of time as they put terminals in place in a country that was primarily  predominantly cash i think in  there were like four terminals per  people today they are closer to  so they have certainly grown quite a bit since  i think the growth rate has come down by probably  we expect that to continue to decline so essentially they are not going to grow as fast from our vantage point the market is being saturated at this point there are many competitors they keep piling on they are all making purpose built devices some of them are pci compliant some of them are not and as we look at the longterm profitability of this market as a us public company we just dont see that as a great place to continue putting as much resource and capital and so over the last two quarters we monitored the situation closely we spent a lot of time on the ground there we’ve come to the conclusion that it’s best not to be a us public technology company trying to compete in china it is best however for us to continue staying in china with a minority interest marc you want to talk about the joint venture marc rothman yes i would like to thank you paul hey tientsin so just a quick point or two on china the intention while we were going through this process by the way which we expect to complete this quarter is to take a fairly small minority interest in the entity the expectation of course is that will be a deconsolidated and perhaps be treated more in a cost basis so that would be perhaps even less than  but it is still a work in progress there but it is just to seek control and secondly i think it would be helpful just to talk a little bit more about the guidance associated with china we had originally projected for the period of time that we intend to after the fact would have divested about  million so we took that out of our prior guidance and it was also in fact expected to continue with investments so it will pick up  they will be accretive if you will for  to divest that business i think its important to note as well that during the first half of the year it was dilutive probably close to the same number so we think as we project into  and perhaps we will be providing some more color on  today and more so in q and q results but the losses that obviously we are incurring for the first half of this year provide accretion into next year too tientsin huang got it thanks for that so i guess as my quick followup just  is there more to do on the divestiture front and with capital raised from some of these actions what should we expect in terms of what you might do here is it more in a way of maybe there is more acquisitions or can we see some buybacks in the stock just curious paul galant our capital allocation policy is what’s guiding us there is really no change to it we will continue to look at acquisition opportunities as we have had over time with particular focus on things that are tuckin that help us to accelerate our transformation to a solutions and platform company we will continue to look at distribution properties that have software capabilities across the globe as we go from selling terminals to providing solutions and then of course we are always going to look at balanced debt repayments and we still have  million left in our authorized stock repurchase program that we might choose to use proceeds but again there is really no change to the policy there is no change to the outlook tientsin huang great all right thank you for the update christopher mammone thank you operator and our next question comes from darrin peller with barclays please go ahead darrin peller hey thanks guys listen just to make sure we are clear on this the petro moves you are making i mean when you talk about first of all what’s embedded in your guidance now is that just the petro emv impacts or is that actually the divestiture i think you said it was  or maybe you just clarify that first paul galant sure i will in fact the petro media revenue projections were actually out last quarter so this was just highlighting the completion of that joint venture and reaffirming that in the original guidance we had previously pulled out that number secondly to your question on the emv shift and the push out thats the  million to  million darrin peller okay all right so thats helpful i guess then on the overall market so that  million to  million before i go to the overall thats incremental now that we didnt see before as much of i mean we knew there was a delay but the impacts are just a little more pronounced or noticeable now marc marc rothman thats right i mean the silver lining here is the fact that weve got this very strategic partnership with gilbarco and the market is not going away these dispensers and these terminals have to get upgraded it will happen over the cycle and it will be more normalized in nature we just began to see in q a more significant push out than we had previously planned so we thought it would be prudent to adjust the second half of the year based upon our forecast but as i said the silver lining here is that the business is going to happen it’s just going to happen more normalized over that three year cycle darrin peller okay paul galant let me just add a little bit  let me add a little bit to that when this first was announced there is a threeyear delay as i think everybody agrees it was a bit of surprise no one was really anticipating a delay that long our projections that we made were essentially that the big guys were going to continue with their upgrade as if there was no push back because they had already started and so we thought that they were going to continue to do that maybe at a slightly lower rate and then we projected that the smaller guys were going to push out they were going to essentially not worry about it in  probably not in  either maybe start to think about it in  the reason why weve now seen another  million to  million of reduction in our projection is because we are seeing some of the big guys are actually slowing down a little bit which we did not anticipate at first but overall as marc said and this is the key point this is going to happen its just going to happen over a longer period of time we are still going to earn all the economics darrin peller okay that helps all right now putting aside the divestitures on your core strategy now i guess paul can you just give us an update again on the north america on the certifications for the new suite of products whether its carbon or and then us and abroad and then visibility into smb adoption there and maybe just ended of with the overall conviction you have in your forecast on the rest of the business right now and how things are feeling in terms of conviction and confidence paul galant lets take that one at a time here for the north america business we still have approximately  million devices that need to be upgraded to evm the evm date now is somewhere around april of  so we should start to see a more pronounced pick up in that as we mentioned about a million pumps need to be upgraded but thats not till  today we think anywhere from  or so of the pumps have the ability to take an evm payment although none of them are turned on okay darrin peller okay paul galant there is also additional devices that we are starting to see that are important so the whole mpos the mobility side of it we are seeing an increase in that and we think at that time closer to  million devices so thats sort of the north america footprint we believe that we are going to see in the second half of the year a continuation of what we saw in q which is slight strengthening quartertoquarter in the smb business slight strengthening quartertoquarter in the retail business and the retail business is really growing based on more of the mobility side than on the traditional terminal side darrin peller got it paul galant all right we also have growth from qsr we have growth from lodging we have growth from pay at the table and we have growth from lottery those are all of the verticals on the pci certification side which is a question you asked we have now achieved pci certification of our entire current lineup of engaged devices so the full sweep the portable the counter top the pinpad the whole deck so once you receive pci certification you obviously start to work with the clients who want to pilot  they go through a certification they go through pilot and then they decide how much they want to buy right so thats where we are on engage on carbon we achieved certification  pci certification on carbon  and we have announced our carbon  device so thats proceeding to plan and we feel pretty good about it darrin peller okay so your conviction levels outside of the petro area per se and obviously taxi in china i mean it sounds like everything else is growing on track or it actually has got real growth potential now paul galant we feel quite confident that  will be a growth year for the company there are many reasons why we feel that way so its not just a single thing its multiple things darrin peller great all right guys thanks very much paul galant and its really very much alignment with what we said in january at analyst day darrin peller okay all right thanks guys christopher mammone thank you darrin operator our next question is from brad berning with craighallum please go ahead brad berning good afternoon given the changes on apac revenues with the divestiture and the normalization of india maybe you could be a little bit more specific about second half look  outlook for apac and kind of all the different changes what you are thinking about that contribution secondly if you just continue to expand upon your comments that you just made about  and returning to growth maybe you can talk a little bit about how much of that is expectations based on trends how much of that is based upon order discussions or preliminary discussions on new products please us understand a little bit more about the visibility of that versus the expectation of growth in  marc rothman sure hey brad marc here let me talk geos i will cover asia a lot of conviction around the asia in the second half we are adjusting pro forma for china but even still and very consistent with last quarters guidance asia will be upwards of up  and past  growth yearonyear mids and with the petro adjustments including petro media i think north america now slightly above  decline but better trajectory certainly around retail and smb latin america and emea those projections are relatively consistent with what we provided last quarter see both flattish perhaps slightly up plus or minus a percent or two but relatively consistent with what we provided last quarter the big shift is the petro business some color around the divestitures but we are quite bullish around asia particularly still in india from a relative basis but there is a lot of momentum around cashless and fiscalization programs in a number of emerging markets that i mentioned paul galant yes let me just add indonesia thailand malaysia even places like myanmar vietnam philippines all of those countries japan  all of those countries are going through either fiscalization or electronification initiatives some driven by government some driven by just continuation of what was started some driven like in japan by in fact that as evm start to take hold in the us some of the fraud is moving to them and they need to start combating it and they have got some important things happening like the rugby world cup in  and the tokyo olympics in  so we believe that our asia business has a number of good growth opportunities we are active in all of these markets we are doing a lot of good listening and experimenting and pilots with clients and we feel good about our trajectory for the second half of the year marc rothman you asked about  we provided as you are aware some longer term projections   to  on the business we have it narrowed down this time in our planning cycle what perhaps that means for  but there is a lot of momentum around a foundation of new certified devices and we are really excited about the potential for ipos and the carbon portfolio as well as the mpos devices the services business in north america continues to go very well continue to work down the backlog and that provides a nice annuity base of revenues too so we will provide more color on  revenues but the trajectory looks positive off the of the guidance that we have provided for the medium range plan brad berning thank you for the update i appreciate it marc rothman thanks brad operator our next question comes from andrew jeffrey with suntrust please go ahead andrew jeffrey hi guys thank you for taking the question a real high level i guess we have seen a few events obviously emv delays in the us and now retail technical difficulty i just wonder how you think about your overall visibility to business performance especially given how geographically diversified you are and when you think about maybe over a multiyear period the things you are going to do but as you go through the planning process for  you maybe take a different approach a more conservative approach to your outlook just given that there are so many moving pieces and apparently mobiles ability of recent certain geos and ive got a followup paul galant andrew thanks for the question i guess let me startoff the biggest complexity in visibility comes from things like rule changes obviously most people didnt anticipate demonetization in india that was a positive obviously you had the emv delays that you talked about those are very difficult to predict one can anticipate some amount on a global portfolio basis will be delayed but beyond that we are  i think becoming better and better at forecasting a lot of precision has been put around how we manage our sales pipeline there is a much more cohesive globally managed business in verifone today than weve ever had and so i think that indiscernible believe that we are in a much better place today to give guidance with conviction than we were some point in the last couple of years having said that again government cues things like that nobody cant control andrew jeffrey okay so it sounds like maybe to some degree you are intimating that the philosophical approach maybe is to risk adjust perhaps a little more i guess a way to  guidance sort of a competitive question with regard to mpos is there a geographic bifurcation in your thinking in other words you have seen a lot of competitors have quite a bit of success most recently it appeared that clover is really gaining some traction is the us really a viable mpos growth market for verifone versus rest of world any feeling about those geos any differently today or run in a different way paul galant okay andrew so lets separate mpos from ipos mpos being mobile point of sale north america absolutely is a growth market for us in mobile point of sale we started to compete and work in the mobile point of sale phase in north america targeting tier clients and thats because they are the ones that really have to reinvent the consumer experience instore to be competitive so there is not a single tier north america merchant who doesnt have mpos in their planning cycle they are either piloting it rolling it out certainly thinking about it and given our very high market share we are about   in tier retail in north america we think that is an important revenue and profitable for the company so thats that where we were not as active as perhaps we should have been was in the small and medium market we have no interest in the micro merchants but in a small and medium merchants and in the emerging markets where you have sort of a different definition of a small merchant than you have in the developed markets in those markets you really need a much lower price with lower feature set  set of devices we have not focused on in that what ive announced in the remarks i made earlier was that we now launched  in the process of launching a midtier mpos device which we did not have and you will see us continue to also go to perhaps the lower tier and mpos devices to cover the emerging markets and in places that are doing terminalization demonetization et cetera we really do want to have a set of solutions for those markets which we dont have today andrew jeffrey okay so thats to say that perhaps and thats a really helpful distinction thank you that perhaps to say that the ipos market in the us is distinct than the mpos market isnt probably a real focus for growth would you  is that a reasonable comment paul galant absolutely absolutely you have seen ipos gain in popularity it has become steadily more interesting you have had a number of important brands start to demonstrate that its a new segment that they have created and during that it really does open up a important tam for verifone that we just did not have a year ago or two years ago and so we are quite excited about it carbon is the device and the software platform that connects to carbon is the thing that really makes us quite excited about the future of this segment it is a future of not just terminal sales but also backend services andrew jeffrey thank you very much christopher mammone thank you operator our next question comes from james schneider with goldman sachs please go ahead james schneider good afternoon thanks for taking my question maybe paul can we return to the commentary you made on the engage and the sales platform and you see there maybe any kind of quantification you can provide around kind of indicators of awarders in terms of how big you think engage could be for you as a number and maybe fiscal  or how many countries you will be shipping engage actively in exiting this fiscal year or some kind of metrics of that nature paul galant yes happy to answer that question so as i mentioned engage is one of our nextgen platforms it is a full line of terminals that not only take payments but can run applications the engage products connect to the same services platform that we used for carbon and in q we rolled out engage in places like india in q we rolled it out in places like japan france and germany in q and q they really are going to take hold in many many more countries the first experiences in rollout have been very very good clients really love the devices they like the speed they love the screen quality they like the abilities that those devices have so we feel quite confident in that i think as you look a year or two three four years out what you are going to see is that engage will supplement some of the mx and vx devices that the company obviously have been driving for more than a decade james schneider thank you and then maybe as a followup on the financial side for you marc maybe with respect to the divestitures can you really talk about two dimensions number one is when you get clear of all these transactions i guess i would have thought that there might an opportunity to do buyback for something to where that might be closer to eps if we do than what you are guiding to so can you help us with that thats the first part and then the second part would be  once we get clear of the taxi divestiture piece as well on a kind of applestoapples volume basis what do you expect to happen in both product and  systems and services from a gross margin perspective when accounting for all those divestitures marc rothman so on the capital allocation paul covered it a bit earlier jim and thats to really keep the capital out allocation policy as we have stated im not expecting some tremendous windfall from this activity in fact the joint venture is  there is not a monetary today benefit back to verifone its a contribution of assets so there is no money is flowing back to we have to obviously wait to see how the china  the taxi process plays out and what type of purchase price we ultimately are able to receive but nonetheless free cash flow continues to be strong there is an opportunity from proceeds from these transactions that we could put forth back to either reducing debt we have capacity we can still lever the revolver and were transactions in terms of ma tuckin makes sense we will do that i think going into  certainly we will continue to look at valuation on a relative basis and buybacks are certainly part of the strategic capital allocation discussions and that will be certainly up for consideration but right now as paul mentioned we have got  million left under the previous authorized buyback and lets just stay tight on that one  that one for the moment great question and thank you for asking it on the profile going into  there is a number of scenarios that play out taxi as i mentioned is still in the guidance and i was hopeful and im still that the information that weve provided in the slides will give you some really good perspective in terms of our margin trajectory in the third and fourth quarter and into next year we can talk about that now so we see basis point improvement in parts of the gross margin let me just get the numbers out here so i can be precise in particular so hold on second i have lot of papers here jim so we did  points of margin in q as a result of the petro media and china revenues and of the portfolio as well as some of the new product introductions we see a  basis point improvement in each of q and q so we see trajectory up to  then  and if you look in particular at the services line we see ourselves back into the mids we see a clear path todate it’s a   margins and as we divest taxi business because those margins are also significantly lower than the services average we see accretion as we divest that business chris and i will provide enough financial information that folks can clearly model that as well but the margin profile we see absolutely in the right trajectory which is going to drive higher operating margins for the business as well as eps accretion james schneider thank you marc rothman hope thats helpful thank you jim paul galant important to note thats mostly on the services line which is where we are focused taking the company james schneider understand thanks very much marc rothman thanks operator our next question comes from ramsey elassal with jefferies please go ahead ramsey elassal hi guys i wanted to make sure that i got this so apologies in advance if you have already addressed this but you closed the petro media jv in early april so what was the eps impact in the quarter from not consolidating our revenue as of early april was there any headwind or tailwind in that quarter due to that marc rothman it was fairly benign we didnt have much in terms of revenue closed in early april there was some dilution albeit small probably about a penny a share ramsey elassal okay and then understanding it sounds like its going to be nicely accretive on the margin side of the divestitures how do we  how should we think about the impact on your sort of organic growth profile overall going forward marc rothman i would say on the organic growth profile going forward its relatively consistent i mean these are small businesses the petro media business last year was sub million it was investment mode so it’s also generally accretive as i just commented on the q results and china the same  china was also  last year it was sub million we had planned it for significant growth obviously it wont play out that way with the divestitures but it too will be accretive in nature ramsey elassal okay so not much topline impact okay and then lastly for me you called out in the past sort of supply chain optimization as a driver of margin expansion where are you in that process is that something that we can continue to kind of bank on as a longterm driver or what earning are you earn with supply chain optimization marc rothman on supply chain the team has made tremendous progress its an ongoing exercise relentless exercise and focus on all aspects of it from procurement to logistics to freight to repair et cetera et cetera and we will continue to drive savings from it the major opportunity in the system side the hardware side will be the new product introductions that have a significantly lower building materials we are thoughtful and cautious about the trajectory i see in the second half of this year with a new product introduction to see some accretion on the gross margin line but we are going to be balanced things do ebb and flow relative to mix things do ebb and flow relative to competitive pricing and other challenges but we do see some improvement and certainly the supply chain folks will have a nice impact on either that balance or improvement ramsey elassal all right great thanks so much marc rothman thank you operator our next question is from wayne johnson with raymond james please go ahead wayne johnson hi yes good afternoon couple of questions on the services side could you give us an update on how many devices are attached now to services and your global platform and i think like in the year ago quarter you guys were talking about there is  million there kind of incremental annual revenue where are we on that and what is the outlook for that and given your comments i mean it certainly sounds favorable but i just like to get some detail please paul galant let me take a shoot marc can help me by correcting all my errors marc rothman never never paul galant never so right now we have at verifone approximately  million devices connected back to us either through gateway or through our terminal management solution and in either of those we are able to deliver software to the device and thats where we start to see good upside of the services in north america we got about  million devices connected we expect that to grow steadily in q we connected approximately  devices we have commitments for another  devices and today we have got a pretty significant backlog of approximately  devices so  in the box connected doing their job today with more to come we expect that number to grow steadily in emea approximately half of our devices are connected so there is  give or take about  million devices connected today and that will continue to grow especially as we move carbon and engage into the region latin america really not very much i would say probably in the low  or  range and in asia pacific where most of the connected devices for us are new zealand and australia we have bit more than  so thats the picture today as we move to our platforms as we move to our next generation devices this number will go up wayne johnson good thank you for that color thats helpful and then this question is for marc on the fx in the second quarter and for the outlook can you just remind us where there tailwinds was it neutral how does that all play out marc rothman slightly favorable in q wayne so it was probably about  basis points favorable and it will be more balanced going forward as well more consistent with our reported results wayne johnson okay great all right thank you very much marc rothman thank you wayne paul galant sure thank you christopher mammone operator we have time for one more question please operator okay and our last question will come from bryan keane with deutsche bank please go ahead bryan keane hi guys thanks for fitting me in just wanted to ask about services i knew was up about  last quarter yearoveryear and down  yearoveryear in the second quarter and i know there is a lot of moving pieces so maybe you could just help us through kind of what services look like and the decline there is there some impacts that we can call out paul galant before marc answers that specifically i just want to be sort of start at the top side of this strategically what we are doing is we are taking services businesses that today like petro media and taxi which are not for us leveragable globally which are not core to payments in commerce and we are replacing or moving that revenue out taking the resources and capital and applying it to growing our payments and commerce services business which is hinged in great part on being able to provide integrated and semiintegrated services with devices like carbon and engage so we are still very much committed to the services space its just you are going to see us pivot out of certain types of services businesses and doubling down on those that we think have the most growth and margin potential marc rothman thanks paul we did a  million as you mentioned in q services and it is down over the prior year it is principally related to the petro media business we so had petro media revenues in the prior period which we divested out on early april so that ma or that divestiture activity had some impact i think maybe more importantly bryan moving forward and into q as just a proxy i see low single digit growth sequentially so on an applestoapples basis there continues to be technical difficulty operator pardon me this is the conference operator we have temporarily lost the location and the speakers please hold for a moment while we reconnect in technical difficulty operator i have reconnected the speakers you may proceed marc rothman fortunately that was our question bryan are you still on the line bryan keane yes i think you answered you basically answered sounds like sequentially it gets better the only other little question i have is just on free cash guide they went from i think  to  i assume thats a lot of thats due to petro business or anything else in there thanks so much marc rothman its actually its substantially all related to the restructuring activities but you are correct its intertwined with the petro restructuring and the small eps adjustment as a result of we think will be offset by some working capital improvements but it will be approximately  million and its planning for  million in restructuring during the second half bryan keane okay thanks so much marc rothman i appreciate it paul galant so in closing let me just say thanks again to everyone joining the call today the team here is really excited about our clients enthusiasm for our next generation solutions we are committed to driving additional efficiency gains and to completing the restructurings and divestitures of nonstrategic businesses all told we are feeling positive about the prospects full return to growth in  for verifone we will be presenting and hosting investor meeting at the jpmorgan and paul hastings nextgen payment services forum later this month in san francisco and so we do hope to see many of you while we are out on the road with that

instructions otherwise wellmade a sturdy wellmade filing cabinet thats more attractive than most but  speaking as someone whos put together plenty of ikea furniture over the years  this was a rare case where the instructions failed me after assembling the drawers and the cabinet with no issues the instructions for loading the drawers into the cabinet turned out to be unworkable meaning following the instructions resulted in damage to the unit this is the only ikea product ive ever had to return date published  rated  out of  by squandabird from great looking cabinet but very spendy for the size gave only  stars as during assembly when installing the top panel the grooved slot would not fit into the tongue that sticks up from the back panel it was off by a good  i am handy so instead of returning it i used a router to make the slot wider and got it to fit nicely also had a crack in one of the side panels but was on the inside not effecting the cosmetics date published  rated  out of  by sorrowful from expensive nightmare i wanted a non metal file cabinet for our home office and my husband required a lock on it hence the purchase of the ikea talent my adult daughter helped in the assembly of said cabinet and we were slow and deliberate in our work  hours later when we had cabinet assembled leveled and ready for drawers the file cabinet would not function properly another hour messing with it and we surmised a side bracket mounted on cabinet side is off  inch making proper drawer operation impossible operation i live  hours from nearest ikea dont purchase  down
