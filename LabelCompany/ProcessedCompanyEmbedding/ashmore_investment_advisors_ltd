and to learn about the requirements for certification common credentials  this is not a complete list of certifications there is no implied endorsement of one certification over another professional designations attained by an advisor do not guarantee a profit or protect against loss in periods of declining values do you offer the services i need investment advisory practices vary widely in the services they provide in general they fall into one or a combination of the categories listed below money managers if you need someone to manage your portfolio and do your investing consider money managers they design investment portfolios generally consisting of stocks bonds and other individual securities often manage the portfolio on a discretionary basis meaning that you authorize the advisor to trade on your behalf without the need for advance approval from you may not offer general financial planning services financial planners if you need someone to review your situation and help with bigpicture planning consider financial planners they help you look to the future and do longterm financial planning in the areas of retirement college funding wealth transfer tax planning and insurance may not offer investing and portfolio management services wealth managers if you need an advisor who can handle both your investing and planning needs consider wealth managers they provide highly personalized comprehensive financial planning as well as investment and portfolio management for highnetworth clients coordinate with other professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants to serve more complex financial needs which may include tax minimization trust management wealth transfers real estate management and portfolio performance analytics how are you compensated knowing how your advisor is compensated may help you evaluate the relative objectivity of the recommendations you receive independent advisors generally work on a feeonly or feepluscommissions basis types of compensation and what they mean to you fee only assetbased hourly or flat fees many independent advisors charge a percentage of the assets they manage for you typically – this compensation method gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets hourly or flat fees are often associated with a specific onetime service eg developing a financial plan the fee may vary by account size and service in addition to these fees you may pay commissions andor other fees for execution of the trades your advisor makes and for custody of your assets fee plus commissions along with an advisory or financial planning fee some advisors may receive a portion of the commissions you pay when you buy or sell certain financial products the advisor recommends such as insurance policies or annuities commissions only advisors sometimes receive compensation only from sales commissions on the investments they buy and sell for you wrap fees sometimes advisors charge a wrap fee which is typically a single assetbased fee for the advice they provide and the execution of the trades they make how will we work together good communication between you and your advisor is essential asking the questions below can help you judge the amount of attention and regular communication you can expect what to ask with whom will i work in some cases the firm’s principal may conduct your initial meeting and then turn your portfolio over to an associate or a team that actually manages it if personal rapport is important to you ask to meet with the people you’ll be working with how often will we communicate regular contact helps ensure that you and your advisor are clear about your financial goals risk tolerance and investment strategy typically your advisor meets you in person at least annually – and stays in touch more frequently by phone and email how will you report performance at a minimum you should expect to receive account statements from the advisor or custodianbrokerage firm where your assets are held quarterly summaries of yeartodate investment performance a comprehensive annual performance report from your advisor what is the size of your firm a firm’s size – including the number of employees the assets under management and the average portfolio size – can have a bearing on the quality of service you receive large firms may have more resources – an important consideration if your needs call for specialized services small firms may offer more personalized attention the average portfolio size of the advisor’s other clients helps you understand your potential fit with the firm how do you approach investing for people like me things to consider performance ask to see portfolio performance numbers for up and down markets ask the advisor to compare the performance with relevant benchmarks such as the sp ® index during the same time period an advisor should at least meet – and preferably beat – the benchmark investment style advisors may specialize in certain types of investments such as mutual funds stocks or bonds and styles such as growth or value you can assess whether the advisors methodology or style aligns with your objectives asking about an advisors investment style is a good way to make sure that the advisor can explain his or her approach clearly and in a way that you understand decisionmaking advisors who have a disciplined approach to decisionmaking may be more likely to stay focused on your longterm goals many advisors use an asset allocation strategy that has a history of success over time your strategy should be based on your goals time horizon and comfort with risk knowing how often an advisor adjusts portfolios can indicate whether the advisor uses a strategic longterm approach or invests in shortterm trends past performance does not guarantee future results the sp ® index is an index of widely traded stocks indexes are unmanaged do not incur fees or expenses and cannot be invested in directly where will my assets be held independent financial advisors typically use independent custodians – generally brokerage firms or banks – to hold and safeguard their clients’ stocks mutual funds and other assets why should you ask this question you want to be confident that your advisor has chosen a custodian that meets or exceeds the security measures required by industry regulators to help protect your assets look for a custodian with important services such as trade execution and preparation of monthly brokerage statements which allow your advisor to concentrate on managing your portfolio ask about the custodian’s policies to help protect personal and financial information from unauthorized activity preliminary screening you can review pertinent information about an advisor

retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education  at the same time children are entering their ’s with student loan debt which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home even grandparents have modified life goals choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now rather than leaving a larger legacy later in short paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern but with a little advance planning families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college  the growing cost of education according to the college boards latest “trends in higher education report the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes

linkedin share this on facebook email this one option says dextraze is for parents to start saving early with a  college savings plan  “having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans he says for the child “having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals as opposed to the college that offers the most aid and graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom named after section  of the internal revenue code a  plan is a taxadvantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save or even pay in advance for college expenses earnings in a  plan can be tax deferred and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition fees room and board and supplies many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that making education a family affair motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education grandparents relatives and even family friends have also begun creating  accounts in a child’s name not only do  plans offer potential tax advantages they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt “today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college says jennifer tierney vice president morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions and  plans product manager “its so important to plan ahead for grandparents aunts and uncles family friends it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that  plans provide to a child and from a taxperspective to themselves” related reading wealth management the real costs of not saving for college wealth management when little geniuses have big dreams wealth management how to break the ice around family finances a flexible way to save and invest for college the appeal of  plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility there are no income restrictions no required minimum distributions no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account and high contribution limits virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child grandchild niece nephew spouse even a friend according to chris stack a managing consultant at savingforcollegecom one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the  account as opposed to a utma uniform transfers to minors act or ugma uniform gifts to minors act account or other strategy “with s grandparents or extended family give themselves an option but not an obligation to apply their funds to help pay college costs he says  another significant benefit of  plans is taxfree compounding “earning on an account’s growth rather than paying taxes on the earnings provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality stack says “having the ability to withdraw the principal and taxdeferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible while as soon as the child is born is ideal he said some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future says dextraze “at the end of the day the idea is to harmonize all of your goals taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there including ks s and others it’s using all of the available tools that’s how you reach your goals” morgan stanley offers many s from some of the nation’s leading mutual

the recommendations you receive independent advisors generally work on a feeonly or feepluscommissions basis types of compensation and what they mean to you fee only assetbased hourly or flat fees many independent advisors charge a percentage of the assets they manage for you typically – this compensation method gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets hourly or flat fees are

you can expect what to ask with whom will i work in some cases the firm’s principal may conduct your initial meeting and then turn your portfolio over to an associate or a team that actually manages it if personal rapport is important to you ask to meet with the people you’ll be working with how often will we communicate regular contact helps ensure that you and your advisor are clear about your financial goals risk tolerance and investment strategy typically your advisor meets you in person at least annually – and stays in touch more frequently by phone and email how will you report performance at a minimum you should expect to receive account statements from the advisor or custodianbrokerage firm where your assets are held quarterly summaries of yeartodate investment performance a comprehensive annual performance report from your advisor what is the size of your firm a firm’s size – including the number of employees the assets under management and the average portfolio size – can have a bearing on the quality of service you receive large firms may have more resources – an important consideration if your needs call for specialized services small firms may offer more personalized attention the average portfolio size of the advisor’s other clients helps you understand your potential fit with the firm how do you approach investing for people like me things to consider performance ask to see portfolio performance numbers for up and down markets ask the advisor to compare the performance with relevant benchmarks such as the sp ® index during the same time period an advisor should at least meet – and preferably beat – the benchmark investment style advisors may specialize in certain types of investments such as mutual funds stocks or bonds and styles such as growth or value you can assess whether the advisors methodology or style aligns with your objectives asking about an advisors investment style is a good way to make sure that the advisor can explain his or her approach clearly and in a way that you understand decisionmaking advisors who have a disciplined approach to decisionmaking may be more likely to stay focused on your longterm goals many advisors use an asset allocation strategy that has a history of success over time your strategy should be based on your goals time horizon and comfort with risk knowing how often an advisor adjusts portfolios can indicate whether the advisor uses a strategic longterm approach or invests in shortterm trends past performance does not guarantee future results the sp ® index is an index of

rather than leaving a larger legacy later in short paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern but with a little advance planning families can make some savvy moves to help

it may take an extended family to educate one tweet this share this on linkedin share this on facebook email this one option says dextraze is for parents to start saving early with a  college savings plan  “having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans he says for the child “having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals as opposed to the college that offers the most aid and graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom named after section  of the internal revenue code a  plan is a taxadvantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save

contribution limits virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child grandchild niece nephew spouse even a friend according to chris stack a managing consultant at savingforcollegecom one of the

grandparents or extended family give themselves an option but not an obligation to apply their funds to help pay college costs he says  another significant benefit of  plans is taxfree compounding “earning on an account’s growth rather than paying taxes on the earnings provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality stack says “having the ability to withdraw the principal and taxdeferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible while as soon as the child is born is ideal he said some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future says dextraze “at the end of the day the idea is to harmonize
