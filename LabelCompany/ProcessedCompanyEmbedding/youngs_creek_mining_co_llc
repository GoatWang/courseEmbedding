and potentially the big metal leases to the west in june  cloud peak energy acquired youngs creek mining co llc and the cx ranch lands youngs creek is a greenfield surface coal mining project located on the state border in wyoming seven miles south of spring creek mine the cx ranch lands encompass  acres that abut youngs creek to the south and spring creek mine to the north and lay over a substantial deposit of coal on the crow indian reservation to the west on january   big metal and the crow tribe of indians signed an exploration agreement and an option to lease agreement for up to  billion tons of inplace coal on the crow indian reservation west of spring creek mine these agreements have been approved by the us bureau of indian affairs bia and provide big metal the opportunity to explore and define mineable coal in the southwestern portion of the reservation and to exercise rights to lease all or portions of this coal for mining subject to additional regulatory approvals the potential coal deposits are squirrel creek tanner creek and upper youngs creek each subject to a separate option to lease taken together these elements of the proposed spring creek complex cover several distinct political jurisdictions – montana wyoming and crow each with federal overlaps – and feature up to  billion tons of inplace coal and  acres cloud peak energy is in the process of evaluating development and production options to potentially meet demand for both the domestic and export customers the big metal agreements big metal paid the crow tribe  million upon signing the exploration agreement and option to lease agreement and paid an additional  million upon bia approval of these agreements plus annual option payments thereafter during the initial option term that could bring total option payments to  million these payments are only for the right to enter into leases substantial multimillion dollar payments would be made to the tribe upon the exercise of a lease or leases and big metal would then pay production taxes and royalties on coal mined and sold these tax and royalty payments would range from  –  of the price paid by big metal’s customers for coal the initial option period expires in june  there are three coal deposits covered under three separate options to lease if big metal does not exercise a lease during the initial option period the agreement will expire however if a lease option is exercised the option to lease agreement will be extended to  for any remaining unexercised additional leases and additional option payments will be made to the tribe likewise if big metal exercises another option to lease prior to the end of  the option agreement will be extended a final time to  if no other options are exercised by the end of  the option agreement will expire at that time big metal is committed to being a good corporate citizen on the reservation in addition to option exercise royalty and tax payments the coal mineral leases with the tribe – once effective – provide for preferential hiring training and promotion of indians and certain preferences for indiancertified contractors in addition big metal has agreed to provide annual scholarships totaling  per year under the option agreement starting with the  academic year and  per year upon the exercise and approval of a leases these amounts are in  dollars and

surface assets from chevron usa inc chevron and consol energy inc consol for  million of this purchase price  million is allocated to the lease of approximately  million tons of inplace coal and  million to the purchase and lease of  acres of land the coal and land are well suited to support potential increased exports through the pacific northwest youngs creek is a permitted but undeveloped surface mine project in the northern powder river basin located  miles north of sheridan wyoming contiguous with the wyomingmontana state line it is  miles south of cloud peak energy’s spring creek mine and  miles from the mainline railroad “the significant coal and surface assets we acquired position cloud peak energy well for future growth in our asian exports as additional terminal capacity becomes available the location of the coal and surface lands close to the spring creek mine and its rail spur should reduce development costs and allow future operating synergies to be realized the quality of the coal is similar to that of our spring creek mine and offers lower sodium levels to further meet the needs of our customers” said colin marshall president and chief executive officer of cloud peak energy of the approximately  million tons of inplace coal the undeveloped youngs creek mine permits cover  million recoverable tons of low sulfur high btu subbituminous coal of this permitted coal  million tons benefit from a royalty rate of  payable to consol and chevron which is below the normal  of gross proceeds payable on federal coal the  acres of land includes youngs creek

of which cloud peak energy owns  to the east “this coal has the same geographic and quality advantages over southern prb coal as the spring creek mine which have allowed us to make the majority of prb export sales in recent years we now have a large asset base and lots of options as to how we develop our northern prb operations to meet future export and domestic coal demand” said marshall future development timing and production levels are expected to depend largely on the availability of additional export terminal capacity on the west coast and continued strong asian demand for thermal coal the mine would be served exclusively by the bnsf railroad as cloud peak energy has not completed detailed mine development planning the acquired coal is not expected to be reported as reserves at
