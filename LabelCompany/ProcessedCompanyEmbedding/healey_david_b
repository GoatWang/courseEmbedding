michael hoenig david b hamm and linda m brown of counsel and hugh f young jr of the virginia bar admitted pro hac vice for product liability advisory council inc amicus curiae chief judge kaye and judges simons titone bellacosa smith and ciparick concur levine j plaintiff was severely injured when struck in the head by a part of a multipiece truck tire rim which explosively separated when the tire which had just been inflated on it was dropped by an employee of defendant allinn trucking inc the accident occurred september   presuit discovery orders were granted on behalf of plaintiff as well as a temporary order requiring allinn to preserve all of its truck tire rims on its vehicles and at its premises pursuant to the discovery orders the deposition of joseph biassi president of allinn was taken october   carl j lange plaintiffs expert examined and inventoried rims on allinn trucks and at its premises on october   and plaintiffs expert oj hahn examined the rims on all  of allinns trucks and those stored on its premises on december   hahn identified three rims all manufactured and designed by defendants firestone tire  rubber company and bridgestonefirestone inc collectively referred to as firestone as being the only rims of allinn that could have been involved in the accident this theory was based on the assertion that the rims evidenced signs of substantial chording ie being distorted and out of round which hahn opined was the cause of the explosive separation of the rim involved in plaintiffs accident according to plaintiff the three rims were marked for identification and left in the custody of allinns expert pursuant to an understanding with the trucking companys insurance carrier that they would be preserved plaintiff commenced this action against firestone and allinn in june  the causes of action against firestone were grounded in negligence and strict products liability under both manufacturing defect and design defect theories approximately a year later it was disclosed that allinn had lost the three rims identified by plaintiffs expert hahn as the possible instrumentalities for the rim involved in the accident firestone then moved for summary judgment asserting that it was undisputed that the multipiece rim which plaintiff alleged caused the accident was irretrievably lost and that therefore plaintiffs evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish the identity of the manufacturer of the offending rim or that a defect in that product caused the accident supreme court denied firestones motion concluding that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to implicate firestone as the manufacturer of the accidentcausing rim the court further concluded that a triable issue of fact was presented that the rims defective design was the cause of its explosive separation based upon plaintiffs expert hahns opinion excluding any other possible cause a majority at the appellate division agreed with supreme court that plaintiff had submitted sufficient circumstantial evidence to permit the inference that firestone made the accident rim  add  the court also held that as to the plaintiffs design defect strict products liability cause of action firestone was not prejudiced by the disappearance of the suspect rims identified by plaintiffs expert since the actual design of the product could be independently established the court however concluded that the disappearance of the rims fatally prejudiced firestones defense against plaintiffs negligence and manufacturing defect causes of action id at  and therefore modified supreme courts order by dismissing those claims leaving intact only the design defect cause of action the appellate division then granted firestone leave upon the certified question was the order of that court which modified the order of the supreme court properly made the parties agree that the certified question presents two issues  whether there was sufficient evidence to identify firestone as the manufacturer of the offending rim and  whether the plaintiffs inability to identify the actual rim involved in the accident fatally prejudiced firestone in defending plaintiffs claim that the accident was due to the design of the rim and not another cause we reverse and answer the certified question in the negative this case presents no exception to the general rule that one of the necessary elements plaintiff in a strict products liability cause of action must establish by competent proof is that it was the defendant who manufactured and placed in the stream of commerce the injurycausing defective product see hymowitz v lilly  co  nyd   cert denied  us  morrissey v conservative gas corp  app div  affd  nyd  the identity of the manufacturer of a defective product may be established by circumstantial evidence see taylor v general battery corp  add   otis v bausch  lomb  add   prata v national r r passenger

inference of probability as distinguished from mere possibility speculative or conjectural evidence of the manufacturers identity is not enough damico v manufacturers hanover trust co supra perez v new york tel co  add   sosa v joyce beverages  add   plaintiffs proof was insufficient to establish any reasonable probability that a firestone rim caused plaintiffs accident biassi who was on the allinn premises when the accident occurred testified at his presuit deposition on october   that the rim that explosively separated and injured plaintiff was a threepiece rim there was uncontested evidence that at least six companies in addition to firestone made threepiece truck tire rims these firestone rims were distributed under the brand name accuride in  however firestone ceased making rims having sold its rim manufacturing assets and rim design to an unrelated company called accuride corporation biassi also testified at his deposition that the accident rim was reassembled the day after the incident and was either installed on one of allinns trucks or placed against the wall of a shed at the trucking companys premises biassi emphatically denied present knowledge of the whereabouts of the particular rim involved in the accident he kept no records of his purchases of rims stating that rims were usually acquired in used condition from guys selling rims guys coming by or from truckers going out of business notably at his deposition biassi was not asked whether nor did he confirm that the accident rim was still in the possession of allinn when the deposition took place some five weeks after the accident indeed in a subsequent affidavit biassi averred that tires and rims on the allinn trucks were changed frequently because of severe use on equipment primarily driven to haul dirt and gravel over rough terrain and that broken and wornout rims were discarded without any inventory control thus biassis evidence raised a substantial question as to whether the actual rim that explosively separated to cause plaintiffs injuries remained in the possession of allinn during the subsequent inspections of the rims on its trucks and at its premises by plaintiffs experts the foregoing evidentiary gap was not filled by the affidavit of lange plaintiffs expert who conducted an examination and inventory of rims at allinns premises and on its trucks on october   he examined a total of  rims of which he identified  as firestonedesigned accuride ° radial commander emphasis supplied lange gave reasons for excluding the remaining four rims as suspects in causing plaintiffs accident lange however did not examine an unspecified number of inside tandem rims on the allinn trucks moreover as already noted the rims lange described as firestonedesigned accuride could well have included rims manufactured by accuride corporation after the  sale of all of firestones truck tire rimmaking operations equally unavailing to prove identity of the manufacturer was the affidavit of plaintiffs expert hahn regarding his december   examination of the rims on all  of allinns trucks and the spare rims on its premises it is true that hahn identified three specific rims as being capable of causing plaintiffs accident because of their physical condition and that he established that those rims were definitely manufactured by firestone from the markings on them hahn however described the rims he examined on six of the  allinn trucks as being of the accuride ° radial commander threepiece type in contrast to the firestonemanufactured rims he described finding on other trucks or in storage on the premises the foregoing was the only evidence relevant to the identification of firestone as the manufacturer of the actual accident rim and it was insufficient to establish any reasonable probability that firestone made the offending product of primary significance no reasonable inference could be drawn from biassis deposition and affidavit that the accidentcausing rim was retained by allinn so as to have been available for subsequent inspection and identification by plaintiffs experts the affidavit of those experts could not cure this defect in proof indeed their averments were insufficient even to establish a definite likelihood that a significant preponderance of the rims they inspected were actually manufactured by firestone consequently plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of fact on the identity of firestone as the manufacturer of the allegedly defective product in this case see franov v exxon co  add   lv dismissed  nyd  damico v manufacturers hanover trust co  add at  supra cf prata v national r r passenger corp  add  supra our disposition of this issue renders discussion of the second issue unnecessary accordingly

when struck in the head by a part of a multipiece truck tire rim which explosively separated when the tire which had just been inflated on it was dropped by an employee of defendant allinn trucking inc the accident  occurred september   presuit discovery orders were granted on behalf of plaintiff as well as a temporary order requiring allinn to preserve all of its truck tire rims on its vehicles and at its premises pursuant to the discovery orders the deposition of joseph biassi president of allinn was taken october   carl j lange plaintiffs expert examined and inventoried rims on allinn trucks and at its premises on october   and plaintiffs expert oj hahn examined the rims on all  of allinns trucks and those stored on its premises on december   hahn identified three rims all manufactured and designed by defendants firestone tire  rubber company and bridgestonefirestone inc collectively referred to as firestone as being the only rims of allinn that could have been involved in the accident this theory was based on the assertion that the rims evidenced signs of substantial chording ie being distorted and out of round which hahn opined was the cause of the explosive separation of the rim involved in plaintiffs accident according to plaintiff the three rims were marked for identification and left in the custody of allinns expert pursuant to an understanding with the trucking companys insurance carrier that they would be preserved plaintiff commenced this action against firestone and allinn in june  the causes of action against firestone were grounded in negligence and strict products liability under both manufacturing defect and design defect theories approximately a year later it was disclosed that allinn had lost the three rims identified by plaintiffs expert hahn as the possible instrumentalities for the rim involved in the accident firestone then moved for summary judgment asserting that it was undisputed that the multipiece rim which plaintiff alleged caused the accident was irretrievably lost and that therefore plaintiffs evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish the identity of the manufacturer of the offending rim or that a defect in that product caused the accident supreme court denied firestones motion concluding that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to implicate firestone as the manufacturer of the accidentcausing rim the court further concluded that a triable issue of fact was presented that the rims defective design was the cause of its explosive separation based upon plaintiffs expert hahns opinion excluding any other possible cause a majority at the appellate division agreed with supreme court that plaintiff had submitted sufficient circumstantial evidence  to permit the inference that firestone made the accident rim  add  the court also held that as to the plaintiffs design defect strict products liability cause of action firestone was not prejudiced by the disappearance of the suspect rims identified by plaintiffs expert since the actual design of the product could be independently established the court however concluded that the disappearance of the rims fatally prejudiced firestones defense against plaintiffs negligence and manufacturing defect causes of action id at  and therefore modified supreme courts order by dismissing those claims leaving intact only the design defect cause of action the appellate division then granted firestone leave upon the certified question was the order of that court which modified the order of the supreme court properly made the parties agree that the certified question presents two issues  whether there was sufficient evidence to identify firestone as the manufacturer of the offending rim and  whether the plaintiffs inability to identify the actual rim involved in the accident fatally prejudiced firestone in defending plaintiffs claim that the accident was due to the design of the rim and not another cause we reverse and answer the certified question in the negative this case presents no exception to the general rule that one of the necessary elements plaintiff in a strict products liability cause of action must establish by competent proof is that it was the defendant who manufactured and placed in the stream of commerce the injurycausing defective product see hymowitz v lilly  co  nyd   cert denied  us  morrissey v conservative gas corp  app div  affd  nyd  the identity of the manufacturer of a defective product may be established by circumstantial evidence see taylor v general battery corp  add   otis v bausch  lomb  add   prata v national r r passenger corp  add   appeal dismissed  nyd   weinberger new york products liability §  moreover circumstantial evidence may sufficiently demonstrate the makers identity notwithstanding the destruction of the allegedly defective product after use see taylor v general battery corp supra otis v bausch  lomb supra the circumstantial evidence of identity of the manufacturer of a defective product causing personal injury must establish that it is reasonably probable not merely possible or evenly balanced that the defendant was the source of the offending  product see damico v manufacturers hanover trust co  add   see also vecta contract v lynch  so d  fla ct app th dist review denied  so d  naden v celotex corp  ill app d    ned   circumstantial evidence in a products liability case must justify an inference of probability as distinguished from mere possibility speculative or conjectural evidence of the manufacturers identity is not enough damico v manufacturers hanover trust co supra perez v new york tel co  add   sosa v joyce beverages  add   plaintiffs proof was insufficient to establish any reasonable probability that a firestone rim caused plaintiffs accident biassi who was on the allinn premises when the accident occurred testified at his presuit deposition on october   that the rim that explosively separated and injured plaintiff was a threepiece rim there was uncontested evidence that at least six companies in addition to firestone made threepiece truck tire rims these firestone rims were distributed under the brand name accuride in  however firestone ceased making rims having sold its rim manufacturing assets and rim design to an unrelated company called accuride corporation biassi also testified at his deposition that the accident rim was reassembled the day after the incident and was either installed on one of allinns trucks or placed against the wall of a shed at the trucking companys premises biassi emphatically denied present knowledge of the whereabouts of the particular rim involved in the accident he kept no records of his purchases of rims stating that rims were usually acquired in used condition from guys selling rims guys coming by or from truckers going out of business notably at his deposition biassi was not asked whether nor did he confirm that the accident rim was still in the possession of allinn when the deposition took place some five weeks after the accident indeed in a subsequent affidavit biassi averred that tires and rims on the allinn trucks were changed frequently because of severe use on equipment primarily driven to haul dirt and gravel over rough terrain and that broken and wornout rims were discarded without any inventory control thus biassis evidence raised a substantial question as to whether the actual rim that explosively separated to cause plaintiffs injuries remained in the possession of allinn during the subsequent inspections of the rims on its trucks and at its premises by plaintiffs experts the foregoing evidentiary gap was not filled by the affidavit of lange plaintiffs expert who conducted an examination and inventory of rims at allinns premises and on its trucks on october   he examined a total of  rims of which he identified  as firestonedesigned accuride ° radial commander emphasis supplied lange gave reasons for excluding the remaining four rims as suspects in causing plaintiffs accident lange however did not examine an unspecified number of inside tandem rims on the allinn trucks moreover as already noted the rims lange described as firestonedesigned accuride could well have included rims manufactured by accuride corporation after the  sale of all of firestones truck tire rimmaking operations equally unavailing to prove identity of the manufacturer was the affidavit of plaintiffs expert hahn regarding his december   examination of the rims on all  of allinns

radial commander threepiece type in contrast to the firestonemanufactured rims he described finding on other trucks or in storage on the premises the foregoing was the only evidence relevant to the identification of firestone as the manufacturer of the actual accident rim and it was insufficient to establish any reasonable probability that firestone made the offending product of primary significance no reasonable inference could be drawn from biassis deposition and affidavit that the accidentcausing rim was retained by allinn so as to have been available for subsequent inspection and identification by plaintiffs experts the affidavit of those experts could not cure this defect in proof indeed their averments were insufficient even to establish a definite likelihood that a significant preponderance of the rims they inspected were actually manufactured by firestone consequently plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of fact on the identity of firestone as the manufacturer of the allegedly defective product in this case see franov v exxon co  add   lv dismissed  nyd  damico v manufacturers hanover trust co  add at  supra cf prata v national r r passenger
