technology flexformadc flexible hybrid systemthe substrate for the flexible hybrid system is a twolayer flexible circuit board fcb this is a  micron  mil thick pet substrate with layers of electronic interconnect created using screen printing techniques we have also provided means to integrate printed sensors on the flexible circuit board we have  sensor areas available for printing two of which are connected to op amps for signal amplification the flexible circuit board also provides  programmable gpios available that can be integrated with your sensors flexformadc pcbto control and communicate with the flexadc we have our rigid printed circuit board the brain of this board is an atmegap which you might recognize as the chip used on the arduino uno this chip was chosen so that

linear encoders when you need only the highest positioning accuracy only linear encoders from heidenhain can get the job done our advanced design improves productivity by eliminating machine tool position errors caused by thermal expansion deformation of the drive mechanics pitch issues and more in addition to increased accuracy high longterm speed stability and thermal behavior control heidenhainclosecurlyquotes linear encoders are also characterized by their sturdy construction and high resistance to vibration why heidenhain wide range of position measuring devices—including sealed and exposed linear encoders scales and length gages in absolute and incremental versions finer signal periods offer highest interpolation accuracy compact lightweight and easy to install functions properly even after many years of operation heidenhain sealed linear encoders an aluminum housing and downwardoriented elastic lips protect the scale scanning carriage and its guideway from chips dust and fluids—ideal for machine tool applications the scanning carriage travels along the scale on a lowfriction guide encoders connect to the external mounting block via a coupling that compensates for any misalignment between the scale and the machine guideway heidenhain exposed linear encoders no mechanical contact between the scanning head and the scale or scale tape ideal applications include measuring machines comparators and other precision linear metrology devices and production and measuring equipment semiconductor applications for example learn more discover a higher level of
