mccains loss huntsman observed were fundamentally staring down a demographic shift that weve never seen before in america on november   politico called him a possible  contender washington post blogger chris cillizza also speculated huntsman as a possible candidate many republicans were touting huntsman as a possible rising star in the party and that he has a role in reshaping the party utah businessman republican activist tim bridgewater said huntsman has a very bright future huntsman said that i think there will be a lot of personalities emerging between now and  i think the party needs to be smart enough to maintain an open mind obama was nowhere on the radar screen four years ago in june  huntsman top advisor john weaver who was also an advisor for mccain claimed i firmly believe that huntsman and people like him are the prescription for what ails us but i have the feeling that our party maybe wont order that prescription in  in august  a group of political strategists close to huntsman formed a political action committee now called horizon pac that could provide a framework for launching huntsmans campaign this pac was formed in part to draft huntsman into running for president on february   horizon pac launched its official website which made no direct reference to huntsman but stated that the pacs mission is to help elect a new generation of conservative candidates for local and state offices all across america the pacs website also states that it supports freemarket values principled leadership and a commitment to longterm solutions a january   a newsweek article entitled the manchurian candidate featured an interview with huntsman in which he stated you know im really focused on what were doing in our current position  but we wont do this forever and i think we may have one final run left in our bones asked specifically whether he intended to run for president in  he declined to comment the article generated significant speculation about a likely huntsman  presidential bid campaignedit on january   huntsman submitted his formal resignation from his post as us ambassador to china effective april   indicating his plans to return to the united states at that time both top democrats and close associates of huntsman indicated that he was likely to explore a  republican presidential bid on may   he formed an official fundraising

with harold evans he said he would announce his campaign for president on june  huntsman formally entered the race for the republican presidential nomination on june   announcing his bid in a speech at liberty state park in new jersey with the statue of liberty in the background—the same site where ronald reagan launched his campaign in  after focusing his energy and resources on the new hampshire primary in which he finished third huntsman announced the end of his campaign on january   endorsing mitt romney postcampaign politicsedit a month after dropping out of the race huntsman offered the opinion that there was a need for a third party in america in an appearance on the msnbc talk show morning joe on february   huntsman said that a third party would be a healthy development in the presidential election process i think we’re going to have problems politically until we get some sort of third party movement or some voice out there that can put forth new ideas someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this the real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision a bold thinking we might not win but we can certainly influence the debate huntsman said he was not throwing his own hat in the ring as a third party presidential candidate in  the republican national committee reacted by withdrawing an invitation for huntsman to appear as a speaker at a republican fundraiser in palm beach florida in early march in early july huntsman announced that he would not be attending the  republican national convention for the first time since he attended as a reagan delegate in  huntsman issued a statement chiding the republican party for what he perceived as its failures to focus on the daunting socioeconomic issues facing america i will not be attending this years convention nor any republican convention in the future until the party focuses on a bigger bolder more confident future for the united states — a future based on problem solving inclusiveness and a willingness to address the trust deficit which is every bit as corrosive as our fiscal and economic deficits in early november  just days before barack obama was reelected as president the associated press named huntsman as a possible successor to hillary clinton as the united states secretary of state this speculation was echoed by various media outlets particularly after huntsman came to the defense of united states ambassador to the united nations susan rice describing the criticism of her response to the  benghazi attack as being overblown on november   obamas campaign manager jim messina suggested that the obama campaign believed huntsman would have been a particularly difficult candidate to face in the general election messina said that the campaign was honest about our concerns about huntsman and that huntsman would have been a very tough candidate in january  huntsman was named chairman of the atlanticist thinktank the atlantic council huntsman indicated in an interview with politico that he would not run in the  presidential election in april  huntsman decided to endorse republican nominee donald trump but later retracted his endorsement of trump following the donald trump access hollywood controversy  in november  huntsman said he’s weighing a run for the us senate in  depending in part on whether fellow republican orrin hatch decides to seek an eighth term possible trump administration positionedit on december   the associated press reported huntsman was under consideration by donald trump and the trump transition team as a possible choice for secretary of state in  rex tillerson was chosen ten days later huntsman defended trump in interviews with fox news and the new york times after trump received criticism for accepting a congratulatory phone call with the president of taiwan tsai ingwen during his transition process huntsman said the critics were overreacting to trumps decision to accept the phone call and that trumps nontraditional style might be an opportunity for a shift in asia relations in future talks with china it was reported on march   that huntsman accepted a position as united states ambassador to russia political viewsedit huntsman has been described by the huffington post as a conservative technocratoptimist with moderate positions who was willing to work substantively with president barack obama and identifies himself as a centerright conservative as governor huntsman listed economic development healthcare reform education and energy security as his top priorities he oversaw tax cuts and advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so that the government would not become overwhelmed by the states fast growing population he also proposed a plan to reform healthcare mainly through the private sector by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down in  when asked about a healthcare mandate huntsman said im comfortable with a requirement – you can call it whatever you want but at some point were going to have to get serious about how we deal with this issue according to haley barbour former governor of mississippi jon huntsman and i served together and while we dont agree on some issues theres no question that hes a conservative hes way to the right of barack obama for goodness sake but yeah i consider jon a conservative as i said we have some issues that i think are important that we have different views on but he was in the reagan administration elected governor of a very

salt lake city — jon m huntsman jr was  years old when his father packed up their growing family to move east in  leaving behind his fledgling company to work for president richard m nixona driven businessman with deep roots in the mormon church the elder huntsman found little to like about his experience in the nixon white house it was poorly run in his view — not at all like a business — and he felt terrorized by h r haldeman the mercurial chief of staff“you asked me what i took out” he told an interviewer years later “i didn’t take anything but fear out”yet mr huntsman did leave washington with something that proved valuable when he resettled his family here a thick rolodex and a deep understanding of politics in the years that followed as he became a billionaire industrialist a philanthropist a campaign donor and one of utah’s most powerful men his connections and wealth proved critical in carving a path into politics for his namesake and eldest son advertisement continue reading the main story today the younger huntsman is a republican candidate for president at the back of a crowded pack he is best known as a former utah governor conversant in mandarin and politically moderate who crossed party lines to become president obama’s ambassador to china on the campaign trail he has cultivated a reputation as “the civility candidate” continue

his burdenthe fatherson bond preoccupies political circles here some say mr huntsman who has alternated between the family business and public service — including a stint as ambassador to singapore at age  — has been groomed for politics some see him as struggling to emerge from his father’s shadow or wonder if in pursuing the presidency he is chasing his father’s dreammr huntsman  says he is pursuing nobody’s dream but his own he spent last week in new hampshire trying to revive a campaign facing singledigit poll numbers and internal strife walking the streets of manchester asking residents “humbly for your vote” he cut a slight gentle figure displaying none of the swagger that a life of privilege can sometimes bring“he’s my best friend he’s a father he’s been a mentor” mr

huntsman corporation recommended mr huntsman for jobs in utah the father quietly pressed state leaders to install the son as the head of the  salt lake city olympics — a job that ultimately went to

university of utah political scientist who has observed the huntsman clan for  years “and the father for many many years has been cultivating helping expediting opening doors that his very competent and able son can walk through” advertisement continue reading the main story the elder huntsman declined to be interviewed for this article“i certainly plead guilty to loving and supporting and encouraging jon jr” he told the salt lake tribune last month but noting his son’s “remarkable appointments” and landslide reelection in  he added “when people say i’ve orchestrated some of these things it’s a complete impossibility to have great achievements like that from a father” utah royaltyamerican politics has long been rife with dynasties — the names adams roosevelt kennedy and bush leap to mind but in utah where politics and business are deeply entwined with the mormon faith there is no dynasty quite like the huntsmans“if we picked a royal family in utah” said ted wilson a democratic former salt lake city mayor “it would be the huntsmans”mr huntsman’s mother karen — just as ambitious for her children as is her husband many here say — was the daughter of one of  mormon

elder huntsman seeking specific jobs for his son “he doesn’t take no for an answer” said the former official speaking anonymously to avoid drawing the anger of the familymr garn the former senator said he spoke to reagan about mr huntsman after the young man sought his help fred malek a nixon administration colleague of the father’s recommended the son as ambassador to singapore“our families have been very close” mr malek said adding that he saw mr huntsman as “a bright kind of earnest young man cut out of the father’s cloth”mr huntsman acknowledges that his father’s “vast network” has helped open doors but what matters he says is how he fared when he walked through them“you either rise to the ability to perform” he said “or you don’t”in substance and style there are differences between the two men the father forceful and conservative is close with the commentator glenn beck yet is a sometime donor to democrats the son softspoken is often at odds with his party in  they split on presidential politics the father backed mr romney the son senator john mccain photo the huntsman family with president richard m nixon whom jon m huntsman sr served as staff secretary he left with an unflattering view of the nixon white house but also a wealth of political contacts jon jr is at far left credit huntsman campaign still mr huntsman has faced questions about whether he is his own man — so much so that when he first ran for governor his campaign aides joked about making silver spoon lapel pins advertisement continue reading the main story “i don’t think there’s much question that he would not have been ambassador to singapore without his father’s strong support and his father had a very good rolodex in those days” said robert f bennett a republican former senator from utah and romney supporter “but all reports are he did a very good job”others are less charitable “look at where he’s been look what he’s done” said bob springmeyer a salt lake businessman and democrat who lost to mr huntsman in  “if you had dropped out of high school could you have gotten into penn do you think you’d be named trade ambassador without major campaign contributions” keeping a strategic distancein the late s the salt lake organizing committee which oversaw the  winter olympics became engulfed in scandal and needed a new chiefaccording to several people familiar with the selection process mr huntsman’s father reached out to committee and state officials to lobby for his son “he was pretty bent out of shape” when mr romney was picked recalled mr wilson the former salt lake city mayormr huntsman said that he was “not aware of any reaching out” by his father and that he did not seek the job because mr romney’s selection seemed a foregone conclusion today mr romney’s success in revamping the troubled games is one reason he is outpolling mr huntsman here two to onewhen mr huntsman sought the governorship in  — his first bid for elective office — aides insisted he would not buy his way into the job huntsman corporation employees its political action committee and family members gave  of the  million mr huntsman raised that year making the company his top contributor according to records compiled by the sunlight foundation an open government groupthe elder huntsman was a frequent presence on the campaign trail — mr bennett called him the “head cheerleader” — but steered clear of strategy sessions jeff hartley then a huntsman campaign adviser said it was a wise decision “to let jon be his own man” advertisement continue reading the main story after mr huntsman won his father was “circumspect about being seen at the capitol” said mr chambless the political scientist though many here viewed him as a behindthescenes adviser — a role he appears to be reprising in late june mr huntsman sr hosted his son’s top donors at his home in the utah resort town of deer valley david fischer a close huntsman family friend who has just quit the campaign told politico last week that the elder huntsman expressed concern about internal feuding and disarray“but there’s a limit to what the father can do” mr fischer was quoted as sayingonly a week

some voice out there that can put forth new ideas someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this the real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision a bold thinking we might not win but we can certainly influence the debate huntsman said he was not throwing his own hat in the ring as a third party presidential candidate in  the
