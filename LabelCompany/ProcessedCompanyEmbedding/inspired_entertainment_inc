a reported basis virtual sports revenue decreased by  million due to an adverse currency impact of  million net operating loss increased from  million to  million due primarily to the decline in reported revenue and transaction costs of  million related to the transaction between hydra industries acquisition corp our predecessor entity and dmwsl  limited group at which time we were renamed

or  offset by adverse currency translations of  million on a reporting basis total sbg revenue declined from  million to  million sbg service revenue increased by  million on a constant currency basis offset by an adverse currency translation of  million resulting in a decline from  million to  million the underlying performance increase is attributable to gross win per unit per day incomes on the

live customers      total revenue £ £ £ £  nongaap financial metrics the company uses certain nongaap financial measures such as ebitda and adjusted ebitda to enable us to analyze its performance and financial condition we utilize these financial measures to manage our business on a daytoday basis and believe that they are the most relevant measures of performance we believe that these measures are commonly used in the industry to measure performance we believe these nongaap measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance in addition to the standard gaapbased financial measures there are no specific rules or regulations for determining nongaap measures and as such they may not be comparable to measures used by other companies within the industry the presentation of nongaap financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap you should read this discussion and analysis of the companys financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes thereto also included within ebitda is defined as net loss excluding depreciation and amortization interest expense interest income and income tax expense adjusted ebitda is defined as net loss excluding depreciation and amortization interest expense interest income and income tax expense and other supplemental adjustments the company believes adjusted ebitda when considered along with other performance measures is a useful measure as it reflects certain operating drivers of the business such as sales growth operating costs selling and administrative expense and other operating income and expense the company believes adjusted ebitda can provide a more complete understanding of the underlying operating results and trends and an enhanced overall understanding of the companys financial performance and prospects for the future while adjusted ebitda is not a recognized measure under gaap management uses this financial measure to evaluate and forecast business performance adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income or loss as it does not take into account certain requirements such as it excludes nonrecurring gains and losses which are not deemed to be a normal part of the underlying business activities the companys use of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other companies within the industry management compensates for these limitations by using adjusted ebitda as only one of several measures for evaluating its business performance in addition capital expenditures which impact depreciation and amortization interest expense and income tax benefit expense are reviewed separately by management adjusted revenue also revenue excluding nil margin hardware sales is defined as gaap revenue adjusting for hardware sales that are sold at nil margin with the intention of securing longer term recurring revenue streams for the years ending september   and earlier this metric also removed analogue sales on the basis these were no longer considered core to the company constant currency results are a nongaap measure the currency impact shown has been calculated as current period gbpusd rate used less the equivalent rate in the prior period multiplied by the current period amount in the functional currency gbp the remaining difference is therefore calculated as the difference in the functional currency multiplied by the prior period average gbpusd rate as a proxy for constant currency movement conference call and webcast february   at  am est   pm gmt management
