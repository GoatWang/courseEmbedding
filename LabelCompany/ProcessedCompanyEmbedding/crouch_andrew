me my energy motivation inspiration passion hope and spirit i am a singersongwriter who travels the country spreading hope and a positive message to my audiences but i lost all hope in myself when i got out of bed one day looked in the mirror and barely recognized the reflection – i was about  pounds heavier than i had ever been about a year before that day i went to the dr because i was experiencing some serious back pain the diagnosis wasn’t good when he said it was a herniated disk that was also pinching my sciatic nerve that runs down my leg he suggested immediate surgery…i was going to be off my feet for a while against the advise of everyone i wanted time to look into other options and i put off surgery in the meantime even the simplest daytoday tasks were impossible standing up sitting down sleeping driving walking bending over…and exercise well that was definitely out of the question of course i started getting heavier and heavier because inside i was changing with an upcoming wedding i certainly couldn’t have a goal of being in the best shape of my life – i just wanted to be able to walk down the aisle over the course of just over a year i had become clinically obese with  body fat and a ” waist i couldn’t fit into any of my jeans for shows and i refused to go to size  pants the extra weight caused even more problems for my back and i seemed stuck in an eternal circle…more weight caused more pain more pain caused less exercise less exercise cause more weight i became less and less motivated and inspired i couldn’t ven write songs anymore all i had left was a low selfesteem no confidence minimal shows and a guy i didn’t like looking at in the mirror…that doesn’t make for a good performance then…i was challenged to do bodyforlife® by my new fatherinlaw so i faced the challenge head on as more and more people saw me transforming outside they also noticed the transformation taking place inside and could not help but ask me about it strangers and friends alike swarmed as the weight fell off wanting to know what changed me my body and my life so drastically it’s hard to help others when you are so focused on yourself bodyforlife® actually made me able to focus on others again and my career i am a walking billboard for bodyforlife® – on and off the stage inspiring so many to do what i did incredibly my back is healed it is amazing how a healthy diet and the right exercises plus losing  pounds can change your entire life i can run again i can play sports again i can perform again i can hold my head high again i have no pain inside or out since bfl i am now walking countless others through the bfl steps the change in myself is astonishing through bfl i not only transformed my life but i am able to help others transform theirs too bfl is just that  for life it has given me the tools i need to live a healthy lifestyle i have a new assurance in my talents and myself bodyforlife® showed me when i put my mind to anything and focus i can accomplish it – whatever it is i didn’t know that was in me before this i have a barbarian approach to life now since bfl i can see my dreams and insistently pursue them

a range of civil and criminal appeals in both state and federal courts he both writes briefs and appears at oral argument and hearings on behalf of his clients attorney crouch has been an adjunct professor of law at new england school of law where he taught appellate advocacy skills to secondyear law students he has also served as a law clerk to the justices of the massachusetts superior court and to the honorable mark green of the massachusetts appeals court his background as a former clerk for the massachusetts appeals court provides him with unique insight into the appellate process and assists in the crafting of persuasive arguments attorney crouch has handled appellate matters ranging from misdemeanor state offenses to federal carjacking and murder convictions as well as civil and administrative appellate matters he has appeared in dozens of cases before the massachusetts supreme judicial court the appeals court and the united states court of appeals for the first circuit criminal appellate process a case does not end with the return of a jury or jury waived verdict following a conviction a defendant has the right to challenge the verdict either through a postconviction motion or a direct appeal to start an appeal your attorney first files a notice of appeal it is important that such notice be given within the relevant often short time limits set by law or your appellate rights may be lost if you are contemplating an appeal it is important to consult an attorney as soon as possible to ensure that you do not miss the deadline criminal appeals overview a defendant seeking to challenge a conviction can seek a number of avenues of relief the most common area is called a direct appeal where a case is brought before an appellate court in massachusetts there are two state appellate courts the appeals court and the supreme judicial court sometimes referred to as the sjc all cases are sent first to the appeals court except certain cases such as firstdegree murder convictions which proceed directly to the supreme judicial court for review cases raising new or unusual legal issues may also be transferred for an initial hearing in the supreme judicial court at the request of the parties or by the supreme judicial court’s own order once the appeals court issues a decision a party that disagrees with the result can petition the sjc to review the decision while the supreme judicial court ordinarily denies such requests attorney crouch has successfully petitioned for further appellate review or rehearing in several cases grounds on appeal may include whether there was sufficient evidence to sustain the convictions challenges to incorrect jury instructions the improper admission or exclusion of evidence an improper closing argument by the commonwealth’s attorney or incorrect legal rulings on pretrial motions including motions to suppress dismiss or in limine a defendant may also seek one of several other avenues for relief a motion for a new trial can be brought in certain circumstances to challenge a jury’s verdict the admission or exclusion of certain evidence at trial to highlight the discovery of new evidence or to raise specific legal errors in the case of a guilty plea a motion to withdraw the plea can be made if it was not voluntarily made was the product of duress or based upon the ineffective assistance of your former attorney a defendant can also file a motion to challenge his sentence in a variety of ways including motions to revise and revoke the sentence or to protest an illegal sentence appellate process for direct appeals in the case of a direct appeal the case progresses through one of the state’s appellate courts when the case is docketed or accepted by the court the next crucial stage of the appeal is the writing of the appellate brief this document contains a discussion of the facts involved in the case an analysis of the legal issues raised and an argument in support of the position taken by the party who submits the brief the appellant files the first brief the party opposing the appeal the “appellee” files a responding brief and then the appellant if necessary can file a short reply once all of the briefs have been filed the appellate court may schedule a court date to hear oral argument as to why the court should rule in that party’s favor if you are not successful at the state appellate level there may be additional avenues of relief that may be pursued on your behalf if a defendant loses his appeal before the appeals court he may petition the supreme judicial court in an application for further appellate review this application details why the appeals court’s decision was in error if three of the seven sitting supreme judicial court justices agree to hear the case the case may be heard by the court if fewer than three justices vote to hear the case the application will be denied if you need a boston criminal appeals lawyer please
