write a review events talk log in     liberty plznew york ny    one of my children became unable to travel due to cdc guidelines i file a claim still have not heard what documentation is missing i continue to fax it since can not upload it when i call no one knows what happened to my documents keep faxing it  my trip will be next week then they will tell me i am late use a different company i bought a travel policy for my parents cruise trip they were going to take in decjan unfortunately my dad had health conditions that his doctors prohibited him from going on the cruise upon submitting all the documentation that allianz required we were denied our claim they said the health problems your father incurred arent covered in the insurance this company is a total scam this is the first and the last time i will ever use them ive been using geo blue for years and never had any issues someone told me to try allianz and i learned my lesson  down the drain because of allianz policy  eusp dont bother their system is unreliable i decided to purchase tickets to depart the same day my flight was cancelled when i called allianz to put in a claim my information did not show up in their system according to them i never purchase the insurance however the customer must click on decline if they do not want the service which was something i didnt do apparently they are not able to track this system failure how convenient an absolute scam i had to cancel a trip to los angeles for jobrelated reasons i submitted the claim and supporting paperwork as requested they rejected the claim when i clicked on the link to learn why they rejected it the page didnt load so i dont know im stuck with a flight im not going on out of  their online system is shoddy and often doesnt work they didnt communicate with me that they rejected my claim terrible waste of money and shameful that delta partners with them its corporate greed and legalese at its worst whats the point of travel insurance when they reject your claim anyways terrible service very deceptive i bought a trip protection policy on an airlines site which claimed i would be reimbursed for damaged luggage the actual policy was never emailed to me however my credit card was charged while on vacation i got into a bad car accident and tried to claim insurance according to my policy and only then they finally emailed me my policy claiming the luggage had to have been damaged by the airline which does not even make sense since airlines reimburse you if they damage your luggage and there are laws that protect you in that case oh well i explained my situation and asked them for a refund of my initial expense since i never got the policy but no luck they claim that i should have gotten it they cannot produce any proof that they ever sent it ie sent email but they claim that it it is impossible that i did not get it well guess what allianz anything is possible and i did not receive your policy a few of my friends i spoke with also indicated that very often they forget to email documents and they had to call to request them thats a bad and unethical business practice never again dont waste your money i purchased this insurance for my husband me and my daughter yes  separate policies to only be informed when i needed to use it that i would need to pay for the changes necessary and submit the charges once paid against the policy and hope i get reimbursed this is exactly what the customer service rep told me pay for it and hope we reimburse you you are better off saving your money and praying there are no emergencies and if god forbid there is an emergency u have a better chance working directly with the airline please dont make the same mistake i made save your money i wound up taking a day without pay from work because it was cheaper than spending  and hoping to get reimbursed super disappointed scam scam scam do not waste your money with this company as you will never see a claim paid it is a red tape nightmare combined with delays excuses and lack of communication purchased tickets for broadway show could not attend due to work related issue from snowstorm the night before followed their directions to the t even duplicated the sample letter they provided which needed to be submitted with claim thatd was early february just received letter stating they cannot honor business obligations called them and spoke with some alien from another country to dispute and could not get a straight a answer next letter is going to the bbb stay away from this company and anything they offer beware you cannot reach a claims person to check on status of existing claim you must prove via the pcp and specialist the condition for illness was not preexisting the physician filling out the form for reimbursement is not adequate enough to ensure reimbursement the violate hippa compliance by requesting personal medical information for claims i purchased concert tickets at madison square garden as a gift for my family during the holiday seaon the receipient had to undergo an outpatient surgical procedure  days before the event and therefore could not go to the concert i am still trying to resolve this claim to prove the diagnosis date of operation and ensure it was not due to a preexisting condition do not use them bought trip protection and they failed to honor the terms of the agreement never got a cent back not even a refund on policy very unethical stay away this place is the worst i purchased concert tickets for a show in february and purchased event insurance from them in case of an emergency and i couldnt go to the show as it turns out i got the flu the week before which turned into bronchitis i was out of work for  weeks i submitted drs notes from both drs i saw on  different days plus my discharge papers from the er thier website says it takes  days to process claims and get you an answer about your refund i sent my paperwork in at the end of february by mid march no answers they claimed to be backed up because of all of the claims from the snow storms ok fine by the rd week of march they were just looking at my claim and then wanted me to get a physicians statement filled out and sent to them seriously i just gave you  drs notes and paperwork from the er now you want me to pay  to have my dr fill out paperwork no way they calim they need to know if i had bronchitis prior to purchasing my tickets what the physicans statement ask my dr if i was advised not to travel it was a freaking concert why would i discuss my plans to go to a concert with my dr common sense if i am sick and missing work for  weeks i shouldnt be going to a concert i submitted yet another form from my dr on  i called  they havent even looked at the new information because they needed the physicians statement and put it back in que for another  days so now they wont look at it until next friday april th so the stuff i sent last friday now sits for  weeks wtf so if im lucky i will get my money back by the end of april allianz insurance company unclaimed this business has not yet been claimed by the owner or a representative claim this
