body cells andor other living things nutrition is at its best when our food is fresh or kept preserved a vacuum and seal is a natural way of preserving organismsfood i date published  rated  out of  by lzorro from supposed to suck but doesnt our old unit worked pretty well and saved us  and less food being thrown away bought this new fm  in  unit and it worked the first day we had it a month later we were using it again and it did everything but vac we tried to use new bags and preformed bags but it wouldnt even come close to vac out all the air i was lucky and returned the new unit for a full refund but even better i had kept my old one and it works fine date published  rated  out of  by prjones from ease of use date published  rated  out of  by grevb from good product vacuum sealing not easy tpo use does not seal if there is any moisture date published  rated  out of  by mega deer hunters from ugh i bought this almost  yrs ago thinking it would speed up our deer meat processing  other bulk food purchase processing wrong it takes two  hands to get the vaccumsealer to work which as some know doesnt work cuz sometimes takes  hand to lict up enough to level out enough to seal really sorry i spent the money to replace my older food saver for a newer upgrader version what a mistake if you dont want to repackage bulck foods go for it but make sure you have  hands to work it  it takes  hands to work the vaccum seal   hands to keep it even to get it to stay level i wouldnt recommend this series to anyone the attached vacuum sealer doesnt work that great either had the separate vacuum bag sealer  really it gave up after about  months of use date published  rated  out of  by judy from the best one yet i have used the foodsaver products for years this is the best one
