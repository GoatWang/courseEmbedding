 and counting  after being diagnosed with a disease similar to als lou gehrigs disease since that diagnosis in december  simmons first national corp  the parent company of simmons first national bank of pine bluff and seven other smaller bank charters in arkansas  has grown by more than  percent the bank has remained profitable despite sluggish loan demand during and after the great recession and the federal takeover of the student loan business in which simmons had been particularly active simmons has even participated  although to a lesser degree than home bancshares inc of conway and bank of the ozarks of little rock  in the expansion opportunities created by bank failures outside the state in  simmons acquired southwest community bank of springfield mo and security savings bank fsb of olathe kan in deals brokered by the federal deposit insurance corp may recently told arkansas business that simmons sitting on what he described as a large level of excess capital was continuing to look selectively for failing banks to acquire our focus and strategy in doing an fdic deal is not just buying a bad bank at a deep discount he said but it is buying a failed bank at the right price in a good market   may became ceo of simmons in  and during the next decade he executed  traditional acquisitions to expand the companys footprint throughout arkansas while remaining fiercely loyal to pine bluff a stagnant banking market that has nonetheless been very good to our company unlike most bank holding companies especially those with the extra reporting requirements of a publicly traded corporation simmons has continued to operate multiple charters answering to both state and federal regulators while this model is more expensive and a bit more complex may told arkansas business we think the benefit that comes in making traditional acquisitions  recruiting and retaining excellent community bankers and differentiating ourselves from the larger banks  more than offsets the negatives associated with multiple charters we have no plans to eliminate the multiple charters as long as that model is working for our shareholders and we believe our performance has proven the model to be successful growth by conventional acquisition came to a screeching halt after  first because of what may delicately called seller price expectations being too high and then because of the recession we believe traditional acquisitions will be part of our strategy going forward but we expect most of that activity is still in the out years of  and beyond he said and that means it will likely be under the leadership of a new as yet unnamed ceo in january  may told arkansas business that he hoped to work four more years  until his th birthday which will be in december   and he has stuck to that schedule my progression has been slow and thanks to god and my doctors at uams i have been able to continue to work hard and maybe it has forced me to work a little smarter may said ive not always been accused of being real smart in other words it has caused me to do a better job of delegating some duties which a good banker should have done regardless of health consideration he

event sharpening your skills what do you think working paper summaries  dec  oped when your product becomes a commodity    like death and taxes commoditization of your products is a given marketing professor john quelch offers tips for delaying the inevitable and dealing with it once it arrives key concepts include the speed from product launch to maturity is faster than ever before innovate bundle and segment are  things marketers can do to delay commoditization managers already in a commoditized market must rethink salesforce compensation and pricing trim costs acquire competitors and fire unprofitable customers     by john quelch editors note harvard business school professor john quelch writes a blog on marketing issues called marketing know how for harvard business online it is reprinted on hbs working knowledge how often have you heard a manager blame commoditization for failing to deliver sales or profits if youve heard it youve probably wondered if it was just a convenient excuse or if the manager had a valid point the truth is even when a raw material has no value added and quality standards are set by law or the industry there is still plenty of opportunity for differentiation around availability delivery shipment quantities payment terms and all the other services that accompany the core product marketers must use their imagination as the saying goes there are no mature products only mature managers that said intense global competition outsourcing and offshoring are all squeezing margins increasing customer price sensitivity and making it harder to sustain interbrand differentiation the product life cycle suggests that as product categories mature they become more susceptible to the forces of commoditization the difference today is that the speed from launch to maturity is faster than ever before marketers can do three things to delay the inevitable forces of commoditization innovate a new product that better meets consumer needs even an upgrade of an existing product can oneup competitors and force them to invest in matching or exceeding the new specifications bundle selling a commoditized product with differentiated ancillary services such as aftersales service can appeal to buyers willing to pay a premium for the convenience segment mature markets are large markets that can be divided profitably into multiple segments marketers can focus on providing applications expertise for less pricesensitive customer segments for whom the product is still important however you approach commoditization try to innovate at all costs the most overlooked investment a marketer can make in advance of inevitable commoditization is a customer relationship management system that permits computation of the profit margin associated with each customer based on pricepaid less costtoserve companies need to invest in these information systems early to have the information readily at hand once margins start being squeezed but how do you survive if you find yourself in a commoditizing industry characterized by metoo products overcapacity and frequent price cuts how can you make money  decide which customers you do not want to serve try renegotiating prices with them and failing that fire them you will lose market share but improve profitability  compensate your salesforce on profit margin not sales revenues a volumebased salesforce will sign up any customer regardless of profitability thats ok early in the product life cycle but not in maturity  trim costs and acquire competitors with profitable customers to extract maximum scale economies in procurement manufacturing and distribution  if you arent the low cost producer complicate your pricing structures so customers cant easily make sidebyside comparisons and provide discounts as needed of artificially inflated published prices facing commoditization and nonexistent product innovation some companies retreat to serving a progressively smaller niche of priceinsensitive serviceoriented customers others with favorable cost structures may aim to boost market share but then face the challenge of managing hybrid distribution as some customers want to switch to buying through distributors at lower prices while other customers still seek direct sales support but may not be willing to pay to cover the cost however you approach commoditization try to innovate at all costs to beat it back because as peter drucker said in a commodity market you can only be as good as your dumbest competitor join the discussion on harvard business online about the

references  further reading  external links early lifeedit thomas watson jr was born on january   just before his father was dismissed from his job at ncr then two sisters were born jane and helen before the youngest child arthur kittredge watson was born he was raised in the short hills section of millburn new jersey both sons were immersed in ibm from a very early age he was taken on plant inspections — his first memory of such a visit to the dayton ohio factory was at the age of five — business tours to europe and he made appearances at ibm hundred per cent club meetings annual gatherings for the companys elite sales representatives even before he was old enough to attend school at home his fathers discipline was erratic and often harsh around the time he was thirteen tom jr suffered for six years with what might now be called clinical depression talking to a reporter in  watson jr described his relationship with his father my father and i had terrible fights  he seemed like a blanket that covered everything i really wanted to beat him but also make him proud of me but this relationship was not all negative i really enjoyed the ten years working with him in his book he says i was so intimately entwined with my father i had a compelling desire maybe out of honor for the old gentleman maybe out of sheer cussedness to prove to the world that i could excel in the same way that he didix watson jr attended the hun school of princeton in princeton new jersey he claimed in his autobiography that as a child he had a strange defect in his vision that made written words appear to fall off the page when he tried to read them as a result watson struggled in school and he acknowledged that brown university reluctantly admitted him as a favor to his father he obtained a business degree in  he married olive cawley – in  they had six children after graduating watson became a salesman for ibm but had little interest in the job the turning point was his service as a pilot in the army air force during world war ii brother dick arthur watson had dropped out of yale as a major in ordnance tom jr became a lieutenant colonel flying military commanders tom jr later admitted to journalists that the one career he would have liked to follow was an airline pilot piloting came easily to him and for the first time he had confidence in his abilities toward the end of his service watson worked for major general follett bradley who suggested that he should try to follow his father at ibm watson regularly flew bradley the director of lendlease programs to the soviet union to moscow during the war on these trips he learned russian which would later serve him well as the american ambassador to the soviet union watson returned to ibm at the beginning of  he was promoted to be a vice president just six months later and was promoted to the board just four months after that he became executive vicepresident in  ibm presidentedit watson became president of ibm in  and was named as the companys ceo shortly before his fathers death in  up to this time ibm was dedicated to electromechanical punched card systems for its commercial products watson sr had repeatedly rejected electronic computers as overpriced and unreliable except for oneofakind projects such as the ibm ssec tom jr took the company in a new direction hiring electrical engineers by the hundreds and putting them to work designing mainframe computers many of ibms technical experts also did not think computer products were practical since there were only about a dozen computers in the entire world at the time even the supporters of the new technology underestimated the potential cuthbert hurd brought in from the atomic energy commissions oak ridge national laboratory to determine if there was a market predicted  he could find customers for as many as thirty machines even so until the late s the custombuilt us air force sage computerized tracking system accounted for more than half of ibms computer sales the company made little profit on these sales but as tom jr said it enabled us to build highly automated factories ahead of anybody else and to train thousands of new workers in electronicscitation needed tom jrs decision was justified in the longer term it redirected ibm to its later position dominating the computer market even in the short term it paid off for revenues more than tripled in six years from  million in  to  million in  this dramatic rate of growth almost matched the wartime years a better than  compound growth rate that tom jr maintained for much of the twenty years of his leadership of ibm it was a record even better than that of his father despite the presence of his son thomas sr kept a firm grip on the reins until  tom jr described the position of his father as he wanted to make me head of ibm but he didnt like sharing the limelight tom jr took over effective control in a dramatic moment though the formal handover took place a few months later the occasion was signing the consent decree which was offered by the government after its latest antitrust investigation tom jr saw that the consent decree which sought to strip ibm of half its cardmaking capacity was largely irrelevant since the future was in computers not cards there was another condition ibm had to sell machines outright as well as lease them this had repercussions in the late s when leasing companies recognized the financing loophole that it created behind this decision was another spending more on research and development ibm was only spending  on research and development when other high technology companies were spending between  and  tom jr learned the lesson and thereafter — at least until the s when even then gerstner only dropped it to  — ibm consistently spent  by comparison the equivalent figure for japan was  though its high technology companies exceeded even the ibm level with the  spending for canon being  and that for nec being  this training program was to take him over the next five years through many of ibms operating groups tom jr believed his most important influence was albert lynn williams a cpa who became president of ibm in  although the initiative and as such much of the credit for the birth of the information revolution must go to tom jr considerable courage was also displayed by his then aging father who despite his long commitment to internal funding backed his son to the hilt reportedly with the words it is harder to keep a business great than it is to build itcitation needed research and developmentedit of the two brothers tom jr made the most obvious impact on ibm as a whole while dick ran the international business prior to his time ibm had primarily emphasized the sales organization with a reasonable range of products tom jr however promoted the research and development structure that is essential to modern high technology industry it was under his supervision that the laboratories were built up to a point where in the late s they contained nobel prize winners and to the point where the research and development function could stand on an equal footing with marketing true to his original objective when tom jr started this process in  ibm was reportedly two years behind its main competitor univac in the s it was arguably up to a decade ahead of anyone else though its problems since seem to have destroyed much of its strength in this area this was not so obvious to the outside world because the new products still followed the conservative release pattern started in the s and pursued very profitably until recently despite the hype about prereleasing products which did not yet exist only when the market was sufficiently developed and a launch was financially justifiable did ibm commit its marketing resources in the labs though they were able to plan speculatively for the future decades in advance independent and untroubled by commercial demands it was an ideal environment for an industrial researcher and highly productive for ibm the first result of this was the ibm  stretch program to develop a transistorized supercomputer a hundred times more powerful than the vacuum tube  it failed to meet its price and performance goals at a reported cost of  million although embarrassing in terms of the rumors that drifted to the outside world it would not however be the last ibm computer series to be terminated and the cost was small in ibms terms and the experience gained was invaluable one of ibms strengths was that until the s it really did learn from experience most other companies are only too anxious to bury deep their embarrassing mistakes and never use the invaluable information they have gained ibm however made very good use of these particularly hard earned lessons the three computer families that eventually emerged from  onwards comprised the ibm  and ibm  for large government business the ibm  for the scientific community and the ibm  for commercial use despite the fact that many observers believed that tom jr was frittering away the resources his father had built up these new ranges were remarkably successful doubling ibms sales once more over the six years from   billion to   billion maintaining ibms dramatic growth rate virtually undiminished at approaching  compound the effect was that ibm had become independent of outside funding in the early s he oversaw the ibm system project which produced an entire line of computers that ran the same software and used the same peripherals since the  line was incompatible with ibms previous products it represented an enormous risk for the company despite delays in shipment the products were wellreceived following their launch in  and what fortune

structure it was modeled on military organizations going back to the prussian army in napoleonic timescitation needed his organization  provided ibm executives with the clearest possible goals each operating man was judged strictly on his units results and each staff man on his effort toward making ibm the world leader in his specialtycitation needed the final element of formal organizational change was the isolation of headquarters staff in armonk new york this was said by him to be in order to be near his family he lived in connecticut where taxes were lower but kept his staff across the

university  see also  references  further reading  external links early lifeedit thomas watson jr was born on january   just before his father was dismissed from his job at ncr then two sisters were born jane and helen before the youngest child arthur kittredge watson was born he was raised in the short hills section of millburn new jersey both sons were immersed in ibm from a very early age he was taken on plant inspections — his first memory of such a visit to the dayton ohio factory was at the age of five — business tours to europe and he made appearances at ibm hundred per cent club meetings annual gatherings for the companys elite sales representatives even before he was old enough to attend school at home his fathers discipline was erratic and often harsh around the time he was thirteen tom jr suffered for six years with what might now be called clinical depression talking to a reporter in  watson jr described his relationship with his father my father and i had terrible fights  he seemed like a blanket that covered everything i really wanted to beat him but also make him proud of me but this relationship was not all negative i really enjoyed the ten years working with him in his book he says i was so intimately entwined with my father i had a compelling desire maybe out of honor for the old gentleman maybe out of sheer cussedness to prove to the world that i could excel in the same way that he didix watson jr attended the hun school of princeton in princeton new jersey he claimed in his autobiography that as a child he had a strange defect in his vision that made written words appear to fall off the page when he tried to read them as a result watson struggled in school and he acknowledged that brown university reluctantly admitted him as a favor to his father he obtained a business degree in  he married olive cawley – in  they had six children after graduating watson became a salesman for ibm but had little interest in the job the turning point was his service as a pilot in the army air force during world war ii brother dick arthur watson had dropped out of yale as a major in ordnance tom jr became a lieutenant colonel flying military commanders tom jr later admitted to journalists that the one career he would have liked to follow was an airline pilot piloting came easily to him and for the first time he had confidence in his abilities toward the end of his service watson worked for major general follett bradley who suggested that he should try to follow his father at ibm watson regularly flew bradley the director of lendlease programs to the soviet union to moscow during the war on these trips he learned russian which would later serve him well as the american ambassador to the soviet union watson returned to ibm at the beginning of  he was promoted to be a vice president just six months later and was promoted to the board just four months after that he became executive vicepresident in  ibm presidentedit watson became president of ibm in  and was named as the companys ceo shortly before his fathers death in  up to this time ibm was dedicated to electromechanical punched card systems for its commercial products watson sr had repeatedly rejected electronic computers as overpriced and unreliable except for oneofakind projects such as the ibm ssec tom jr took the company in a new direction hiring electrical engineers by the hundreds and putting them to work designing mainframe computers many of ibms technical experts also did not think computer products were practical since there were only about a dozen computers in the entire world at the time even the supporters of the new technology underestimated the potential cuthbert hurd brought in from the atomic energy commissions oak ridge national laboratory to determine if there was a market predicted  he could find customers for as many as thirty machines even so until the late s the custombuilt us air force sage computerized tracking system accounted for more than half of ibms computer sales the company made little profit on these sales but as tom jr said it enabled us to build highly automated factories ahead of anybody else and to train thousands of new workers in electronicscitation needed tom jrs decision was justified in the longer term it redirected ibm to its later position dominating the computer market even in the short term it paid off for revenues more than tripled in six years from  million in  to  million in  this dramatic rate of growth almost matched the wartime years a better than  compound growth rate that tom jr maintained for much of the twenty years of his leadership of ibm it was a record even better than that of his father despite the presence of his son thomas sr kept a firm grip on the reins until  tom jr described the position of his father as he wanted to make me head of ibm but he didnt like sharing the limelight tom jr took over effective control in a dramatic moment though the formal handover took place a few months later the occasion was signing the consent decree which was offered by the government after its latest antitrust investigation tom jr saw that the consent decree which sought to strip ibm of half its cardmaking capacity was largely irrelevant since the future was in computers not cards there was another condition ibm had to sell machines outright as well as lease them this had repercussions in the late s when leasing companies recognized the financing loophole that it created behind this decision was another spending more on research and development ibm was only spending  on research and development when other high technology companies were spending between  and  tom jr learned the lesson and thereafter — at least until the s when even then gerstner only dropped it to  — ibm consistently spent  by comparison the equivalent figure for japan was  though its high technology companies exceeded even the ibm level with the  spending for canon being  and that for nec being  this training program was to take him over the next five years through many of ibms operating groups tom jr believed his most important influence was albert lynn williams a cpa who became president of ibm in  although the initiative and as such much of the credit for the birth of the information revolution must go to tom jr considerable courage was also displayed by his then aging father who despite his long commitment to internal funding backed his son to the hilt reportedly with the words it is harder to keep a business great than it is to build itcitation needed research and developmentedit of the two brothers tom jr made the most obvious impact on ibm as a whole while dick ran the international business prior to his time ibm had primarily emphasized the sales organization with a reasonable range of products tom jr however promoted the research and development structure that is essential to modern high technology industry it was under his supervision that the laboratories were built up to a point where in the late s they contained nobel prize winners and to the point where the research and development function could stand on an equal footing with marketing true to his original objective when tom jr started this process in  ibm was reportedly two years behind its main competitor univac in the s it was arguably up to a decade ahead of anyone else though its problems since seem to have destroyed much of its strength in this area this was not so obvious to the outside world because the new products still followed the conservative release pattern started in the s and pursued very profitably until recently despite the hype about prereleasing products which did not yet exist only when the market was sufficiently developed and a launch was financially justifiable did ibm commit its marketing resources in the labs though they were able to plan speculatively for the future decades in advance independent and untroubled by commercial demands it was an ideal environment for an industrial researcher and highly productive for ibm the first result of this was the ibm  stretch program to develop a transistorized supercomputer a hundred times more powerful than the vacuum tube  it failed to meet its price and performance goals at a reported cost of  million although embarrassing in terms of the rumors that drifted to the outside world it would not however be the last ibm computer series to be terminated and the cost was small in ibms terms and the experience gained was invaluable one of ibms strengths was that until the s it really did learn from experience most other companies are only too anxious to bury deep their embarrassing mistakes and never use the invaluable information they have gained ibm however made very good use of these particularly hard earned lessons the three computer families that eventually emerged from  onwards comprised the ibm  and ibm  for large government business the ibm  for the scientific community and the ibm  for commercial use despite the fact that many observers believed that tom jr was frittering away the resources his father had built up these new ranges were remarkably successful doubling ibms sales once more over the six years from   billion to   billion maintaining ibms dramatic growth rate virtually undiminished at approaching  compound the effect was that ibm had become independent of outside funding in the early s he oversaw the ibm system project which produced an entire line of computers that ran the same software and used the same peripherals since the  line was incompatible with ibms previous products it represented an enormous risk for the company despite delays in shipment the products were wellreceived following their launch in  and what fortune magazine called ibms  billion gamble in the end paid off organizational structuresedit perhaps watsons most enduring contribution to ibm was its organizational structure

links early lifeedit thomas watson jr was born on january   just before his father was dismissed from his job at ncr then two sisters were born jane and helen before the youngest child arthur kittredge watson was born he was raised in the short hills section of millburn new jersey both sons were immersed in ibm from a very early age he was taken on plant inspections — his first memory of such a visit to the dayton ohio factory was at the age of five — business tours to europe and he made appearances at ibm hundred per cent club meetings annual gatherings for the companys elite sales representatives even before he was old enough to attend school at home his fathers discipline was erratic and often harsh around the time he was thirteen tom jr suffered for six years with what might now be called clinical depression talking to a reporter in  watson jr described his relationship with his father my father and i had terrible fights  he seemed like a blanket that covered everything i really wanted to beat him but also make him proud of me but this relationship was not all negative i really enjoyed the ten years working with him in his book he says i was so intimately entwined with my father i had a compelling desire maybe out of honor for the old gentleman maybe out of sheer cussedness to prove to the world that i could excel in the same way that he didix watson jr attended the hun school of princeton in princeton new jersey he claimed in his autobiography that as a child he had a strange defect in his vision that made written words appear to fall off the page when he tried to read them as a result watson struggled in school and he acknowledged that brown university reluctantly admitted him as a favor to his father he obtained a business degree in  he married olive cawley – in  they had six children after graduating watson became a salesman for ibm but had little interest in the job the turning point was his service as a pilot in the army air force during world war ii brother dick arthur watson had dropped out of yale as a major in ordnance tom jr became a lieutenant colonel flying military commanders tom jr later admitted to journalists that the one career he would have liked to follow was an airline pilot piloting came easily to him and for the first time he had confidence in his abilities toward the end of his service watson worked for major general follett bradley who suggested that he should try to follow his father at ibm watson regularly flew bradley the director of lendlease programs to the soviet union to moscow during the war on these trips he learned russian which would later serve him well as the american ambassador to the soviet union watson returned to ibm at the beginning of  he was promoted to be a vice president just six months later and was promoted to the board just four months after that he became executive vicepresident in  ibm presidentedit watson became president of ibm in  and was named as the companys ceo shortly before his fathers death in  up to this time ibm was dedicated to electromechanical punched card systems for its commercial products watson sr had repeatedly rejected electronic computers as overpriced and unreliable except for oneofakind projects such as the ibm ssec tom jr took the company in a new direction hiring electrical engineers by the hundreds and putting them to work designing mainframe computers many of ibms technical experts also did not think computer products were practical since there were only about a dozen computers in the entire world at the time even the supporters of the new technology underestimated the potential cuthbert hurd brought in from the atomic energy commissions oak ridge national laboratory to determine if there was a market predicted  he could find customers for as many as thirty machines even so until the late s the custombuilt us air force sage computerized tracking system accounted for more than half of ibms computer sales the company made little profit on these sales but as tom jr said it enabled us to build highly automated factories ahead of anybody else and to train thousands of new workers in electronicscitation needed tom jrs decision was justified in the longer term it redirected ibm to its later position dominating the computer market even in the short term it paid off for revenues more than tripled in six years from  million in  to  million in  this dramatic rate of growth almost matched the wartime years a better than  compound growth rate that tom jr maintained for much of the twenty years of his leadership of ibm it was a record even better than that of his father despite the presence of his son thomas sr kept a firm grip on the reins until  tom jr described the position of his father as he wanted to make me head of ibm but he didnt like sharing the limelight tom jr took over effective control in a dramatic moment though the formal handover took place a few months later the occasion was signing the consent decree which was offered by the government after its latest antitrust investigation tom jr saw that the consent decree which sought to strip ibm of half its cardmaking capacity was largely irrelevant since the future was in computers not cards there was another condition ibm had to sell machines outright as well as lease them this had repercussions in the late s when leasing companies recognized the financing loophole that it created behind this decision was another spending more on research and development ibm was only spending  on research and development when other high technology companies were spending between  and  tom jr learned the lesson and thereafter — at least until the s when even then gerstner only dropped it to  — ibm consistently spent  by comparison the equivalent figure for japan was  though its high technology companies exceeded even the ibm level with the  spending for canon being  and that for nec being  this training program was to take him over the next five years through many of ibms operating groups tom jr believed his most important influence was albert lynn williams a cpa who became president of ibm in  although the initiative and as such much of the credit for the birth of the information revolution must go to tom jr considerable courage was also displayed by his then aging father who despite his long commitment to internal funding backed his son to the hilt reportedly with the words it is harder to keep a business great than it is to build itcitation needed research and developmentedit of the two brothers tom jr made the most obvious impact on ibm as a whole while dick ran the international business prior to his time ibm had primarily emphasized the sales organization with a reasonable range of products tom jr however promoted the research and development structure that is essential to modern high technology industry it was under his supervision that the laboratories were built up to a point where in the late s they contained nobel prize winners and to the point where the research and development function could stand on an equal footing with marketing true to his original objective when tom jr started this process in  ibm was reportedly two years behind its main competitor univac in the s it was arguably up to a decade ahead of anyone else though its problems since seem to have destroyed much of its strength in this area this was not so obvious to the outside world because the new products still followed the conservative release pattern started in the s and pursued very profitably until recently despite the hype about prereleasing products which did not yet exist only when the market was sufficiently developed and a launch was financially justifiable did ibm commit its marketing resources in the labs though they were able to plan speculatively for the future decades in advance independent and untroubled by commercial demands it was an ideal environment for an industrial researcher and highly productive for ibm the first result of this was the ibm  stretch program to develop a transistorized supercomputer a hundred times more powerful than the vacuum tube  it failed to meet its price and performance goals at a reported cost of  million although embarrassing in terms of the rumors that drifted to the outside world it would not however be the last ibm computer series to be terminated and the cost was small in ibms terms and the experience gained was invaluable one of ibms strengths was that until the s it really did learn from experience most other companies are only too anxious to bury deep their embarrassing mistakes and never use the invaluable information they have gained ibm however made very good use of these particularly hard earned lessons the three computer families that eventually emerged from  onwards comprised the ibm  and ibm  for large government business the ibm  for the scientific community and the ibm  for commercial use despite the fact that many observers believed that tom jr was frittering away the resources his father had built up these new ranges were remarkably successful doubling ibms sales once more over the six years from   billion to   billion maintaining ibms dramatic growth rate virtually undiminished at approaching  compound the effect was that ibm had become independent of outside funding in the early s he oversaw the ibm system project which produced an entire line of computers that ran the same software and used the same peripherals since the  line was incompatible with ibms previous products it represented an enormous risk for the company despite delays in shipment the products were wellreceived following their launch in  and what fortune magazine called ibms  billion gamble in the end paid off organizational structuresedit perhaps watsons most enduring contribution to ibm was its organizational structure since new products no matter how successful carry a company for at most a few years in  in a move that became a biannual event he reorganized ibm on divisional lines to give a decentralized organization with five major divisions in the us the new structure comprised data processing division — selling to and servicing commercial customers federal systems division — selling to and servicing the us government systems manufacturing division components manufacturing division research division smaller units were electric typewriter ibm world trade service bureau corporation supplies division and time division sold off in  watson said we had a superb sales organization but lacked expert management organization in almost everything elsecitation needed his goal was to redirect ibm to absorb the shocks of change including change from its own innovation he introduced the terminology line and staffcitation needed in his words by the mids just about every big corporation had adopted the socalled staffandline structure it was modeled on military organizations going back to the prussian army in napoleonic timescitation needed his organization  provided ibm executives with the clearest possible goals each operating man was judged strictly on his units results and each staff man on his effort toward making ibm the world leader in his specialtycitation needed the final element of formal organizational change was the isolation of headquarters staff in armonk new york this was said by him to be in order to be near his family he lived in connecticut where taxes were lower but kept his staff across the border in new york state so it has been suggested that ibm would not be seen as similarly evading taxes cynics said it was his fear of nuclear warfare he owned a fallout sheltercitation needed his first book in  discussed his management philosophy honorsedit watson received the silver buffalo award from the boy scouts of america in  for his service to youth he was the national president of the bsa from  to  his father had

sailboats after palawan the last in  watson sailed his sailboat palawan further up the northern coast of greenland than any nonmilitary ship had done previously for which he won the new york yacht clubs highest award and the cruising club of americas blue water medal he traveled the route of captain cook in exploring the pacific he flew aircraft from helicopters and jets to stunt planes and he was the first private citizen to receive permission from soviet premier mikhail gorbachev in  to fly to all the time zones of the soviet union a route he had previously done as a pilot ferrying

century contents  early life  ibm president  research and development  organizational structures  honors  retirement  philanthropy  columbia university  see also  references  further reading  external links early lifeedit thomas watson jr was born on january   just before his father was dismissed from his job at ncr then two sisters were born jane and helen before the youngest child arthur kittredge watson was born he was raised in the short hills section of millburn new jersey both sons were immersed in ibm from a very early age he was taken on plant inspections — his first memory of such a visit to the dayton ohio factory was at the age of five — business tours to europe and he made appearances at ibm hundred per cent club meetings annual gatherings for the companys elite sales representatives even before he was old enough to attend school at home his fathers discipline was erratic and often harsh around the time he was thirteen tom jr suffered for six years with what might now be called clinical depression talking to a reporter in  watson jr described his relationship with his father my father and i had terrible fights  he seemed like a blanket that covered everything i really wanted to beat him but also make him proud of me but this relationship was not all negative i really enjoyed the ten years working with him in his book he says i was so intimately entwined with my father i had a compelling desire maybe out of honor for the old gentleman maybe out of sheer cussedness to prove to the world that i could excel in the same way that he didix watson jr attended the hun school of princeton in princeton new jersey he claimed in his autobiography that as a child he had a strange defect in his vision that made written words appear to fall off the page when he tried to read them as a result watson struggled in school and he acknowledged that brown university reluctantly admitted him as a favor to his father he obtained a business degree in  he married olive cawley – in  they had six children after graduating watson became a salesman for ibm but had little interest in the job the turning point was his service as a pilot in the army air force during world war ii brother dick arthur watson had dropped out of yale as a major in ordnance tom jr became a lieutenant colonel flying military commanders tom jr later admitted to journalists that the one career he would have liked to follow was an airline pilot piloting came easily to him and for the first time he had confidence in his abilities toward the end of his service watson worked for major general follett bradley who suggested that he should try to follow his father at ibm watson regularly flew bradley the director of lendlease programs to the soviet union to moscow during the war on these trips he learned russian which would later serve him well as the american ambassador to the soviet union watson returned to ibm at the beginning of  he was promoted to be a vice president just six months later and was promoted to the board just four months after that he became executive vicepresident in  ibm presidentedit watson became president of ibm in  and was named as the companys ceo shortly before his fathers death in  up to this time ibm was dedicated to electromechanical punched card systems for its commercial products watson sr had repeatedly rejected electronic computers as overpriced and unreliable except for oneofakind projects such as the ibm ssec tom jr took the company in a new direction hiring electrical engineers by the hundreds and putting them to work designing mainframe computers many of ibms technical experts also did not think computer products were practical since there were only about a dozen computers in the entire world at the time even the supporters of the new technology underestimated the potential cuthbert hurd brought in from the atomic energy commissions oak ridge national laboratory to determine if there was a market predicted  he could find customers for as many as thirty machines even so until the late s the custombuilt us air force sage computerized tracking system accounted for more than half of ibms computer sales the company made little profit on these sales but as tom jr said it enabled us to build highly automated factories ahead of anybody else and to train thousands of new workers in electronicscitation needed tom jrs decision was justified in the longer term it redirected ibm to its later position dominating the computer market even in the short term it paid off for revenues more than tripled in six years from  million in  to  million in  this dramatic rate of growth almost matched the wartime years a better than  compound growth rate that tom jr maintained for much of the twenty years of his leadership of ibm it was a record even better than that of his father despite the presence of his son thomas sr kept a firm grip on the reins until  tom jr described the position of his father as he wanted to make me head of ibm but he didnt like sharing the limelight tom jr took over effective control in a dramatic moment though the formal handover took place a few months later the occasion was signing the consent decree which was offered by the government after its latest antitrust investigation tom jr saw that the consent decree which sought to strip ibm of half its cardmaking capacity was largely irrelevant since the future was in computers not cards there was another condition ibm had to sell machines outright as well as lease them this had repercussions in the late s when leasing companies recognized the financing loophole that it created behind this decision was another spending more on research and development ibm was only spending  on research and development when other high technology companies were spending between  and  tom jr learned the lesson and thereafter — at least until the s when even then gerstner only dropped it to  — ibm consistently spent  by comparison the equivalent figure for japan was  though its high technology companies exceeded even the ibm level with the  spending for canon being  and that for nec being  this training program was to take him over the next five years through many of ibms operating groups tom jr believed his most important influence was albert lynn williams a cpa who became president of ibm in  although the initiative and as such much of the credit for the birth of the information revolution must go to tom jr considerable courage was also displayed by his then aging father who despite his long commitment to internal funding backed his son to the hilt reportedly with the words it is harder to keep a business great than it is to build itcitation needed research and developmentedit of the two brothers tom jr made the most obvious impact on ibm as a whole while dick ran the international business prior to his time ibm had primarily emphasized the sales organization with a reasonable range of products tom jr however promoted the research and development structure that is essential to modern high technology industry it was under his supervision that the laboratories were built up to a point where in the late s they contained nobel prize winners and to the point where the research and development function could stand on an equal footing with marketing true to his original objective when tom jr started this process in  ibm was reportedly two years behind its main competitor univac in the s it was arguably up to a decade ahead of anyone else though its problems since seem to have destroyed much of its strength in this area this was not so obvious to the outside world because the new products still followed the conservative release pattern started in the s and pursued very profitably until recently despite the hype about prereleasing products which did not yet exist only when the market was sufficiently developed and a launch was financially justifiable did ibm commit its marketing resources in the labs though they were able to plan speculatively for the future decades in advance independent and untroubled by commercial demands it was an ideal environment for an industrial researcher and highly productive for ibm the first result of this was the ibm  stretch program to develop a transistorized supercomputer a hundred times more powerful than the vacuum tube  it failed to meet its price and performance goals at a reported cost of  million although embarrassing in terms of the rumors that drifted to the outside world it would not however be the last ibm computer series to be terminated and the cost was small in ibms terms and the experience gained was invaluable one of ibms strengths was that until the s it really did learn from experience most other companies are only too anxious to bury deep their embarrassing mistakes and never use the invaluable information they have gained ibm however made very good use of these particularly hard earned lessons the three computer families that eventually emerged from  onwards comprised the ibm  and ibm  for large government business the ibm  for the scientific community and the ibm  for commercial use despite the fact that many observers believed that tom jr was frittering away the resources his father had built up these new ranges were remarkably successful doubling ibms sales once more over the six years from   billion to   billion maintaining ibms dramatic growth rate virtually undiminished at approaching  compound the effect was that ibm had become independent of outside funding in the early s he oversaw the ibm system project which produced an entire line of computers that ran the same software and used the same peripherals since the  line was incompatible with ibms previous products it represented an enormous risk for the company despite delays in shipment the products were wellreceived following their launch in  and what fortune magazine called ibms  billion gamble in the end paid off organizational structuresedit perhaps watsons most enduring contribution to ibm was its organizational structure since new products no matter how successful carry a company for at most a few years in  in a move that became a biannual event he reorganized ibm on divisional lines to give a decentralized organization with five major divisions in the us the new structure comprised data processing division — selling to and servicing commercial customers federal systems division — selling to and servicing the us government systems manufacturing division components manufacturing division research division smaller units were electric typewriter ibm world trade service bureau corporation supplies division and time division sold off in  watson said we had a superb sales organization but lacked expert management organization in almost everything elsecitation needed his goal was to redirect ibm to absorb the shocks of change including change from its own innovation he introduced the terminology line and staffcitation needed in his words by the mids just about every big corporation had adopted the socalled staffandline structure it was modeled on military organizations going back to the prussian army in napoleonic timescitation needed his organization  provided ibm executives with the clearest possible goals each operating man was judged strictly on his units results and each staff man on his effort toward making ibm the world leader in his specialtycitation needed the final element of formal organizational change was the isolation of headquarters staff in armonk new york this was said by him to be in order to be near his family he lived in connecticut where taxes were lower but kept his staff across the border in new york state so it has been suggested that ibm would not be seen as similarly evading taxes cynics said it was his fear of nuclear warfare he owned a fallout sheltercitation needed his first book in  discussed his management philosophy honorsedit watson received the silver buffalo award from the boy scouts of america in  for his service to youth he was the national president of the bsa from  to  his father had also served on the national executive board and was international commissioner in the s lyndon b johnson in september  awarded watson the presidential medal of freedom the highest award a us president can bestow on a civilian watson was inducted into the junior achievement us business hall of fame in  he was awarded the vermilye medal in  in  fortune magazine hailed watson on its cover as the greatest capitalist in history in  he was included on time magazines  most influential people of the th century retirementedit watson with jimmy carter january   watson left ibm in  on his doctors advice after having a heart attack after recovering he was appointed by jimmy carter to be ambassador to the soviet union serving from october   to january   prior to this service he was the chairman of the general advisory committee gac which was set up by president kennedy to give advice to the president about americas nuclear defense policy he was an avid sailor and pilot he named  successive sailboats after palawan the last in  watson sailed his sailboat palawan further up the northern coast of greenland than any nonmilitary ship had done previously for which he won the new york yacht clubs highest award and the cruising club of americas blue water medal he traveled the route of captain cook in exploring the pacific he flew aircraft from helicopters and jets to stunt planes and he was the first private citizen to receive permission from soviet premier mikhail gorbachev in  to fly to all the time zones of the soviet union a route he had previously done as a pilot ferrying general bradley in a jet he piloted himself watson had homes in greenwich connecticut north haven maine stowe vermont vail colorado new york city and antigua he died in greenwich on december   of complications following a stroke he was  philanthropyedit olive and thomas j watson jr pavilion at greenwich hospital watson was the principal benefactor of the watson institute for international

museum in owls head maine columbia universityedit after leaving ibm watson donated tens of millions of dollars to columbia university from  onward these included a library the thomas j watson library of business and economics and several smaller building grants watson funded a columbia east campus residence hall named watson house the house became a landmark on campus and is one of the most coveted places for undergraduate seniors to live in honor of watson the  residents of watson house opened up a small snack shop called the watson joint emblematic of watsons business principles the

discusses the basic principles of reliability and robust design theory the development of a comprehensive model will enable an integrated consideration of both domains in the future will offer guidance for a systematic choice of corresponding methods and is thus aiming to pave the way for future researchauthors thomas j howard stefan kemmler tobias eiflerpatentssystems and methods for
