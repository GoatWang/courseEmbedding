helpful for various readers of this profile to be aware of the massive global importance of what peter is likely to accomplish perhaps it is sufficient to say that if he is doing something to create wealth you would be lucky to be involved  and if you dont understand or agree with what hes doing then you might be twice as lucky because youd likely learn why you were wrong as you watched him

hannover  bern  about hype company leadership partners news jobs contact us blog peter thiel’s  questions for product innovation posted by tim woods jan    am in his book zero to one peter thiel looks at why the cleantech industry crashed and believes that most cleantech companies failed to adequately answer one or more of seven fundamental questions about their business although these questions are primarily for businesses as a whole  and in particular technology startups  they are equally applicable for new product innovations it’s worth asking if your pipeline of innovations can adequately respond to them   the engineering question if we are truly talking about an innovation then the product will not be an incremental improvement for it to be an innovation it must be  times better than what is currently available apple’s ipad was x better than previous tablets google’s search performance accuracy and simplicity was x better than the plethora of previous search engines and portals paypal was x better than sending cheques to pay for ebay items it costs about £m to send a rocket into space elon musk wants to do it for £m  a x advantage it is only when you have this significant advantage in technology that you can offer transparent superiority to the customer a great technology company should have proprietary technology an order of magnitude better than its nearest substitute is your solution  times better  in a key dimension  than anything else available   the timing question are you entering an existing market with the product is it a slow moving market or a fast moving one cleantech compared itself to the silicon chip industry of the ’s but failed to appreciate the speed at which that market was moving  it was expanding exponentially with moore’s law  whereas the cleantech industry had no such advancement there was no explosion in growth and the industry lagged facebook launched at a time when broadband infrastructure was rapidly expanding and it exploded when mobile devices and smart phones became ubiquitous infrastructure readiness social norms government regulations established platforms and ecosystems all play a role in the timing question   the monopoly question peter thiel believes monopolies are a good thing and competition is bad monopolies allow you to innovate because you have cash flow and room to try radical things competition on the other hand prevents you from innovating google has had a monopoly on search for over a decade  nobody even comes close to its market share  and it can therefore invest in innovation think of google glass driverless cars project loon and internet barges most companies do not enjoy a monopoly they are instead engaged in fierce competition don’t overestimate how unique your product actually is  be realistic to the competitive threats a true innovation is one that has no competition it has a x technology advancement and is therefore clearly distinct in its space exaggerating your own uniqueness is an easy way to botch the monopoly question   the people question so much of innovation is about the quality of people and culture you have and finding a technical advancement which is x better means having engineers and technical people to do it cleantech is a perfect example and where you find cleantech companies you would expect to find engineers running them compare solyndra ceo brian harrison and tesla ceo elon musk  but thiel found this not to be the case so many of the companies that pitched cleantech to him were led by men in suits “this was a huge red flag because real technologists wear tshirts and jeans so we instituted a blanket rule pass on any company whose founders dressed up for pitch meetings” more broadly you need to ask yourself if you really have the right people capable of working on real product innovations and do you have the best people on the team to pursue the product to market a technical intrapreneur can lead and sell a product better than many sales people can   the distribution question you might think your technology speaks for itself but it most probably doesn’t you still need an effective distribution channel primarily a way to get close to the customer so they can experience the superior advantage you can bring cleantech companies effectively courted government and investors but they often forgot about customers they learned the hard way that the world is not a laboratory better place an electric vehicle startup had the technology but failed to market it to customers in a clear way people were confused whether they were buying a regular car like a renault with added electric or a better place car it wasn’t clear what the offering actually was the company bombed and in  when selling off the  assets they admitted they overcame the technical obstacles but failed in the distribution ones   the durability question you should plan to be the last mover in your market what does the market look like in  and  years time and how will your solution dominate the space what possible competition could you face  can china make it cheaper is the customer still ready to pay for your solution when circumstances change you need to be asking these questions to see how durable your future is cleantech relied on government subsidies and backing which is not necessarily a durable path it was also relying on the premise that fossil fuels were peaking as an energy source  however the rise of fracking in the mid ’s changed the picture more than doubling the fracking oil industry china became the bogeyman for us solar companies with abound solar blaming “aggressive pricing actions from chinese solar panel competitors” when it went bankrupt also upon going bankrupt energy conversion devices filed a  million lawsuit against chinese competitors for their aggressive competition a simple question the cleantech companies might have asked what will stop china from wiping out our business if there’s no good answer perhaps the durability question was a problem tesla had a head start in its field and its design and technology is moving faster than anybody else  its lead is widening all the time it also has a distinct and trustworthy brand which has consumer envy given that buying a car is one of the biggest purchasing decisions people make having trust in a brand is a hard thing to win  tesla has that trust where others don’t similarly apple has that brand trust which is very hard to displace   the secret question all great companies are built upon finding answers to secrets this is the heart of innovation secrets are problems which have an answer but nobody has figured it out yet pythagoras discovered the secrets of the triangle newton discovered the secrets to gravity and nasa figured out how to land humans on the moon these are big secrets but every great company and product solves a problem for the customer in a new way previously unknown think airbnb and uber great companies have secrets specific reasons for success that other people don’t see does your innovation uncover a secret which solves a fundamental problem for the customer so there it is the seven questions peter

trump has tapped thiel to help unleash the silicon valley mindset on the agency will it work updated by julia belluzjuliaoftoronto jan   am est tweet share peter thiel has said you would not be able to invent the polio vaccine today” a medical historian called that “at best ahistorical if not altogether meaningless” vcgcontributorgetty since the election of donald trump there’s been a lot of discussion in medical circles about bringing a silicon valley ethos to drug innovation in america this idea is embodied in peter thiel the billionaire founder of paypal who has reportedly been helping the president vet a pool of candidates to lead the food and drug administration thiel a libertarian iconoclast has repeatedly made the case that the fda gets in the way of drug innovation by making it too difficult for new medicines to get to the market some of the fda candidates he’s identified — including silicon valley’s jim o’neill and balaji srinivasan — have similarly argued that the agency should dump its requirement that drugs be proven effective before reaching the market and that we’d be better off if the fda operated more like a “yelp for drugs” in other words bringing the same speedy and disruptive approach to medical regulation that silicon valley brought to the taxi and hotel industries for example will unlock cures — fast but thiel and his pals miss a very important point about developing new drugs manipulating biology isn’t the same as manipulating computer code it’s much much harder speeding up medical innovation will take a lot more than just stripping down the fda — it’ll take huge leaps forward in our understanding of biochemistry and the body health care is also different from taxis and hotels in another key way consumers can’t really judge the safety and quality of medical products by themselves it’s not the fda that gets in the way of innovation it’s the limits of our knowledge one of the key notions that undergirds the peter thiel view of the fda is that if the agency just got rid of some of the pesky restrictions for drug approval we’d usher in another golden age in drug development thiel declined our interview request to test this idea i asked a longtime pharmaceutical scientist and conservative derek lowe for his views in his  years in the lab lowe has seen hundreds of thousands of compounds tested on a huge variety of drug targets and never not once has he brought a drug to market the reason “we don’t know how to find drugs that work” he said for every  compounds discovered at this preclinical phase of drug development only about five are promising enough to be tried in humans that’s a success rate of  percent drug innovation comes from painstaking tinkering and a dash of luck “it’s very tempting for someone who has come out of it to say ‘dna is code and cells are the hardware go in and debug it’” lowe said “but this is wrong” in silicon valley humans have designed the hardware software and computer code they’re working with in medical research scientists do not have that advantage lowe said “we have  billion years of spaghettitangled gibberish to deal with and unless you’ve done drug development it’s very hard to get across how hard it is i don’t know of anything that’s harder” biochemistry and cell biology are “like alien nanotechnology” he added so the real hurdle researchers face when it comes to finding new drugs for people isn’t overcoming a stringent regulator it’s grappling with that “alien nanotechnology” in the lab cheaper faster but  worse drugs thiel has argued that the clinical trials required to prove a drug is effective slow down the development process in one talk he said that if we didn’t force drugmakers to prove their products are better than the others already available we’d have more “slightly worse but much cheaper” options to pick from to address this he and other regulation skeptics typically suggest that the fda should loosen up or even get rid of its efficacy requirement let’s step back a bit to explain how the fda approves drugs and the three phases of clinical testing they have to pass to get the final green light in phase one trials researchers test drugs for safety in a small group of healthy people and tinker with dosing in phase two they test the drug in a larger group of people and make sure it delivers on its promise by monitoring how well it works against the best available therapies or a placebo in phase three the drug is tested on an even bigger group up to  people and again researchers compare how the drug works against other treatments on the market and carefully analyze safety data if the drug makes it through phase three the data is submitted to the fda for approval folks in the thiel camp argue that removing the efficacy requirements — or abolishing phase two and three clinical trials — would give consumers more drug options and they’re right on that point if drugmakers only had to prove their drugs were safe there would certainly be many more products on the market but would they be good drugs consider this it wasn’t until  that the food and drug administration starting asking drug companies to prove their products were both safe and effective before they hit the market until that time there were some standards related to adulteration and labeling but otherwise it was mostly a freeforall it took the infamous scandal around thalidomide a morningsickness medication that caused severe birth defects to strengthen the fda  and incidentally the fda’s efficacy standard coincided with the golden age of drug innovation in the s and ’s the failure rate for drugs in clinical trials is about  percent that means the vast majority of drugs aren’t safe or effective enough to be used — they don’t do what they were supposed to do as yale fda researcher joe ross noted to me “if there is no demonstration of a benefit does it matter if we have more options” and here’s lowe “the clinical failure rate is not  percent because the fda are such bastards the clinical failure rate is that high because most drugs don’t do what we thought they were going to do” it’s precisely the clinical trial process with scientists closely measuring efficacy that helps weed out drugs that don’t work unlike hotels or taxi services which can easily be evaluated by consumers consumers often can’t judge whether their drugs are helping or hurting them the effects may not be obvious or appear for a very long time “it’s not like when you pick up a car and drive it and decide whether you like it or not” said hank greely director of the center for law and the biosciences at stanford “knowing whether drugs are safe and work is something far beyond the common knowledge of patients and is frankly far beyond the knowledge of most physicians” greely pointed out that we already have an example of what a much less regulated drug world would look like “it’s called the nutritional supplement industry and it’s a travesty” supplement makers dont need to demonstrate that their products are effective or even safe before putting them on store shelves — so most supplements are unproven and problems with quality and adulteration appear to be distressingly common the fda has become the fastest medical regulatory agency in the world in the s and ’s congress and the fda created several programs to speed up the development and approval process for new pharmaceuticals the orphan drug designation priority review fast track and accelerated approval these programs were intended to push the most clinically important innovative drugs — medicines to treat rare serious or lifethreatening diseases — out to patients more quickly often on the basis of more limited and less rigorous clinical trial data “these pathways along with increased funding for fda drug reviews from user fees enacted first in  were successful” said aaron kesselheim an associate professor of medicine at brigham and women’s hospital in an email “the average total review time for example has fallen from  months in the s to currently around  months” sixty years of drug approvals what you see is that the annual approval rate for new drugs has mostly held steady since the s with a shortlived boost in the s after a new user fee law gave the fda more funding to clear out a backlog of applications nature reviews and drug discovery but the more important question is whether expedited fda pathways increased the number of innovative new therapeutic options for patients — and here the data is far less clear “some transformative drugs like imatinib gleevec for chronic myeloid leukemia have definitely benefited from speedier fda pathways” kesselheim said but research continues to show that the majority of drugs that have come onto the market offer little or no improvement over the status quo for example several studies have found that since the mids about  to  percent of new drugs that have come onto the market dont offer any clinical advantages for patients compared with existing therapies more worryingly the special expedited development and approval pathways have become the rule rather than the exception newer research led by kesselheim in the bmj looked at a database of all new medicines approved by the fda between  and  and found that over the past two decades the proportion of new drugs qualifying for at least one of the fdas expedited programs has increased by  percent per year kesselheim and his colleagues also concluded that this trend is being driven by drugs that are not first in class and thus potentially less innovative so theres little evidence that speeding up approval times has helped spur innovation some even argue that if you want to bolster medical innovation you need to look well beyond the fda yale’s ross says some of the biggest barriers occur in the world of insurance payers “medicare essentially pays for almost everything the fda approves if payers were making more coverage decisions — including reimbursing more effective safer medications — based on value that would be a huge incentive to innovate better products” he says before descending on the agency silicon valley types will also need a firmer grasp of the history of medical regulation and why it’s there in the first place peter thiel has said you would not be able to invent the polio vaccine today” echoing similar statements from some of the potential fda picks yale medical historian jason schwartz disagreed “this assertion is at best ahistorical if not altogether meaningless” the famous salk polio vaccine trial in  involved more than half a million children “a number that would be unacceptable today” schwartz explained and shortly after the vaccine’s introduction problems with its production resulted in the cutter incident vaccines with live polio virus instead of killed virus were administered to thousands of american children sickening  leaving  paralyzed and killing  over the past halfcentury we’ve seen a number of new vaccines come onto the market including shots to prevent hepatitis b and meningococcal which were developed without harming children “its exactly the production safeguards and ongoing oversight of vaccines and other products by the fda today — both before and after approval — that keep these kinds of preventable tragedies from happening again” schwartz said there are some places where silicon valley can help with drug innovation now that we’ve gone through the reasons silicon valley types are misguided let’s talk about the places where they could really shake up the fda for the better alex tabarrok over at marginal revolution argues that the fda needs to better adapt to the new world of personal technologies that can empower patients as he wrote on his blog today almost everyone carries in their pocket the processing power of a s supercomputer smartphones equipped with sensors can monitor blood pressure perform ecgs and even analyze dna other devices being developed or available include contact lens that can track glucose levels and eye pressure devices for monitoring and analyzing gait in real time and head bands that monitor and even adjust your brain waves and several of the fda commissioner candidates would be well positioned to help the agency work through how to safely integrate these technologies into clinical trial research and patient care “fda commissioner candidate joseph gulfo has experience in getting devices through the fda process including the remarkable melafind a device for spotting melanomas” tabarrok said in an email “balaji srinivasan another fda candidate started a genetics testing company so they have experience in this area” mark mcclellan an fda commissioner under george w bush agreed he told us he’d like to see the fda enable innovators to use technologies like electronic medical records mobile phones and remote sensing to automatically collect medical data from patients or find potential enrollees for clinical trials “the big opportunity for time savings is not in fda review time” mcclellan said “it’s in the entire development process that leads up to the review — how to design clinical trials how to enroll patients in them” drug approvals in cancer therapeutics is another area several observers said could radically be improved dr vincent devita an oncologist and former head of the national cancer institute wants to see cancer centers initiate and run earlystage clinical trials instead of the status quo which involves the agency signing off on the trials first adding time and cost to the process the fda also requires researchers to test drugs separately — but a lot of cancer treatments right now involve treating patients with combination therapies — so here too the fda lags the pace of oncologic drug innovation but he also said “i think these issues are unique to cancer” whoever gets appointed devita said he’s not holding his breath for a big shake up “i went through five fda commissioners while working in government and not one of them had a major impact on drug development” he says it’s the midlevel staff at the agency that often wields the most influence he added a “yelp for drugs” sponsored by the government is a long way off was this article helpful awesome share it tweet share help us improve give us your feedback your email address next

united states when peter was aged one and lived in cleveland where klaus worked as a chemical engineer klaus then worked for various mining companies which caused an itinerant upbringing for thiel and his younger brother patrick michael thiel thiels mother naturalized as a us citizen but his father did not before settling in foster city california in  the thiels had lived in south africa and southwest africa and peter had been forced to change elementary schools seven times one of peters elementary schools a strict establishment in swakopmund required students to wear uniforms and utilized corporal punishment such as striking students hands with a ruler for mistakes this experience instilled a distaste for uniformity and regimentation later reflected in thiels support for individualism and libertarianism as an adult in his youth thiel played dungeons  dragons was an avid reader of science fiction with isaac asimov and robert a heinlein among his favorite authors and a fan of j r r tolkiens works stating as an adult that he had read the lord of the rings over ten times during his childhood he has since founded  firms palantir technologies valar ventures mithril capital lembas llc rivendell llc and arda capital whose names originate from tolkien education in school thiel excelled in mathematics and scored first in a californiawide mathematics competition while attending middle school in san mateo at the san mateo high school he read ayn rand admired the optimism and anticommunism of thenpresident ronald reagan and was valedictorian of his graduating class in  after graduating from san mateo high school thiel went on to study philosophy at stanford university during thiels time at stanford debates on identity politics and political correctness were ongoing at the university and a western culture program which was criticized by the rainbow agenda because of a perceived overrepresentation of the achievements made by european men was replaced with a culture ideas and values course which instead pushed diversity and multiculturalism this replacement provoked controversy on the campus and led to thiel founding the stanford review a paper for conservative and libertarian viewpoints in  through the funding of irving kristol thiel served as the stanford reviews first editorinchief and remained in that post until he received his bachelor of arts in  at which point his friend david o sacks became the new editorinchief thiel then continued on to the stanford law school and acquired his doctor of jurisprudence in  while at stanford thiel encountered rené girard whose mimetic theory influenced him mimetic theory posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis and that imitation can engender pointless conflict girard notes the productive potential of competition it is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially if not individually acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another thiel applied this theory to his personal life and business ventures stating the big problem with competition is that it focuses us on the people around us and while we get better at the things were competing on we lose sight of anything thats important or transcendent or truly meaningful in our world career early career after graduating from the stanford law school thiel had interviews with supreme court justices antonin scalia and anthony kennedy after not being hired he instead took up a post as a judicial clerk for judge james larry edmondson of the united states court of appeals for the th circuit but soon moved to new york to work as a securities lawyer for sullivan  cromwell after seven months and three days he left the law firm citing a lack of transcendental value in his work he then took a job as a derivatives trader in currency options at credit suisse working there from  on while also operating as a speechwriter for formerunited states secretary of education william bennett before again feeling as though his work lacked meaningful value and returning to california in  upon returning to the bay area thiel noticed that the development of the internet and personal computer had already altered the economic landscape and the dotcom boom was well underway with financial support from friends and family he was able to raise  million toward the establishment of thiel capital management and embark on his venture capital career early on he experienced a setback after investing  in his friend luke noseks unsuccessful webbased calendar project however his luck changed when max levchin a friend of noseks introduced him to his cryptographyrelated company idea which later became their first venture called confinity in  paypal further information paypal § early history with confinity thiel realized they could develop a software to solve a gap in making online payments although the use of credit cards and expanding automated teller machine networks provided consumers with more available payment options not all merchants could gain the necessary hardware to accept credit cards thus consumers were often left with little choice and instead had to pay with exact cash or personal checks thiel wanted to create a type of digital wallet in the hopes of ensuring more consumer convenience and security by encrypting data on digital devices and in  confinity launched paypal paypal promised to open up new possibilities for handling money and according to eric m jacksons account in his book the paypal wars thiel viewed paypals mission as liberating people throughout the world from the erosion of the value of their currencies due to inflation jackson recalls an inspirational speech by thiel in  were definitely onto something big the need paypal answers is monumental everyone in the world needs money – to get paid to trade to live paper money is an ancient technology and an inconvenient means of payment you can run out of it it wears out it can get lost or stolen in the twentyfirst century people need a form of money thats more convenient and secure something that can be accessed from anywhere with a pda or an internet connection of course what were calling convenient for american users will be revolutionary for the developing world many of these countries governments play fast and loose with their currencies they use inflation and sometimes wholesale currency devaluations like we saw in russia and several southeast asian countries last year referring to the  russian and  asian financial crisis to take wealth away from their citizens most of the ordinary people there never have an opportunity to open an offshore account or to get their hands on more than a few bills of a stable currency like us dollars eventually paypal will be able to change this in the future when we make our service available outside the us and as internet penetration continues to expand to all

college degree you don’t know what you’re going to do with your college degree so you get a graduate degree in my case it was law school which is the classic thing one does when one has no idea what else to do i don’t have any big regrets but if i had to do it over i would try to think more about the future than i did at the time  you cannot get out of student debt even if you personally go

views on the future of both the libertarian movement and politics in the united states in general in an article published by cato unbound on april   stating i remain committed to the faith of my teenage years to authentic human freedom as a precondition for the highest good i stand against confiscatory taxes totalitarian collectives and the ideology of the inevitability of the death of every individual for all these reasons i still call myself libertarian but i must confess that over the last two decades i have changed radically on the question of how to achieve these goals most importantly i no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible  the s were the last decade in american history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics since  the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of capitalist democracy into an oxymoron on september   thiel said at a  fundraiser for the american foundation for equal rights gay marriage can’t be a partisan issue because as long as there are partisan issues or cultural issues in this country you’ll have trench warfare like on the western front in world war i you’ll have lots of carnage and no progress in  he wrote an editorial in national review on the slowdown of technological progress and the state of modern western civilization most of our political leaders are not engineers or scientists and do not listen to engineers or scientists today a letter from einstein would get lost in the white house mail room and the manhattan project would not even get started it certainly could never be completed in three years i am not aware of a single political leader in the us either democrat or republican who would cut healthcare spending in order to free up money for biotechnology research — or more generally who would make serious cuts to the welfare state in order to free up serious money for major engineering projects men reached the moon in july  and woodstock began three weeks later with the benefit of hindsight we can see that this was when the hippies took over the country and when the true cultural war over progress was lost todays aged hippies no longer understand that there is a difference between the election of a black president and the creation of cheap solar energy in their minds the movement towards greater civil rights parallels general progress everywhere because of these ideological conflations and commitments the s progressive left cannot ask whether things actually might be getting worse in a  episode of conversations with bill kristol thiel spoke at length on what he sees to be a crisis in american higher education the university system in  its like the catholic church circa   you have this priestly class of professors that doesnt do very much work people are buying indulgences in the form of amassing

africa  peter andreas thiel was born in frankfurt am main west germany on october   to susanne and klaus friedrich thiel the family migrated to the united states when peter was aged one and lived in cleveland where klaus worked as a chemical engineer klaus then worked for various mining companies which caused an itinerant upbringing for thiel and his younger brother patrick michael thiel thiels mother naturalized as a us citizen but his father did not before settling in foster city california in  the thiels had lived in south africa and southwest africa and peter had been forced to change elementary schools seven times one of peters elementary schools a strict establishment in swakopmund required students to wear uniforms and utilized corporal punishment such as striking students hands with a ruler for mistakes this experience instilled a distaste for uniformity and regimentation later reflected in thiels support for individualism and libertarianism as an adult in his youth thiel played dungeons  dragons was an avid reader of science fiction with isaac asimov and robert a heinlein among his favorite authors and a fan of j r r tolkiens works stating as an adult that he had read the lord of the rings over ten times during his childhood he has since founded  firms palantir technologies valar ventures mithril capital lembas llc rivendell llc and arda capital whose names originate from tolkien education in school thiel excelled in mathematics and scored first in a californiawide mathematics competition while attending middle school in san mateo at the san mateo high school he read ayn rand admired the optimism and anticommunism of thenpresident ronald reagan and was valedictorian of his graduating class in  after graduating from san mateo high school thiel went on to study philosophy at stanford university during thiels time at stanford debates on identity politics and political correctness were ongoing at the university and a western culture program which was criticized by the rainbow agenda because of a perceived overrepresentation of the achievements made by european men was replaced with a culture ideas and values course which instead pushed diversity and multiculturalism this replacement provoked controversy on the campus and led to thiel founding the stanford review a paper for conservative and libertarian viewpoints in  through the funding of irving kristol thiel served as the stanford reviews first editorinchief and remained in that post until he received his bachelor of arts in  at which point his friend david o sacks became the new editorinchief thiel then continued on to the stanford law school and acquired his doctor of jurisprudence in  while at stanford thiel encountered rené girard whose mimetic theory influenced him mimetic theory posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis and that imitation can engender pointless conflict girard notes the productive potential of competition it is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially if not individually acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another thiel applied this theory to his personal life and business ventures stating the big problem with competition is that it focuses us on the people around us and while we get better at the things were competing on we lose sight of anything thats important or transcendent or truly meaningful in our world career early career after graduating from the stanford law school thiel had interviews with supreme court justices antonin scalia and anthony kennedy after not being hired he instead took up a post as a judicial clerk for judge james larry edmondson of the united states court of appeals for the th circuit but soon moved to new york to work as a securities lawyer for sullivan  cromwell after seven months and three days he left the law firm citing a lack of transcendental value in his work he then took a job as a derivatives trader in currency options at credit suisse working there from  on while also operating as a speechwriter for formerunited states secretary of education william bennett before again feeling as though his work lacked meaningful value and returning to california in  upon returning to the bay area thiel noticed that the development of the internet and personal computer had already altered the economic landscape and the dotcom boom was well underway with financial support from friends and family he was able to raise  million toward the establishment of thiel capital management and embark on his venture capital career early on he experienced a setback after investing  in his friend luke noseks unsuccessful webbased calendar project however his luck changed when max levchin a friend of noseks introduced him to his cryptographyrelated company idea which later became their first venture called confinity in  paypal further information paypal § early history with confinity thiel realized they could develop a software to solve a gap in making online payments although the use of credit cards and expanding automated teller machine networks provided consumers with more available payment options not all merchants could gain the necessary hardware to accept credit cards thus consumers were often left with little choice and instead had to pay with exact cash or personal checks thiel wanted to create a type of digital wallet in the hopes of ensuring more consumer convenience and security by encrypting data on digital devices and in  confinity launched paypal paypal promised to open up new possibilities for handling money and according to eric m jacksons account in his book the paypal wars thiel viewed paypals mission as liberating people throughout the world from the erosion of the value of their currencies due to inflation jackson recalls an inspirational speech by thiel in  were definitely onto something big the need paypal answers is monumental everyone in the world needs money – to get paid to trade to live paper money is an ancient technology and an inconvenient means of payment you can run out of it it wears out it can get lost or stolen in the twentyfirst century people need a form of money thats more convenient and secure something that can be accessed from anywhere with a pda or an internet connection of course what were calling convenient for american users will be revolutionary for the developing world many of these countries governments play fast and loose with their currencies they use inflation and sometimes wholesale currency devaluations like we saw in russia and several southeast asian countries last year referring to the  russian and  asian financial crisis to take wealth away from their citizens most of the ordinary people there never have an opportunity to open an offshore account or to get their hands on more than a few bills of a stable currency like us dollars eventually paypal will be able to change this in the future when we make our service available outside the us and as internet penetration continues to expand to all economic tiers of people paypal will give citizens worldwide more direct control over their currencies than they ever had before it will be nearly impossible for corrupt governments to steal wealth from their people through their old means because if they try the people will switch to dollars or pounds or yen in effect dumping the worthless local currency for something more secure when paypal launched at a successful press conference in  representatives from nokia and deutsche bank sent  million in venture funding to thiel using paypal on their palmpilots paypal then continued to grow through mergers with elon musk’s financial services company xcom and with pixo a company specializing in mobile commerce in  these mergers allowed paypal to expand into the wireless phone market and transformed it into a safer and more userfriendly tool by enabling users to transfer money via a free online registration and email rather than by exchanging bank account information by  paypal served over  million customers and had expanded its services to private consumers and businesses in twentysix countries paypal went public on february   and was sold to ebay for  billion in october of that year thiels  stake was worth  million at the time of the acquisition clarium capital further information clarium capital following paypals sale to ebay in  thiel devoted  million of his proceeds to establish clarium capital management a global macro hedge fund focusing on directional and liquid instruments in currencies interest rates commodities and equities thiel stated that the big macroeconomic idea that we had at clarium—the idée fixe—was the peakoil theory which was basically that the world was running out of oil and that there were no easy alternatives in  clarium capital reflected a return of  as thiel successfully bet that the united states dollar would weaken in  thiel spoke of the dotcom bubble having migrated in effect into a growing bubble in the financial sector and specified general electric and walmart as vulnerable in  clarium saw a  return as thiel predicted that the dollar would rally this success saw clarium honored as global macro hedge fund of the year by marhedge and absolute return  alpha however clariums faltered in  with a  loss during this time the firm sought to profit in the longterm from its petrodollar analysis which foresaw the impending decline in oil supplies and the unsustainable bubble growing in the us housing market clariums assets under management indeed after achieving a  return in  grew to over  billion by  but plummeted as financial markets collapsed near the start of  by  after missing out on the economic rebound many key investors pulled out causing clariums assets to be valued at  million over half of which was thiels own money palantir further information palantir technologies in may  thiel incorporated palantir technologies a big data analysis company named after the tolkien artifact and continues to serves as its chairman as of  thiel stated that the idea for the company was based on the realization that the approaches that paypal had used to fight fraud could be extended into other contexts like fighting terrorism he also stated that after the september  attacks the debate in the united states was will we have more security with less privacy or less security with more privacy and saw palantir as being able to provide data mining services to government intelligence agencies which were maximally unintrusive and traceable at first palantirs only backers was the central intelligence agencys venture capital arm inqtel but the company steadily grew and in  was valued at  billion with thiel being the companys largest shareholder facebook further information facebook § thefacebook thiel investment and name change in august  thiel made a  angel

of president of facebook was seeking investors for facebook parker approached reid hoffman the ceo of workbased social network linkedin hoffman liked facebook but declined to be the lead investor because of the potential for conflict of interest with his duties as linkedin ceo thus hoffman directed parker to thiel whom he knew from their paypal days thiel met parker and mark zuckerberg the harvard student who had founded facebook thiel and zuckerberg got along well and thiel agreed to lead facebooks seed round with  for  of the company the investment was originally in the form of a convertible note to be converted to equity if facebook reached  million users by the end of  although facebook narrowly missed the target thiel allowed the loan to be converted to equity anyway thiel said of his investment i was comfortable with them pursuing their original vision and it was a very reasonable valuation i thought it was going to be a pretty safe investment in september  thiel while expressing skepticism about the potential for growth in the consumer internet sector argued that relative to other internet companies facebook which then had a secondary market valuation of  billion was comparatively undervalued facebooks initial public offering was in may  with a market cap of nearly  billion  a share at which time thiel sold  million shares for  million in august  immediately

personally very guilty of this you don’t know what to do with your life so you get a college degree you don’t know what you’re going to do with your college degree so you get a graduate degree in my case it was law school which is the classic thing one does when one has no idea what else to do i don’t have any big regrets but if i had to do it over i would try to think more about the future than i did at the time  you cannot get out of student debt even if you personally go bankrupt its a form of almost like indentured servitude its attached to your physical person for the rest of your life

activities quotes this page is a candidate to be copied to wikiquote using the transwiki process if the page can be expanded into an encyclopedic article rather than a list of quotations please do so and remove this message thiel in  a devoted libertarian thiel expounded his views on the future of both the libertarian movement and politics in the united states in general in an article published by cato unbound on april   stating i remain committed to the faith of my teenage years to authentic human freedom as a precondition for the highest good i stand against confiscatory taxes totalitarian collectives and the ideology of the inevitability of the death of every individual for all these reasons i still call myself libertarian but i must confess that over the last two decades i have changed radically on the question of how to achieve these goals most importantly i no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible  the s were the last decade in american history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics since  the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of capitalist democracy into an oxymoron on september   thiel said at a  fundraiser for the american foundation for equal rights gay marriage can’t be a partisan issue because as long as there are partisan issues or cultural issues in this country you’ll have trench warfare like on the western front in world war i you’ll have lots of carnage and no progress in  he wrote an editorial in national review on the slowdown of technological progress and the state of modern western civilization most of our political leaders are not engineers or scientists and do not listen to engineers or scientists today a letter from einstein would get lost in the white house mail room and the manhattan project would not even get started it certainly could never be completed in three years i am not aware of a single political leader in the us either democrat or republican who would cut healthcare spending in order to free up money for biotechnology research — or more generally who would make serious cuts to the welfare state in order to free up serious money for major engineering projects men reached the moon in july  and woodstock began three weeks later with the benefit of hindsight we can see that this was when the hippies took over the country and when the true cultural war over progress was lost todays aged hippies no longer understand that there is a difference between the election of a black president and the creation of cheap solar energy in their minds the movement towards greater civil rights parallels general progress everywhere because of these ideological conflations and commitments the s progressive left cannot ask whether things actually might be getting worse in a  episode of conversations with bill kristol thiel spoke at length on what he sees to be a crisis in american higher education the university system in  its like the catholic church circa   you have this priestly class of professors that doesnt do very much work people are buying indulgences in the form of amassing enormous debt for the sort of the secular salvation that a diploma represents and what i think is also similar to the th century

when he applied he stated he had no intention of living in new zealand religious views thiel is a selfdescribed christian and a promoter of rené girards christian anthropology he grew up in an evangelical household but as of  describes his religious beliefs as somewhat heterodox and stated i believe christianity is true but i dont sort of feel a compelling need to convince other people of that during his time at stanford university thiel attended a lecture given by rené girard girard a catholic explained the role of sacrifice and the scapegoat mechanism in resolving social conflict which appealed to thiel as it offered a basis for his christian faith without the fundamentalism of his parents chess career peter thiel title life master fide rating  november  peak rating  december

along with david o sacks and with a foreword by the late emory university historian elizabeth foxgenovese the book is critical of political correctness and multiculturalism in higher education and the consequent dilution of academic rigor thiel and sacks writings drew criticism from thenstanford provost and later president george w bushs national security advisor condoleezza rice with rice joining thenstanford president gerhard casper in describing thiel and sacks view of stanford as a cartoon not a description of our freshman curriculum and their commentary as demagoguery pure and simple in  thiel apologized for two statements he made in the book  the purpose of the rape crisis movement seems as much about vilifying men as about raising awareness and  but since a multicultural rape charge may indicate nothing more than belated regret a woman might realize that she had been raped the next day or even many days later he stated more than two decades ago i cowrote a book with several insensitive crudely argued statements as i’ve said before i wish i’d never written those things i’m sorry for it rape in all forms is a crime i regret writing passages that have been taken to suggest

frankfurt am main west germany on october   to susanne and klaus friedrich thiel the family migrated to the united states when peter was aged one and lived in cleveland where klaus worked as a chemical engineer klaus then worked for various mining companies which caused an itinerant upbringing for thiel and his younger brother patrick michael thiel thiels mother naturalized as a us citizen but his father did not before settling in foster city california in  the thiels had lived in south africa and southwest africa and peter had been forced to change elementary schools seven times one of peters elementary schools a strict establishment in swakopmund required students to wear uniforms and utilized corporal punishment such as striking students hands with a ruler for mistakes this experience instilled a distaste for uniformity and regimentation later reflected in thiels support for individualism and libertarianism as an adult in his youth thiel played dungeons  dragons was an avid reader of science fiction with isaac asimov and robert a heinlein among his favorite authors and a fan of j r r tolkiens works stating as an adult that he had read the lord of the rings over ten times during his childhood he has since founded  firms palantir technologies valar ventures mithril capital lembas llc rivendell llc and arda capital whose names originate from tolkien education in school thiel excelled in mathematics and scored first in a californiawide mathematics competition while attending middle school in san mateo at the san mateo high school he read ayn rand admired the optimism and anticommunism of thenpresident ronald reagan and was valedictorian of his graduating class in  after graduating from san mateo high school thiel went on to study philosophy at stanford university during thiels time at stanford debates on identity politics and political correctness were ongoing at the university and a western culture program which was criticized by the rainbow agenda because of a perceived overrepresentation of the achievements made by european men was replaced with a culture ideas and values course which instead pushed diversity and multiculturalism this replacement provoked controversy on the campus and led to thiel founding the stanford review a paper for conservative and libertarian viewpoints in  through the funding of irving kristol thiel served as the stanford reviews first editorinchief and remained in that post until he received his bachelor of arts in  at which point his friend david o sacks became the new editorinchief thiel then continued on to the stanford law school and acquired his doctor of jurisprudence in  while at stanford thiel encountered rené girard whose mimetic theory influenced him mimetic theory posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis and that imitation can engender pointless conflict girard notes the productive potential of competition it is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially if not individually acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another thiel applied this theory to his personal life and business ventures stating the big problem with competition is that it focuses us on the people around us and while we get better at the things were competing on we lose sight of anything thats important or transcendent or truly meaningful in our world career early career after graduating from the stanford law school thiel had interviews with supreme court justices antonin scalia and anthony kennedy after not being hired he instead took up a post as a judicial clerk for judge james larry edmondson of the united states court of appeals for the th circuit but soon moved to new york to work as a securities lawyer for sullivan  cromwell after seven months and three days he left the law firm citing a lack of transcendental value in his work he then took a job as a derivatives trader in currency options at credit suisse working there from  on while also operating as a speechwriter for formerunited states secretary of education william bennett before again feeling as though his work lacked meaningful value and returning to california in  upon returning to the bay area thiel noticed that the development of the internet and personal computer had already altered the economic landscape and the dotcom boom was well underway with financial support from friends and family he was able to raise  million toward the establishment of thiel capital management and embark on his venture capital career early on he experienced a setback after investing  in his friend luke noseks unsuccessful webbased calendar project however his luck changed when max levchin a friend of noseks introduced him to his cryptographyrelated company idea which later became their first venture called confinity in  paypal further information paypal § early history with confinity thiel realized they could develop a software to solve a gap in making online payments although the use of credit cards and expanding automated teller machine networks provided consumers with more available payment options not all merchants could gain the necessary hardware to accept credit cards thus consumers were often left with little choice and instead had to pay with exact cash or personal checks thiel wanted to create a type of digital wallet in the hopes of ensuring more consumer convenience and security by encrypting data on digital devices and in  confinity launched paypal paypal promised to open up new possibilities for handling money and according to eric m jacksons account in his book the paypal wars thiel viewed paypals mission as liberating people throughout the world from the erosion of the value of their currencies due to inflation jackson recalls an inspirational speech by thiel in  were definitely onto something big the need paypal answers is monumental everyone in the world needs money – to get paid to trade to live paper money is an ancient technology and an inconvenient means of payment you can run out of it it wears out it can get lost or stolen in the twentyfirst century people need a form of money thats more convenient and secure something that can be accessed from anywhere with a pda or an internet connection of course what were calling convenient for american users will be revolutionary for the developing world many of these countries governments play fast and loose with their currencies they use inflation and sometimes wholesale currency devaluations like we saw in russia and several southeast asian countries last year referring to the  russian and  asian financial crisis to take wealth away from their citizens most of the ordinary people there never have an opportunity to open an offshore account or to get their hands on more than a few bills of a stable currency like us dollars eventually paypal will be able to change this in the future when we make our service available outside the us and as internet penetration continues to expand to all economic tiers of people paypal will give citizens worldwide more direct control over their currencies than they ever had before it will be nearly impossible for corrupt governments to steal wealth from their people through their old means because if they try the people will switch to dollars or pounds or yen in effect dumping the worthless local currency for something more secure when paypal launched at a successful press conference in  representatives from nokia and deutsche bank sent  million in venture funding to thiel using paypal on their palmpilots paypal then continued to grow through mergers with elon musk’s financial services company xcom and with pixo a company specializing in mobile commerce in  these mergers allowed paypal to expand into the wireless phone market and transformed it into a safer and more userfriendly tool by enabling users to transfer money via a free online registration and email rather than by exchanging bank account information by  paypal served over  million customers and had expanded its services to private consumers and businesses in twentysix countries paypal went public on february   and was sold to ebay for  billion in october of that year thiels  stake was worth  million at the time of the acquisition clarium capital further information clarium capital following paypals sale to ebay in  thiel devoted  million of his proceeds to establish clarium capital management a global macro hedge fund focusing on directional and liquid instruments in currencies interest rates commodities and equities thiel stated that the big macroeconomic idea that we had at clarium—the idée fixe—was the peakoil theory which was basically that the world was running out of oil and that there were no easy alternatives in  clarium capital reflected a return of  as thiel successfully bet that the united states dollar would

and remove this message thiel in  a devoted libertarian thiel expounded his views on the future of both the libertarian movement and politics in the united states in general in an article published by cato unbound on april   stating i remain committed to the faith of my teenage years to authentic human freedom as a precondition for the highest good i stand against confiscatory taxes totalitarian collectives and the ideology of the inevitability of the death of every individual for all these reasons i still call myself libertarian but i must confess that over the last two decades i have changed radically on the question of how to achieve these goals most importantly i no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible  the s were the last decade in american history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics since  the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of capitalist democracy into an oxymoron on september   thiel said at a  fundraiser for the american foundation for equal rights gay marriage can’t be a partisan issue because as long as there are partisan issues or cultural issues in this country you’ll have trench warfare like on the western front in world war i you’ll have lots of carnage and no progress in  he wrote an editorial in national review on the slowdown of technological progress and the state of modern western civilization most of our political leaders are not engineers or scientists and do not listen to engineers or scientists today a letter from einstein would get lost in the white house mail room and the manhattan project would not even get started it certainly could never be completed in three years i am not aware of a single political leader in the us either democrat or republican who would cut healthcare spending in order to free up money for biotechnology research — or more generally who would make serious cuts to the welfare state in order to free up serious money for major engineering projects men reached the moon in july  and woodstock began three weeks later with the benefit of hindsight we can see that this was when the hippies took over the country and when the true cultural war over progress was lost todays aged hippies no longer understand that there is a difference between the election of a black president and the creation of cheap solar energy in their minds the movement towards greater civil rights parallels general progress everywhere because of these ideological conflations and commitments the s progressive left cannot ask whether things actually might be getting worse in a  episode of conversations with bill kristol thiel spoke at length on what he sees to be a crisis in american higher education the university system in  its like the catholic church circa   you have this priestly class of professors that doesnt do very much work people are buying indulgences in the form of amassing enormous debt for the sort of the secular salvation that a diploma represents and what i think is also similar to the th century

frankfurt am main west germany on october   to susanne and klaus friedrich thiel the family migrated to the united states when peter was aged one and lived in cleveland where klaus worked as a chemical engineer klaus then worked for various mining companies which caused an itinerant upbringing for thiel and his younger brother patrick michael thiel thiels mother naturalized as a us citizen but his father did not before settling in foster city california in  the thiels had lived in south africa and southwest africa and peter had been forced to change elementary schools seven times one of peters elementary schools a strict establishment in swakopmund required students to wear uniforms and utilized corporal punishment such as striking students hands with a ruler for mistakes this experience instilled a distaste for uniformity and regimentation later reflected in thiels support for individualism and libertarianism as an adult in his youth thiel played dungeons  dragons was an avid reader of science fiction with isaac asimov and robert a heinlein among his favorite authors and a fan of j r r tolkiens works stating as an adult that he had read the lord of the rings over ten times during his childhood he has since founded  firms palantir technologies valar ventures mithril capital lembas llc rivendell llc and arda capital whose names originate from tolkien education in school thiel excelled in mathematics and scored first in a californiawide mathematics competition while attending middle school in san mateo at the san mateo high school he read ayn rand admired the optimism and anticommunism of thenpresident ronald reagan and was valedictorian of his graduating class in  after graduating from san mateo high school thiel went on to study philosophy at stanford university during thiels time at stanford debates on identity politics and political correctness were ongoing at the university and a western culture program which was criticized by the rainbow agenda because of a perceived overrepresentation of the achievements made by european men was replaced with a culture ideas and values course which instead pushed diversity and multiculturalism this replacement provoked controversy on the campus and led to thiel founding the stanford review a paper for conservative and libertarian viewpoints in  through the funding of irving kristol thiel served as the stanford reviews first editorinchief and remained in that post until he received his bachelor of arts in  at which point his friend david o sacks became the new editorinchief thiel then continued on to the stanford law school and acquired his doctor of jurisprudence in  while at stanford thiel encountered rené girard whose mimetic theory influenced him mimetic theory posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis and that imitation can engender pointless conflict girard notes the productive potential of competition it is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially if not individually acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another thiel applied this theory to his personal life and business ventures stating the big problem with competition is that it focuses us on the people around us and while we get better at the things were competing on we lose sight of anything thats important or transcendent or truly meaningful in our world career early career after graduating from the stanford law school thiel had interviews with supreme court justices antonin scalia and anthony kennedy after not being hired he instead took up a post as a judicial clerk for judge james larry edmondson of the united states court of appeals for the th circuit but soon moved to new york to work as a securities lawyer for sullivan  cromwell after seven months and three days he left the law firm citing a lack of transcendental value in his work he then took a job as a derivatives trader in currency options at credit suisse working there from  on while also operating as a speechwriter for formerunited states secretary of education william bennett before again feeling as though his work lacked meaningful value and returning to california in  upon returning to the bay area thiel noticed that the development of the internet and personal computer had already altered the economic landscape and the dotcom boom was well underway with financial support from friends and family he was able to raise  million toward the establishment of thiel capital management and embark on his venture capital career early on he experienced a setback after investing  in his friend luke noseks unsuccessful webbased calendar project however his luck changed when max levchin a friend of noseks introduced him to his cryptographyrelated company idea which later became their first venture called confinity in  paypal further information paypal § early history with confinity thiel realized they could develop a software to solve a gap in making online payments although the use of credit cards and expanding automated teller machine networks provided consumers with more available payment options not all merchants could gain the necessary hardware to accept credit cards thus consumers were often left with little choice and instead had to pay with exact cash or personal checks thiel wanted to create a type of digital wallet in the hopes of ensuring more consumer convenience and security by encrypting data on digital devices and in  confinity launched paypal paypal promised to open up new possibilities for handling money and according to eric m jacksons account in his book the paypal wars thiel viewed paypals mission as liberating people throughout the world from the erosion of the value of their currencies due to inflation jackson recalls an inspirational speech by thiel in  were definitely onto something big the need paypal answers is monumental everyone in the world needs money – to get paid to trade to live paper money is an ancient technology and an inconvenient means of payment you can run out of it it wears out it can get lost or stolen in the twentyfirst century people need a form of money thats more convenient and secure something that can be accessed from anywhere with a pda or an internet connection of course what were calling convenient for american users will be revolutionary for the developing world many of these countries governments play fast and loose with their currencies they use inflation and sometimes wholesale currency devaluations like we saw in russia and several southeast asian countries last year referring to the  russian and  asian financial crisis to take wealth away from their citizens most of the ordinary people there never have an opportunity to open an offshore account or to get their hands on more than a few bills of a stable currency like us dollars eventually paypal will be able to change this in the future when we make our service available outside the us and as internet penetration continues to expand to all economic tiers of people paypal will give citizens worldwide more direct control over their currencies than they ever had before it will be nearly impossible for corrupt governments to steal wealth from their people through their old means because if they try the people will switch to dollars or pounds or yen in effect dumping the worthless local currency for something more secure when paypal launched at a successful press conference in  representatives from nokia and deutsche bank sent  million in venture funding to thiel using paypal on their palmpilots paypal then continued to grow through mergers with elon musk’s financial services company xcom and with pixo a company specializing in mobile commerce in  these mergers allowed paypal to expand into the wireless phone market and transformed it into a safer and more userfriendly tool by enabling users to transfer money via a free online registration and email rather than by exchanging bank account information by  paypal served over  million customers and had expanded its services to private consumers

capital further information clarium capital following paypals sale to ebay in  thiel devoted  million of his proceeds to establish clarium capital management a global macro hedge fund focusing on directional and liquid instruments in currencies interest rates commodities and equities thiel stated that the big macroeconomic idea that we had at clarium—the idée fixe—was the peakoil theory which was basically that the world was running out of oil and that there were no easy alternatives in  clarium capital reflected a return of  as thiel successfully bet that the united states dollar would weaken in  thiel spoke of the dotcom bubble having migrated in effect into a growing bubble in the financial sector and specified general electric and walmart as vulnerable in  clarium saw a  return as thiel predicted that the dollar would rally this success saw clarium honored as global macro hedge fund of the year by marhedge and absolute return  alpha however clariums faltered in  with a  loss during this time the firm sought to profit in the longterm from its petrodollar analysis which foresaw the impending decline in oil supplies and the unsustainable bubble growing in the us housing market clariums assets under management indeed after achieving a  return in  grew to over  billion by  but plummeted as financial markets collapsed near the start of  by  after missing out on the economic rebound many key investors pulled out causing clariums assets to be valued at  million over half of which was thiels own money palantir further information palantir technologies in may  thiel incorporated palantir technologies a big data analysis company named after the tolkien artifact and continues to serves as its chairman as of  thiel stated that the idea for the company was based on the realization that the approaches that paypal had used to fight fraud could be extended into other contexts like fighting terrorism he also stated that after the september  attacks the debate in the united states was will we have more security with less privacy or less security with more privacy and saw palantir as being able to provide data mining services to government intelligence agencies which were maximally unintrusive and traceable at first palantirs only backers was the central intelligence agencys venture capital arm inqtel but the company steadily grew and in  was valued at

financial crisis in his book the facebook effect david kirkpatrick outlines how thiel came to make this investment napster cofounder sean parker who at the time had assumed the title of president of facebook was seeking investors for facebook parker approached reid hoffman the ceo of workbased social network linkedin hoffman liked facebook but declined to be the lead investor because of the potential for conflict of interest with his duties as linkedin ceo thus hoffman directed parker to thiel whom he knew from their paypal days thiel met parker and mark zuckerberg the harvard student who had founded facebook thiel and zuckerberg got along well and thiel agreed to lead facebooks seed round with  for  of the company the investment was originally in the form of a convertible note to be converted to equity if facebook reached  million users by the end of  although facebook narrowly missed the target thiel allowed the loan to be converted to equity anyway thiel said of his investment i was comfortable with them pursuing their original vision and it was a very reasonable valuation i thought it was going to be a pretty safe investment in september  thiel while expressing skepticism about the potential for growth in the consumer internet sector argued that relative to other internet companies facebook which then had a secondary market valuation of  billion was comparatively undervalued facebooks initial public offering was in may  with a market cap of nearly  billion  a share at which time thiel sold  million shares for  million in august  immediately upon

case it was law school which is the classic thing one does when one has no idea what else to do i don’t have any big regrets but if i had to do it over i would try to think more about the future than

and remove this message thiel in  a devoted libertarian thiel expounded his views on the future of both the libertarian movement and politics in the united states in general in an article published by cato unbound on april   stating i remain committed to the faith of my teenage years to authentic human freedom as a precondition for the highest good i stand against confiscatory taxes totalitarian collectives and the ideology of the inevitability of the death of every individual for all these reasons i still call myself libertarian but i must confess that over the last two decades i have changed radically on the question of how to achieve these goals most importantly i no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible  the s were the last decade in american history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics since  the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of capitalist democracy into an oxymoron on september   thiel said at a  fundraiser for the american foundation for equal rights gay marriage can’t be a partisan issue because as long as there are partisan issues or cultural issues in this country you’ll have trench warfare like on the western front in world war i you’ll have lots of carnage and no progress in  he wrote an editorial in national review on the slowdown of technological progress and the state of modern western civilization most of our political leaders are not engineers or scientists and do not listen to engineers or scientists today a letter from einstein would get lost in the white house mail room and the manhattan project would not even get started it certainly could never be completed in three years i am not aware of a single political leader in the us either democrat or republican who would cut healthcare spending in order to free up money for biotechnology research — or more generally who would make serious cuts to the welfare state in order to free up serious money for major engineering projects men reached the moon in july  and woodstock began three weeks later with the benefit of hindsight we can see that this was when the hippies took over the country and when the true cultural war over progress was lost todays aged hippies no longer understand that there is a difference between the election of a black president and the creation of cheap solar energy in their minds the movement towards greater civil rights parallels general progress everywhere because of these ideological conflations and commitments the s progressive left cannot ask whether things actually might be getting worse in a  episode of conversations with bill kristol thiel spoke at length on what he sees to be a crisis in american higher education the university system in  its like the catholic church circa   you have this priestly class of professors that doesnt do very much work people are buying indulgences in the form of amassing enormous debt for the sort of the secular salvation that a diploma represents and what i think is also similar to the th century

frankfurt am main west germany on october   to susanne and klaus friedrich thiel the family migrated to the united states when peter was aged one and lived in cleveland where klaus worked as a chemical engineer klaus then worked for various mining companies which caused an itinerant upbringing for thiel and his younger brother patrick michael thiel thiels mother naturalized as a us citizen but his father did not before settling in foster city california in  the thiels had lived in south africa and southwest africa and peter had been forced to change elementary schools seven times one of peters elementary schools a strict establishment in swakopmund required students to wear uniforms and utilized corporal punishment such as striking students hands with a ruler for mistakes this experience instilled a distaste for uniformity and regimentation later reflected in thiels support for individualism and libertarianism as an adult in his youth thiel played dungeons  dragons was an avid reader of science fiction with isaac asimov and robert a heinlein among his favorite authors and a fan of j r r tolkiens works stating as an adult that he had read the lord of the rings over ten times during his childhood he has since founded  firms palantir technologies valar ventures mithril capital lembas llc rivendell llc and arda capital whose names originate from tolkien education in school thiel excelled in mathematics and scored first in a californiawide mathematics competition while attending middle school in san mateo at the san mateo high school he read ayn rand admired the optimism and anticommunism of thenpresident ronald reagan and was valedictorian of his graduating class in  after graduating from san mateo high school thiel went on to study philosophy at stanford university during thiels time at stanford debates on identity politics and political correctness were ongoing at the university and a western culture program which was criticized by the rainbow agenda because of a perceived overrepresentation of the achievements made by european men was replaced with a culture ideas and values course which instead pushed diversity and multiculturalism this replacement provoked controversy on the campus and led to thiel founding the stanford review a paper for conservative and libertarian viewpoints in  through the funding of irving kristol thiel served as the stanford reviews first editorinchief and remained in that post until he received his bachelor of arts in  at which point his friend david o sacks became the new editorinchief thiel then continued on to the stanford law school and acquired his doctor of jurisprudence in  while at stanford thiel encountered rené girard whose mimetic theory influenced him mimetic theory posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis and that imitation can engender pointless conflict girard notes the productive potential of competition it is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially if not individually acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another thiel applied this theory to his personal life and business ventures stating the big problem with competition is that it focuses us on the people around us and while we get better at the things were competing on we lose sight of anything thats important or transcendent or truly meaningful in our world career early career after graduating from the stanford law school thiel had interviews with supreme court justices antonin scalia and anthony kennedy after not being hired he instead took up a post as a judicial clerk for judge james larry edmondson of the united states court of appeals for the th circuit but soon moved to new york to work as a securities lawyer for sullivan  cromwell after seven months and three days he left the law firm citing a lack of transcendental value in his work he then took a job as a derivatives trader in currency options at credit suisse working there from  on while also operating as a speechwriter for formerunited states secretary of education william bennett before again feeling as though his work lacked meaningful value and returning to california in  upon returning to the bay area thiel noticed that the development of the internet and personal computer had already altered the economic landscape and the dotcom boom was well underway with financial support from friends and family he was able to raise  million toward the establishment of thiel capital management and embark on his venture capital career early on he experienced a setback after investing  in his friend luke noseks unsuccessful webbased calendar project however his luck changed when max levchin a friend of noseks introduced him to his cryptographyrelated company idea which later became their first venture called confinity in  paypal further information paypal § early history with confinity thiel realized they could develop a software to solve a gap in making online payments although the use of credit cards and expanding automated teller machine networks provided consumers with more available payment options not all merchants could gain the necessary hardware to accept credit cards thus consumers were often left with little choice and instead had to pay with exact cash or personal checks thiel wanted to create a type of digital wallet in the hopes of ensuring more consumer convenience and security by encrypting data on digital devices and in  confinity launched paypal paypal promised to open up new possibilities for handling money and according to eric m jacksons account in his book the paypal wars thiel viewed paypals mission as liberating people throughout the world from the erosion of the value of their currencies due to inflation jackson recalls an inspirational speech by thiel in  were definitely onto something big the need paypal answers is monumental everyone in the world needs money – to get paid to trade to live paper money is an ancient technology and an inconvenient means of payment you can run out of it it wears out it can get lost or stolen in the twentyfirst century people need a form of money thats more convenient and secure something that can be accessed from anywhere with a pda or an internet connection of course what were calling convenient for american users will be revolutionary for the developing world many of these countries governments play fast and loose with their currencies they use inflation and sometimes wholesale currency devaluations like we saw in russia and several southeast asian countries last year referring to the  russian and  asian financial crisis to take wealth away from their citizens most of the ordinary people there never have an opportunity to open an offshore account or to get their hands on more than a few bills of a stable currency like us dollars eventually paypal will be able to change this in the future when we make our service available outside the us and as internet penetration continues to expand to all economic tiers of people paypal will give citizens worldwide more direct control over their currencies than they ever had before it will be nearly impossible for corrupt governments to steal wealth from their people through their old means because if they try the people will switch to dollars or pounds or yen in effect dumping the worthless local currency for something more secure when paypal launched at a successful press conference in  representatives from nokia and deutsche bank sent  million in venture funding to thiel using paypal on their palmpilots paypal then continued to grow through mergers with elon musk’s financial services company xcom and with pixo a company specializing in mobile commerce in  these mergers allowed paypal to expand into the wireless phone market and transformed it into a safer and more userfriendly tool by enabling users to transfer money via a free online registration and email rather than by exchanging bank account information by  paypal served over  million customers and had expanded its services to private consumers and businesses in twentysix countries paypal went public on february   and was sold to ebay for  billion in october of that year thiels  stake was worth  million at the time of the acquisition clarium capital further information clarium capital following paypals sale to ebay in  thiel devoted  million of his proceeds to establish clarium capital management a global macro hedge fund focusing on directional and liquid instruments in currencies interest rates commodities and equities thiel stated that the big macroeconomic idea that we had at clarium—the idée fixe—was the peakoil theory which was basically that the world was running out of oil and that there were no easy alternatives in  clarium capital reflected a return of  as thiel successfully bet that the united states dollar would weaken in  thiel spoke of the dotcom bubble having migrated in effect into a growing bubble in the financial sector and specified general electric and walmart as vulnerable in  clarium saw a  return as thiel predicted that the dollar would rally this success saw clarium honored as global macro hedge fund of the year by marhedge and absolute return  alpha however clariums faltered in  with a  loss during this time the firm sought to profit in the longterm from its petrodollar analysis which foresaw the impending decline in oil supplies and the unsustainable bubble growing in the us housing market clariums assets under management indeed after achieving a  return in  grew to over  billion by  but plummeted as financial markets collapsed near the start of  by  after missing out on the economic rebound many key investors pulled out causing clariums assets to be valued at  million over half of which was thiels own money palantir further information palantir technologies in may  thiel incorporated palantir technologies a big data analysis company named after the tolkien artifact and continues to serves as its chairman as of  thiel stated that the idea for the company was based on the realization that the approaches that paypal had used to fight fraud could be extended into other contexts like fighting terrorism he also stated that after the september  attacks the debate in the united states was will we have more security with less privacy or less security with more privacy and saw palantir as being able to provide data mining services to government intelligence agencies which were maximally unintrusive and traceable at first palantirs only backers was the central intelligence agencys venture capital arm inqtel but the company steadily grew and in  was valued at

and remove this message thiel in  a devoted libertarian thiel expounded his views on the future of both the libertarian movement and politics in the united states in general in an article published by cato unbound on april   stating i remain committed to the faith of my teenage years to authentic human freedom as a precondition for the highest good i stand against confiscatory taxes totalitarian collectives and the ideology of the inevitability of the death of every individual for all these reasons i still call myself libertarian but i must confess that over the last two decades i have changed radically on the question of how to achieve these goals most importantly i no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible  the s were the last decade in american history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics since  the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of capitalist democracy into an oxymoron on september   thiel said at a  fundraiser for the american foundation for equal rights gay marriage can’t be a partisan issue because as long as there are partisan issues or cultural issues in this country you’ll have trench warfare like on the western front in world war i you’ll have lots of carnage and no progress in  he wrote an editorial in national review on the slowdown of technological progress and the state of modern western civilization most of our political leaders are not engineers or scientists and do not listen to engineers or scientists today a letter from einstein would get lost in the white house mail room and the manhattan project would not even get started it certainly could never be completed in three years i am not aware of a single political leader in the us either democrat or republican who would cut healthcare spending in order to free up money for biotechnology research — or more generally who would make serious cuts to the welfare state in order to free up serious money for major engineering projects men reached the moon in july  and woodstock began three weeks later with the benefit of hindsight we can see that this was when the hippies took over the country and when the true cultural war over progress was lost todays aged hippies no longer understand that there is a difference between the election of a black president and the creation of cheap solar energy in their minds the movement towards greater civil rights parallels general progress everywhere because of these ideological conflations and commitments the s progressive left cannot ask whether things actually might be getting worse in a  episode of conversations with bill kristol thiel spoke at length on what he sees to be a crisis in american higher education the university system in  its like the catholic church circa   you have this priestly class of professors that doesnt do very much work people are buying indulgences in the form of amassing enormous debt for the sort of the secular salvation that a diploma represents and what i think is also similar to the th century

frankfurt am main west germany on october   to susanne and klaus friedrich thiel the family migrated to the united states when peter was aged one and lived in cleveland where klaus worked as a chemical engineer klaus then worked for various mining companies which caused an itinerant upbringing for thiel and his younger brother patrick michael thiel thiels mother naturalized as a us citizen but his father did not before settling in foster city california in  the thiels had lived in south africa and southwest africa and peter had been forced to change elementary schools seven times one of peters elementary schools a strict establishment in swakopmund required students to wear uniforms and utilized corporal punishment such as striking students hands with a ruler for mistakes this experience instilled a distaste for uniformity and regimentation later reflected in thiels support for individualism and libertarianism as an adult in his youth thiel played dungeons  dragons was an avid reader of science fiction with isaac asimov and robert a heinlein among his favorite authors and a fan of j r r tolkiens works stating as an adult that he had read the lord of the rings over ten times during his childhood he has since founded  firms palantir technologies valar ventures mithril capital lembas llc rivendell llc and arda capital whose names originate from tolkien education in school thiel excelled in mathematics and scored first in a californiawide mathematics competition while attending middle school in san mateo at the san mateo high school he read ayn rand admired the optimism and anticommunism of thenpresident ronald reagan and was valedictorian of his graduating class in  after graduating from san mateo high school thiel went on to study philosophy at stanford university during thiels time at stanford debates on identity politics and political correctness were ongoing at the university and a western culture program which was criticized by the rainbow agenda because of a perceived overrepresentation of the achievements made by european men was replaced with a culture ideas and values course which instead pushed diversity and multiculturalism this replacement provoked controversy on the campus and led to thiel founding the stanford review a paper for conservative and libertarian viewpoints in  through the funding of irving kristol thiel served as the stanford reviews first editorinchief and remained in that post until he received his bachelor of arts in  at which point his friend david o sacks became the new editorinchief thiel then continued on to the stanford law school and acquired his doctor of jurisprudence in  while at stanford thiel encountered rené girard whose mimetic theory influenced him mimetic theory posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis and that imitation can engender pointless conflict girard notes the productive potential of competition it is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially if not individually acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another thiel applied this theory to his personal life and business ventures stating the big problem with competition is that it focuses us on the people around us and while we get better at the things were competing on we lose sight of anything thats important or transcendent or truly meaningful in our world career early career after graduating from the stanford law school thiel had interviews with supreme court justices antonin scalia and anthony kennedy after not being hired he instead took up a post as a judicial clerk for judge james larry edmondson of the united states court of appeals for the th circuit but soon moved to new york

trader in currency options at credit suisse working there from  on while also operating as a speechwriter for formerunited states secretary of education william bennett before again feeling as though his work lacked meaningful value and returning to california in  upon returning to the bay area thiel noticed that the development of the internet and personal computer had already altered the economic landscape and the dotcom boom was well underway with financial support from friends and family he was able to raise  million toward the establishment of thiel capital management and embark on his venture capital career early on he experienced a setback after investing  in his friend luke noseks unsuccessful webbased calendar project however his luck changed when max levchin a friend of noseks introduced him to his cryptographyrelated company idea which later became their first venture called confinity in  paypal further information paypal § early history with confinity thiel realized they could develop a software to solve a gap in making online payments although the use of credit cards and expanding automated teller machine networks provided consumers with more available payment options not all merchants could gain the necessary hardware to accept credit cards thus consumers were often left with little choice and instead had to pay with exact cash or personal checks thiel wanted to create a type of digital wallet in the hopes of ensuring more consumer convenience and security by encrypting data on digital devices and in  confinity launched paypal paypal promised to open up new possibilities for handling money and according to eric m jacksons account in his book the paypal wars thiel viewed paypals mission as liberating people throughout the world from the erosion of the value of their currencies due to inflation jackson recalls an inspirational speech by thiel in  were definitely onto something big the need paypal answers is monumental everyone in the world needs money – to get paid to trade to live paper money is an ancient technology and an inconvenient means of payment you can run out of it it wears out it can get lost or stolen in the twentyfirst century people need a form of money thats more convenient and secure something that can be accessed from anywhere with a pda or an internet connection of course what were calling convenient for american users will be revolutionary for the developing world many of these countries governments play fast and loose with their currencies they use inflation and sometimes wholesale currency devaluations like we saw in russia and several southeast asian countries last year referring to the  russian and  asian financial crisis to take wealth away from their citizens most of the ordinary people there never have an opportunity to open an offshore account or to get their hands on more than a few bills of a stable currency like us dollars eventually paypal will be able to change this in the future when we make our service available outside the us and as internet penetration continues to expand to all economic tiers of people paypal will give citizens worldwide more direct control over their currencies than they ever had before it will be nearly impossible for corrupt governments to steal wealth from their people through their old means because if they try the people will switch to dollars or pounds or yen in effect dumping the worthless local currency for something more secure when paypal launched at a successful press conference in  representatives from nokia and deutsche bank sent  million in venture funding to thiel using paypal on their palmpilots paypal then continued to grow through mergers with elon musk’s financial services company xcom and with pixo a company specializing in mobile commerce in  these mergers allowed paypal to expand into the wireless phone market and transformed it into a safer and more userfriendly tool by enabling users to transfer money via a free online registration and email rather than by exchanging bank account information by  paypal served over  million customers and had expanded its services to private consumers

capital further information clarium capital following paypals sale to ebay in  thiel devoted  million of his proceeds to establish clarium capital management a global macro hedge fund focusing on

was basically that the world was running out of oil and that there were no easy alternatives in  clarium capital reflected a return of  as thiel successfully bet that the united states dollar would weaken in  thiel spoke of the dotcom bubble having migrated in effect into a growing bubble in the financial sector and specified general electric and walmart as vulnerable in  clarium saw a  return as thiel predicted that the dollar would rally this success saw clarium honored as global macro hedge fund of the year by marhedge and absolute return  alpha however clariums faltered in  with a  loss during this time the firm sought to profit in the longterm from its petrodollar analysis which foresaw the impending decline in oil supplies and the unsustainable bubble growing in the us housing

incorporated palantir technologies a big data analysis company named after the tolkien artifact and continues to serves as its chairman as of  thiel stated that the idea for the company was based on the realization that the approaches that paypal had used to fight fraud could be extended into other contexts like fighting terrorism he also stated that after the september  attacks the debate in the united states was will we have more security with less privacy or less security with more privacy and saw palantir as being able to provide data mining services to government intelligence agencies which were maximally unintrusive and traceable at first palantirs only backers was the central intelligence agencys venture capital arm inqtel but the company steadily grew and in  was valued at

investment i was comfortable with them pursuing their original vision and it was a very reasonable valuation i thought it was going to be a pretty safe investment in september  thiel while expressing skepticism about the potential for growth in the consumer internet sector argued that relative to other internet companies facebook which then had a secondary market valuation of  billion was comparatively undervalued facebooks initial public offering was in may  with a market cap of nearly  billion  a share at which time thiel sold  million shares for  million in august  immediately upon

and remove this message thiel in  a devoted libertarian thiel expounded his views on the future of both the libertarian movement and politics in the united states in general in an article published by cato unbound on april   stating i remain committed to the faith of my teenage years to authentic human freedom as a precondition for the highest good i stand against confiscatory taxes totalitarian collectives and the ideology of the inevitability of the death of every individual for all these reasons i still call myself libertarian but i must confess that over the last two decades i have changed radically on the question of how to achieve these goals most importantly i no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible  the s were the last decade in american history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics since  the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of capitalist democracy into an oxymoron on september   thiel said at a  fundraiser for the american foundation for equal rights gay marriage can’t be a partisan issue because as long as there are partisan issues or cultural issues in this country you’ll have trench warfare like on the western front in world war i you’ll have lots of carnage and no progress in  he wrote an editorial in national review on the slowdown of technological progress and the state of modern western civilization most of our political leaders are not engineers or scientists and do not listen to engineers or scientists today a letter from einstein would get lost in the white house mail room and the manhattan project would not even get started it certainly could never be completed in three years i am not aware of a single political leader in the us either democrat or republican who would cut healthcare spending in order to free up money for biotechnology research — or more generally who would make serious cuts to the welfare state in order to free up serious money for major engineering projects men reached the moon in july  and woodstock began three weeks later with the benefit of hindsight we can see that this was when the hippies took over the country and when the true cultural war over progress was lost todays aged hippies no longer understand that there is a difference between the election of a black president and the creation of cheap solar energy in their minds the movement towards greater civil rights parallels general progress everywhere because of these ideological conflations and commitments the s progressive left cannot ask whether things actually might be getting worse in a  episode of conversations with bill kristol thiel spoke at length on what he sees to be a crisis in american higher education the university system in  its like the catholic church circa   you have this priestly class of professors that doesnt do very much work people are buying indulgences in the form of amassing enormous debt for the sort of the secular salvation that a diploma represents and what i think is also similar to the th century

capitalist believes transfusions may hold the key to his dream of living forever by jeff bercovici jeff bercovici is the san francisco bureau chief of inc previously he held senior editorial positions at forbes aol and radar jeffbercovici san francisco bureau chief incjeffbercovici  comments peter thiel credit getty images more than anything peter thiel the billionaire technology investor and donald trump supporter wants to find a way to escape death hes channeled millions of dollars into startups working on antiaging medicine spends considerable time and money researching therapies for his personal use and believes society ought to open its mind to lifeextension methods that sound weird or unsavory speaking of weird and unsavory if theres one thing that really excites thiel its the prospect of having younger peoples blood transfused into his own veins that practice is known as parabiosis and according to thiel its a potential biological fountain of youththe closest thing science has discovered to an antiaging panacea research into parabiosis began in the s with crude experiments that involved cutting rats open and stitching their circulatory systems together after decades languishing on the fringes its recently started getting attention from mainstream researchers with multiple  clinical  trials underway in humans in the us and even more advanced studies in  china and  korea considering the sciencefiction promise of parabiosis the studies have received notably little fanfare but thiel has been watching closely thiel and ambrosia in monterey california about  miles from san francisco a company called ambrosia recently commenced one of the trials titled young donor plasma transfusion and agerelated biomarkers it has a simple protocol healthy participants aged  and older get a transfusion of blood plasma from donors under  and researchers monitor their blood over the next two years for molecular indicators of health and aging the study is patientfunded participants who range in age from late s through s must pay  to take part and live in or travel to monterey for treatments and followup assessments ambrosias founder the stanfordtrained physician jesse karmazin has been studying aging for more than a decade he became interested in launching a company around parabiosis after seeing impressive data from animals and studies conducted abroad in humans in one trial after another subjects experience a reversal of aging symptoms across every major organ system while the mechanisms at play arent totally understood he said young organisms blood not only contains all sorts of proteins that improve cell function somehow it also prompts the recipients body to increase its production of those proteins the effects seem to be almost permanent he says its almost like theres a resetting of gene expression while ambrosia advertised the study to attract participants it didnt seek broader coverage so karmazin was somewhat surprised to get a message from jason camm chief medical officer at thiel capital who expressed interest in what the company was doing karmazin said he hasnt reached out to any investors id really want to talk about what the business model would be although his linkedin profile identifies him as an angel investor thats not camms primary job an osteopath with a background in treating elite athletes camm is personal health director to peter thiel  and a number of other prominent silicon valley business leaders and investors according to his professional profile he enables his clients to make radical breakthroughs in their immediate daytoday health cognitive functioning and physical performance  all of which increase their prospects for optimal health and significant lifespan extension among his duties at thiel capital is this communicates with a number of the worlds best physicians health care professionals and researchers in the usa europe and the middle east on life extension optimizing blood markers and novel techniques to improve health  were a little too biased when i interviewed thiel a year ago about his investments in biotech and lifeextension medicine i asked him what health interventions he found compelling enough to incorporate in his own life there are all these things ive looked into doing i havent quite quite quite started yet he told me adding that he is always really uncomfortable giving general advice on this stuff i suspect were a little too biased against all these things in society he told me after briefly discussing the pros and cons of caloric restriction human growth hormone and the diabetes drug metformin thiel said this im not convinced yet weve found a single panacea that works its possible there exist singlepoint things that could work im looking into parabiosis stuff which i think is really interesting this is where they did the young blood into older mice and they found that had a massive rejuvenating effect and so thats  that is one that  again its one of these very odd things where people had done these studies in the s and then it got dropped altogether i think there are a lot of these things that have been strangely underexplored i followed up to ask if he meant parabiosis was really interesting as a business opportunity or a personalhealth treatment he made it clear he was talking about the latter that would be one where its more just do we think the science works some of these its not clear theres actually a great company to start around it it may just be its not necessarily patentable the parabiosis would not require  theres no fda approval needed because its just blood transfusions there are widespread rumors in silicon valley where lifeextension science is a popular obsession that various wealthy individuals from the tech world have already begun practicing parabiosis spending tens of thousands of dollars for the procedures and youngpersonblood and repeating the exercise several times a year in our april  interview thiel was seemingly explicit that parabiosis was something he hadnt quite quite quite started yet a thiel capital spokesman said nothing had changed since then offlabel blood and the fda anyone seeking to practice parabiosis privately would quickly encounter the question of where to obtain sufficient quantities of young peoples blood but human blood isnt available for purchase to just anybody a spokeswoman for the food and drug administration says the agency regulates the collection and manufacture of blood and blood components to help protect the health of the blood donor and to ensure the safety purity and potency of the blood product while its not approved specifically for antiaging treatments like other drugs it can be prescribed for socalled offlabel uses as long as there is no advertising or efficacy claims involved  clinical trials like ambrosias can get blood from blood banks fairly easily for that purpose but ambrosia is a forprofit company for it to begin selling transfusions as a service to patient clients like thiel it would presumably need to figure out a source other than nonprofit blood banks karmazin acknowledges the potential supply issue but notes that plasma is relatively abundant and has a twoyear shelf life he speculates that a surge of popular attention for parabiosis might inspire more blood donations by young donors whose blood tends to provide greater benefit when administered in more conventional therapeutic transfusions for thiel the day when technologies like parabiosis are not only clinically proven but socially accepted cant come soon enough after all hes not getting any younger published on aug   forbes welcomeclose more options quote of the day success is failure turned inside out if youre afraid

say that death is natural but it is also natural to fight death but if you stand up and say this is a big problem we should do something about this that makes people very uncomfortable because theyve made their peace with death peter thiel death peace fight the future is limitless peter thiel future limitless in a world where wealth is growing you can get away with printing money doubling the debt over the next  years is not a problem peter thiel money world problem in the s the keynesian stuff worked at least in the sense that you could print money without inflation because there was all this

successful entrepreneurs seem to be suffering from a mild form of aspergers where its like youre missing the imitation socialization gene peter thiel successful suffering you from my perspective i think the question of how we build a better future is an extremely important overarching question and i think its become obscured from us because we no longer think its possible to have a meaningful conversation about the future peter thiel future perspective better facebook succeeded because it was about real people having a presence on the internet there were all these other social networking sites people had but they were all about fictional people peter thiel networking people internet i think whats always important is not to be contrarian for its own sake but to really get at the truth
