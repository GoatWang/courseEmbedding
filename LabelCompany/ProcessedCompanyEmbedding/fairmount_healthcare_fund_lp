enterprise systems management information assurance network engineering and systems development and integration    cowen and company analysts commented ncit offers an attractive riskreward profile as its peerlow valuation x evebitda   fbr  co analysts commented we take a neutral perspective on nci shares for the time being although we are encouraged by the efforts that the company is taking to position itself for success in an evolving government it landscape ceo paul dillahay was appointed in october  and we believe he is taking steps to increase nci’s ability to capture new business given that we estimate that this company has a very strong recompete win rate the base upon which the team can build appears fairly stable that being said we think that the company has outsized dependence on a few larger contracts —like the peo soldier contract that we estimate accounted for  of revenue in —and there may be a nearterm sentiment overhang on the stock related to the recently disclosed alleged embezzlement by the former controller the company does have significant capabilities in agile software development and we believe management’s approach is inspired there could be an opportunity to become more constructive in the future but for the time being we think that remaining on the sidelines would be advisable  who are some of ncis key competitors some companies that are
