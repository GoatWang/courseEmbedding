scenarios where we sell various amounts of the shares since we are making this offering without any minimum requirement there is no guarantee that we will be successful at selling any of the securities being offered in this prospectus accordingly the actual amount of proceeds we will raise in this offering if any may differ none of the proceeds from this offering will be used to pay the salaries to our officers and directors percent of net proceeds received         shares sold     gross proceeds         less offering expenses             net offering proceeds         the use of

acquisition of other businesses at present no material changes are contemplated should there be any material changes in the projected use of proceeds in connection with this offering we will issue an amended prospectus reflecting the new uses in all instances after the effectiveness of this registration statement the company will need some amount of working capital to maintain its general

accounting auditing and transfer of agent fees the company recognizes that if it does not raise net proceeds of at least  in this offering it will have to seek additional funds to cover these expenses the  in net proceeds that we need to stay in business for twelve months is comprised of i  for existing liabilities ii  for web design and social media marketing expenses and iii  for sec reporting

be used to pay the offering expenses and no funds will be available for continuing to operate the company  raised  net  will enable the company to continue as a public company  raised  net  will enable the company to start initiating its business plan the company will fail if it does not raise a minimum of net proceeds of  and the director will not be able to fund the company in addition to changing allocations because of the amount of proceeds received we may change the use of proceeds because of required changes in our business plan investors should understand that we have wide discretion over the use of proceeds therefore management decisions may not be in line with the initial objectives of investors who will have little ability to influence these decisions there are two main areas of competition for the caleminder inc webbased calendar reminder service the first area includes greeting card manufacturers such as hallmark cards inc and american greetings corporation while both of these companies have websites that offer ecards otherwise known as electronic cards neither side offers the calendar functionality that we hope to include in our service while in the initial stages of development their sites are more developed and offer more customization of the cards being sent electronically our longrange plans also include extensive customization options in addition to these two major competitors there are a large number of websites in the greeting card industry in the united states ranging from small organizations to large national and international companies with the expansion of the internet as a distribution channel for greeting cards with digital photographs and other personalized content the competition has increased tremendously company description our company has developed a business plan for an online service that provides a calendar based greeting and reminder service to assist subscribers in remembering important life events such as birthdays anniversaries etc the company operates out of israel however the web application will be available worldwide users will register with the system and enter these important dates as well as configure a variety of settings including how they want to be notified for example by email or by text message or via facebook or other social media tools when they want to be notified for example one month prior two weeks prior one week prior etc the user can also designate contacts as belonging to specific user groups such as friends family professional contact these user groups will be customizable the content of the reminder can also be customized so that the user can either enter all the relevant details or leave the reminder cryptic so as not to alert others to the upcoming event many of the settings will be onetime preferences while other fields will need to be customized per reminder set a series of reports will be made available to the enduser to indicate what reminders are pending already sent etc because the website will run entirely on the cloud endusers will not be required to download any application the company plans to work with an outside web developer to create the programming back office and infrastructure as well as the look and feel of the website we plan to work with marketing and social media experts to determine the best way to promote the site and brand our offering we will also need to hire user interface experts to optimize the graphic user interface we plan to monetize the site through several means including topicbased advertisement local national global and corporate sponsors and more while the base service will be free to endusers additional forpay services will be added these will include not only the reminder messages that are free but the ability to configure automatic emails that will be sent on the day of the event – birthday anniversary etc to another person we believe we can create an interface that will enable the enduser to customize many factors within the notification we will offer the forpay users the opportunity to upload a video or tape an audio message that will be attached to the email or included in a link a full set of forpay enduser benefits will need to be discussed with the development agency we hire some of the initially planned features may need to be shifted to later development cycles certain features of the proposed services may not be developed without proper funding in the early stages we plan to develop templatelike options that enable a user to upload digital photographs logos etc to customize templates that can be saved and reused when needed each template will be created via a template editor ideally the template editor will have a graphic “what you see is what you get”

caleminder inc     notes to condensed financial statements march   unaudited   note  general organization and business   caleminder inc the “company” was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on may   the company has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations   the company’s sole operations since inception have been limited to the development of an online calendarbased greeting and reminder service in connection with the change in control described in note  below the company intends to become a vertically integrated producer and distributor of medicalgrade cannabis products however there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in executing its business plan   the company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the company’s business plan   note  summary of significant accounting practices   basis of accounting   the company’s condensed financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting the company has elected a december  fiscal year end   in the opinion of management the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of caleminder inc contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the company’s financial position as of march   and its results of operations and cash flows for the periods ended march   the accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with instructions to form q the results of operations for the periods ended march   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents   income taxes   a deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards deferred tax expense benefit results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment              when required the company records a liability for unrecognized tax positions defined as the aggregate tax effect of differences between positions taken on tax returns and the benefits recognized in the financial statements tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement no tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet this threshold the company has no uncertain tax positions that require the company to record a liability   the company recognizes penalties and interest associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and includes accrued interest and penalties with the related tax liability in the balance sheet the company had no accrued penalties and interest as of march     loss per share   the basic loss per share is calculated by dividing our net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year the diluted earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing our net loss by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity the company has not issued any potentially dilutive debt or equity securities   recently issued accounting pronouncements   the company does not believe that there are any new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations   note  income taxes   the company uses the liability method where deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes as of march   and  the company has incurred net losses and therefore has no tax liability the net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carryforward has been fully reserved as of march   the cumulative net operating loss carryforward is approximately  and will expire  years from the date the loss was incurred   note  stockholders’ deficit   authorized   the company is authorized to issue  shares of  par value common stock all common shares have equal voting rights are nonassessable and have one vote per share voting rights are not cumulative and therefore the holders of more than  of the common stock could if they choose to do so elect all of the directors of the company   issued and outstanding   on june   the company issued  common shares to its sole stockholder for cash consideration of  per share the proceeds of  were received on june     on february   the company issued  shares of common stock for  as per a registration statement filed with the sec at an offering price of  per share   note  going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern the company has no revenues and an accumulated deficit of approximately  this condition among others raises substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty   management is planning to raise funds through debt or equity offerings there is no guarantee that the company will be successful in these efforts              note  related party transactions   as of march   and december   loans from the company’s principal stockholder amounted to  and  respectively and represent working capital advances the loans are unsecured noninterest bearing and due on demand in connection with the change in control described in note  below the stockholder released the company from its obligations to repay these advances   note  subsequent events   change in control   on may   shira halperin the holder of  shares the “restricted shares” of common stock of the company representing  of the company’s outstanding shares sold all of such shares to certain third parties including i pure harvest cannabis producers inc a nevada corporation “pure harvest” which

the company’s operating expenses for the three months ended march   and  were  and  respectively the operating expenses primarily consisted of professional fees legal auditing and other consulting fees associated with sec compliance   we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses as a result we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability which may not

historically we have financed our cash flow and operations from the sale of common stock and loans from a related party  net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended march   and  was  and  respectively   we have not generated any revenue from our operations we will require additional funds to fully implement our plans these funds may be raised through equity financing debt financing or other sources which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our shares we currently do not have any arrangements for additional financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when required our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and generate revenue the issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution to our stockholders obtaining commercial loans assuming those loans would be available will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments   we will require additional funds to maintain our reporting status with the sec              going concern consideration   we have incurred net losses since our inception through march   totaling  and have completed only the preliminary stages of our business plan  we anticipate incurring additional losses before realizing any revenues and will depend on additional financing in order to meet our continuing obligations and ultimately to attain profitability  our ability to obtain additional financing whether through the issuance of additional equity or through the assumption of debt is uncertain  accordingly our independent auditors’ report on our annual financial statements for the year ended december   includes an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern including additional information contained in the notes to our financial statements describing the circumstances leading to this disclosure  the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the

the companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules ae and de as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and our management is required to apply their judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures based upon that evaluation the ceo concluded that as of march   the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the company files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms and that it is accumulated and communicated to management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   as a result of this evaluation management identified the following deficiencies which are deemed to be material weaknesses   · due to the size of the company there is a lack of segregation of duties which would allow for proper processing review and approval of transactions and events that have an impact on the company’s financial results · the company lacks a system to allow for the review and monitoring of internal control over financial reporting which would mitigate concerns related to management’s override of controls · the company lacks an independent audit committee which can provide oversight of management and the financial reporting process   changes in internal control over

such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including the company’s ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting   the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company our internal control system was designed to in general provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements but because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate   our management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december   the framework used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled “ internal control – integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on that assessment our management has determined that as of december   the company’s internal control over financial reporting was ineffective for the purposes for which it is intended   a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over our financial reporting as of december   the company determined that the following items constituted a material weakness     the company does not currently have an active chief financial officer to oversee the day to day transactions and operations which ensures the timely and accurate identification and reporting of all necessary transactions       the company does not have an independent audit committee that can review and approve significant transactions and the reporting process and provide independent oversight of the company       the company is dependent on related parties for funding and decision making which is provided on a very limited basis therefore accurate accounting record retention and financial disclosures are not performed in a timely and efficient manner   this annual report does not include an attestation report of the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting managements report was not subject to attestation by the companys registered public accounting firm as we are a smaller reporting
