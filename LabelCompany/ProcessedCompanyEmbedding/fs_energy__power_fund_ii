are some of the risks an investment in our common shares involves however you should carefully consider all of the information found in fseps annual report on form k and other reports filed with the sec because there is no public trading market for our common shares and we are not obligated to effectuate a liquidity event by a specified date it will be difficult for you to sell your common shares if you are able to sell your common shares before we complete a liquidity event it is likely that you will receive less than what you paid for them while we intend to conduct quarterly tender offers for our common shares only a limited number of our common shares will be eligible for repurchase and we may suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time our distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to us for investment any capital returned to shareholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses an investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges including the lack of available information about these companies investing in middle market companies involves a number of significant risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results a lack of liquidity in certain of our investments may adversely affect our business we are subject to financial market risks including changes in interest rates which may have a substantial negative impact on our investments we have borrowed funds to make investments which increases the volatility of our investments and may increase the risks of investing in our securities fsep is a

gross income of at least  or ii a net worth of at least  some states such as kansas impose higher suitability standards please consult the prospectus for a detailed description of the suitability

expenses including through the waiver of certain investment advisory fees that are subject to repayment to our affiliate fs investments and our future distributions may be funded from such waivers and reimbursements significant portions of these distributions may not be based on our investment performance and such waivers and reimbursements by fs investments may not continue in the future if fs investments had not agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses including through the waiver of certain advisory fees significant portions of these distributions may come from offering proceeds or

investment product fs energy and power fund  white securities lawwhite securities law  securities fraud attorneys and finra arbitration lawyers menu september   comments  current investigations alternative investment product fs energy and power fund last updated on march  have you suffered investment losses in fs energy  power fund fsep ii if so the white law group may be able to help you recover your losses by filing a finra dispute resolution claim against the brokerage firm that sold you the investment fs energy  power fund fsep ii is a nontraded business development company bdc designed to provide investors a combination of income growth and diversification by investing primarily in the debt and incomeoriented securities of private us energy and power companies it is an investment offered by franklin square capital partners on september   fs energy and power fund increased its public offering price in accordance with its share pricing policy to  per share from  per share  the increase in the offering price is effective as of september   according to their website franklin square capital partners gives investors access to alternative asset classes strategies and asset managers that typically have been available to only the largest institutional investors franklin square often raises money for investments through reg d private placement offerings like the company did for fs energy  power fund  these reg d private placements are then typically sold by brokerage firms in exchange for a large up front commission usually between  as well as additional “due diligence fees” that can range from  the trouble with alternative investment products like fs energy  power fund and other similar bdcs is that they involve a high degree of risk and are typically sold as unregistered securities which lack the same regulatory oversight as more traditional investment products like stocks or bonds the white law group is investigating the liability that brokerage firms may have for improperly selling bdcs like fs energy  power fund broker dealers that sell alternative investments are required to perform adequate due diligence on all investment recommendations to ensure that each investment recommendation that is made is suitable for the investor in light of the investor’s age risk tolerance net worth financial needs and investment experience however another problem with reg d private placements is that the high sales commissions and due diligence fees the brokers earn for selling such products sometimes can provide brokers with an enormous incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors who do not fully understand the risks of these types of investments or to outright misrepresent the basic features of the products – usually focusing on the income potential and tax benefits while downplaying the risks fortunately finra does provide for an arbitration forum for investors to resolve such disputes and if a broker or brokerage firm makes an unsuitable investment recommendation or fails to adequately disclose the risks associated with an investment they may be found liable for investment losses in a finra arbitration claim to determine whether you may be able to recover investment losses incurred as a result of your purchase of fs energy  power fund or another franklin square bdc please contact the
