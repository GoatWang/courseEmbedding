polyxen™ platform technology to conjugate polysialic acid to therapeutic bloodclotting factors    lexington ma – may   – xenetic biosciences inc  nasdaq xbio “xenetic” or the “company” a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery research and development of nextgeneration biologic drugs and novel orphan oncology therapeutics announced today that it has received an update on the phase  clinical study conducted by its partner shire evaluating shp “psarecombinant factor viii” “psarfviii” which is being developed as a longacting therapeutic for the treatment of hemophilia a utilizing xenetics polyxen™ platform technology to conjugate polysialic acid to therapeutic bloodclotting factors the phase  study demonstrated shp’s efficacy and pharmacokinetic data commensurate with the profile of an extended halflife rfviii product additionally there were no drugrelated adverse events serious adverse events or rfviii inhibitors reported however in this study a predefined onceweekly dosing criterion was not met    “despite not achieving the principal objective of onceweekly dosing in this phase  study our polyxen technology clearly works as a platform to successfully extend the circulating halflife of rfviii with no drugrelated serious adverse events” stated m scott maguire xenetic’s chief executive officer   “including our own studies with a polysialylated erythropoietin “psaepo” “erepoxen®” candidate this is the second instance in which polyxen has been demonstrated in a human clinical trial setting to confer extended halflife to a biotherapeutic while maintaining pharmacological activity and a favorable safety and tolerability profile moving forward we believe data from shire’s shp program continues to support the broad utility of our proprietary polyxen technology platform and we remain focused on building a growing pipeline of partnerships utilizing this proven platform we truly value our continuing relationship with shire and look forward to exploring other potential applications of polyxen within the shire portfolio” added mr maguire   “while shire is disappointed by this outcome the company is encouraged by the knowledge gained through this research and remains committed to transforming the treatment landscape for patients with bleeding disorders  given the potential application of polysialic acid technology the companies will explore future collaborations” stated philip vickers phd global head of research  development at shire   about polyxen™   polyxen™ is a patentprotected platform technology for creating proprietary nextgeneration protein therapeutics by attaching polysialic acid “psa” a biodegradable polymer found in living systems to existing protein or peptide therapeutics which can improve their pharmacological properties   attachment of psa “polysialylation” to a therapeutic increases its apparent size which reduces systemic clearance rates while shielding the protein from other degradation pathways the polyxen platform permits optimization of a target therapeutic’s pharmacological properties by controlling the amount size and sites of attachment of the psa polymers   in clinical and preclinical settings therapeutic proteins polysialylated with the polyxen™ platform have been shown to have extended circulating halflife improved thermodynamic stability and resistance to proteases while retaining pharmacological activity numerous human clinical trials to date have shown no evidence of psa induced immunogenicity                  about xenetic biosciences   xenetic biosciences inc is a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery research and development of nextgeneration biologic drugs and novel orphan oncology therapeutics xenetics proprietary drug development platforms include polyxen™ which enables nextgeneration biologic drugs by improving their halflife and other pharmacological properties xenetics lead investigational product candidates

the properties of the human histone h h for the development of drug candidates for the treatment of a range of cancer indications oncohist is based on a molecule occurring naturally in the human body
