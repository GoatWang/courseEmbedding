request has been denied canadian supreme court justice ronald mckinnon who oversaw the extradition hearing commented on the arrest saying it is simply not done in a civilized jurisdiction that is

involvement in censorship in the peoples republic of china according to author ethan gutmann cisco and other telecommunications equipment providers supplied the chinese government with surveillance and internet infrastructure equipment that is used to block internet websites and track online activities in china cisco says that it does not customize or develop specialized or unique filtering capabilities to enable governments to block access to information and that it sells the same equipment in china as it sells worldwide wired news had uncovered a leaked confidential cisco powerpoint presentation that details the commercial opportunities of the golden shield project of internet control in her article journalist sarah stirland accuses cisco of marketing its technology specifically as a tool of repression in may  a group of falun gong practitioners filed the lawsuit under the alien tort statute alleging that cisco knowingly developed and customized its product to assist the chinese government in prosecution and abuse of falun gong practitioners the presentation leaked from cisco lists combat falun gong evil religion and other hostiles as one of the benefits of the cisco

networking equipment in may  cisco accused the person who filed the antitrust suit britishnigerian technology entrepreneur peter alfredadekeye with hacking and pressured the us government to extradite him from canada alfredadekeye was arrested while in the middle of testifying against cisco in an antitrust hearing although he was released after  days on bail the case has stretched for a year because the us attorneys office was unable to present the evidence required for the extradition the antitrust lawsuit has been settled  months after alfredadekeyes arrest in may  the us extradition request has been denied canadian supreme court justice ronald mckinnon who oversaw the extradition hearing commented on the arrest saying it is simply not done in a civilized jurisdiction that is bound by the rule of law he also stated that the real reason for the extradition proceedings was because alfredadekeye dared to take on a multinational giant judge mckinnon has also condemned the us prosecutor for hiding the fact that alfredadekeye was in legal proceedings against cisco systems for stating that alfredadekeye had left the usa in a time period when he had not and a formal request for extradition was not filed against alfredadekeye when he was taken into custody he described the information provided by cisco and the us prosecutor as full of innuendo halftruths and falsehoods adding that this speaks volumes for ciscos duplicity and accused them of unmitigated gall in using such a heavyhanded move as an unsupportable arrest and jailing to pressure alfredadekeye to drop or settle his civil antitrust complaint this case was eventually settled out of court and dismissed with prejudice in february  in march  multiven filed a complaint both in switzerland and the us

control at multiven’ downloaded and ‘stole’ cisco software five times in  from ciscocom  using this lie to orchestrate his illegal arrest in vancouver canada in  and  continuing to knowingly propagate this falsehood till today remotely monitoring users connections ciscos linksys e e e devices have been reported to be remotely updated to a firmware version that forces users to register for a cloud
