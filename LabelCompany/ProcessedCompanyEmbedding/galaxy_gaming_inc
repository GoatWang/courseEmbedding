develops innovative and enhanced electronic wagering platforms such as its bonus jackpot system galaxy gaming distributes its products to casinos throughout north america and on cruise ships worldwide casinos use proprietary table games and bonus jackpot products in lieu of those available in the public domain eg blackjack craps roulette etc because of their popularity with players and because the

public speaker having served as a keynote speaker and panelist for numerous trade organizations and conventions including the annual global gaming expo mr saucier resides in las vegas gaming otc bb glxz galaxy gaming inc  o�bannon drive las vegas nv  phone    interview conducted by lynn fosse senior editor ceocfointerviewscom published � october     ceocfo mr saucier how was it that you started galaxy gaming mr saucier galaxy gaming started out as almost an accident i used to own a small casino and i ended up creating a side bet for blackjack that became very popular with our players and financially very profitable for our casino as a result of the success we were having our competitors sought to have our product added to the blackjack games in their casinos as well so it became the a �tail that wags the dog� story the demand for this product by both players and casinos kept growing and growing and that was the beginning of galaxy gaming it really was not planned it was the result of a pleasant accidental surprise   ceocfo what is galaxy gaming all about today mr saucier we provide table games and electronic enhancements for casinos throughout north america on cruise ships worldwide   ceocfo will you tell us more about the casino table game industry particularly the growth trends mr saucier  in the �s and �s casino table games were king slot machines had very little impact on the casino industry but were provided mainly to give spouses something to do while the men played table games eventually however slots became more prominent and the percentage of floor space they occupied increased over table games this trend seemed to be endless at least in north america anyway but several events kept table games a very important component of the gaming floor   first proprietary table games were invented back in about  when a new casino table game called �caribbean stud� was introduced the game featured a progressive jackpot prize that progressively grew with each wager placed it was like a mini lottery on the table game for one dollar a player could potentially win hundreds of thousands of dollars the game became a hit and casinos all over the world couldn�t wait to have it because of the huge player demand caribbean stud made its owners extremely wealthy and the table game gold rush was on   second table games had a resurgence about ten to twelve years ago we first noticed a change at the hard rock hotel and casino in las vegas obviously the hard rock caters to a younger crowd and they prefer the live human interaction of table games compared to merely depositing their money into a computer   third table games received another boost a little over six years ago when the poker craze took off on television although that primarily affected live poker rooms collaterally that trend also benefited casino table games sort of a �rising tide lifting all boats� equation   finally the expansion of gaming in the asian markets has drastically increased the popularity of table games in those markets such as macau slot machines are insignificant compared to the live table game play   ceocfo tell us specifically about your games and other products mr saucier we divide the proprietary table games we provide into two classifications one is what we refer to as a side bet which is an additional bet on a game that is in the public domain for example a separate wager made in the game of blackjack the other type is what we refer to as standalone premium games these are unique games in and of themselves an example of a game like that is the table game known as texas shootout which is a casino variation of texas hold�em   in addition to our proprietary games we also have electronic enhancements for table games one such enhancement is our bonus jackpot system where players while they are playing table games can participate in an electronic bonusing platform where they can win a very substantial jackpot for maybe as little as a dollar   ceocfo who is doing the inventing mr saucier since we have an extensive and growing distribution system we see at least  new games a year that come to us from inventors who demonstrate different games that they have invented most of those will never see the inside of a casino but there are many people with many ideas mainly however we develop our own games internally and i lead our game development team   ceocfo how do you go from concept to finished product mr saucier if we develop a new game and feel good about it we brand it and give it a name we work on the graphics both in terms of the logo and how it is going to actually play on the table surface once we have that and feel good about it then one of the things that we will do is file a patent application to see if we can protect the concept with a patent we also have a mathematical analysis done on it we first do it internally then go outside and get one or more mathematical analysis done so that we understand what the house advantages of the game are and how the game will play out once we have all of that done we then go to some of our existing casino clients who we know like to experiment with new games from their feedback and our own observations we rate the game�s popularity with players and the profitability of the game   ceocfo what is your revenue model for these games and products are they sold outright or do they compliment your recurring revenue model mr saucier the short answer is both and i do not mean not �either  or� let me explain this most of us are familiar with the classic �razor blade� example of giving away the razor so that you can sell the blades in galaxy gaming�s case and with our products and particularly the bonus jackpot system we have an unusual opportunity to sell both the razors and the blades casinos purchase the equipment they need from us but then they also pay us monthly fees for its use   for example with our proprietary games a casino will agree to pay us a fixed amount per month such as  per table per month plus when our electronic enhancements are used the company receives additional recurring revenue as well in direct proportion to the game�s performance we refer to this as �performance based pricing� whereby we get a fee for every wager a player places so the better our game does the greater the fee we receive   ceocfo will people go to a particular casino because of the variety mr saucier the answer is yes people will go to a certain casino because games exist there that do not exist in other casinos the reason people gamble in the first place is because they have to have a belief that at times they can beat the casinos over the long run people know that they can�t but from time to time they may be able to so if they see a new game and they think they have it figured out how to win at it then that will attract them to that particular game   ceocfo what is your geographic reach mr saucier roughly we last counted about  casinos who are galaxy gaming clients they are located throughout north america and on cruise ships worldwide we do plan to expand into europe asia and throughout the globe in the coming years   ceocfo is it casino by casino a chain of casinos or line of cruise ships how does it work mr saucier both but generally speaking it is casino by casino for example even though we may have national agreements with major gaming corporations such as harrah�s each casino makes its own decision as to which games they would like to put in however we also have other clients such as cruise ships whereby the cruise ship corporation will make the decision to put the product in on all of their ships   ceocfo what has changed for you in the current economy mr saucier the positive effect is that our products are in higher demand now than they were before particularly in a down economy casinos have a need to make more money since we don�t require a large capital expenditure and we can immediately improve the bottom line for casinos they are very attentive to the types of products we offer it is significant to note that the last time we experienced this level of growth was during the months that followed the tragedies of september th   so from that standpoint the recession has been good for us as our recurring revenues have been growing significantly for example the revenues we posted in the st and nd quarters represent a  and  increase respectively over the same quarters a year ago we estimate our rd quarter revenues to exceed  growth so that part of our business has been excellent   the negative effect that the economy has had on us particularly for a small company like ours is reduced access to capital but we are fortunate in that we are cash flowing so we don�t need capital to sustain our operations however to be able to grow or take advantage perhaps of acquisition opportunities we need capital and the access to capital is very difficult right now in today�s financial market place in spite of this we have been successful in attracting new capital to our company and a recent offering we completed was oversubscribed so it can be done its just a lot harder in this economy   ceocfo what is the competitive landscape are there many companies coming out with new ideas or is it a limited field mr saucier actually it is quite limited it used to be greater but there have been a number of mergers and acquisitions the industry is dominated by shuffle master and they are the largest company in the space we are the second largest company in the space and then below that there are maybe about ten or twelve small to mediumsize companies with only one other one that is a public company   ceocfo what is ahead for galaxy mr saucier we have some exciting new products that i just can�t wait to come out i�d love to talk about them but i�m sure you understand why for legal and competitive reasons i can�t yet but here is one clue the bonus jackpot system that i mention previously is continually evolving so we are doing new versions of it   the bonus jackpot system is really our big story for  and beyond we just released it in march of this year and we limited its distribution to one trial market which was washington state we did that with the intent to gain an understanding of the product and to experience its reliability and determine field service requirements our goal was to get it in the field for about six months and get about  units out before we started to go into other jurisdictions now that we have accomplished those goals we are now negotiating with other jurisdictions and plan on spreading our bonus jackpot system throughout north america and on cruise ships eventually we intend on expanding globally   ceocfo you recently became a public company why was this the time mr saucier i can�t say that we specifically picked this time other than it was a long process that had begun several years earlier it just so happens that we became public in what is probably the worst recession in history but from that standpoint our investors are very pleased if you are going to invest into a company everybody knows the goal is to buy low and sell high so from that standpoint there is probably no better time than now for an investor to invest in a company like ours valuations over all are low but the import thing to consider is to find quality and to separate those companies that you think will do well versus those that won�t prosper or even survive as a result our investors are very pleased since we are doing very well in tough times and will do even better as we all pull out of this recession that is why i think galaxy gaming represents a great opportunity for investors at this time   ceocfo haven�t you recently expanded your sales force mr saucier yes and we intend on expanding it further in the future our primary use of proceeds for any funds that we might raise and in fact our primary strategies to rapidly grow our company is to expand our sales force and distribution networks and escalate our research development and engineering   ceocfo would you address potential investors there are so many companies to choose from why pick galaxy gaming out of the crowd mr saucier the first thing that people get excited about with our company is that our revenues are high margin recurring revenues typically our recurring revenues are  or more of our total revenues and they represent very high margins that is something that most investors get thrilled about because there is a lot of stability in a revenue model like that second of all is that we have shown phenomenal growth throughout the recession and really without attracting much in the way of outside capital so once we get out of the recession our company should do extremely well because we have proven how well we can do in the tough times plus we now have the ability to raise some capital to fuel our expansion   also we have been in business for twelve years so whatever was going to kill us probably would have done so by now we are a very stable and solid company with an excellent management team and a great reputation in the industry   ceocfo final thoughts what should people remember most when they read about galaxy gaming mr saucier to our clients we treat them with the utmost of respect and we have a tremendous reputation among our clients for our fairness and quality of service to our investors all of us here are striving to make their decision to invest in galaxy gaming the best investment
