fastestgrowing and most significant disease burdens among industrialized societies new treatment options are needed to prevent progression of disease and loss of pancreatic function in type  diabetic patients system inflammation inflammatory cells infiltrate white adipose tissue and the pancreas resulting in the development of insulin resistance and loss of insulin production respectively when inflammation makes adipose cells insensitive to insulin they can no longer take up sugar making control of blood sugar levels difficult pancreatitis acute inflammation of the pancreas the pancreas can initially compensate for reduced insulin sensitivity by increasing output of insulin however this increased load results in stress on the pancreas and an inflammatory process can ensue in the pancreas itself current drugs such as linagliptin worsen this process by stimulating the pancreas to produce insulin and furthering stress on the pancreas xbiotech antibody therapy the mechanism of action of
