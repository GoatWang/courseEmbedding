the company measures performance and helps clients improve and strengthen their market positions and identify opportunities for profitable growth with the use of its deep data assets and rich insights what consumers buyedit nielsens buy segment approx  of global revenues primarily helps packaged goods companies and retailers and wall street analysts understand what consumers are buying in terms of categories brands and products the company’s aim is to measure all consumer purchases as buying behavior continues to fragment across channels and segments for example it is nielsens data that measures how much diet coke vs diet pepsi is sold in stores or how much crest versus colgate toothpaste is sold nielsen accomplishes this by purchasing and analyzing huge amounts of retail data that measures what is being sold in the store and then combines it with household panel data that captures everything that is brought into the home these measures of sales performance also fuel a range of forwardlooking analytics to help clients improve the precision and efficiency of their advertising spending maximize the impact of their promotion budgets and optimize their product assortment they also can provide insights into how changes in product offerings pricing or marketing would change sales major clients include the cocacola company nestlé sa the procter  gamble company unilever group and walmart while the united states is the company’s largest market nielsen is a global company in the buy business it covers  countries representing more than  of the world’s population what

with coining this business term radio and televisionedit in  arthur c nielsen acquired the audimeter which measured which radio stations a radio had been tuned to during the day after tinkering with the device for a few years the company created a national radio rating service in  the company collected information on which stations were tuned to in  homes then this survey data was sold to
