diagnosis then surgery which i was burned on accident ndrd degree three half dollar sizes burns on my arm i spent my whole summer doing wound care on my already disabled arm which kept me the whole summer from doing what i should of been doing so from going from all of that to finally healing and getting to go back to work after  months i worked a total of  days before my reconstruction days later after reconstruction i couldnt walk or hold my bladder my oncologist ordered a pet scan a week right before thanksgiving what we saw was unbelieveable so bad she wanted to admit me that night im like hell no im going home to my family the cancer has spread to most of my organs and bones im still shocked im alive by just hearing statistic and time given to live its all so scary then  weeks later my breast leaking and getting infected and them having to cut it off again literally cut it off and leave  i wanted both removed my last freaking wish and they would only take  so my reasoning for the go fund me  is to get me  out of bed to live the rest of my days traveling to see friends and family i would also  love a wedding reception and a honneymoon  pay bills funeral costs gas
