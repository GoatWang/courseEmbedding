of what linkedin members have to say about johnit is my pleasure to write this recommendation for john pinkerton who joined atc technology corporation in february  john as the cfo was my partner in running the business daytoday in so many ways john was the backbone of the atc financial function and i can think of no higher compliment to pay to him i have worked with many financial professionals during the course of my career and i can state objectively that few matched the skill level that john possesses as a company we always took pride in the quality and timeliness of our financial reporting actually receiving accolades from the street for same this is in large measure to john’s credit i could rely on whatever set of financials john developed—each time and without question he developed an intimate knowledge of atc’s businesses with a thorough understanding of the factors that drove the financials this was invaluable to me in being able to sucessfully run our businesses john developed financial models that would be the envy of any company and had a mastery of the puts and takes that drove changes to our financials like no other cfo with whom i have collaborated he drove the budgeting process was vital to our ma reviews developed our secmandated reports and just overall knew the story behind every critical number atc reported john is a topnotch professional suffice to say i am grateful to john for his professional service to atc and feel solidly confident in my recommendation of him for another cfo position any organization would be proud to call john its cfo just as atc was todd peterssee moresee lessjohn made it a point to give his full attention to his colleagues when asked and was always generous in spending his time to discuss issues that would arise he has an outstanding grasp of accounting principles and a knack for understanding the true nature of business issues which helped to speed along the process of resolving complex
