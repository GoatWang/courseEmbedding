assets during fund i meaning we had to be patient and come up with different ways to create value ultimately we built a number of core infrastructure assets such as the carlsbad california

investor support for our second fund and we look forward to pursuing the attractive opportunities we see for fund ii” michael dorrell stonepeak cofounder and senior managing director stated “we have witnessed a twospeed financial market over the past six months with cracks in energy power and highyield credit on the onehand and strength until very recently in broader equity markets on the other we are pleased to be entering this market with significant capital where high quality infrastructure businesses are facing capital shortages due to market dislocation it is becoming a good time to invest in operating infrastructure businesses and if cracks continue to widen the situation for our investors will improve accordingly we have the right sized team and fund to continue to deploy capital and work with management teams to drive increased value post investment ” the majority of the capital commitments to fund ii came from investors who also participated in fund i stonepeak is extremely appreciative of the strong support that fund ii received from investors stonepeak believes that the size of fund ii aligns well with the investment opportunities before it and with the
