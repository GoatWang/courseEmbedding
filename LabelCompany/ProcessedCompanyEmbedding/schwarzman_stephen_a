reading the main story photo stephen schwarzman the chief executive of blackstone at the white house on friday with president trump credit al dragothe new york times for devotees of president trump the first gathering on friday of his business council which featured  executives may have looked like a colorized version of “mr smith goes to washington” but for those focusing exclusively on the rapport between the two leaders it resembled “goodfellas”sitting alongside mr trump was the head of the council stephen schwarzman the chief executive of the private equity firm blackstone group wearing washington’s newly obligatory red tie since its founding in  blackstone has accumulated more than  billion in assets and made mr schwartzman a fortune estimated at  billion — a figure that no doubt dwarfs whatever it is that mr trump is worth in  mr schwarzman was paid  millionmr schwarzman has flourished during the four decades that the people mr trump purports to represent have languished in the pursuit once known as leveraged buyouts — before some marketing genius fastened on “private equity” as a way to disguise the fact that the business still rests on a mountain of debt — mr schwarzman and his brethren have become symbols for the economic inequality that mr trump deplored during his campaign they are able to borrow billions and deduct interest payments from their corporate tax bills while ayear wage earners in ohio michigan or pennsylvania are unable to secure a mortgage and get no tax break on their monthly rent advertisement continue reading the main story just like mr trump’s realestate business groups like blackstone rely on enormous debt to prop up their business the playbook for any of their acquisitions is to gain  percent control by financing the purchase of a company with a small down payment and a heap of debt secured not heaven forbid by their own savings or houses but by the business they are looking to acquire they then cut costs — which almost always means making sizable layoffs at the company they’re taking over — and figure out a way to reward themselves financially continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the

us anytime perhaps after friday’s meeting traveling together aboard air force one to mr trump’s club in florida mr schwarzman explained to mr trump that he could make america great again by employing the same tactics blackstone used after its  billion acquisition in  of travelport a travelreservations business that within a year of the purchase had laid off  workers or  percent of its work forcethe story of this fiasco is enough to make anyone weep laidoff workers were forced to sell their homes others lost their health insurance and postponed plans to start a family some were stuck on unemployment lines even more brazenly blackstone seven months after its investment layered more debt on travelport which it used to pay itself back for the original purchase travelport subsequently underwent two restructurings of its debtfirms like blackstone will with a straight face argue that they are making american companies more efficient and that we are all better off as a result were that it were so they do not advertise the fact that their principals benefit from an indefensible quirk in the united states tax code that allows them to pay lower taxes on their capital gains i also benefit from this quirk albeit in a very different capacity as an investor in silicon valley i should stress that the opinions expressed in this piece don’t necessarily reflect those of sequoia

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a
