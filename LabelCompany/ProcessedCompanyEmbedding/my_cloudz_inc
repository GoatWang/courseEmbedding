officer has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on form q our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae or de under the exchange act were not effective as reported in our registration statement on form s which included our financial statements for the period from inception on july   through august   the company’s principal executive and financial officer has determined that there are material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures the material weaknesses in our disclosure control procedures are as follows  lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions the company utilizes a third party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements although our management reviews the financial statements and footnotes we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions the third party independent contractor is not involved in the dayto day operations of the company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reportingconsideration of certain transactions audit committee and financial expert the company does not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert and thus the company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting process   table of contents we intend to initiate measures to remediate the identified material weaknesses including but not necessarily limited to the following  ·establishing a formal review process of significant accounting transactions that includes participation of the principal executive officer the principal financial officer and the company’s corporate legal counsel  ·form an audit committee that will establish policies and procedures that will provide the board of directors a formal review process that will among other things

preparation of our financial statements providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected as reported in our registration statement on form s which included our financial statements for the period from inception on july   through august   management is aware that there is a significant deficiency and a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and therefore has concluded that the company’s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of may   the significant deficiency relates to a lack of segregation of duties due to the small number of employees involvement with general administrative and financial matters the material weakness relates to a lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended may   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting   table of contents part ii  other
