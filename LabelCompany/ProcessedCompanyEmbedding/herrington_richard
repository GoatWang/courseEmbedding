required field submit comment  out of  perfect safety product this is the best door jamming product that i have found small size allows you to pack it easily but works like a giant i would recommend this product by william s on february    pm was this review helpful yes no share name required field leave a comment required field submit comment  out of  on the small side let me just say i read the other reviews and found that as expected the product was on the small side its well made as far as i can tell and setting it up was very easy the only thing in testing it is that the door still could be opened just slightly we tightened it down and then tried it again and the door opened just a little bit less i think personally that if someone wanted into the room this would not completely stop them from just kicking in the door i do believe the door frame would crack before the stopper would but by that time enough noise would occur and you would be well awake to deal with whoever was coming through the door i was not convinced that it had a super grip on the carpet and did not test it further to see if it would slide over the carpet nap but it held the door closed and that is what i wanted for its price and size ease of use and portability it works well for what i wanted it for i would recommend this for anyone with a door that doesnt lock for added security works best with a light weight door or a heavier one so its versatile i would recommend this product by pamela f on february    am was this review helpful yes no share name required field leave a comment required field submit comment thank you for your feedback on the doorjammer once properly installed the door should not open slightly there may be a little wiggle room but the door should not open at all our supplier indicated that if the space between the door and the floor is greater than   you may experience a less sturdy result when properly installed the doorjammer wont budge were pleased to hear that overall you are happy with this product by on february    pm report abuse  out of  doorjammer i purchased this for a friend who lives in the country and has one door that doest lock properly im hoping this works for her i will let you know how that works after she uses it i would recommend this product by sk from auburn on december    pm was this review helpful yes no share name required
