price beyond these positive factors the longterm trajectory for housing improvement is immense this outlook and our balance sheet provide us with multiple avenues to invest additional capital in our business to generate attractive returns such as our recent expansion into salt lake city as we have demonstrated since our founding we remain committed to building our company into a premier homebuilder we are continuing to make substantial progress towards that goal looking ahead to the remainder of  we remain on path to grow home deliveries and leverage our cost base to deliver another full year of expanded profits and return on equity i’d now like to turn the call over to rob to discuss our markets in greater detail robert francescon thank you dale and good afternoon everyone during first quarter the overall trend in our markets was positive and we further positioned our business to benefit from the sustained upward move in housing demand we grow our orders over  on good momentum and our pace of activity to  homes we ended the quarter with a stronger backlog of  homes with a dollar value of  million we recorded an  increase in asp in backlog over the same period with prices moving higher in each market reflecting the success of our new communities and product offerings we also continued strengthen our positions in our current markets by sourcing additional land parcels that meet our disciplined underwriting requirements in the first quarter we acquired  lots for  million mainly in atlanta and colorado we ended the quarter with an inventory of  owned and controlled lots which provides us with a visible pipeline of organic growth for many years to come this growth opportunity is broad based not only from a geographic perspective but also with buyer profile we are opening new communities and offering new product that not only caters to move up but also first time home buyers the ladder be in the market segment we believe has immense opportunity as it continues its recovery this continued expansion provides us with wider target market for growth while also allowing diversify across additional buyer segments product types and price points to deliver more stable growth now looking specifically at our individual markets we had strong order growth in atlanta colorado and las vegas along with variant degree of success in texas more importantly the strength of our diversified platform netted out stable improvement across most metrics in colorado our operations were strong with home deliveries up  and average selling price up  to  compared to the year ago quarter order improved  on a higher absorption pace build by steady demand colorado continues to be one of the best housing markets in the country with new home supply still hovering around one month and its central location and diverse economy provided an influx of population growth the employment growth rate remains solid at  during the last  months with an increasing number of job gains from the professional and business services sector which are typically higher paying jobs in atlanta as the second largest builder we continue to increase our land inventory to support our growing base of first time home buyers and expansion in the townhome product and additional move up categories average selling prices of deliveries and backlog were each up doubledigits during the first quarter reflecting this development orders increased  and backlog value was up  core demand in atlanta remains strong for our product the new home supply is tight the ability to increase prices exists in many of our communities and the cost of living remains relatively low attracting more population inflow in las vegas the market continues to transform itself for the better and supply and demand remains in balance singlefamily permits continue to trend upward with limited resale and spec inventory in the market place we opened three communities featuring new product at various price points during the quarter contributing to the  increase in orders we have an additional three communities expected to open during the second quarter from our existing pipeline of communities in central texas which comprises san antonio and austin we had a strong quarter of growth in home deliveries but experience some softness at our higher price points this is consistent with the quarterly choppiness we have seen in this market for the past several quarters however home supply remains below three months in both markets and healthy employment growth towards service job support positive longterm fundamentals in this market beyond  in houston we continue to scale back our operations until market conditions improve we believe this is a prudent approach with houston now representing only  of both our total backlog and lot holdings beyond our existing foot print we remain committed to entering markets with attractive longterm fundamentals strengthening our current market positions and supporting our growth initiatives with a prudently leverage balance sheet our preferred market attributes include job growth increasing household formations limited housing supply and positive home price outlooks just this week we announced our entry into the salt lake city market with the acquisition of  finished lot and we currently own our control over  lots the salt lake city market exhibits all of these characteristics i just described and is an exceptional fit within our longterm multimarket growth strategy the local economy has been robust with total employment now at a  of the prior peak in  the improving economy and steady population growth have produced strong buyer demand amid very tight home supply near two months we expect to open our first community in the salt lake city area in the secondhalf of  in summary we are encouraged by our business momentum to start the year our overall success is consistent with our objective diversify our homebuilding operations across geography product and price point as a result we have a much stronger and stable platform with decreasing quarterly fluctuations this provides us with more predicable visibility and a high sense of comfort in our longterm outlook as we continue to grow we will be prudent with our capital and focus on high return investments to bring our platform and capital strength to bear we look forward to accomplishing our goals in  and beyond i will now turn the call over to dave who will provide greater detail on our financial results for the first quarter david messenger thank you rob during the first quarter we achieved higher sales and a  basis points improvement in adjusted gross margin to drive increase in net income to  million or  per share compared to  million or  per share in the prior year quarter for the first quarter our pretax income was  million an increase of  yearoveryear adjusted ebitda for the first quarter was  million up  compared to  million in the prior year quarter home sales revenues for the first quarter were  million an increase of  compared to  million in the prior year quarter this improvement in revenues was mainly driven by higher average selling price of home deliveries increasingly to  in the first quarter of  compared to  and the prior year quarter largely due to a favorable shift in regional and product mix from new communities as in the past we expect prices to remain largely stable with normal quartertoquarter fluctuation as a result of regional and product mix home deliveries were  homes compared to  homes in the prior year quarter gross margin percentage on homes closed in the first quarter improved  basis points to  compared to  in the prior year quarter excluding capitalized interest and purchase accounting impacts from cost of sales our adjusted gross margin percentage in the quarter increased to  versus  in the prior year quarter sga as a percentage of revenue was  in the first quarter compared to  in the prior year quarter primarily as a result of higher home sales revenues which were offset by an increase in personnel costs and additional investments to support a higher number of open communities we expect to gain addition leverage on sga as progress through the year turning now to our balance sheet and liquidity we ended the first quarter with total inventories of  million and total assets of  million our total liabilities were  million including total debt of  million during the quarter we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price  we believe our balance sheet and capital resources firmly position us to continue investing in attractive land parcels and other value enhancing opportunities we have over  million of total liquidity including  million of availability on our undrawn revolver in addition to the  million of liquidity we have a  million accordion feature and a revolver which provides us flexibility to move quickly as we pursue growth and investment opportunities in closing we are pleased with our first quarter results we are capitalized on expanded scale to support our localized strategies with enhanced product mix operational enhancements and a stronger capital pace to generate strong returns to that end we remain confident about the prospects for continued growth in our overall business during  most of our housing markets continue to be supported by improving fundamentals including job gains new household formations and strengthening regional economies as a result we are reaffirming our full year  outlook for deliveries to be  to  and home sales revenues to be in the range of  million to  million we expect our net income trends to be seasonally similar to  with our first quarter experiencing our lowest closing and net income we expect each quarter to grow as the year progresses we close and open new communities and leverage our sga we look forward to updating you on our progress in coming quarters operator can you please open the lines up for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you at this time we’ll be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question is from the line of jay mccanless with sterne agee please go ahead with your questions jay mccanless good afternoon guys great quarter first question i had can you talk a little bit more about the expansion in the salt lake city and i guess first what type of products you are going to be offering there and then also should we expect sga leverage to probably to be back half weighted once you guys have spent the money to get going there dale francescon jay this is dale salt lake was just it is a market that we’ve been looking at for expansion for some time it has very attractive market fundamentals and it’s obviously geographically close to colorado one of the other attributes that made it attractive was the fact that the product is fairly consistent with the product in colorado and we are starting up by exporting product from this market to that market and then the other attribute that it had is we had home grown talent in todd amberry that was ready to stepup and run a division and so all of those things just came into play and why during a greenfield in salt lake city made sense david messenger and jay from the sga standalone you are looking at our closing guidance for the year and revenue guidance were up about  to midpoint our revenues and so with the lower closing of revenue number seasonally in the first quarter that takes up our sga but over the course of the year we expect that to come down and be more similar to what we had in  dale francescon then in terms of the price segment we are going after in salt lake city it is going to predominantly entry level with some first time move up jay mccanless first time move up okay perfect then on the land side you talked about how the has been in this quarter was concentrating colorado and atlanta could you talk a little bit about what you’re buying in atlanta and especially focus on the expansion in the more up communities as you guys grow from the peachtree position dale francescon sure so we’re continuing to source and purchase land in atlanta both in the entry level price point as well as move up price points in ten to two on a watch dial and the ten to two range in atlanta we also have a transaction that’s inside the parameter in atlanta which in a prime location and so where we are still expanding quite a bit on the entry level price points we are moving in that to some other market segments in addition we have started townhomes in that market as well jay jay mccanless okay great all right that’s all questions i had thanks again dale francescon thanks jay david messenger thanks jay operator our next question comes from the line of patrick kealey with fbr please go ahead with your questions patrick kealey hey everyone thanks for taking my question dale francescon hey patrick patrick kealey so sticking with the land strategy i think you talked about on the prior call about may be a shift a little bit towards options over own as we kind of look forward here over the cost in next  months so can you may be give us insight into may be what the right proportion would be you know you are  here at the end of first quarter what would be kind of ideal mix if we look out and may be which market are probably presenting the opportunity to make that shift dale francescon sure you know patrick part of the ratio is kind of where we are at any particular point in time we’re comfortable with the  overtime we would like to have shot a little more towards the balance and however some of that is market dependent and opportunity dependent we look at the areas where we have the availability of having options atlanta obviously is at the top of our list in terms of the transactions that lend themselves to more of a control situation same thing in some of the texas markets that we are in you’ve got that opportunity we don’t have as much opportunity in las vegas or in colorado for that and we anticipate that we’ll have some opportunity for that in some salt lake city as well patrick kealey okay thanks that’s very helpful and also not sure if you have in front of you but can you give us a sense of how april shaped up for you guys may be kind of on a yearoveryear basis and may be if there is any one market or two markets that stuck out in the quarter what’s calling out i think that’ll be great dale francescon sure we were up in the first quarter roughly a little over  yearoveryear when we look at april that was a similar trend the market in terms of orders has started out well we have seen something other than a continuation of that as just going forward we are happy with performance and in all of our markets with the acceptation of houston and we are not different than anybody else that builds in houston other than we have a very small percentage  of our backlog is in houston and that is not going to change in the nearterm outside of that particular market we’re happy with how all of them have performed patrick kealey okay great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of nishu sood with deutsche bank please go ahead with your questions nishu sood thank you dave i just wanted to followup on the sga topic you mentioned that with the lower revenues the sga didn’t look as good as this quarter but as the leverage comes through the revenue has come through in the remaining quarters of the year it would be level on a yeartoyear basis i guess what i was thinking was that it sounds like some of these expenses from market expansion may taper off as time goes on so when would we expect the ish percent revenue growth to drive sga down because the revenue is going up  you would expect some pretty decent declines in sga on a percentage basis or maybe another way to think about it as you know what kind of run rate can we expect for the total sga this year it’ll be a little bit of bump so should we expect ish million for the remainder of the year and when would we begin to see leverage again david messenger i think we will start seeing some leverage here as we gets to the second quarter but definitely as we hit q and q similar to what happen in the last where from a revenue and closing standalone kind of startup the year a little slow but then the backhalf year we pick it up and that’s where you see a lot of leverage coming through and so we’ve historically been running about a  split on our ga between fix versus variable so i think we keep that same ratio you’ll see us leverage the ga platform really in q and q nishu sood got it so on the backhalf of the year sga percentage should be declining on a yearoveryear basis is what you are saying david messenger yes nishu sood got it okay that helps the entry level buyer dale i think you were talking through the strategy on this so a lot of builders talking about the entry level as i think about you folks and going into the entry level first i’d appreciate your thoughts as to what has prompted this shift the entry level what are you seeing in the market some people are siding affordability some people are just siding that you know in the move up market there is not as many opportunities so your thought process on entering and also your business differs then some of the other builders in that the organization is much more recent in terms of like your acquisition as that you made in the different area so atlanta obviously that operation will be much more suited to entry level it is a lot of entry level already you know in denver there is more of mix so how on a nationwide basis do you push down the strategy like that when your divisions are so different because they have been acquired and had different operations and products to begin with dale francescon well we have always done entry level housing and it is in varying degrees in each of the different divisions and so from our standpoint it is not really a new strategy it is just being opportunistic on where we see the best investment opportunity so you mentioned atlanta as the second largest builder in atlanta we do a lot of entry level housing and it is something that even though we have expanded the product deliveries to include move up we are not backing away from entry level in any way and we grow on that part of the business as well and so we look at each one of our markets we do entry level to different degrees so that is not a new strategy for us nishu sood got it got it so what are you seeing out there in terms of the opportunities are better from what perspective just the land prices or are you seeing great absorptions in your entry level products it makes sense for more capital what specifically is making those opportunities more attractive right now dale francescon part of it is we see the entry level buyer continuing to come back into the market it’s something where we think that there is a significant amount of demand we think that’s going to continue to increase over time and so we want to be in a position to be able to deliver homes to that buyer profile and it is challenging in certain cases to make economics work but it is a matter of finding those opportunities and capitalizing on them nishu sood got it great thanks for your thoughts dale francescon welcome operator our next question comes from the line of william wong with jpmorgan please go ahead with your questions william wong thanks good afternoon guys so dave i just had a followup on the sga so you mentioned that in the backhalf you guys expect some leverage so for the full year just given where you are with the first quarter do you think that on a full year basis you guys will see sga as a percentage of revenue be down a little bit versus the prior year david messenger we don’t have the official guidance range out there what i can assure you that as we’re looking for ways to increase our pretax margin as a percent of revenue we’re looking to leverage this sga platform we’ve spend past couple of years we are building it for all the acquisitions we have incorporated the acquisitions into our platform and as we have the revenue coming through we think that we’ll see leverage so we are always driving for addition opportunities of leverage that we can pull to decrease that but we haven’t been  put a number out there to say we are going to x points better william wong okay thanks and with regards to the gross margins i mean what does gross margins look like currently in your backlog and then just i think you guys have been pretty consistent on the gross margins right around    for the most part is that something that we should expect as well just kind of going forward with your new additions i guess what you told you guys haven’t seen any closing there yet since its opening in the backhalf of this year but in terms of just your current operations do you think that  is kind of right level to be thinking about it david messenger yeah i don’t think our numbers will be similar then what we had in  now let us say from a modeling for your modeling practices utah has minimal impact of any this year william wong okay great and then just lastly in terms of your geographic foot print now guys you are expanding into utah how should we think about your growth going forward i think you mentioned before that you are looking one of the best investment returns would be but if you think about some of the division that you are operating in you had any additional geographies that you think might be attractive right now and in terms of organic growth in utah you mentioned there are couple of factors that play in terms of manager being ready to be promoted in approximately to colorado i guess outside of that there any other regions that you think might be attractive at this point dale francescon well our expansion is still in our mind best accomplish through acquisition of other homebuilders and even though we did a greenfield and salt lake city that was just those circumstances that i discussed and so we are continuing to look at acquisitions candidates but we have got pretty discipline standards in terms of what we think make sense for us and we haven’t found anything recently that has risen to that level in terms of geography the southeast is something that we have continued to look at in terms of the carolina it makes sense given our large presence that we have in atlanta to be able to leverage some of the resources that we have in atlanta into some of those adjacent states as well as we look at different opportunities in the west but those are probably the two areas that we have been the most focused on william wong okay great thanks guys dale francescon welcome company speaker yeah thanks operator our next question comes from the line of joel locker with fbn securities please go ahead with your questions joel locker hi guys just i guess little more clarity on the sga may be if you could break down the fourth quarter by just kind of fix cost and what was part of commission and if there was any kind of one time in there just with the  million sequential increase david messenger  revenue picks up trying to get into some  detail with you to go through the fourth quarter versus first quarter but really sga still run at roughly  fixed versus variable and not too many things being different from the fourth quarter to this quarter joel locker was it just a base to jump up i mean a lot of what just it seems like that was i guess a little higher than what i had expected david messenger there are some base cost increases related to personnel some annual merit increases but nothing else in there that’s really too significant that would have cause a significant jump joel locker right and i guess moving along to backlog conversion i mean that was a little stronger and i think what people expected to turn around a little over  what do you expect going forward second quarter i know atlanta is giving you some leverage there where you can convert homes pretty quickly there but do you expect it be up yearoveryear again in the second quarter robert francescon backlog conversion yeah in terms of our backlog conversion yearoveryear i think the first quarter we had a very high conversion roughly  i think that you are probably going to see us on a consolidated basis trend back towards a  to  which is historically where we run joel locker okay so even with the peachtree acquisition which is obviously large part of your business now… robert francescon yeah i think if you look at our conversion ratios each quarter for  that is about where we are running and that includes a fair amount of the peachtree acquisition we have done  homes in the last year joel locker right and then what about the share buyback i guess in general just you guys bought back a little bit of shares in the second quarter i mean i guess first question were you guys active also on the second quarter robert francescon so we bought back just under  thousand shares in the first quarter as we found certain opportunities we typically don’t comment on activity in the second quarter but for this point we can because we have been in the blackout since the quarter started and earnings happened and we continue to evaluate it as the capital alternative joel locker well that is what i was thinking with your shares there is a capital choice and basically with your shares trading below at  your tangible book if that would just be an ongoing operation until the market just decide to put capital all back in the homebuilding business just to be active in the market just to take advantage of situations robert francescon it will be an opportunity that we are continuing to evaluate as each trading day passes joel locker right all right i will get back in the queue thanks a lot robert francescon thank you operator our next question comes from the line of alex barron with housing research center please go ahead with your questions alex barron thanks and great job guys dale francescon thanks alex good to hear from you alex barron i want to understand it seems like you guys are off to a really strong start and from what we can tell april is off to a good momentum as well so what would kind of and given your strong backlog conversion in this quarter what would cause you to not raise the bottom end of your delivery guidance is it just conservatism of what would actually cause you to hit the number in the low end it seems to like you guys are going to be closer to at least the midpoint david messenger hey alex this is dave i think you know having provide the guidance in february now we are in may we are at the start of the selling seasons or kind of it is the selling season with a lot of year left ago i just we think where we stand right now from the guidance perspective we feel comfortable with as the year progresses we’ll let you know if we need to adjust the range accordingly alex barron okay sounds good and then i guess with regard to your entry into utah did you guys consider may be buying somebody there to kind of king scale and jump start that or is there an advantage to doing at greenfield david messenger you know alex it’s really not an advantage doing a greenfield we’ve looked over the last few years at a number of different opportunities in utah we just haven’t found a right fit and when we looked at the opportunities there to do a greenfield we thought it made sense just given some of the unique attributes but again as i indicated earlier doing greenfield is not our first choice our first choice our market expansion is to do it through an acquisition but everything has to make sense on that acquisition and we haven’t seen that in utah alex barron okay and then in terms of vegas i believe you guys are expanding pretty aggressively there your number can you just comment on what you’re seeing in that market david messenger so this was a concerted effort to that we started last year on getting new positions in that market and they are coming to finish now and so in q we opened up three new communities and in q we’ll open up three additional communities and we’re bullish on las vegas we like the market and we’ve got a great team in las vegas and feel really good about the prospects right now alex barron okay well good luck and good job thanks david messenger thank you alex operator our next question comes from jay mccanless with sterne agee please go ahead with your questions jay mccanless hi thanks for taking my followup just wanted to ask on central texas you said that i believe higher price points were the issue there can you talk about what you’re doing from a technical perspective to address that and then also maybe talk about how you see san antonio rolling out over the next  months dale francescon when we look at our operation in central texas it started with the acquisition of the jimmy jacobs hallmark  a number of years ago the focus on that particular business was a higher end product which we’ve continued as our primary positioning there overtime we’ve added some more affordable products and as we have seen the market somewhat adjust we’ve continued to move towards more affordable products so it’s just a natural transition given what we’re seeing in the market as far as san antonio is concerned we look at austin and san antonio is our central texas operation we’re active in both of those markets and we like both of those markets jay mccanless okay that sounds good thanks again dale francescon thanks jay operator our next question is coming from the line of william wong with jp morgan please go ahead with your questions william wong hey guys thanks for taking my followup just regarding the denver market have you guys seen any increased challenges with labor relative to where you guys were may be in last year also in the backhalf of last year dale francescon no not really its labor has been tight here for some time we’ve got extensive contacts in this market and as we look at it it’s something that’s part of our business is to manage our trade partners and it’s something that we’ve been doing and we have not seen additional pressure over and above what we’ve been experience for the past year or  months william wong great and then dave i’m not sure if i got this but can you remind me what’s the gross margin backlog look like relative to the first quarter david messenger as i said before earlier on the call roughly we think for the year we’re looking at  or  or even paying out in the past now break  different that were for  william wong okay perfect thanks guys i appreciate it david messenger thank you operator the next question is coming from the line of patrick kealey with fbr please go ahead with your questions patrick kealey thanks for taking my followup just one quick question on colorado you guys did see kind of a nice jump in absorptions there can you kind of talk about the incentive environment there i’d assumed with one month supply that’s probably playing out in your favor but just trying to get a sense of was the drivers of the absorptions there just purely demand or any other kind of changes in that maybe kind of help us forward dale francescon yeah colorado has been a low incentive market place and we see that continuing with the lack of inventory in this market for at least foreseeable future and so when we look at that it’s really just in demand driven i suppose to any incentive driven in our sales patrick kealey okay thank you dale francescon great thank you operator thank you at this time i will turn the floor back to dale francescon for closing remarks dale francescon thank you operator and thank you again to everyone for joining us today we look

sheet and  outlook following our prepared remarks we will open the lines for questions a healthy pace of activity continued through the fourth quarter to help us deliver another record year of earnings which totaled  million or  per share this represents an exciting milestone as the th consecutive year of profitable results for now more mature and established company as we look at our history most of our growth has developed during the past four years from  to  we have expanded home sales revenue operating income and adjusted ebitda each by a factor of  times our business today enjoys three underlying attributes that were not available to us when we began our transformation four years ago first our dramatically expanded scale has and does allow us to achieve impressive yearoveryear results second we have achieved increasingly stable and predictable performance as a result of a more established operations and better visibility as we look forward and finally we have recognized sustain growth and returns on equity that are taking additional steps to generate even greater returns in  and beyond our consistent accomplishments are the result of our efforts to expand and enhance operations in each of our markets to further augment our position as the top  us homebuilder we have remained true to our principles to grow end markets with sound fundamentals through a cycle tested approach with a focus on enhancing returns on equity to that end during  our roe increased by  basis points to  compared to  in  and  in  we are very pleased with that progress and we are focused on further expansion of returns on equity as a prime example in mid  we entered the attractive salt lake city market through the acquisition of  lots which we have scaled up to over  welllocated lots as of yearend  we have already begun opening communities and delivering homes in utah more recently during the fourth quarter we made a twopronged expansion into the southeast the first was the previously announced purchase of  interest in wade jurney homes which targets first time homebuyers in the carolina florida and georgia wade jurney was ranked in  as the th largest homebuilder nationally and the fastest growing private builder by builder magazine additionally in december  we entered the rapidly growing charlotte north carolina market with the purchase of  lots and the control of an additional  lots we expect to begin opening communities in charlotte during the second half of  these southeast expansions add to our position as the second largest builder in atlanta and give us a more balanced exposure to one of the most economically sound regions of the country and beyond core homebuilding operations during the quarter we formed a new whollyowned financial services division to provide title and mortgage services to our homebuyers this division is aligned with our objective to invest in ancillary businesses that can generate incremental value for shareholders this business is on track to start contributing incremental earnings in the second half of  it is our expectation that all of these  investments will generate a high return on equity for century while providing stable earnings growth as we further diversify across additional buyer segments product types and geographic areas we expect these actions to continue building on our year track record of proven results which has driven outsized growth in revenues and profits versus peers looking at our  results our strategy generated significant expansion in virtually all metrics including deliveries revenues and net new home contracts we delivered on our full year targets and significantly grew our home sale revenue by  to  million and home deliveries by  to  homes during the fourth quarter home deliveries increased  to  home and home sale revenues improved  to  million we were especially pleased to achieve this higher activity while recording an average selling price of  for the fourth quarter and  for the full year reflecting favorable product mix and core price momentum our net new contracts also grew to  up  for the quarter and to  up  for the year we continue to carefully balance growth and cost in order to maximize profits and shareholder returns during the full year we increased our adjusted gross margin by  to  million this included a  increase in adjusted gross margin to  million during the fourth quarter which represented an adjusted gross margin percentage of  versus  in the prior year quarter this quarteroverquarter difference was a function of geographical and product mix combined with increases in costs which are occurring across the homebuilding industry we are actively working to control costs to partially offset these margin headwinds which we expect to persist for the full year adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was  compared to  in  despite rising costs we are pleased with this relatively stable margin performance during the past eight quarters which has been strengthened by our multimarket approach strategic land purchases strict underwriting standards and tightly run operations as we have shown during the past several years we are committed to investing time energy and capital to advance our goal of growing century into the most profitable builder amongst its peers we acknowledge the nearterm macro environment is clouded by a number of shifting policy initiatives and uncertain variable such as additional interest rate hikes currently demand trends remain encouraging in our markets we have an attractive pipeline of communities a deep land portfolio and ample capital resources to execute on our objectives we are extremely pleased with the hard work and commitment from the entire century team which will help drive our success into  and beyond id now like to turn the call over to rob to discuss our markets in greater detail rob francescon thank you dale and good afternoon everyone  was a very productive year for century communities we achieved four quarters of consistent progress to end the year with a much stronger and diverse platform during  we’ve strengthen our positions in all markets we delivered a full year of considerable organic growth in new contracts home deliveries and earnings this success reflects our teams’ hard efforts to capitalize on favorable demand trends in our markets full year net new contracts increased  to  homes and for the fourth quarter contracts grew  to  homes led by nevada central texas and colorado we ended the year with the backlog dollar value of  to  million from the prior year this was helped by steady order activity continuing into the fourth quarter with our absorption pace improving by  we have achieved these higher absorptions without sacrificing price this is evidenced by average selling price and backlog which increased by  yearoveryear asp and backlog has moved higher in each key region reflecting the success of our new communities and product offerings with the exception of minor benefits from our new utah division all of this growth in contracts and backlog was generated by continued expansion within our existing markets we are pleased with this progress and as dale discussed earlier we continue to put our capital into wise investments that are aligned with our strict return hurdles this includes our sourcing of additional land parcels that we are disciplined underwriting requirements overall we ended the quarter with the land inventory of  yearoveryear to  owned and controlled lots now looking at our market portfolio the overall trend is positive beginning with the southeast in atlanta our efforts to upgrade our mix across price point and product type has resulted in seven straight quarters of sequential price growth backlog dollar value in atlanta at yearend was up  mainly attributable to price and mix gains on a relatively stable absorption pace the job market remained strong which is driving steady traffic the gap between monthly homeownership and rental cost has narrowed which is producing good homebuilding conditions in our newest market charlotte which is a top  homebuilding market and one that we have been carefully studying for several years charlotte has a favorable homebuilding environment with the steady population inflect driving demand and a relatively tight housing supply of less than three months supporting potential price growth job and employment growth experienced healthy improvement for the past several years and that trend is expected to continue through  owned affordability is amongst the highest of the markets that we serve and homebuilding production is still thousands of units below historical levels in colorado we had a very strong demand with fourth quarter new contracts of  and home deliveries rising  yearoveryear prices increased in the midsingle digits which was in line with market trends and the resell supply remains extremely low at around one month which supports healthy fundamentals in utah we were pleased in the year with open selling communities and a good trajectory in terms of sales and delivery activity overall economic and housing fundamentals are extremely strong with steady increases in both yearoveryear job growth and buyer demand we plan on opening five communities in the first and second quarter of the year both colorado and utah have expanded employment bases and tight home supply which align strongly with our pipeline of new communities in las vegas growth in new home deliveries more than doubled following several quarters of doubledigit growth in new contracts this is a result of consistent buyer demand and our doubling of communities in that market over the past year the fourth quarter order growth remained strong at  yearoveryear which validates our investment in that market in the las vegas market good fundamentals has led the steady home price appreciation in texas both san antonio and austin had a strong quarter of growth in net new home contracts and home deliveries in austin singlefamily permits are still trending upward following a  increase in  new home traffic and sales have gained momentum in recent months and we finished the year with net contracts of  yearoveryear in central texas the san antonio market maintained a steady pace throughout  homes are still extremely affordable and when you combine that with job growth across many industries both tech medical and military that make san antonio a desirable place to buy and sell property in houston demand continues to be steady below the  price point and the recovery prospects are slowly improving with well staying above about  we have begun investing additional capital in the market as part of our transition to more entrylevel product we more than doubled our total owned and controlled lots to  at yearend  compared to  and continue to pursue new land deals to capture more of the first time buyer demand as you can see most of our markets experience favorable homebuilding conditions as always we remained focused on entering markets with attractive longterm fundamentals strengthening market positions and supporting growth initiatives with the fully leverage balance sheet while we pride ourselves on offering a wide variety of price points and product in order to appeal to a diverse buyer profile we have and continue to deliver entrylevel home as meaningful part of our business in an effort to grow this segment we have recently introduced our century complete line in colorado which is solely focused on catering to this buyer demographic century complete homes have smaller square footage price points in the  and provide an attractive homebuying options for the first time buyer segment continuing on our strategy to increase our percentage of entrylevel offerings our recent investment in wade jurney homes allows us to leverage its unique business model which requires less capital investments and yields quicker asset terms in  wade jurney delivered  homes generating  million in revenue and ended the year with more than  owned and controlled lots given the demonstrated success of this operation coupled with the immense opportunity in the entrylevel market we intend to grow this brand and expand it into additional markets as a result of our recent efforts we now have a much broader position in the rapidly growing southeast as well as an even greater exposure to first time buyers within our portfolio in summary based on our strong  results and our positive views on the homebuilding environment we are energized to further grow our business and enhance returns in  and beyond i will now turn the call over to dave who will provide greater detail on our financial results for the fourth quarter david messenger thank you rob our strong  results continued into the fourth quarter during the quarter we increased net income by  to  million or  per share compared to  million or  per share in the prior year quarter this great progress reflects the expansion of our homebuilding operations and improving returns on equity for the fourth quarter our pretax income was  million for the full year our pretax income was  million an increase of  yearoveryear our net income was  million or  per share compared to  million or  per share fourth quarter adjusted ebitda grew  to  million compared to  million the prior year quarter attributable to revenue growth adjusted ebita for the full year was  million up  compared to  million in  home sales revenues for the fourth quarter were  million an increase of  compared to  million in the prior year quarter this improvement in revenues was mainly driven by  increase in home deliveries to  and higher average selling prices which increased to  in the fourth quarter  compared to  in the prior year quarter attributable to a shift in regional and product mix in core price gains for the full year we grew home sales revenues by  to  million and home deliveries by  to  homes net new home contracts for the fourth quarter increased to  homes an increase of  compared to  homes in the prior year quarter mainly due to stronger demand trends in most of our divisions driving an overall increase in absorption rates led by nevada colorado and central texas for the full year net new home contracts increased to  homes an increase of  compared to  in the prior year gross margin percentage on homes closed in the fourth quarter was  compared to  in the prior year quarter excluding capitalized interest and purchase accounting impacts from cost of sales our adjusted gross margin percentage in the quarter decreased slightly to  versus  in the prior year quarter for the full year adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was more stable at  compared to  in  sga as a percentage of home sales revenues was  compared to  in the prior year quarter our comparison was a result of certain  onetime benefits coupled with numerous investments made in  that will produce results in  in regards to the  sga investments we made significant strides in setting up our financial services subsidiary and continue to expect profitable results in the second half of  we have made extensive preparations for stock compliance in anticipation of surpassing the  billion threshold in  additionally we started the greenfield operations in salt lake city which we expect to produce meaningful results in  and charlotte which we expect to produce meaningful results in  in regards to our financing operations our ramp up is progressing according to plan and we have begun hiring people and started the licensing process for inspire home loans our new mortgage entity as previously mentioned given the lead time necessary for hiring loan officers licensing and taking applications we expect to begin closing loans in the second quarter but dont expect to generate profits until the second half of  now turning to our balance sheet and liquidity as of december   the company had total longterm debt of  million which included the  million senior notes with a fixed rate of  senior notes due  in january  we took an opportunity to raise an additional  million under the significant senior notes at ph  par  with an effective interest rate of  we used net proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility as planned as a result as of december   and on a pro forma basis including this refinancing activities the company had total longterm debt of  million and total liquidity of  million including  million of availability on our  million revolver our pro forma net debttocapital ratio remained essentially unchanged at approximately  during the quarter we were able to issue approximately  shares under our atm for  million or  per share these proceeds were used to match fund our land acquisitions in closing we are pleased with the balance improvement in results across our diverse footprint during the fourth quarter and full year as we move through  we plan to deliver another year of earnings improvement as we take advantage of strengthening positions in legacy markets and ramp up activity in more recently entered markets most of our housing markets continued to perform in line with expectations supported by positive economic fundamentals however we anticipate potential for interest rate increases may impact buyers the additional stability provided by our expanded scale gives us confidence as we head into the new year with these points in mind we are excited to introduce our full year  outlook we expect deliveries to be in the range of  to  homes and home sales revenues to be in the range of  billion to  billion we expect to open approximately  to  new communities throughout the year and close on approximately equivalent number ending the year between  and  selling communities while we do not provide guidance on a quarterly basis we expect net income trends to be seasonally similar to  our first quarter will experience our lowest closing and net income after the first quarter we expect earnings to grow as the year progresses operator can you please open the lines up to qa questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from jay mccanless of wedbush please go ahead jay mccanless hi good afternoon everyone thanks for taking my questions the first question i had on the sga line  million was certainly higher than what we were looking for are there any onetime items in that number and could you maybe talk about how we have modeled the run rate without going into ’ david messenger yeah hey jay it’s dave in the fourth quarter we had several investments that we have made that we inaudible  platform our financial services subsidiary hired new individuals involved with compliance secondary market accounting it field personal we had preparations for surpassing the  billion threshold in  negatively transact so those investments were relatively expensive that involved hiring numerous consultant and several inhouse people we engaged not only inhousing accounting firm but also engage our current auditors to do fair amount of testing and documentation and it almost cost a  billion threshold this year we also made  as we have discussed previously several investment in our salt lake and charlotte operations currently our salt lake division has two open communities and as rob mentioned that’s going to grow to seven by the end of the second quarter and both the salt lake and charlotte division have had ran personal sales and operation individuals hired as they claim for the growth in   a lot of those investments were obviously onetime items that happened in  that will produce a meaningful result held into  and ’ so as we look at  look forward going into  with fourth quarter being approximately sga as a percent of home sales revenue is  we expect that or a number similar to that for full year  jay mccanless okay great and then second question i have as i look at the closing mix on geographic basis from q ’ to q ’ there wasn’t really much change in terms of percentage mix except for the utah houses coming on is that one of things that led on gross margin sequentially or did you guys get a little more aggressive and try to clear out some old specs can you talk about that shift from q to q please dale francescon hi jay it’s dale we saw really nothing in the market that weighed heavily on the gross margins regarding it’s some variation from quartertoquarter depending on product mix it comes through about the only thing that that we are seeing i think consistent with other people is we are seeing continued pricing pressure from some of our trade partners thats not anything new it’s something that we’ve been experiencing now for probably going on upwards of couple years so nothing unusual or nothing that we saw that occur in the fourth quarter thats different than really what we saw throughout the year jay mccanless okay and then the last question i have could you guys give us any color on january how orders trended for the month dale francescon sure so we look at january first couple weeks were pretty quiet different than the way  started at that point it’s just kind of light switch went on and it really kicked in and we ended up january for example incrementally higher than we did in  notwithstanding the slow start and as we got into february we have seen pretty much a continuation of that same trend jay mccanless okay that sounds great thank you guys dale francescon thank you david messenger thanks jay operator thank you the next question is from michael rehaut of jp morgan please go ahead william long hey good afternoon this is william for mike i guess switching to some of the regions that you talked about you have done a great job holding margins steady given some of the headwinds you talked about but i guess given your new north carolina and utah positions can you maybe update us on where you are seeing pricing are dale francescon so looking at salt lake city and utah basically the lots we have went in and purchase there have been generally speaking finished lot deals on a rolling option and so with that our margins were slightly below maybe on a consolidated basis but still in the upper teens with interest included in that and we see that continuing in addition to that weve also now started developing our own lots in that market and we see those margins rising above that number for the risk reward for developing those lots and so we would see those communities have a higher margin in the charlotte market we have started out the same way to get our feet on the ground and that is to get finished lots in that market and thats where we positioned ourselves from an initial standpoint again margins in the higher teens for that type of product we will transition we haven’t done it yet but we will transition in that market to also do self development of lots and then at that point we would expect higher margins william long okay that helps and i guess on the some of the older markets but in colorado you are seeing some of labor constraints still being kind of the headwind during that lining up rob francescon it’s  it really hasn’t changed significantly the markets that we are in are attractive markets there is competition in all of the markets and so when we look at that weve been experiencing trade shortages for some time and were not seeing it really escalate but we are not seeing it go away something that is part of our job to manage our trade partners and manage our business to mitigate it as in many ways we possibly can dale francescon we are seeing some early signs though as the apartment construction is starting to slowdown in some of the markets we are seeing a free up of some labor as a result of that and we think that is a trend and will continue william long okay that makes sense thank you operator thank you the next question is from will randow of citi please go ahead will randow hey good afternoon guys and congratulations on the progress dale francescon thanks will will randow you mentioned a couple of points that dovetail together well but i was missing one that is your expectation for free cash flow given it sounds like community growth it feel like it’s going to be somewhat flat with i assume absorption stronger and on that note where you are investing cash incrementally it sounds like southeast utah but how should we think about positive negative free cash of that working capital line item as well david messenger hey will this is dave i think that from a cash flow perspective you are going to see us reinvesting in our markets that obviously we have a great opportunity to invest in the southeast not only to our atlanta platform but also from our new markets in charlotte and obviously with utah we are going to be investing dollars in those markets but also we have some significant opportunities in some of our other markets where we have a smaller market share and we can invest capital in order to grow our presence in those markets will randow so just to pinpoint you guys will be using your working capital in  with inaudible  or how should we think about that david messenger i would think that that’s a fair statement yes will randow okay make sense and in terms of it’s good to hear you guys are talking  price point on entry level one of the few california  oh sorry colorado builders will get that can you talk about particularly how you are thinking about product what you are going to hit that work is it predominately denver or you are going to stretch out with that and whats the run rate on expanding the new entrylevel product rob francescon yeah well we are starting that in denver as we mentioned our product line up starts at around  square feet and goes from there it’s like the name century complete it’s a complete from an amenity package inside of complete package house and at those lower price points you can imagine that thats a very attractive price point in the denver metro area when you look at the average asps for new home construction as far as rolling that out outside of denver atlanta is prime for that where historically weve done entry level but not quite to that level and so we are going to expand into that in that market as well as we are doing this going forward into central texas and of course houston as well so we see tremendous opportunity for that on a go forward basis in addition playing off as we mentioned playing off the entry level standpoint in the us right now where everybody seems to be migrating down to that and there is certainly tremendous amount of demand there the wade jurney model that we have invested in continues to play directly into that market exclusively will randow and lastly if i can sneak one and what’s your anticipation in terms of capture rate for your new housing finance arm and congrats again david messenger hey this is dave i assume a very high expectation for finance arm but given we are seeing a process of appealing warehouse lines venture approvals licensing staffing we are not really in a position yet to put out any kind of the capture rate we will do that later in the year as we get that operation going will randow thank you david messenger yeah thanks will operator thank you our next question is from nishu sood of deutsche bank please go ahead nishu sood thanks just following up on the entry level obviously a topic of quite a bit of interest to investors you got the wade jurney approach obviously peachtree had  has sound approach to the entry level and now you are talking about this new product in denver how should we think about how youre going to overlap those and expand those and think about the appropriateness i mean i know there are some builders that your largest peer in atlanta for example has a couple different approaches to entry level so how should we think about the broader entry level strategy and you are going to mix and match those in a way that most tragic results dale francescon hi nishu it’s dale in terms of our platform we’ve  we always focused on building a wide variety of products so that we could appeal to a wide buyer demographic we are not going away from that but the entry level buyer continues to come back into the market and we want to be able to have that as a large percentage of our business as we look at our entry level today within the century line it’s between  and  and we have the ability to increase that or decrease that depending on where we see the buyer demand and so from that standpoint thats really the plan that we are continuing on doing within the wade jurney business model its a different business model in that there is no model homes it sold from retail centers and it is an entry level price point typically sub  on an average that is even below what we are targeting within the broader century nishu sood got it got it okay your overall entry level percentage then where is it currently and you mentioned the century branded a percentage of portfolio where would you look to drive the entry level percentage i mean obviously the historic benchmark market overall and for builders overall has been about the  to  range where are you now and do you think about it in terms of target dale francescon we really dont think about it in terms of target thats as i said we think we are in that  to  right now we think we have the ability to increase that percentage we think that market is there and readily accessible to us but as opposed to saying we have a percentage that we want to hit it’s really on a case by case deal by deal basis on where we think we can invest our capital with the greatest return nishu sood got it and a question on gross margins you mentioned that dave mentioned that cost pressures influencing obviously the gross margin and the trend similar gross margin levels in ’ versus ’ but ‘ had a more of the rising trend and ‘ had a declining trend how should we think then about ‘ gross margins are we kind of starting off the year where ‘ where we ended ‘ and could there be downward pressure from there how should we think about that david messenger i think as we look at  we look at our backlog and kind of a pro forma product and market mix i think  will be at levels consistent with the fourth quarter of  now giving each quarter we are going to have some fluctuation in a very big market product but for the full year  it will be fairly similar to where we ended the year and the fourth quarter  nishu sood got it and the interest in the  went out  to over    i think it was in q given your debttocapital then change much over the course of year but the interest has crapped up are we reaching about a steadystate on that because you seem to be kind of holding in the mids on your net debttocapital david messenger i think you may see a creep up a little bit more as we go later in this year given that we did the deal in january for  million at ph  par  so by fixing some of the debt we had on revolver that will create some incremental increase to it remain on to that until second and third quarter as that product grows nishu sood okay thank you david messenger thank you nishu operator thank you operator instructions the question is from alex rygiel of fbr please go ahead alex rygiel thank you and nice quarter gentlemen dale francescon thanks rob francescon thanks alex alex rygiel quick question as it relates to the mix of owned versus controlled lots have changed a little bit is there going to be any impact or shift in gross margin from that dale francescon no we dont see that at the present time i mean we’ve purposely gone to a higher mix of controlled however we dont see that really changing as dave just talked about gross margins what we are expecting for  we dont really see that changing off q of ’ alex rygiel and in your prepared remarks you talked a little bit about cost inflation and then in the qa you addressed some of vendors were there any other cost inflation that have sort of creeped up or developed and can you sort of comment on historically how easy it is for you to sort of push cost inflation back onto either the consumer or the seller of land such that you can maintain steady margins rob francescon alex in terms of there is obviously the cost component related to the vertical side of the business that we have been experiencing for some time with regard to land land is in general getting a bit more expensive thats obviously another large part of the cost component that goes in we really dont find land sellers in a position where theyre willing to accept much of that we obviously try to educate them as much as we can in terms of what acceptable returns are but in most of our markets our competitors are actively buying land as well and so there is obviously a fair amount of competition for that with regard to increasing the price and push it on to the consumer we try to do that where we can it’s down to the individual subdivision level within the market and some markets we continue to have a pretty consistent pricing power in other markets we don’t where we dont see pricing power we are looking at can we introduce a different product so that we can deliver a less expensive home and have be able to deal with some of those cost pressures and so there is a variety of different levers it depends on the situation down at the subdivision level and we tried to use them all alex rygiel very helpful thank you very much rob francescon thank you alex operator thank you the next question is from alex barron of housing research center please go ahead alex barron congratulations gentlemen good job dale francescon thanks alex alex barron i was wondering if you guys could comment on not sure but if i missed it if you guys could comment on any noticeable changes in cancellation trends from yeartodate versus a year ago dale francescon no we really havent seen anything significant obviously get some fluctuation just because of circumstances but relating to individual buyers but there is no trend thats creating any concern for us alex barron okay great and second question is if you can comment on your thoughts or appetite for ma this year what your thoughts are on that dale francescon our appetite remained strong we are seeing a bit more deal flow that started occurring in the latter part of last year continuing into this year more so than we saw a year ago and our appetite hasn’t changed at all that was as we look at that that was part of the reason that we actually expanded our bond offering recently so that we freed up additional capacity there we did two greenfields in  which is not our preferred way to expand in the market but we just havent found the opportunities there in ma bases yet that was a good way of entering those markets but as we look forward into  we are optimistic that we will be able to find additional opportunities alex barron okay best wishes for this year thanks dale francescon thanks alex rob francescon thanks alex operator thank you we have no further questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to mr francescon for any closing remarks dale francescon thank you operator and thank you again to everyone for joining us today we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter operator thank you ladies and gentlemen
