snapshotfigure  superior energy services inc company snapshot the increase in the global oil and gas production in north america and the middle east accompanied by the maturing onshore oilfields shifted the focus of operators towards offshore for new ep activities however due to the recent crude oil price slump offshore drilling companies will see weaker revenues over the next few quarters this downfall is a result of the spending cuts and increase in demand for better pricing and terms of the contract negotiations and renewals offshore drilling companies are likely to face a dip in the demand and pricing for services these companies are therefore trying to capitalize on scale improve their operational efficiency and their cost bases global offshore drilling market is expected to grow from usd  billion in  to usd  billion by  at a cagr of  during  asiapacific accounted for the largest market share in  and is projected to grow at a cagr of  during  offshore drilling market has been classified on the basis of applications such as shallow water deepwater and ultradeepwater based operations nearly half of the offshore drilling market is covered by shallow water applications but with the advent of advanced technology the operators are entering into deepwater and ultradeepwater zones moreover due to decreasing production in shallow water basins the large potential of untapped subsea hydrocarbon reserves is driving increased focus in deep water drilling there have been increasing deep water oil discoveries in india africa australia the us russia and norway oil discoveries in africa especially in ghana congo mozambique and angola are creating lucrative business opportunities where offshore drilling market players are trying to focus to enhance their revenue offshore drilling market has also been classified on the basis of service type into offshore contract drilling directional drilling loggingwhiledrilling and measurement while drilling more than half of the offshore drilling market is captured by offshore contract drilling services the market is also witnessing an increase in directional drilling however due to continuous decline of oil price since mid the market has witnessed a drastic setback leading to retirementcold stacking of many of the rigs and delay in the delivery of new rigs several operators have either cancelled or postponed their contracts leading to lower day rates asiapacific is the leading market in the offshore drilling owing to the offshore activities taking place in south china sea china thailand india australia and indonesia are mainly driving growth of the offshore drilling market in the region also liberalization of mexican oil  gas industry is another key driver fueling the demand for offshore drilling market in south america mexico is one of the largest nonopec oil producers in the world with the liberalization state run monopoly has ended paving way for foreign ep companies the recent downturn in the crude oil prices has resulted in the decline of the exploration  production ep activities all over the world as offshore drilling is highly capital intensive industry it was affected more as compared to onshore drilling industry many contracts were cancelled postponed or reworked by companies for rigs rigs still in operation are operating on very low dayrates compared to the rates in the current expenditure in ep has fallen since  but the current capacity reduction is expected to resolve the current demand and supply imbalance of oil and gas thus the price of oil and gas is expected to rise in the future amounting to more capital expenditure on oil and gas ep activities as a result the expected increase in the demand for energy in the future is expected to push the need for optimum exploration  production thus boosting the demand for the offshore drilling across the globe custom market research services we will customize the research for you in case the report listed

productsour flexjoints® are installed on production and export risers of floating production systems the increase in deepwater production has increased the demand for steel catenary risers scr to transport the hydrocarbons  from the subsea wellheads to the production facility and  from the facility to the export pipelines manufactured from a combination of forged steel and elastomeric elements our scr flexjoint® reduces the motioninduced stresses between a floating offshore facility and the riser flexjoints are capable of providing a free angular rotation ±° withstanding pressures in excess of  psi and axial tensions up to  kips our merlin™ and tle connectors improve the efficiency of installing tlp mooring connectors by limiting the number of offshore welds necessary to install the risers commercialized in  with the installation on the exxon augur platform the merlin™ tle connector was the first developed nonrotational connector for use in anchor tendons of tlps with circumferential teeth rather than helical threads the merlin™ connector is madeup and broken out by separating the teeth using hydraulic pressure the use of merlin™ connectors provides for installation efficiencies as the makeup time for merlin™ connectors is a fraction of the time necessary to weld tendons or pipe offshore reducing offshore vessel time and expenditures for operators

than landbased installations due to the remote and harsher environment much of the innovation in the offshore petroleum sector concerns overcoming these challenges including the need to provide very large production facilities production and drilling facilities may be very large and a large investment such as the troll a platform standing on a depth of  meters another type of offshore platform may float with a mooring system to maintain it on location while a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities the ocean can add several thousand meters or more to the fluid column the addition increases the equivalent circulating density and downhole pressures in drilling wells as well as the energy needed to lift produced fluids for separation on the platform the trend today is to conduct more of the production operations subsea by separating water from oil and reinjecting it rather than pumping it up to a platform or by flowing to onshore with no installations visible above the sea subsea installations help to exploit resources at progressively deeper waters—locations which had been inaccessible—and overcome challenges posed by sea ice such as in the barents sea one such challenge in shallower environments is seabed gouging by drifting ice features means of protecting offshore installations against ice action includes burial in the seabed offshore manned facilities also present logistics and human resources challenges an

depths up to  metres  ft in shallower waters the mobile units are anchored to the seabed however in deeper water more than  metres  ft the semisubmersibles or drillships are maintained at the required drilling location using dynamic positioning contents  history  main offshore fields  challenges  effects on the environment  see also  references  external links historyedit around  the first submerged oil wells were drilled from platforms built on piles in the fresh waters of the grand lake st marys aka mercer county reservoir in ohio the wells were developed by small local companies such as bryson riley oil germanamerican and bankers oil around  the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the summerland field extending under the santa barbara channel in california the wells were drilled from piers extending from land out into the channel other notable early submerged drilling activities occurred on the canadian side of lake erie in the s and caddo lake in louisiana in the s shortly thereafter wells were drilled in tidal zones along the texas and louisiana gulf coast the goose creek oil field near baytown texas is one such example in the s drilling activities occurred from concrete platforms in venezuelas lake maracaibo one of the oldest subsea wells is the bibi eibat well which came on stream in  in azerbaijandubious – discuss the well was located on an artificial island in a shallow portion of the caspian sea in the early s the texas co later texaco now chevron developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the gulf of mexico in  pure oil now chevron and its partner superior oil now exxonmobil used a fixed platform to develop a field  mile  km offshore of calcasieu parish louisiana in  feet  m of water in  humble oil built a milelong wooden trestle with railway tracks into the sea at mcfadden beach on the gulf of mexico placing a derrick at its end  this was later destroyed by a hurricane in  concern for american control of its offshore oil reserves caused president harry truman to issue an executive order unilaterally extending american territory to the edge of its continental shelf an act that effectively ended the mile limit freedom of the seas regime in  magnolia petroleum now exxonmobil drilled at a site  miles  km off the coast erecting a platform in  feet  m of water off st mary parish louisiana in early  superior oil erected a drilling and production platform in  feet  m of water some  miles  km off vermilion parish la but it was kerrmcgee oil industries now anadarko petroleum as operator for partners phillips petroleum conocophillips and stanolind oil  gas bp that completed its historic ship shoal block  well in october  months before superior actually drilled a discovery from their vermilion platform farther offshore in any case that made kerrmcgees well the first oil discovery drilled out of sight of land when offshore drilling moved into deeper waters of up to  metres  ft fixed platform rigs were built until demands for drilling equipment was needed in the  feet  m to  metres  ft depth of the gulf of mexico the first jackup rigs began appearing from specialized offshore drilling contractors such as forerunners of ensco international the first semisubmersible resulted from an unexpected observation in  blue water drilling company owned and operated the fourcolumn submersible blue water rig no in the gulf of mexico for shell oil company as the pontoons were not sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of the rig and its consumables it was towed between locations at a draught midway between the top of the pontoons and the underside of the deck it was noticed that the motions at this draught were very small and blue water drilling and shell jointly decided to try operating the rig in the floating mode the concept of an anchored stable floating deepsea platform had been designed and tested back in the s by edward robert armstrong for the purpose of operating aircraft with an invention known as the seadrome the first purposebuilt drilling semisubmersible ocean driller was launched in  since then many semisubmersibles have been purposedesigned for the drilling industry mobile offshore fleet the first offshore drillship was the cuss  developed for the mohole project to drill into the earths crust as of june  there were over  mobile offshore drilling rigs jackups semisubs drillships barges available for service in the competitive rig fleet one of the worlds deepest hubs is currently the perdido in the gulf of mexico floating in  meters of water it is operated by royal dutch shell and was built at a cost of  billion the deepest operational platform is the petrobras america cascade fpso in the walker ridge  field in  meters of water main offshore fieldsedit notable offshore fields include the north sea the gulf of mexico offshore texas louisiana mississippi and alabama california in the los angeles basin and santa barbara channel part of the ventura basin the caspian sea notably some major fields offshore azerbaijan the campos and santos basins off the coasts of brazil newfoundland and nova scotia atlantic canada several fields off west africa most notably west of nigeria and angola offshore fields in south east asia and sakhalin russia major offshore oil fields are located in the persian gulf such as safaniya manifa and marjan which belong to saudi arabia and are developed by saudi aramco fields in india mumbai high k g basineast coast of india tapti field gujarat india the taranaki basin in new zealand challengesedit offshore oil and gas production is more challenging than landbased installations due to the remote and harsher environment much of the innovation in the offshore petroleum sector concerns overcoming these challenges including the need to provide very large production facilities production and drilling facilities may be very large and a large investment such as the troll a platform standing on a depth of  meters another type of offshore platform may float with a mooring system to maintain it on location while a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities the ocean can add several thousand meters or more to the fluid column the addition increases the equivalent circulating density and downhole pressures in drilling wells as well as the energy needed to lift produced fluids for separation on the platform the trend today is to conduct more of the production operations subsea by separating water from oil and reinjecting it rather than pumping it up to a platform or by flowing to onshore with no installations visible above the sea subsea installations help to exploit resources at progressively deeper waters—locations which had been inaccessible—and overcome challenges posed by sea ice such as in the barents sea one such challenge in shallower environments is seabed gouging by drifting ice features means of protecting offshore installations against ice action includes burial in the seabed offshore manned facilities also present logistics and human resources challenges an offshore oil platform is a small community in itself with cafeteria sleeping quarters management and other support functions in the north sea staff members are transported by helicopter for a twoweek shift they usually receive higher salary than onshore workers do supplies and waste are transported by ship and the supply deliveries need to be carefully planned because storage space on the platform is limited today much effort goes into relocating as many of the personnel as possible onshore where management and technical experts are in touch with the platform by video conferencing an onshore job is also more attractive for the aging workforce in the petroleum industry at least in the western world these efforts among others are contained in the established term integrated operations the increased use of subsea facilities helps achieve the objective of keeping more workers onshore subsea facilities are also easier to expand with new separators or different modules for different oil types and are not limited by the fixed floor space of an abovewater installation effects on the environmentedit see also ecological effects of oil platforms offshore oil production involves environmental risks most notably oil spills from oil tankers or pipelines transporting oil from the platform to onshore facilities and from leaks and accidents on the platform produced water is also generated which is water brought to the surface along with the oil and gas it is usually highly saline and may include dissolved or unseparated hydrocarbons see alsoedit deep sea mining deepwater drilling drillship jackup barge offshore geotechnical engineering offshore oil and gas in the united states oil drilling
