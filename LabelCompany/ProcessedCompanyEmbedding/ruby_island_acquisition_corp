from strongest chart to weakest for investors to use and help them gather information Â  risks and uncertainties facing the company Â  as a development stage company the company has no operating history and has continuously experienced losses since its inception the companyâs independent auditors have issued a report questioning the companyâs ability to continue as a going concern that is the company needs to create a source of revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans as a development stage company management of the company has no prior experience in building and selling projects similar to that planned by the company and in marketing and distributing such projects on a broad scale Â  one of the biggest challenges facing the company is the ability to raise adequate capital to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations which it had not been able to accomplish to the date of the report and or obtain additional financing from its stockholders andor other third parties Â  the company has to date conducted limited operations if the company were unable to develop strong and reliable sources of funding for continued operations it is unlikely that the company could develop its operations to return revenue sufficient to further develop its business plan moreover the above assumes that the companyâs efforts are met with customer satisfaction in the marketplace and exhibit steady adoption of its solutions amongst the potential base of customers neither of which are currently known or guaranteed Â  due to these and other factors the companyâs need for additional capital the companyâs independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt of the companyâs ability to continue as a going concern Â  Â  Â   Â  table of contents Â  Â  trading market Â  currently there is no trading market for the securities of the company the company intends to initially apply for admission to quotation of its securities on the otc bulletin board as soon as possible which may be while this offering is still in process there can be no assurance that the company will qualify for quotation of its securities on the otc bulletin board Â  the offering Â  the maximum number of shares that can be sold pursuant to the terms of this offering is  the offering will terminate twentyfour  months from the date of this prospectus unless earlier terminated by the company Â  this prospectus relates to the offer and sale of  shares âsharesâ of common stock of the company by the holders thereof the âselling shareholder sharesâ who are deemed to be statutory underwriters Â  the selling shareholders will offer their shares respectively at a fixed price of  per share for the duration of the offering Â Â  common stock outstanding before the offering Â  Â    Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  common stock for sale by the company Â  Â   Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  common stock for sale by selling shareholders Â  Â   Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  common stock outstanding after the offering Â  Â    Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  offering price Â    per share Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  proceeds to the company Â    Â  Â   based on number of shares outstanding as of the date of this prospectus  assumes the sale of the maximum number of shares Â  Â   Â  table of contents Â  Â  risk factors Â  a purchase of any shares is an investment in the companyâs common stock and involves a high degree of risk investors should consider carefully the following information about these risks together with the other information contained in the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part before the purchase of any shares if any of the following risks actually occur the business financial condition or results of operations of the company would likely suffer the market price of the common stock would likely decline and investors could lose all or a portion of their investment the company has listed the following risk factors which it believes to be that material to an investment decision in this offering Â  the company has no independent operating history and as such an investor cannot assess its profitability or performance but must rely on the experience of its president and other officers Â  the company is a development stage company and has no operating history and it is therefore not possible for an investor to assess prior performance or determine whether it will likely meet its projected business plan such lack of experience may result in the company experiencing difficulty in adequately designing or building any project thereby causing the project to function improperly or provide inadequate utility for which it is intended if the companyâs projects cannot be completed or consistently function improperly or perform below expectations the company will likely be unable to market and sell many of its projects or products an investor will be required to make an investment decision based solely on the managementâs history and its projected operations in light of the risks expenses and uncertainties that may be encountered by engaging in the building and managing of ecological theme parks and producing organically grown food Â  the companyâs independent auditors have issued a report questioning the companyâs ability to continue as a going concern Â  the report of the companyâs independent auditors contained in the companyâs financial statements for the year ended december   includes a paragraph that explains that the company has experienced recurring losses and has an accumulated deficit during the development stage of  these matters raise substantial doubt regarding the companyâs ability to continue as a going concern without the influx of capital through the sale of its securities or through development of its operations Â  the company has an accumulated deficit of  as of march   Â  as of march   the company has an accumulated deficit of  this deficit may impact on the company in various ways including but not limited to making it more difficult to borrow money sell stock or to maintain a good market price Â  the offering price of the shares has been arbitrarily determined and such price should not be used by an investor as an indicator of the fair market value of the shares Â  currently there is no public market for the companyâs common stock the offering price for the shares has been arbitrarily determined and does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the assets operations book or other established criteria of value of the company thus an investor should be aware that the offering price does not reflect the fair market price of the shares Â  reliance on management Â  management will participate in all decisions with respect to the management of the company including without limitation determining business strategy operations and development in the event of the dissolution death retirement or other incapacity of the management the business and operations of the company may be adversely affected Â  the companyâs ceo controls a majority of the outstanding stock Â  the ceo of the company currently beneficially owns more than a majority of the companyâs outstanding common stock as such he controls most matters requiring approval by stockholders including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the companyâs common stock or prevent stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares mr david meyers will retain substantial control over matters requiring approval such as without limitation the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control Â  risksÂ associated withÂ the companyâs reliance on its affiliatedÂ partyâs intellectualÂ property rights and contracts Â  the success of the company isÂ reliant to a large extent on successfully securing rightsÂ via assignment licenseÂ or by other contractual arrangementÂ or transactionÂ to certain software development contracts and intellectual property rights associated therewith currentlyÂ held or under control of affiliated entities of the companyÂ for instance as of the date of this prospectus a la carte charts llc an arizona limited liability company âla carte llcâ of which the companyâs founder david meyers is sole member and  owner has invested  in development of its proprietary software and mobile apps in january and june  pursuant to a twophase development proposal that has been attached as an exhibit to this registration statement la carte llc has engaged vuria llc âvuriaâ an esolutions provider to provide state of the art mobile application development and functionality the âapps developmentâ the apps development includes integrated solutions for iphone and android mobile device platforms including optimal graphic design userfriendly digital architecture and programming the companyâs ability to generate operating capitalÂ and revenueÂ is reliant to a large extent on its ability to exploit theÂ apps developmentÂ however the company to date does not have rightÂ orÂ title to the software and associated appÂ  while the company is confident it will be ableÂ in the near futureÂ to secure rights from la carte llcÂ necessaryÂ to exploit theÂ apps developmentÂ la carte llc is under no legal obligation to go forward with assignmen of its interest in the apps development or otherwiseÂ orÂ la carte llc may go forward with the apps development using other entities affiliated with mr meyersÂ  in the event that the company is unable to secureÂ rightsÂ to the apps development via assignment or otherwiseÂ the companyâsÂ business financial condition and operating resultsÂ may beÂ materially adversely affected Â   Â  table of contents Â  Â  the company will have to compete with an already established and everevolving market Â  within this massive market on a broad scale the company competes with a host of investment websites and traditional brokeragesadvisors that have blogs newsletters websites apps and segments on tv shows although the company believes there doesnât yet exist an exact competitor to itâs a la carte charts product there are similar apps already in the marketplace Â  in addition to brokerage firms the biggest competition is from sites like wwwthestreetcom yahoo finance stocktwits and others that offer subscription services also with the rapidly growing size of the retail investor market new competitors are likely to enter the market robinhood for example is a new crowdsourced investor application that uses a âsocial investingâ algorithm to provide watch lists for popular stocks along with financial articles trends and a personalized stocktrading feed Â  the company will compete for advertising and subscription revenue with the aforementioned competitors and some of alccâs current or potential competitors may have greater resources or better competitive positions in certain areas than the company will which may allow them to respond more effectively than us to new technologies and changes in market conditions we compete for advertising and circulation revenue with both traditional and new content providers this competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of new digital media technologies and new media providers offering online news and other content and new competitors could quickly emerge some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources or better competitive positions in certain areas than we do which may allow them to respond more effectively than us to new technologies and changes in market conditions Â  our ability to compete effectively depends on many factors both within and beyond our control including among others Â  Â  â our ability to continue to deliver highquality investment analysis  information and content that is interesting and relevant to our audience Â  Â  Â  Â  â our ability to develop maintain and monetize our digital and other products Â  Â  Â  Â  â the quantity and activity of our users and our ability to maintain ongoing active users Â  Â  Â  Â  â the popularity usefulness ease of use performance and reliability of our products Â  Â  Â  Â  â the engagement of our potential subscribers with our products Â  Â  Â  Â  â our ability to attract contract retain and motivate talented management software developers professionals and other employees and executives Â  Â  Â  Â  â our ability to manage and grow our operations in a costeffective manner and Â  Â  Â  Â  â our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors Â  our success depends on our ability to respond and adapt to changes in technology and consumer behavior Â  technology in the online trading industry continues to evolve rapidly advances in technology have led to an increasing number of methods for the delivery and consumption of news and other content these developments are driving changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over how they invest Â  changes in technology and consumer behavior pose a number of challenges that could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position for example among others Â  Â  â we may be unable to develop products for mobile devices or other digital platforms that consumers find engaging that work with a variety of operating systems and networks and that achieve a high level of market acceptance Â  Â  Â  Â  â there may be changes in user sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our existing products or concerns related to privacy security or other factors Â  Â  Â  Â  â failure to successfully manage changes in search engine optimization and social media traffic to increase our digital presence and visibility may reduce our traffic levels Â  Â  Â  Â  â we may be unable to maintain or update our technology infrastructure in a way that meets market and consumer demands Â  Â  Â  Â  â the distribution of our content on delivery platforms of third parties may lead to limitations on monetization of our products the loss of control over distribution of our content and loss of a direct relationship with our audience and Â  Â  Â  Â  â we may experience challenges in creating display advertising on mobile devices that does not disrupt the user experience Â  Â   Â  table of contents Â  Â  responding to these changes may require significant investment we may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital products services or opportunities and we may incur expense in building maintaining and evolving our technology infrastructure unless we are able to use new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors and develop in a timely manner compelling new products and services that engage users across platforms our business financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected Â  the inability of the company to retain and grow our user base could adversely affect our results of operations and business Â  revenue from advertising derived from our various consumerfacing and investorfacing products makes up a majority of our total revenue advertising revenue is sensitive to discretionary spending of advertisers in the markets we serve as well as economic conditions to the extent poor economic conditions lead advertising consumers to reduce spending on marketing activities or if our user base does not grow at a rate sufficient to attract or retain demand from advertising consumers our results of operations will be adversely affected Â  failure to execute costcontrol measures successfully could adversely affect our profitability Â  the company intends to deploy a strategy that will reduce operating costs by maintaining minimal staff and overhead and contracting out software development and other necessary functions however if we do not achieve expected savings or our operating costs increase as a result of investments in strategic initiatives our total operating costs would be greater than anticipated in addition if we do not manage costreduction efforts properly such efforts may affect the quality of our products and therefore our ability to generate future revenues whatâs more significant portions of our expenses are fixed costs that will neither increase nor decrease proportionately with revenues if we are not able to implement further costcontrol efforts or reduce our fixed costs sufficiently in response to a decline in our revenues our results of operations will be adversely affected Â  security breaches and other network and information systems disruptions could affect our ability to conduct our business effectively Â  our online systems shall store and process confidential subscriber employee and other sensitive personal data and therefore maintaining our network security is of critical importance we shall use thirdparty technology and systems for a variety of operations including encryption and authentication technology employee email domain name registration content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions our systems and those of third parties upon which our business relies may be vulnerable to interruption or damage that can result from natural disasters fires power outages acts of terrorism or other similar events or from deliberate attacks such as computer hacking computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing such an event could result in a disruption of our services or improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information which could harm our reputation require us to expend resources to remedy such a security breach or defend against further attacks divert managementâs attention and resources or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased operating costs or loss of revenue Â  legislative and regulatory developments including with respect to privacy could adversely affect our business Â  our business is subject to government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate and our apps which we intend to make available worldwide may be subject to laws regulating the internet even in jurisdictions where we do not do business we may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply Â  revenues from our digital products could be adversely affected directly or indirectly in particular by existing or future laws and regulations relating to online privacy and the collection and use of consumer data in digital media in addition any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any datarelated requirements could result in claims against us by governmental entities or others or could require us to change our practices which could adversely affect our business Â  Â   Â  table of contents Â  Â  if the company fails to successfully execute its growth strategies it may not be able to attract sufficient subscription or purchase of its products to obtain significant market share Â  the success of the companyâs business depends primarily on subscription andor purchase of our products from digitally savvy investors and traders who seek out actionable daily information for the burgeoning selfdirected market therefore the companyâs ability to deliver an easytouse resourceful and engaging product is critical to the success and growth of the company this in turn will depend on several factors including alccâs ability to successfully execute its growth strategies to develop new products and enhance existing products to respond to developments in the industry and investor and trader demands while the companyâs founder mr meyers is a renowned âcommon manâsâ investment advisor having been a proprietary investor since  and having run an online newsletter publication for the âcommon manâ since  plus having made several appearances on radio and cnbc for his stock picks and market insights there is still no assurance that this experience will translate to the companyâs brand or that the company will be able to maintain or increase demand based on its founderâs prior successes and acclaim if the company fails to successfully execute its growth strategies it may not be able to sufficiently attract subscriptions and alcc may have to significantly decrease prices and revenues profitability and business prospects may be materially and adversely affected Â  no assurance of commercial feasibility Â  even if the companyâs plans and projects are successfully initiated there can be no assurance that such plans and projects will have any commercial success or advantage also there is no assurance that the companyâs products will perform as intended in the marketplace Â  investors in the offering may experience immediate dilution of the value of their shares Â  purchasers of the shares may experience immediate dilution in the value of their shares dilution represents the difference between the price per share paid by investors  and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of the offering net tangible book value per share is the net tangible assets of the company total assets less total liabilities less intangible assets divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding thus if at some other time shares had been sold by the company at a price less than the  paid by purchasers of the shares or had been issued by the company for services or as other noncash consideration then the value of such investor shares immediately after purchase would be less than the  purchase price Â  there has been no prior public market for the companyâs common stock and the lack of such a market may make resale of the shares difficult Â  no prior public market has existed for the companyâs securities and the company cannot assure any purchaser that a market will develop subsequent to this offering the company intends to apply for quotation of its common stock on the otc bulletin board however the company does not know if it will be successful in such application how long such application will take or if successful that a market for the common stock will ever develop or continue on that or any other trading market if for any reason a trading market for the shares does not develop investors may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so Â  the companyâs election not to opt out of jobs act extended accounting transition period may not make its financial statements easily comparable to other companies Â  pursuant to the jobs act of  as an emerging growth company the company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the pcaob or the sec the company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies the company as an emerging growth company can adopt the standard for the private company this may make comparison of the companyâs financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used Â  the companyâs stock may be considered a penny stock and any investment in the companyâs stock will be considered a highrisk investment and subject to restrictions on marketability Â  if the shares commence trading the trading price of the companyâs common stock may be below  per share if the price of the common stock is below such level trading in its common stock would be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended these rules require additional disclosure by brokerdealers in connection with any trades generally involving any nonnasdaq equity security that has a market price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions such rules require the delivery before any penny stock transaction of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors generally institutions for these types of transactions the brokerdealer must determine the suitability of the penny stock for the purchaser and receive the purchaserâs written consent to the transactions before sale the additional burdens imposed upon brokerdealers by such requirements may discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in the companyâs common stock which could impact the liquidity of the companyâs common stock Â  little experience in being a public company Â  the company is an earlystage company and as such has little experience in managing a public company such lack of experience may result in the company experiencing difficulty in adequately operating and growing its business further the company may be hampered by lack of experience in addressing the issues and considerations which are common to growing companies if the companyâs operating or management abilities consistently perform below expectations the companyâs business is unlikely to thrive Â  Â   Â  table of contents Â  Â  the company is an earlystage company with no developed finance and accounting organization and the rigorous demands of being a public company require a structured and developed finance and accounting group as a reporting company the company is already subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  however the requirements of these laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder entail significant accounting legal and financial compliance costs which may be prohibitive to the company as it develops its business plan services and scope these costs have made and will continue to make some activities more difficult time consuming or costly and may place significant strain on its personnel systems and resources Â  the securities exchange act requires among other things that companies maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in order to maintain the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required as a result managementâs attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on the development of the companyâs business financial condition and results of operations Â  these rules and regulations may also make it difficult and expensive for the company to obtain director and officer liability insurance if the company is unable to obtain adequate director and officer insurance its ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors especially those directors who may be deemed independent will be significantly curtailed Â  the board of directors could use the issuance or designation of preferred stock to impede or discourage an acquisition of the company that may otherwise be beneficial to some shareholders Â  the company is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock the issuance of shares of preferred stock or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal for instance the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders in addition under certain circumstances the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock although the companyâs board of directors is required to make any determination to issue such preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of the stockholders of the company the board of directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some or a majority of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock the board of directors does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock unless otherwise required by law or otherwise Â  the company may not be able to obtain additional funds to finance its operations on terms acceptable or at all and if alcc does raise funds the value of investment in the company may be negatively impacted Â  the companyâs business operations may require expenditures that exceed its available capital resources although the company currently does not expect that it will incur substantial debt to finance its future growth to the extent that its funding requirements exceeds its financial resources alcc will be required to seek additional financing or to defer planned expenditures there is no assurance that the company can obtain additional funds on terms acceptable or at all Â  in addition if the company raises additional funds by equity financing investorsâ equity interest in the company may be diluted if alcc raises additional funds by incurring debt obligations it may be subject to various covenants under the relevant debt instruments that may among other things restrict its ability to pay dividends servicing such debt obligations could also be burdensome to its operations if the company fails to service the debt obligations or is unable to comply with the covenants it could be in default under the debt obligations and its liquidity and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected Â  the registrant currently does not hold any intellectual property protection and has not applied for any patents the registrant may decide in the future to pursue further efforts to protect its intellectual property trade secrets and proprietary methods and processes Â  litigation risk Â

to locate brokerdealers or selling agents to participate in the sale of the shares in such cases the company will pay customary selling commissions and expenses of such sales which would reduce the proceeds to the company Â  any and all funds received by the company for sales of shares by the company at any time in the offering will become immediately available to the company there is no fixed amount or number of shares that must be reached or sold before any closing or use of any funds can occur Â  Â   Â  table of contents Â  Â  risk factors Â  a purchase of any shares is an investment in the companyâs common stock and involves a high degree of risk investors should consider carefully the following information about these risks together with the other information contained in the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part before the purchase of any shares if any of the following risks actually occur the business financial condition or results of operations of the company would likely suffer the market price of the common stock would likely decline and investors could lose all or a portion of their investment the company has listed the following risk factors which it believes to be that material to an investment decision in this offering Â  the company has no independent operating history and as such an investor cannot assess its profitability or performance but must rely on the experience of its president and other officers Â  the company is a development stage company and has no operating history and it is therefore not possible for an investor to assess prior performance or determine whether it will likely meet its projected business plan such lack of experience may result in the company experiencing difficulty in adequately designing or building any project thereby causing the project to function improperly or provide inadequate utility for which it is intended if the companyâs projects cannot be completed or consistently function improperly or perform below expectations the company will likely be unable to market and sell many of its projects or products an investor will be required to make an investment decision based solely on the managementâs history and its projected operations in light of the risks expenses and uncertainties that may be encountered by engaging in the building and managing of ecological theme parks and producing organically grown food Â  the companyâs independent auditors have issued a report questioning the companyâs ability to continue as a going concern Â  the report of the companyâs independent auditors contained in the companyâs financial statements for the year ended december   includes a paragraph that explains that the company has experienced recurring losses and has an accumulated deficit during the development stage of  these matters raise substantial doubt regarding the companyâs ability to continue as a going concern without the influx of capital through the sale of its securities or through development of its operations Â  the company has an accumulated deficit of  as of march   Â  as of march   the company has an accumulated deficit of  this deficit may impact on the company in various ways including but not limited to making it more difficult to borrow money sell stock or to maintain a good market price Â  the offering price of the shares has been arbitrarily determined and such price should not be used by an investor as an indicator of the fair market value of the shares Â  currently there is no public market for the companyâs common stock the offering price for the shares has been arbitrarily determined and does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the assets operations book or other established criteria of value of the company thus an investor should be aware that the offering price does not reflect the fair market price of the shares Â  reliance on management Â  management will participate in all decisions with respect to the management of the company including without limitation determining business strategy operations and development in the event of the dissolution death retirement or other incapacity of the management the business and operations of the company may be adversely affected Â  the companyâs ceo controls a majority of the outstanding stock Â  the ceo of the company currently beneficially owns more than a majority of the companyâs outstanding common stock as such he controls most matters requiring approval by stockholders including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the companyâs common stock or prevent stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares mr david meyers will retain substantial control over matters requiring approval such as without limitation the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control Â  the company will have to compete with an already established and everevolving market Â  within this massive market on a broad scale the company competes with a host of investment websites and traditional brokeragesadvisors that have blogs newsletters websites apps and segments on tv shows although the company believes there doesnât yet exist an exact competitor to itâs a la carte charts product there are similar apps already in the marketplace Â  in addition to brokerage firms the biggest competition is from sites like wwwthestreetcom yahoo finance stocktwits and others that offer subscription services also with the rapidly growing size of the retail investor market new competitors are likely to enter the market robinhood for example is a new crowdsourced investor application that uses a âsocial investingâ algorithm to provide watch lists for popular stocks along with financial articles trends and a personalized stocktrading feed Â  Â   Â  table of contents Â  Â  the company will compete for advertising and subscription revenue with the aforementioned competitors and some of alccâs current or potential competitors may have greater resources or better competitive positions in certain areas than the company will which may allow them to respond more effectively than us to new technologies and changes in market conditions we compete for advertising and circulation revenue with both traditional and new content providers this competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of new digital media technologies and new media providers offering online news and other content and new competitors could quickly emerge some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources or better competitive positions in certain areas than we do which may allow them to respond more effectively than us to new technologies and changes in market conditions Â  our ability to compete effectively depends on many factors both within and beyond our control including among others Â  Â  â our ability to continue to deliver highquality investment analysis  information and content that is interesting and relevant to our audience Â  Â  Â  Â  â our ability to develop maintain and monetize our digital and other products Â  Â  Â  Â  â the quantity and activity of our users and our ability to maintain ongoing active users Â  Â  Â  Â  â the popularity usefulness ease of use performance and reliability of our products Â  Â  Â  Â  â the engagement of our potential subscribers with our products Â  Â  Â  Â  â our ability to attract contract retain and motivate talented management software developers professionals and other employees and executives Â  Â  Â  Â  â our ability to manage and grow our operations in a costeffective manner and Â  Â  Â  Â  â our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors Â  our success depends on our ability to respond and adapt to changes in technology and consumer behavior Â  technology in the online trading industry continues to evolve rapidly advances in technology have led to an increasing number of methods for the delivery and consumption of news and other content these developments are driving changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over how they invest Â  changes in technology and consumer behavior pose a number of challenges that could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position for example among others Â  Â  â we may be unable to develop products for mobile devices or other digital platforms that consumers find engaging that work with a variety of operating systems and networks and that achieve a high level of market acceptance Â  Â  Â  Â  â there may be changes in user sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our existing products or concerns related to privacy security or other factors Â  Â  Â  Â  â failure to successfully manage changes in search engine optimization and social media traffic to increase our digital presence and visibility may reduce our traffic levels Â  Â  Â  Â  â we may be unable to maintain or update our technology infrastructure in a way that meets market and consumer demands Â  Â  Â  Â  â the distribution of our content on delivery platforms of third parties may lead to limitations on monetization of our products the loss of control over distribution of our content and loss of a direct relationship with our audience and Â  Â  Â  Â  â we may experience challenges in creating display advertising on mobile devices that does not disrupt the user experience Â  responding to these changes may require significant investment we may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital products services or opportunities and we may incur expense in building maintaining and evolving our technology infrastructure unless we are able to use new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors and develop in a timely manner compelling new products and services that engage users across platforms our business financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected Â  Â   Â  table of contents Â  Â  the inability of the company to retain and grow our user base could adversely affect our results of operations and business Â  revenue from advertising derived from our various consumerfacing and investorfacing products makes up a majority of our total revenue advertising revenue is sensitive to discretionary spending of advertisers in the markets we serve as well as economic conditions to the extent poor economic conditions lead advertising consumers to reduce spending on marketing activities or if our user base does not grow at a rate sufficient to attract or retain demand from advertising consumers our results of operations will be adversely affected Â  failure to execute costcontrol measures successfully could adversely affect our profitability Â  the company intends to deploy a strategy that will reduce operating costs by maintaining minimal staff and overhead and contracting out software development and other necessary functions however if we do not achieve expected savings or our operating costs increase as a result of investments in strategic initiatives our total operating costs would be greater than anticipated in addition if we do not manage costreduction efforts properly such efforts may affect the quality of our products and therefore our ability to generate future revenues whatâs more significant portions of our expenses are fixed costs that will neither increase nor decrease proportionately with revenues if we are not able to implement further costcontrol efforts or reduce our fixed costs sufficiently in response to a decline in our revenues our results of operations will be adversely affected Â  security breaches and other network and information systems disruptions could affect our ability to conduct our business effectively Â  our online systems shall store and process confidential subscriber employee and other sensitive personal data and therefore maintaining our network security is of critical importance we shall use thirdparty technology and systems for a variety of operations including encryption and authentication technology employee email domain name registration content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions our systems and those of third parties upon which our business relies may be vulnerable to interruption or damage that can result from natural disasters fires power outages acts of terrorism or other similar events or from deliberate attacks such as computer hacking computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing such an event could result in a disruption of our services or improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information which could harm our reputation require us to expend resources to remedy such a security breach or defend against further attacks divert managementâs attention and resources or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased operating costs or loss of revenue Â  legislative and regulatory developments including with respect to privacy could adversely affect our business Â  our business is subject to government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate and our apps which we intend to make available worldwide may be subject to laws regulating the internet even in jurisdictions where we do not do business we may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply Â  revenues from our digital products could be adversely affected directly or indirectly in particular by existing or future laws and regulations relating to online privacy and the collection and use of consumer data in digital media in addition any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any datarelated requirements could result in claims against us by governmental entities or others or could require us to change our practices which could adversely affect our business Â  Â   Â  table of contents Â  Â  if the company fails to successfully execute its growth strategies it may not be able to attract sufficient subscription or purchase of its products to obtain significant market share Â  the success of the companyâs business depends primarily on subscription andor purchase of our products from digitally savvy investors and traders who seek out actionable daily information for the burgeoning selfdirected market therefore the companyâs ability to deliver an easytouse resourceful and engaging product is critical to the success and growth of the company this in turn will depend on several factors including alccâs ability to successfully execute its growth strategies to develop new products and enhance existing products to respond to developments in the industry and investor and trader demands while the companyâs founder mr meyers is a renowned âcommon manâsâ investment advisor having been a proprietary investor since  and having run an online newsletter publication for the âcommon manâ since  plus having made several appearances on radio and cnbc for his stock picks and market insights there is still no assurance that this experience will translate to the companyâs brand or that the company will be able to maintain or increase demand based on its founderâs prior successes and acclaim if the company fails to successfully execute its growth strategies it may not be able to sufficiently attract subscriptions and alcc may have to significantly decrease prices and revenues profitability and business prospects may be materially and adversely affected Â  no assurance of commercial feasibility Â  even if the companyâs plans and projects are successfully initiated there can be no assurance that such plans and projects will have any commercial success or advantage also there is no assurance that the companyâs products will perform as intended in the marketplace Â  investors in the offering may experience immediate dilution of the value of their shares Â  purchasers of the shares may experience immediate dilution in the value of their shares dilution represents the difference between the price per share paid by investors  and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of the offering net tangible book value per share is the net tangible assets of the company total assets less total liabilities less intangible assets divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding thus if at some other time shares had been sold by the company at a price less than the  paid by purchasers of the shares or had been issued by the company for services or as other noncash consideration then the value of such investor shares immediately after purchase would be less than the  purchase price Â  there has been no prior public market for the companyâs common stock and the lack of such a market may make resale of the shares difficult Â  no prior public market has existed for the companyâs securities and the company cannot assure any purchaser that a market will develop subsequent to this offering the company intends to apply for quotation of its common stock on the otc bulletin board however the company does not know if it will be successful in such application how long such application will take or if successful that a market for the common stock will ever develop or continue on that or any other trading market if for any reason a trading market for the shares does not develop investors may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so Â  the companyâs election not to opt out of jobs act extended accounting transition period may not make its financial statements easily comparable to other companies Â  pursuant to the jobs act of  as an emerging growth company the company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the pcaob or the sec the company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies the company as an emerging growth company can adopt the standard for the private company this may make comparison of the companyâs financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used Â  the companyâs stock may be considered a penny stock and any investment in the companyâs stock will be considered a highrisk investment and subject to restrictions on marketability Â  if the shares commence trading the trading price of the companyâs common stock may be below  per share if the price of the common stock is below such level trading in its common stock would be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended these rules require additional disclosure by brokerdealers in connection with any trades generally involving any nonnasdaq equity security that has a market price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions such rules require the delivery before any penny stock transaction of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors generally institutions for these types of transactions the brokerdealer must determine the suitability of the penny stock for the purchaser and receive the purchaserâs written consent to the transactions before sale the additional burdens imposed upon brokerdealers by such requirements may discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in the companyâs common stock which could impact the liquidity of the companyâs common stock Â  little experience in being a public company Â  the company is an earlystage company and as such has little experience in managing a public company such lack of experience may result in the company experiencing difficulty in adequately operating and growing its business further the company may be hampered by lack of experience in addressing the issues and considerations which are common to growing companies if the companyâs operating or management abilities consistently perform below expectations the companyâs business is unlikely to thrive Â  Â   Â  table of contents Â  Â  the company is an earlystage company with no developed finance and accounting organization and the rigorous demands of being a public company require a structured and developed finance and accounting group as a reporting company the company is already subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  however the requirements of these laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder entail significant accounting legal and financial compliance costs which may be prohibitive to the company as it develops its business plan services and scope these costs have made and will continue to make some activities more difficult time consuming or costly and may place significant strain on its personnel systems and resources Â  the securities exchange act requires among other things that companies maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in order to maintain the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required as a result managementâs attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on the development of the companyâs business financial condition and results of operations Â  these rules and regulations may also make it difficult and expensive for the company to obtain director and officer liability insurance if the company is unable to obtain adequate director and officer insurance its ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors especially those directors who may be deemed independent will be significantly curtailed Â  the board of directors could use the issuance or designation of preferred stock to impede or discourage an acquisition of the company that may otherwise be beneficial to some shareholders Â  the company is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock the issuance of shares of preferred stock or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal for instance the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders in addition under certain circumstances the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock although the companyâs board of directors is required to make any determination to issue such preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of the stockholders of the company the board of directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some or a majority of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock the board of directors does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock unless otherwise required by law or otherwise Â  the company may not be able to obtain additional funds to finance its operations on terms acceptable or at all and if alcc does raise funds the value of investment in the company may be negatively impacted Â  the companyâs business operations may require expenditures that exceed its available capital resources although the company currently does not expect that it will incur substantial debt to finance its future growth to the extent that its funding requirements exceeds its financial resources alcc will be required to seek additional financing or to defer planned expenditures there is no assurance that the company can obtain additional funds on terms acceptable or at all Â  in addition if the company raises additional funds by equity financing investorsâ equity interest in the company may be diluted if alcc raises additional funds by incurring debt obligations it may be subject to various covenants under the relevant debt instruments that may among other things restrict its ability to pay dividends servicing such debt obligations could also be burdensome to its operations if the company fails to service the debt obligations or is unable to comply with the covenants it could be in default under the debt obligations and its liquidity and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected Â  the registrant currently does not hold any intellectual property protection and has not applied for any patents the registrant may decide in the future to pursue further efforts to protect its intellectual property trade secrets and proprietary methods and processes Â  litigation risk Â  the company does not have any business liability disruption or litigation insurance and any business disruption or litigation the company experiences might result in it incurring substantial costs and diversion of resources Â  broad indemnification provided to management Â  the governing documents of the company limit the liability of and provide indemnification for the management and the respective directors officers employees and agents of the company and the management the indemnification provided is to the full extent permitted under applicable delaware law those provisions may limit certain rights of the shareholders against such parties and moreover an indemnification by the company of the management or any indemnified individual may result in substantial outofpocket costs and expenses payable by the company if the company is forced to provide indemnification for any of these indemnified parties it is possible that the assets of the company could become depleted or the company may otherwise suffer a material adverse financial consequence as a result of its indemnity obligations as of the date of this memorandum to the knowledge of the company there is no pending litigation or proceeding that exists involving a director officer employee or agent of the management or the company where indemnification will be required or permitted Â  Â   Â  table of contents Â  Â  limited transferability of shares Â  there is no public market for the shares while the company intends to develop a public market in the future there can be no assurance if or when such a market would be expected to develop in the future even if a potential buyer could be found the

declare and pay dividends there can be no assurance with respect to the amount and timing of any dividends other than to the shareholders or that they will ever be made future dividends will be determined by the management of the company in light of prevailing financial conditions earnings if any as well as other relevant factors Â  unforeseen changes Â  while the company has enumerated certain material risk factors herein it is impossible to know all risks which may arise in the future in particular shareholders may be negatively affected by changes in any of the following i laws rules and regulations ii regional national andor global economic factors iii the capacity circumstances and relationships of partners of the company or the management or iv general changes in financial or capital markets Â  the company continuously encounters changes in its operating environment and the company may have fewer resources than many of its competitors to continue to adjust to those changes the operating environment of the company is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of laws regulations competitors market approaches and economic impacts future success will depend in part upon the ability of the company to adapt to those changes and providing products and services that will satisfy the demands of their respective businesses and projects many of the competitors have substantially greater resources to adapt to those changes the company may not effectively react to all of the changes in its operating environment or be successful in adapting its products and approach Â  arbitration Â  by execution of the subscription agreement for purchase of the shares investors in this offering agree to submit to arbitration all claims arising from their investment arbitration may not afford investors all the relief they might obtain outside arbitration arbitration narrows procedural and other steps available to claimants such as discovery broad choice of venue and scope of appellate review and is in general a more informal process than court action on the other hand arbitration is normally a less expensive process for a claimant than court action and normally results in a quicker final decision however investors may find that as a result of arbitration they are more restricted in the resolution of claims if any arising from this

including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes if any tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than  percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained in accordance with the guidance of asc  the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which based on all available evidence management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes if any tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than  percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying condensed balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination Â  earnings loss per common share the company computes net earnings loss per share in accordance with asc  â earnings per shareâ  asc  requires presentation of both basic and diluted net earnings per share âepsâ on the

period diluted eps gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible note and preferred stock using the ifconverted method in computing diluted eps the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants diluted eps excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is antidilutive at march   and december   there were no convertible notes options or warrants available for conversion that if exercised may
