leaders in the area in regards to implementing an enhanced recovery program for their patients historically patients have been ill informed about their surgery and what to expect in addition surgical care was fragmented into several phases of care that did not communicate with each other preoperative care surgical care anesthesia care postoperative hospital care and postoperative home care the surgeons at colon rectal specialists have been leaders in creating a program that integrates all phases of care through an enhanced recovery program the patients are empowered to take control of their care information regarding smoking cessation and the benefits of exercise prior to surgery are provided as well as helpful tools to achieve those goals patients are also given healthy expectation of what to expect during and after their hospitalization along with nurses therapists anesthesiologists care is provided in a coordinated manner to ensure minimal narcotic medication use and a healthy recovery for the patient throughout the world programs such as this has proven to show reduced complications after surgery shorter hospitalizations quicker return from surgery reduced readmissions to the hospital and overall better patient satisfaction which is the ultimate goal at colon rectal specialists when scheduling your surgery please ask your surgeon about the eras programcolonoscopysigmoidoscopy is similar to colonoscopy but is restricted to the last  feet of the colon and goes no farther it is usually performed on younger patients who don’t clinically require a colonoscopy sigmoidoscopy provides a direct visualization of the lining of the colon and rectum if anything unusual is detected – such as a polyp or inflamed tissue – a biopsy can be taken and sent for evaluationconstipationirritable bowel syndromethese inflammatory conditions should be distinguished from irritable bowel syndrome ibs which is a functional bowel disorder where there is no evidence of bowel inflammation to correspond to a patients symptomsurinary incontinencea rectocele may be present without any other abnormalities in some cases a rectocele may be part of a more generalized weakness of pelvic support and may exist along with a cystocele urethrocele and enterocele or with uterine or vaginal prolapse rectal prolapse and fecal or urinary incontinencediarrheaincontinence is the impaired ability to control gas or stool and it ranges from mild difficulty with gas control to severe loss of control over liquid and formed stools incontinence to stool is a common problem but one that’s rarely discussed in public both bladder and bowel incontinence are problems that tend to increase with ageneurologistsmultiple sclerosisthere may be several causes including inadequate intake of both fiber and fluid constipation may be aggravated by travel pregnancy or change in diet and in some people it may occur as the result of repeatedly ignoring the urge to have a bowel movement other more serious causes include narrowing of the colon or growths in the bowel certain thyroid diseases such as under active thyroid plus disorders of the nervous system such as multiple sclerosis or parkinson’s disease also many medications – including pain killers antidepressants blood pressure medicine iron or calcium supplements and antacids containing aluminum – can cause constipation that’s why it’s important to talk to us if constipation persists for several weeks – and sooner if blood appears in your stoolradiologistxrayscomputed tomographycheckups may include a physical exam including a digital rectal exam lab tests including fecal occult blood test and cea test colonoscopy xrays ct scans or other testschemotherapysystemic therapy chemotherapy and biological therapy are systemic therapies the drugs enter the bloodstream and destroy or control cancer throughout the bodyradiation therapylocal therapy surgery and radiation therapy are local therapies they remove or destroy cancer in or near the colon or rectum when colorectal cancer has spread to other parts of the body local therapy may be used to control the disease in those specific areasultrasounda physical exam of the anal region should be performed because it may identify an obvious injury to the anal muscles in a test called manometry a small catheter is placed into the anus to record pressure as patients relax and tighten the anal muscles this test reveals the strength of the muscle a separate test may also be conducted to determine if the nerves that go to the anal muscles are functioning properly finally an ultrasound probe can be used within the anal area to provide a picture of the muscles and show areas in which the anal muscles have been injuredinternistscolon cancerthe colon is susceptible to several problems the most severe of which is colon cancer however other problems can occur that result in painful symptoms many of these diseases can be treated successfully or prevented altogether that’s why regular screening is so importantendoscopya critical step in the patient’s evaluation involves examination of the intestine with a fiberoptic instrument called a colonoscope under light sedation the entire large intestine can be inspected and biopsies can be performed for microscopic evaluation usually the most terminal portion of the small intestine can be visualized as well occasionally colonoscopy might be supplemented by xray testing or even “capsule endoscopy” which has caught the public’s imagination as the “camera pill”surgeonsminimally invasive surgeryminimally invasive surgery mis is an advanced technique of surgery that uses a series of small incisions that allows the surgeon to perform surgery through small channels called ports it allows the surgeon to look inside of a person through a fiber optic camera and perform the necessary surgery without having to create a large incision the obvious benefits of minimally invasive surgery is smaller incisions less pain shorter hospital stays a quicker return to normal activities and decreased costs   despite the obvious benefits mis is technically challenging and so recent data shows that less only than  of colorectal surgery is being performed via a minimally invasive technique colon rectal specialists has been early adopters in these techniques for the sake of their patients and has been performing minimally invasive colon surgery for more than  years if in need of colorectal surgery please consult with one of our board certified surgeons about laparoscopic minimally invasive surgeryrobotic surgerythe newest form of minimally invasive surgery these days is robotic surgery though it is a fairly new platform the surgeons at colon rectal surgery have more than  years of experience providing surgery with some of the newest and greatest technology available the beauty of robotic surgery is that it has allowed us to perform surgeries in a minimally invasive way that may not have been feasible before the robotic platform provides the surgeon with better visualization during surgery more flexible wristed movement of instruments for better control and the ability to access very difficult areas for delicate surgery please contact us to see if robotic colon and rectal surgery would be of benefit to youhysterectomyin addition a history of constipation and straining with bowel movements or hysterectomy may contribute to the development of a rectocele commonly these problems develop with age but they may occasionally occur in younger women or in those that have not delivered childrenlaparoscopylaparoscopy using minimally invasive techniques select colon cancers may be removed with the aid of the laparoscope three or four tiny cuts are made into your abdomen the surgeon sees inside your abdomen with the laparoscope the tumor and lymph nodes with a margin of normal tissue are removed the surgeon checks the rest of your abdomen to see if the cancer has spreadgynecologistspregnancylabor and deliverythere are many causes of incontinence one of the most common being injury during childbirth such an injury may cause a separation in the anal muscles and a decrease in muscle strength also the nerves supplying the anal muscles may also be injured some of these injuries may become apparent immediately following childbirth others however can go unnoticed until later in lifedermatologistseczemapsoriasisother rare causes of anal itching may include pinworms psoriasis eczema dermatitis homorrhoids anal fissures and infections and allergiesphysical therapistsphysical therapyas many as  million americans about  in  are affected by fecal or bowel incontinence symptoms can be varied resulting in stool urgency lack of sensation anal leakage staining of underwear and a full loss of control leading to the need for adult diapers it is often an embarrassing topic for patients to mention to friends family members and even to their own doctors so it tends to go undiagnosed for many years there have been many therapies over the years sometimes dietary therapy and physical therapy to help build pelvic floor muscles is all that is needed but often that is not enough colon rectal specialists now offers a new and exciting therapy called sacral nerve neuromodulation delivered by interstim® therapy to manage chronic bowel incontinence this device consists of a wire and an implantable pacemakerlike device that is placed by the surgeon the interstim device delivers tiny electrical pulses to pelvic nerves which help the brain and nerves to communicate so the bowel pelvic floor and related muscles can function and interact correctly prior to permanent implantation

go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have they must take the time to discuss and address your worriesexpertise level if youre going in for surgery you want someone that knows what theyre doing and has a high success rate ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it this will give you peace of mind that youre in capable handsunderstanding your insuranceyour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have you may have insurance through employment your spouse your parents if youre under  or the marketplace if the previous options dont apply to you its important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what youll need to pay foryour insurance will have a deductible which is the amount that youre responsible to pay for covered medical expenses some plans have coinsurances where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill and insurance will cover the rest copays state a flat rate for certain services like paying  when you visit your gp or a  copay for an emergency room visit once you reach your outofpocket maximum which will differ if youre an individual or within a family plan your insurance may pay for  percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan yearif you plan to go to the doctor need medication or have been recommended for surgery call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers you can choose the best doctor for your needs understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expensessetting your appointmentmost doctors require a phone call for an appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on we just redesigned ypcom do you like it× likenot a fan× thank youfeedback
