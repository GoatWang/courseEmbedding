beat down brian feroldi tmftypeoh feb   at pm what radius health nasdaqrdus a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing products that treat osteoporosis and other endocrinemediated diseases had a rough january the companys shares lost  of their value during the month according to data from sp capital iq so what despite the huge share price swoon radius actually had some good news to share with investors during the month two news items in particular are worth highlighting first radius health presented at the jp morgan healthcare conference where it gave investors an update on what they should expect from the company in  radius confirmed that it has already submitted abaloparatide sc its compound for treating osteoporosis for regulatory approval in europe and management remains committed to having the drug in the fdas hands by the end of this quarter the company also confirmed that it is still actively looking for a partner as it prepares for a commercial launch second radius announced that it has entered into a worldwide clinical collaboration with pharma giant novartis nysenvs to evaluate its potential cancer compound rad for use alongside novartis investigational drug lee the companies will study the two compounds ability to treat breast cancer the terms of the agreement both radius and novartis will contribute resources and supply compound material necessary for the studies to be conducted and they will share thirdparty outofpocket research and development expenses now what investors who are bullish on abaloparatide scs market potential should do their best to ignore the stocks seemingly arbitrary huge price drop and focus on radius healths longterm potential its estimated that two million osteoporosisrelated bone fractures happen each year in the us alone which is a huge market opportunity mixing in the news about its new collaboration deal with novartis should only add additional upside potential to the companys future so investors with a
