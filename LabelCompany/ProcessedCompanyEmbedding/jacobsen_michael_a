by michaeljacobsenmarketingin branding business digital media marketing uncategorized by michael jacobsen digital marketing expert from toronto they are everywhere you can’t escape them spinning around on fingers and spinning on the minds of many consumers fidget spinners has caused quiet a stir or should i say spin in the last few months to kids everywhere for those of you who live under a rock fidget spinners are a piece of plastic with holes in them that you flick to spin sounds simple they were created to help people with attention deficit and other special needs concentrate in school since then they have taken off and are being spun by millions of kids around the world a simple product that took the world by storm here are  things that marketers can learn from the fidget spinner be universal the cool thing with the fidget spinner is that anyone can use it people of all ages can take their finger and flick the plastic to watch it spin marketers need to be able to reach out to their target audience but they also need to make their message universal you want your message to be able to understand and available to anyone they could have marketed the fidget spinners as a toy to cope with adhd but instead made it more universal  build brand ambassadors i have never seen an ad for fidget spinners on tv i don’t think i saw any ads online so how did i hear about them i heard about them from the news media and friends with kids other people built up a reputation for the product and finally i caved in and bought one the company never used an ad on me they let other people build up the product news media ate it up and really helped the fidget spinner become what it is today it’s always best to let other people do the marketing for you reach out to influencers and the rest will be easy  keep it simple the interesting thing about the fidget spinner is that it doesn’t have any electronics in it nowadays almost all toys or things we use are connected to wifi and needs to be charged up but not the fidget spinner it’s so simple people like simple things and same with marketing don’t overhype or add all this razzle dazzle just be authentic and understandable
