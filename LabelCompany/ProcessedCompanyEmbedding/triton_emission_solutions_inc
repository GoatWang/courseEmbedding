proprietary and proven technology as its foundation by integrating this proven platform with additional new proprietary technologies which react and release the sulfur in the fuel our dsox system is able to scrub and wash the sulfur from the fuel njord exhaust gas scrubber system the njord exhaust gas scrubber is the latest addition to our emission control solution for the maritime industry njord is a hybrid exhaust gas scrubber that can operate in either in a closed loop configuration or as an open loop configuration adding to its flexibility triton’s njord can be used either as a standalone solution or as a complement to the dsox fuel desulfurization system clean you can bank on with our dsox technology we have found a way to make this happen as a byproduct the system also removes other harmful alkali metals such as vanadium sodium and calcium the dsox system works by creating an emulsion of fuel and process water which is injected into the unit under high pressure this process releases the sulfur from the fuel making it possible to mix with the water upon completion of the mixing step the wash water is separated out in the regular purification system in order to minimize the use of chemicals our process is undertaken in  steps utilizing the reused process water in the initial cleaning step dsox tour triton emission solutions proudly presents a tour of a full scale dsox system currently installed and running on a cruise ship pst the pst is a patented system designed to significantly reduce the maintenance cost and premature failure of gas turbines by removing alkali metals in the fuel stock prior to combustion the elimination of salt calcium and other alkali metal substances in the fuel stock by the pst significantly reduces and in many cases eliminates the high temperature corrosion and premature failure in gas turbine engine components caused by the high temperature corrosion process small footprint big benefits exhaust gas heat reduction the dsox increases the ship’s exhaust gas boiler efficiency removing excess heat from the exhaust gases without risking corrosion of the boiler tubes discharging waste water the dsox system allows vessels to operate in all waters with sulfur emission controls including all upcoming eca’s the resulting waste water can be processed as bilge water and discharged at sea or while landed in ports onboard chemical manufacturing we have now developed a system without the need to bunker chemicals as they will be manufactured onboard only the activator and emulsifier will be added to the system compact size our fuel purification system takes less space and weighs less than any existing scrubber on the market because of its compact size it can easily be installed while the vessel is in service low energy consumption lower use of electricity substantially reduces operating costs when compared to the use of existing exhaust scrubber technologies reduced installation expense installation expenditures are lower than those of competitors since it can be installed while a vessel is in service the basics – what you get with our product our solution not only reduces the sulfur emissions but offers numerous beneficial byproducts on installation and while in production the right kind of clean energy dsox and njord exhaust gas scrubber system  global required ships each ship must comply with the new directive of  within the eca’s or they can be fined  per day for noncompliance  dsox sulfur level we anticipate that our solution will satisfy both the  requirement as well as the  global requirement of   tons of shipping industry sulfur emissions which equals  times all car emissions worldwide and triton plans to put a big dent in that what can triton do for you contact us now  ×
