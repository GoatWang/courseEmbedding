inc is an affiliate of barclays bank plc and is a registered us brokerdealer regulated by the sec and finra   an investment in any etns linked to the barclays ofi steelpath midstream mlp index the etns involves significant risks and may not be suitable for all investors  selected risks are summarized here but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks described under risk factors in the applicable prospectus supplement and pricing supplement   you may lose some or all of your principal  the etns are exposed to any decrease in the volume weighted average price vwap level between the inception date and the applicable valuation date additionally if the vwap level is insufficient to offset the negative effect of the investor fee and other applicable costs you will lose some or all of your investment at maturity or upon redemption even if the vwap value has increased because the etns are subject to an investor fee and any other applicable costs the return on the etns will always be lower than the total return on a direct investment in the index components the etns are riskier than ordinary unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection credit of barclays bank plc  the etns are unsecured debt obligations of the issuer barclays bank plc and are not either directly or indirectly an obligation of or guaranteed by any third party any payment to be made on the etns including any payment at maturity or upon redemption depends on the ability of barclays bank plc to satisfy its obligations as they come due as a result the actual and perceived creditworthiness of barclays bank plc will affect the market value if any of the etns prior to maturity or redemption in addition in the event barclays bank plc were to default on its obligations you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the etns issuer redemption barclays bank plc will have the right to redeem or call the etns in whole but not in part at its sole discretion and without your consent on any trading day on or after the inception date until and including maturity the payment on the etns is linked to the vwap level not to the closing level of the index and not to the published intraday indicative value of the etns your payment at maturity or upon early redemption is linked to the performance of the vwap level as compared to the initial vwap level although the vwap level is intended to track the performance of the index the calculation of the vwap level is different from the calculation of the official closing level of the index therefore the payment at maturity or early redemption of your etns may be different from the payment you would receive if such payment were determined by reference to the official closing level of the index no guaranteed coupon payments you are not guaranteed to receive coupon payments on the etns you will receive a coupon payment on a coupon payment date only to the extent that the accrued dividend exceeds the accrued investor fee on the relevant coupon valuation date the amount of the accrued dividend on any coupon valuation date depends in part on the aggregate cash value of distributions that a reference holder would have been entitled to receive in respect of the index constituents prior to the relevant coupon valuation date market and volatility risk the return on the etns is linked to the performance of the vwap level of the index which in turn is linked to the performance of the master limited partnerships and other securities that are included as index constituents at any time the prices of the index constituents may change unpredictably and as a result affect the level of the index and the value of your etns in unforeseeable ways concentration risk the index constituents are companies in the midstream oil  gas and liquid petroleum and natural gas shippers categories as determined by the bloomberg industry classification system® bcis in addition many of the index constituents are smaller nondiversified businesses that are exposed to the risks associated with such businesses including the lack of capital funding to sustain or grow businesses and potential competition from larger better financed and more diversified businesses the etns are susceptible to general market fluctuations in the energy infrastructure and midstream energy business mlp market and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions regarding the index constituents change your investment may therefore carry risks similar to a concentrated securities investment in one industry or sector a trading market for the etns may not develop although the etns are listed on a us national securities exchange a trading market for the etns may not develop and the liquidity of the etns may be limited as we are not required to maintain any listing of the etns restrictions on the minimum number of etns and date restrictions for redemptions you must redeem at least  etns at one time in order to exercise your right to redeem your etns on any redemption date you may only redeem your etns on a redemption date if we receive a notice of redemption from you by certain dates and times as set forth in the pricing supplement uncertain tax treatment significant aspects of the tax treatment of the etns may be less favorable than a direct investment in mlps and are uncertain you should consult your own tax advisor about your own tax situationbarclays bank plc has filed a registration statement including a prospectus with the sec for

investing in mlps involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock including risks related to cash flow dilution and voting rights each fund’s investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by mlps which may increase volatility energy infrastructure companies are subject to risks specific to the industry such as fluctuations in commodity prices reduced volumes of natural gas or other energy commodities environmental hazards changes in the macroeconomic or the regulatory environment or extreme weather mlps may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in mlp funds the oppenheimer steelpath mlp funds are subject to certain mlp tax risks an investment in an oppenheimer steelpath mlp fund does not offer the same tax benefits of a direct investment in an mlp the funds are organized as subchapter “c” corporations and are subject to us federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate currently as high as  as well as state and local income taxes the potential tax benefit of investing in mlps depends on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes if the mlp is deemed to be a corporation its income would be subject to federal taxation at the entity level reducing the amount of cash available for distribution which could result in a reduction of the fund’s value mlp funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of mlp distributions considered to be a taxdeferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments this deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily nav and as a result an mlp fund’s aftertax performance could differ significantly from
