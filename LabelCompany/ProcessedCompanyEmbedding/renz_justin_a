completing boston for the ninth time last april in  — twoplus hours before the first bomb exploded near the finish line — he planned to skip this year’s race and focus on london completing his circuit of the majors but within a few days he made the decision that he would run both london and boston“i have three kids and they said ‘dad you can’t not run boston this year’ ” recalled renz advertisement his wife jen and their children — yearold twins annie and jonah and will  — will be at the mile mark in wellesley at the children’s hospital station the past six years renz has run for children’s and his patient partner cameron macphail of braintree“it’s a lot of fun because we watch him and support him at most of his races” said jen renz “my kids are developing a positive experience out of being a part of the whole children’s hospital contingent they have become friends with cameron and his family”last week wearing his children’s hospital singlet in london renz received a great deal of support for bostonmonday he is hoping to finish the course in less than three hours and “enjoy the magic that will occur after the tragedy of last year” he saidin his six majors he has averaged a  finish the thirdbest performance to date since toyko was added as the sixth major only a year ago not every elite runner has had an opportunity to run all six his best time a  in chicago in  but he acknowledges that he is fortunate to still be on coursein  while running boston he developed a severe blister on his left foot while breaking in a new pair of shoes the foot became infected and when renz arrived at the emergency room a month later he was told by doctors that he was roughly  hours away from having the foot amputatedantibiotic injections were prescribed but he was allergic to the initial dose four weeks later he was back in the emergency room after noticing blood in his urine the allergic reaction had resulted in kidney failure and a condition known as rapidly progressing glumerulonephritis his kidneys responded to medicine and returned to normal but renz gained  pounds after taking prednisone an immunosuppressant drug for several years to control his conditionhe jogged occasionally for eight years but didn’t venture back to serious running until four days after will was born in  he ran a local k in milton which led to his return to marathoning in  in newport ri“i ran a personal worst  but this was fast enough for me to qualify for boston” said renz a connecticut native who ran crosscountry at holy cross “i wanted to be a fit dad and get back in shape for my kids”in his return in  — his first hopkintontoboston trek in  years he ran a  he has completed every race since “i’m looking forward to monday i think the crowds will be the biggest and best ever” susan collins last april susan collins was stopped two miles from the finish line near the brooklineboston border“nobody knew what was going on” recalled collins the varsity girls’ lacrosse coach at marshfield high“on beacon street i really got the sense that something was going on when emergency vehicles were passing us on the same side of the street we were running on you never see that“almost every car that went by had whitejacketed medical people in it the police made us move away from mailboxes because the bomb squad had not checked them at that point i knew it was bad”collins walked to route  to meet her family and drive home “fortunately i was able to get out of the city pretty easily” she saidshe is eager to run boston for the fifth time on monday“last year was an awful day yet i met some wonderful people” said collins who has also run marathons in new york chicago and washington dc mark maggi when mark maggi a yearold cohasset resident crossed the finish line in a personalbest time  last year he had no intention of returning to boston in “i ran a great race and i thought i would take a break for a couple of years” said maggi an economist for the federal government “i wasn’t anticipating coming back”that all changed when he met friends and family at a postrace gathering in newton and turned to the television in disbelief as the tragic events at the finish line unfoldedhe will run his fourth consecutive boston as a gesture of solidarity“i was a lucky one last year” he said “i ran a great race and was out of the city but there is a whole group of people who had their finish line taken away from them”maggi who bettered his personal best by more than five minutes last year said the outpouring of support from the running community has been phenomenal“i have friends who were done with marathons who have signed up for the race” he said“i know guys who are short distance runners who are coming to run in the running community as a whole there is an overwhelming need to show that nothing will change“this is one day of the year when there are no factions and it’s such a perfect day in massachusetts to have that tampered with last year
