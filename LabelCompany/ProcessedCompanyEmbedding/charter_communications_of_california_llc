liability company faq find faqs related to starting an llc what is a limited liability company llc a limited liability company or llc is a business entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership like a corporation the owners of an llc are not personally liable for business debts like a sole proprietorship or partnership an llc has operating flexibility and is a passthrough entity for tax purposes this means the llcs profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the llc what legal documents do i need to form an llc to create an llc articles of organization must be filed with the secretary of state or appropriate state agency next the llc members should enter into an operating agreement which sets forth the rights of the members and the rules for running the company an llc may also need to apply for a tax identification number with the irs legalzoom can prepare all of the required documents for you can my llc have an unlimited lifespan yes recent changes to the irs code have promoted changes in state laws permitting llcs to be created with an unlimited life what is the difference between a member and a manager of an llc a member is an owner of the llc and is similar to a stockholder of a corporation a manager is a person chosen by the members to manage the llc and is similar to a director of a corporation a manager can also be a member does an llc have to hold meetings the answer is usually no unless the llcs operating agreement requires meetings legalzooms operating agreements make meetings optional this is one of the key advantages of an llc  fewer formalities this means less paperwork and less chance that the members will accidentally violate the law and thereby lose their liability protection how much will it cost to form and operate an llc each state charges an annual fee to maintain an llc in many states you must also submit an annual report or statement of information which is a onepage form sent by the state some states also have state taxes the annual fees for three popular states—california nevada and delaware—are as follows prices shown are as of  california a  reporting fee and a statement of information are required  days after formation and then every two years an annual  llc tax is due by the th day of the fourth month after llc formation and every year thereafter if the llcs income exceeds  it will owe an additional llc tax based on the income amount nevada a  fee and the initial list of managers or managing members as well as a  fee and a business licence application are due within  days of formation there is no state income tax delaware there is an annual llc tax of  due each june st beginning the year following formation there is no state income tax new york every llc must publish notice of its formation in two newspapers in the county in which it was created in some areas the fees for this publication can run up to  the company must then submit a certificate of this publication to the state together with a  filing fee for llcs that choose to be treated as a partnership there are annual taxes that are based on total income from a minimum of  to a maximum of  every other state contact a local accountant   legalzoom can help you save time when you form an llc answer a few questions in our online questionnaire we’ll
