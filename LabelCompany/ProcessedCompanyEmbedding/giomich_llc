hotel is about a  minute taxi drive from nikola tesla airport my experience was certainly that all the staff were pleasant friendly and very helpful the whole hotel was clean and looks as if it has been recently refurbished to a high standardi had a double room which had a walk in shower modern fittings a little bit small maybe but ample for one person room itself had wardrobe nice comfy bed small table and two comfy chairs room safe in wardrobe what i found really helped was another door between the bedroom and the main door to the room this made sure you didnt hear anyone else coming back late at nightwifi throughout the hotel was good although the continual need to login if you changed floors became a bit of a nuisancebreakfast was continentalbuffet style you were able to order omelettes if you wanted toif i was returning to belgrade i would definitely stay here again stayed march  traveled on business value location sleep quality rooms cleanliness service helpful  thank cgt

reviews  helpful votes “excellent choice” reviewed march   read the reviews on tripadvisor for hotel excelsior and agree that it is a very nice clean hotel with good value the location was good as we were able to walk to the various tourist areas and the neighborhood was safe being very close to parliament and embassys the staff was friendly spoke very good english and helpful with directions and recommendationswe flew in to belgrade and took a taxi to the hotel the driver was familiar with the hotel and took us directly there pointing out sights along the way there is a flat fee into the city from the airport so avoid the taxi cowboys in the terminal and go directly to the taxi kioskwe left belgrade by train and and it was a short inexpensive ride to the train station stayed february

trips only recently i discovered the excelsior hotel and since then i have been staying in the excelsior several times the hotel excelsior and especially the staff made my stays very enjoyable and there was never any problem that the very friendly and hospitable staff was not able to solve there was hardly any hotel in belgrade where i was looking that much forward to breakfast than in the hotel excelsior i can only recommend this hotel to anybody visiting belgrade because of the good location not in the heart of the city but a  minutes walk close to it most friendly staff i ever encountered in a belgrade hotel great breakfast with many fresh things and excellent coffee you can also get an espresso if you just ask for it good internet connection wired and wireless clean and new interiour comfortable beds nice showerthe only downside are the rooms that are located along the main street kneza milosa in summer you cant leave the window open as its quite noisy from  am till  pm if you keep the windows closed it is however no problem at all room tip rooms that are located along the main street kneza milosa are generally more noisy than the others see more room tips stayed

our mission palm products llc is a growing and dynamic ecommerce retailer we track analyze and use our years of experience to manage market and retail products for some of nation’s top manufacturers we are committed to a mutual success between us and our brand partnerssuppliers through versatility adaptability and most importantly…quality relationships our strategies there is no such thing as a “one size fits all” approach…especially when it comes to ecommerce every product we take on deserves a different approach tailored ultimately for the consumer seeking the purchase with online shopping there is no need for the old marketing methods of “broadcasting” in hopes to build a topofmind name recognition for when then consumer is ultimately making a buying decision we focus on a “narrowcasting” approach that seeks to serve as an informational resource for consumers shopping for that product this can be done through a mix of search engine optimization keyword strategies and channel distribution our insights our years of experience in online retailing have taught us a couple things first too many retailers use price as their sole marketing method especially online it becomes a race to the bottom with pricing by trying to gain a market share strictly through being the lowest price this is the easy way to do it and takes the least amount of work strategy and knowhow we believe this will ultimately hurt the brand in both perception to consumer and bottom line of the income statement second we “narrowcast” this is probably something you will hear us say a lot when focusing on reaching consumers we try and be as specific as possible for instance instead of building an advertising campaign focused on a generality like women ages  to  we believe in building a more focused approach like women ages  to  who live in the northeast and watch grey’s our future the future is bright we are excited for the direction that our company is moving and the partnerships that we have built the dynamics of today’s marketplace mean that we are constantly searching and refining what our strategies focuses and channels will be in the future copyright palm products llc
