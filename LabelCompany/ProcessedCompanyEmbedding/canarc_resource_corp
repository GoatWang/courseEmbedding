result the mine closed cominco owned and operated the nearby tulsequah chief and big bull deposits and in  leased the site polaristaku site and upgrade the mill to process ores mined from these deposits this continued until  during the mines operation a total of  oz gold was produced from  tonnes of ore grading  grams per tonne  ozton gold concentrates were shipped to a smelter in tacoma washington for refining about  m of underground development on  levels and  m of raise development were completed at new polaris the deepest level of the mine is  m below sea level a  m internal winze was used to haul ore to the main haulage access level mining methods included longhole shrinkage and resuing new polaris then lay dormant for  years until exploration resumed in  canarc acquired new

silicasericitefuchsitealtered wall rocks of almost barren quartzcarbonate veins the white quartzcarbonate veins developed late in the mineralizing hydrothermal system and remobilized rare free gold into some late quartzstibnite veins the mineralized veins are hosted within paleozoicaged mafic volcanic rocks and are developed along three principal vein sets adjacent to a major crustal break gold mineralization is late cretaceous to early tertiary and is very similar in terms of wallrock alteration style of mineralization and host rock material to wellknown archean lode gold deposits such as

nugget effect individual zones pinch swell and overlap en echelon width of gold mineralization ranges from  to  m in thickness but tends to average about  m metallurgy historically the mine operated at a rate of  tons per day ore was crushed through primary and secondary crushers and ground in a ball mill a standard flotation circuit was used to concentrate the ore prior to being shipped off site historical gold recoveries averaged  and concentrate grades ranged from    oz per ton gold canarc performed extensive metallurgical test work that utilized flotation cyanidation of the flotation tailings and pressure oxidation autoclaving of the flotation concentrate  these tests achieved an average recovery of  additional metallurgical test work is planned to optimize the process site

lot of potential upside sensitivity npv after tax based on discount rate and commodity price variation discount rate  oz  oz  oz  oz  oz  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil  mil with the price of gold rising to over  an ounce in recent months the elcompas project is looking quite attractive mine construction is expected to take only  months and with the project fully permitted and the financing likely to be completed soon i feel confident that the project will be completed successfully mexico is a stable mining jurisdiction and canarc resource corp has signed a lease agreement to process ore at the zacatecas government mill which should create a strong relationship with the local government with very low aisc elcompas should produce margins of roughly  an ounce in the current gold environment and can remain quite profitable even at lower gold prices while providing leverage to rising gold prices at this point i see the main risk as being the uncertainty regarding the terms of the  million financing which will be disclosed in the next  days if the deal is unfavorable for canarc resource corp it could place a burden on the company however with the monetary amount of the deal being only  million with an option for up to  million i think the risk level is fairly low the other main risk is in regard to issues with mine construction as shareholders of rubicon minerals know only too well and potential cost overruns and delays of course all mining projects carry this risk but in canarc resource corps case this is partly mitigated by the fact that they will be utilizing the zacatecas government mill for ore processing which they have signed a  year lease with this greatly reduces capital costs and permitting and makes mine construction a lot more straightforward canarc resource corp also own the new polaris project in british columbia for which they have completed a pea and are advancing towards a feasibility study the results of the pea look promising with an after tax npv of ca  million at oz gold the internal rate of return is not quite as high as i would like at  but is still fairly decent and the payback period is  years cash costs are estimated at a low us an ounce annual production would be approximately  ounces so if canarc resource corp can bring new polaris to production it would transform them from a microcap miner to more of a traditional small cap miner capital costs to construct new polaris are estimated at ca million which means that while some of the funding would come from cash flow from elcompas there would definitely have to be financing as well at this point while new polaris looks promising its hard to ascribe too much value to the project until their feasibility study is completed and they make substantial permitting progress while canarc resource corps share price has risen quite a bit over the last several months i believe there is plenty of upside left i would expect shares to move higher as key milestones are achieved including completion of the term sheet beginning of mine construction first gold pour and declaration of commercial production of course if there are delays cost overruns or any other issues this will negatively affect share price while share price will be partly tied to achieving key milestones the price of gold itself will have a large impact on share price if it moves substantially higher or lower from current prices with such a small market cap canarc resource corp is a very risky investment and definitely not recommended for the risk averse however for those willing to take risk i would recommend accumulating shares on any dips in share price i believe canarc resource corp will successfully bring elcompas online over the next year and as long as the price of gold doesnt drop too much i think we will see the stock price trend up towards the npv of elcompas as key milestones

attorney on an unlimited number of new legal matters  off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business

whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many
