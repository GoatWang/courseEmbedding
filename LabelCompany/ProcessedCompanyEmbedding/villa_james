balbianello is located next to lake como italy in the spring of  the movie casino royale was filmed in front of the villa the villa doubles as a hospital where james bond daniel craig is recovering together with vesper eva green and where the swiss banker comes to get the code to transfer the moneybuilt for cardinal angelo maria durini at the end of the xviii century the villa stands on the tip of a steep promontory overlooking lake como almost opposite bellagio today the villa has the appearance desired by its last owner the explorer guido monzino with a rich collection of chinese african and precolombian art precious english and french furniture of the s and the small museum with documents and mementoes of his expeditions yet the true masterpiece is the panoramic terraced garden dominated by the elegant loggia with three arches rising on the highest point of the promontorythe same villa can also be seen in star wars ii attack of the clonesthe villa is now owned by fondo per

filimon on  july   permalink reply i like the way this villa looks its very beautiful i wish i could visit it peter wakefield on  june   permalink reply try travelsphere holidays httpwwwtravelspherecoukdestinationseuropesoutherneuropeitaly ben williams on  july   permalink reply villa del balbianello is absolutely stunning and well worth a visit the villa and the surrounding grounds are beautiful and the view across the lake is absolutely breathtaking the atmosphere is very peaceful and relaxed and you are able to explore the grounds and the building at your own leisure all the areas used in casino royale are accessible to the public whilst you can’t actually stay in the villa itself there is fantastic and reasonably priced accommodation in the form of the hotel san giorgio lenno which is walking distance from the villa whilst you can walk to the villa from lenno i’d suggest getting a boat either there or back as you get a wonderful view from the water as the boat passes alongside the promontory a flight to milan form the uk was under £ then a train trip to como which was very reasonable you can catch a bus from como to lenno although beware it is not for the faint of heart if you want to enjoy a slice of the bond lifestyle but haven’t the budget for the ocean club this is highly recommended add new comment your name  email  the content of this field
