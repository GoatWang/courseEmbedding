filings section of our investor relations websitenow id like to turn the call over to ronronald e konezny digi international inc  ceo president and director thank you mike and greetings to everyone on the call today the result of our second quarter of  met our profitability expectations excluding significant ma expenses but clearly fell short of our revenue expectations we have revenue challenges at the present but we expect to resume sequential growth in our fiscal fourth quarter this revised view has stimulated more assertive approach to our cost controls which have been enabled by our streamlining initiativesread morewe remain committed to our objective of doubledigit ebitda margins in our call today we will provide more detail on our initiatives and provide an updated forecast for our fiscal in cellular we have high expectations for this product line and we clearly did not meet them at this  during this past quarter however we have a number of large projects underway and we have aligned our resources to support and deliver on these projects which we believe will result in higher loads of revenue over time were carefully balancing resources between supporting our wr series routers and advancing our lr series routersin network the decline in revenues has been higher than we anticipated were increasing the rd resources within this product family to soften the pace of decline in specific product lines including both maintenance of line and new product and activitiesin embedded we saw steeperthanexpected decline in the mature portion of the portfolio of this product line which were not offset by the growth in our new products our ccul new product offering is receiving a great market reception with nearly  design wins while it can take time for design wins to generate revenue we expect this product line to drive growthin rf our run rate business was stable but some of our larger customers have seen delays in their consumption to rollout the xbee cellular new product line has captured design wins with both existing digi xbee customers as well as customers being exposed to digi for the first timein services we closed the smart temps acquisition in the second fiscal quarter which helped increase revenues and services weve integrated the combined offerings of smart temps digi cold chain and freshtemps quickly our new renamed offerings smart solutions launched today smart solutions represents a most comprehensive view of our solutions portfolio replacing digi cold chain we have clear vertical offerings with positive proof points and a growing installed basein addition we launched safe temps our transportational logistics offering we are uniquely positioned to service the supply chain for companies in the food and medicine industries in addition were seeing positive momentum within our wireless design services group now a few functional updatesin sales each of our product lines have focused on our top larger opportunities we have already secured some early wins in cellular embedded and rf in addition our channel sales resources are providing more deeply for demand generation and going further with our partnership sales teams on specific pursuits in product management we hit our goal of  skus within the second fiscal quarter we intend to go further with a new goal of less than  skus by the middle of calendar as weve discussed before simplifying our offerings allow us to focus resources mirroring our sales and development organizations we are combining the rf and embedded product management teams in rd we hit our mark by starting embedded connectcore  sic ul or ccul model shipments during the second fiscal quarterin addition we hit our mark by starting rfs xbee cellular module shipments during the second fiscal quarter we have roadmaps established for each of our product linesin it in line with our theme of simplification weve begun our crm and erp migration and were starting our pom implementation as the year progresses we will have fewer more modern and integrated systems that will enable us to move faster the easier to do business with and reduce our costs finally in corporate development we continue to invest time with inorganic pursuits we are progressing discussions with a select number of opportunities that can help our businesses go furtherwhile we remain committed to sustainable and more consistent longterm growth we clearly have hit a nearterm speedbump on revenue targeted measures have been undertaken to ensure our profitability objectives are realized however we are not sacrificing our growth initiativesnow ill turn it over to mike for a comprehensive update of our financial performance mikemichael c goergen digi international inc  cfo svp and treasurer thanks you ron id like to start with some additional insights relative to our q quarterly results we were disappointed that the unexpected softness across our product lines both in north america and emea resulted in lower results than our previous guidancei will discuss later our expectations for our product businesses and our nearterm top line challenges we are pleased to see continued momentum in our service business and specifically our newly branded digi smart solutions formally digi cold chain as ron mentioned earlierfrom the pl perspective we generated  million of total revenue which fell short of our guided range of  million to  million revenue decreased by  million or  compared to the same quarter last year hardware product revenue decreased  million or  this was partially offset by an increase in service revenue of  million our cellular category declined by  million or  in q versus a year ago quarter driven mainly by pressure in our retail verticalin addition we continue to feel the effects of the delayed introduction of our digi transport lr router the new release has not yet met our sales expectations and we expect that to be the case for the balance of fy rf product revenue in q  was essentially flat compared to the same period a year ago as i mentioned last quarter we are encouraged by the building pipeline for our new cellular xbee modules released in march which will allow original equipment manufacturers to integrate lte cat  cellular connectivity into their designs we expect increased revenue from developer kits then design wins and finally production volumes similar to the embedded modules sales cycleproduction volumes are not expected to contribute until fiscal  embedded product revenue in q  decreased  million or  compared to the same period a year ago similar to our new xbee cellular product we are seeing a building pipeline for new connectcore ul released for general availability in april of  the connectcore ul application processor is the most powerefficient lowest cost and smallest industrial som available as an embedded module design wins will lead to production volumes which are expected to ramp in fiscal our network category decreased by  million or  in the second quarter of fiscal  compared to the same quarter a year ago our network products have declined more rapidly than anticipated and we have adjusted our balance of your expectations accordingly we do believe the curve of the decline can be improved we will be investing modestly here and forming a dedicated engineering team for npi as well as incremental sales resourcesas i indicated previously service revenue increased significantly in q  versus the year ago quarter fueled by incremental revenue from digi smart solutions as well as continued improvement in our wireless design services revenue we are now servicing nearly  sites and our recurring revenue continues to growgeographically north america revenue decreased by  million or  in q  largely resulting from weaker sales of network and cellular products compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal yearemea revenue decreased by  million or  versus the prior year comparable quarter revenue in asia and latin america increased modestly versus q  gross profit decreased by  million or  in q  versus the year ago quarter due primarily to lower top line revenue performance and shifting product mixour overall gross margin was  compared to  in q  a decrease of  basis points our q  hardware product gross margin was  compared to  in q  decreasing largely from sales mix as our network product category declined as an overall percent of our products revenueas our network category declines we expect to see pressure on our hardware gross margins service gross margin for q  was  compared to  in the year ago quarter we continue to expect margins in the service category to be between  and  for the balance of the fiscal year we also expect that service gross margin will continue to improve over time as recurring revenue from digi smart solutions continues to growoperating expenses in q  decreased by  or  compared to the year ago quarter we recorded lower incentive compensation since planned thresholds for revenue are not expected to be met this was partially offset by incremental operating expenses for smart temps and an increase in ma expenses in the second fiscal quarter of  compared to the same quarter a year agowe incurred approximately  million of ma expense in the quarter versus  a year ago we recorded an effective tax rate of  for the quarter compared with an effective tax rate of  for the second quarter a year ago the decrease in our q effective tax rate is largely a result of the decrease in our forecasted income for the fiscal year our overall effective tax rate results from the mix of income between taxing jurisdictions many of which have lower statutory tax rates than the us for planning purposes we project an overall effective tax rate of approximately  to  for the full fiscal year income from continuing operations for the quarter was  million or  per diluted share compared to  million or  per diluted share in q  ebitda from continuing operations was  million or  of revenue compared to  million or  of revenue for q  we have provided a full reconciliation table for nongaap items in our earnings release for your convenienceincluded in our ebitda a stock compensation expense of  million and the previously mentioned ma expense of  million if we had not incurred the ma expense we get much closer to demonstrating our goal of doubledigit ebitdamoving to the balance sheet cash and investments including longterm investments totaled  million a decrease of  million over the comparable balance at september  the decrease in cash was primarily a result of the freshtemp and smart temps acquisitions for a total cash expenditure of approximately  million net of cash acquired of  on may   our board approved a new  million stock buyback plan replacing the  million plan that expired on may  our balance sheet continues to be very strong with a current ratio of  at march   compared to  at september   we remain debt freenow id like to provide our updated guidance which includes the third quarter and the full year of fiscal  the following guidance does not include any potential restructuring actions we may implement in future periods the company has actively been evaluating alternatives to reduce operating expenses in the near term including a restructuring of certain operations in the emea region for the third fiscal quarter of  we expect to see continued challenges with our product revenue and headwinds from an increase in our channel inventory which grew to  million in q from  million in qwe expect total company revenue in the range of  million to  million we expect net income per diluted share from continuing operations to be in a range of  to  for the full fiscal year we are projecting sequential improvement to our product revenue in our fiscal q and therefore expect revenue to be in a range of  million to  million we expect net income per diluted share from continuing operations to be in the range of  to  despite our nearterm product revenue challenges we remain committed to our strategy of focusing on new product introductions with broader applications simplifying our offerings and reducing customizations investing in sales leadership to drive strategic direct customer relationships and growing our verticallyfocused smart solutions businessas ron mentioned our model should demonstrate resiliency and profitability and our commitment to doubledigit ebitda margins that completes our prepared remarksat this time ron and i are pleased to open up the call for your questions heidiquestions and answersoperator operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of mike walkley with canaccord genuityjoshua christopher reilly canaccord genuity limited research division  analyst this is josh for mike i guess to start off maybe you could give us some of the puts and takes across the business lines you mentioned that networks is going to be weaker going forward is there any  or any of the other product categories not performing up to your expectations going forward or is it primarily networks thats the dragronald e konezny digi international inc  ceo president and director well jason this is ron in a couple of our businesses we do have mature products and embedded in particular and so that portion of our product portfolio that is not performing at the level we thought and so we do have some weakness in the mature portion of our embedded product line we do as i mentioned in my comments we do think cellular is capable of producing more and were going to expect more out of that sequentially as we move throughout the fiscal yearjoshua christopher reilly canaccord genuity limited research division  analyst okay are there any new products in cellular that we should be aware of that might move the needle in the second half of the fiscal yearronald e konezny digi international inc  ceo president and director as i mentioned in my comments we have been investing pretty heavily in our lr series and were going to rebalance that team a little bit to introduce some new variance of our wr series these products have some nearterm project opportunities and were balancing the investment between that wr and lr series so the variance of the wr product line the wr  and  that we can take advantage of nearterm opportunitiesjoshua christopher reilly canaccord genuity limited research division  analyst okay sounds good how should we think about the run rate of the cold chain business now going forward i guess this quarter including the wireless design business that was  million total how should we think about the seasonality of the cold chain business which may or may not be there going forward since i believe most of its recurring revenueronald e konezny digi international inc  ceo president and director this is ron i mean we really think that services businesses have a different profile than a lot of our product business we expect that to sequentially improve throughout the year as we add additional installations and grow that installed base and the recurring revenue portion of that adds to that visibility and that predictability but we really think of that services product or services line item is increasing sequentially throughout the yearmichael c goergen digi international inc  cfo svp and treasurer the only comment ill make is with the acquisition of smart temps they do have a component of their revenue which is really kind of capex model so there is upfront hardware as part of the smart temps solutions which we really dont have in kind of the  prior assets and so that  we will have to kind of consider that as we go forward and if youre commenting about seasonality i dont think we really see any real seasonality to that business at alloperator the next question comes from the line of jaeson schmidt with lake street capitaljaeson schmidt lake street capital markets llc research division  senior research analyst i apologize if i missed it in the prepared remarks but can you talk a little bit about if you think the softness is just more general market softness or if you think there has maybe been some market share shifts within each of your product linesronald e konezny digi international inc  ceo president and director well i think the softness as we mentioned in our remarks we got some mature products that we knew were going to have some decline and the decline was a little bit steeper than we thought which certainly impacted our network and to some extent our embedded product line but listen we also i think need to execute better with our new products and our existing products as well so i think the combination of the two as you know weve been aggressively working down on our skus thats had an impact to some extent in our revenue profile as we move customers to different skus or in some cases we cant move them to an existing sku but were committed to simplifying the company and having fewer products that have broader appeal and so were content with that shortterm impact because we see such a longterm gainmichael c goergen digi international inc  cfo svp and treasurer jaeson this is mike i tried to articulate my comments that were really excited about the growing pipeline and the market acceptance of the  products in both our rf and embedded groups i think that revenue is probably once it hits production volumes its potentially more predictable and something well have greater visibility to the unfortunate part is that because of our modulus right they go through developer kits design wins and then ultimately reward us with the production volumes and thats what i was discussing in my comments about fy  is really when we expect those  new products to really start contributing i think the good news is with network and cellular those obviously being both box build those have an opportunity to contribute maybe more meaningful as we march through the balance of the yearjaeson schmidt lake street capital markets llc research division  senior research analyst okay thats helpful and then do you mind commenting on what youre seeing from a pricing environment standpoint within each of your product linesronald e konezny digi international inc  ceo president and director we dont see a ton of different dynamics within the product lines were in many competitive businesses but there hasnt been a dramatic shift in asps id say there is  if anything a more intense level of competition within cellular those guys have shorter product dormant cycles there is a lot of change going on with the cellular network providers as well so you really got to stay on top of your game and that cellular product line to continue momentum but we havent seen significant asp declinesjaeson schmidt lake street capital markets llc research division  senior research analyst okay and then shifting to the smart solutions obviously the acquisition is fairly recent but do you mind talking about how the customer engagement pipeline has tracked over the past plus months or how should we think about that business going forward beyond that  million target for the yearmichael c goergen digi international inc  cfo svp and treasurer yes were not prepared to offer any kind of fy  guidance but were very excited i mean there is tremendous demand and its across several verticals and we really feel like were strongly positioned to be that one provider that can go across the supply chain in both food and medicine from a distribution center warehouse commissary into a transporting vehicle and then even into the retailer whether that be a grocery store or restaurant or pharmacy a clinic a hospital or school so were very excited about the applicability of the technology weve got some really good vertical domain expertise within our group thats making us a choice for many customers and we think that position will grow over time with the increased visibility of the solutionjaeson schmidt lake street capital markets llc research division  senior research analyst okay and then the last one from me and ill jump back into queue just more of a housekeeping do you envision breaking out kind of these tasks or more recurring revenue portion of that business in the futuremichael c goergen digi international inc  cfo svp and treasurer yes we really do i think once we have a little bit more critical mass the metrics that i think were going to track in addition to just overall top line performance is how much of that is recurring what is the annualized recurring revenue subscribers and potentially average revenue per subscriber as well but yes were actively evaluating what that may look like in future periods jasonoperator your next question comes from the line of greg burns with sidotigregory burns sidoti  company llc  analyst in terms of the  some of the  youre seeing on the hardware side of the business is that more a function of execution on your part do you still  do you feel like you have the  or do you feel like you have the power portfolio is where it needs to be and it just a function of execution on your part in terms of your sales organization and then maybe what needs to kind of change from a sales perspective to get better acceptance of some of these newer products that youre bringing to marketronald e konezny digi international inc  ceo president and director yes its a good question greg as i highlighted in my comments i think the biggest initiative that mike ueland has underway with our sales folks is he is bringing a higher level of directsales engagement digi historically has been a little more channel centric and were really asking our sales resources to engage more directly in their larger pursuits sometimes with a partner and that partner pursuit can be even more beneficial when youve got  different perspective on a certain opportunity so i believe there are opportunities for us to improve from an execution perspective and in all of our business new product introduction is really critical and so we have to both identify and execute on that new product introduction mike highlighted a couple of examples we think were performing very well it takes time for that to convert into revenue and in the cellular area weve clearly made adjustments here to focus on some improvements to our wr series which we think can capture more immediate opportunities as we progress our lr series which is more of a longerterm program at the momentgregory burns sidoti  company llc  analyst okay so you say that the softness is coming more from your direct sales versus your channel sales  like is  are your channel sales still healthy or growing orronald e konezny digi international inc  ceo president and director yes relatively speaking our channel sales have been strong i think weve had a strategy  a couple for one is our direct sales force identifying and prosecuting larger opportunities in particular within our cellular rf and embedded groups and our channel relationship remains strong and we still feel very good about our channel we want to complement that with better contributions on the direct sidegregory burns sidoti  company llc  analyst okay and the investments you talked about on the networking group why continue to invest there why not just let it run off and milk it or as much as you can get out as it while it runs offmichael c goergen digi international inc  cfo svp and treasurer yes its a good question and we  i want to emphasize were doing a very select amount of innovation on products that within that portfolio that we see some real benefit and we think its a modest investment for the return that it provides so i wanted to make sure we characterize that investment correctly its  it is important to maintain some of those product lines to extend not only the revenue but the contribution that comes from it and so again its a very targeted level of investment within specific products within that portfoliogregory burns sidoti  company llc  analyst okay and then turning to smart solutions are you still sticking with the  million to  million over the next  months that you gave last year in terms of revenue and then when you look at the business or other places where you need to invest are there any bottlenecks in your ability to kind of grow revenue right now in terms of maybe deployment resources or sales resources like what needs to be added to that business to continue to scale it organicallymichael c goergen digi international inc  cfo svp and treasurer yes we very much are  found on our guidance for  calendar year of  million to  million in revenues we  as i mentioned in my comments weve released our new offering safe temps we feel like weve got a really good product portfolio there will be further integration of technologies between the  acquisitions but i think you hit the nail on the head in terms of well were looking at additional investments its really in the gotomarket side we think we could get some increased coverage we are actively looking for additional resources to represent the solution were looking in particular for resources that have experienced with technology to the verticals in which we are serving we think thats a good set of attributes to attract and so were actively looking for additional sales resources to represent the smart solutions portfoliogregory burns sidoti  company llc  analyst okay with the  looking at the goal of the business and the investments you need to make like how do you think about the margin profile of that business in the intermediate termmichael c goergen digi international inc  cfo svp and treasurer well the margins got  angles to it as we grow and we add more upfront revenue in particular with the smart temps solution that upfront revenue tends to have lower margin but the recurring revenue portion of that business has more attractive margin so as we grow that recurring margin will take time for it to have an outsized impact on the overall margin profileronald e konezny digi international inc  ceo president and director greg so we havent yet obviously broken that apart from the other services the wireless design services group and some of the app development so the best we can give you right now is really think about that  to  gross profit or the margin and then thats probably good for the balance of the yearoperator operator instructions and your next question comes from the line of david gearhart with first analysisdavid w gearhart first analysis securities corporation research division  associate analyst my first question i kind of wanted to ask about the hardware business going back to that in prior calls you had talked about or pointed to the hardware business being lumpy some opportunities being pushed how much of the revenue shortfall we see in the current quarter and nearterm is this related to either projects being canceled delayed pushed out versus just as your execution issue if you can kind of talk high levelmichael c goergen digi international inc  cfo svp and treasurer yes i think that lumpiness comment best applies to our cellular business thats an area we have high expectations for and it tends to be lumpy we  as i mentioned in my comments we have a couple of larger projects that were executed on that we expect to deliver yet this calendar  or sorry this fiscal year and those projects can be heavily influenced by our oem and var partners that are in turn dealing with their enduser to implement the solution so there was certainly a portion of that where we expected those programs to hit this quarter we had some inventory actually be procured in order to fulfill that demand and our partner wasnt in a position to take the product in that particular period now with that said i think there is absolute improvement for us to go further on our execution we mentioned on the sales side weve some additional rd efforts we want to put to use as well so i will say its a combination of the lumpiness of larger projects being hitting certain quarters and i think there is some improved execution that we can dodavid w gearhart first analysis securities corporation research division  associate analyst okay and you were talking about development kits design wins production volumes i know youre not giving guidance beyond this year but how should we think about what these businesses should grow at in an average environment for this versus where you are today just trying to put a  trying to figure out what the trajectory of these businesses could beronald e konezny digi international inc  ceo president and director yes as you mentioned were not issuing any kind of fiscal  guidance but let me give you some attributes of these products because i think it helps frame the opportunity so the ccul product is particularly exciting weve got a number of design wins its very competitive positioned from a performance from a functionality and from a price point the other thing about the connectcore ul product that we really like is its a global offering so we can sell throughout our geographies and throughout our channel partners so we have pretty high expectation for that product to really contribute to our embedded product line the xbee cellular product line as you now with cellular networks there are specific radios for specific carriers and specific protocols we released our first version of an xbee lte cat  for verizon were following up with an att version we are following that up with the catam and mbiot version so we expect that portfolio as we release followon modules to increase the appeal of that product in other geographies outside of north america but the asps are slightly higher for xbee cellular than they are for the ccul so we have an offset on the geographical expansion with higher asps so were really excited that both of these products will help drive sequential growth and as mike said we get these design wins you get a more consistent level of shipments and visibility across that customer base for those particular productsdavid w gearhart first analysis securities corporation research division  associate analyst and lastly from me i mean you mentioned the sku rationalization program and moving customers to different skus is that a case where you do lose customers because you cant move into certain skus that  as part of the process youre naturally going to lose some customers are you expecting that you just have to deal with that as one of the takes in the businessmichael c goergen digi international inc  cfo svp and treasurer yes absolutely i mean there has been situations we  and in fact many situations in fact most situations we can migrate an existing customer to a new solution they are happy with digi and we can really work with them over time to move them in some cases we do not have a destination for that particular customer and we lose them to competition and then lastly there are some cases where discontinuing sku has largely no effect on our results but we have been willing to sacrifice some shortterm revenue for the longerterm gain we have renewed commitment to that sku rationalization as i mentioned in my remarks we want to go further with  skus and we do think we get a significant benefit from having fewer skus not only within the rd group but also within our product management team with our channel partners and of course on the manufacturing side so we remain committed and then all these kind of quarters test your results but we feel longterm that is the absolute best thing for this company to have really more consistent growth rates that are sustainableoperator im showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference back to mr ron koneznyronald e
