have my william baffin rose planted in a location that most people would assume a rose would not do well and it thrives it receives morning sun partial shade the rest of the day in over fives years it has never failed to bloom magnificently suffered winter dieback had black spot or any disease issues it requires little care i mulch with compost and cut it back in late winter it is not at all fussythe only drawback to this rose is that it produces a few suckers a year and is really huge easily  ft tall and  wide after  years i dont see my neighbors ugly garage all summer  of  people found this review helpful do you yes no a tried and true stalwart kitty from littleton ma i love my willliam baffin roses i have them about  feet away from the road and they get splashed all winter with snow ice and road salt yet come spring they always push up new canes and bloom like crazy on both new and old wood they are a little bit coarse for a mixed herbaceous border but as a tall screen  they reach  feet in my zone b garden they are unbeatable they can be pruned or not as you need be careful when you prune for the very numerous and sharp thorns the first flush of blooms is just magnificent  they are smothered with beautiful bright pink blooms after that they produce intermittent blooms for the rest of the summer the bushes are vaseshaped and attractive even when they are not covered with flowers for a carefree screen they cant be beat  of  people found this review helpful do you yes no best climbing rose ever chloe s from albany ny i bought my william baffin rose from wff about  years ago and loved it i had it by the gate of our white fence where it did not get full sun all day but still thrived and was a prolific bloomer the flowers keep on coming unfortunately i had to move it while it was in full bloom for the fence and gate to be replaced i cut it way back but don t know if it will come back  well see since i cant live without it ill wait until these are back in stock to get a new one i have had to prune to keep the gate entrance clear but generally it keeps its shape with very minimal pruning i have another climbing rose in another spot in the yard that is a nightmare to keep in shape but william baffin is very well behaved no cons at all to this hardy climber  of  people found this review helpful do you yes no tough to the tips bud not dud from s dakota we have commercial building with a parkinglot that was a heavily traveled shortcut a stand of these  feet apart spacing cut foot traffic to absolute zero we use them as bushes and they are approximately  feet wide and tall very dense very heavy spring flush then sporatic flowers after until hard frost they are hardy to the tip in f winters and i have never needed to prune i was so impressed used at home to hide fence but neighbors lawn chemicals killed them after  years  of  people found this review helpful do you yes no i am very happy with the william baffin c from wisconsin i planted the rose entrance to my garden  of  people found this review helpful do you yes no  certified buyer next page  of click here to read more reviews about this item  total growing guide growing guide planting before planting a bareroot rose remove and discard the packing material and soak the roots for a few hours then dig a planting hole that allows sufficient room for the depth and spread of the roots if you’re planting a climbing rose locate the hole so that the base of the rose will be about ′ from the foot of the trellis discard  of the soil dug from the hole and replace it with at least as much organic matter—such as compost aged manure or leafmold—and mix this into the remaining soil next set the plant in the hole so that the bud union the bulge where the top was grafted onto the rootstock or the point where the first branch leaves the main stem on roses that were not grafted is ″ below the surrounding soil in the north and at the same level or an inch above the soil in mildwinter climates then push the mix of soil and organic matter back into the hole tamping firmly as you go water thoroughly mound soil around the canes to a height of –″ this prevents the canes from drying out in the sun and wind check the canes every couple of days and remove the mounded soil gradually once new growth appears lightwatering roses grow best where they receive at least six hours of direct sun per day more sun means more blooms and prevents leaning leggy plants newly planted roses need the equivalent of one inch of water per week throughout their first growing season if water doesnt fall from the sky you must supply it a generous layer of organic mulch compost or composted manure is best helps keep the soil evenly moist if weather is dry in the fall be sure to water roses well never allow the foliage to remain wet into the evening water early in the day fertilizersoil and ph roses with the exception of species roses grow more vigorously bloom more prolifically and show greater resistance to diseases if fertilized several times during the growing season in early spring except the first spring after planting immediately after the first wave of bloom and again in early august species roses should be fertilized just once in early spring with granular fertilizer such as  gardeners in the south and west may wish to fertilize monthly from early spring until june pausing during the heat of summer and fertilizing again in august and september to close out the season we prefer natural fertilizers such as fish emulsion or seaweed extract applied in solution because they release their nutrients more slowly and evenly than chemical fertilizers roses adore composted horse manure but so do weeds if youre willing to face the consequences by all means provide this treat as topdressing in spring or as winter mulch and the roses will reward you for your efforts pestsdiseases the roses we offer were selected for their vigor and their resistance to pests and diseases if planted and grown as we suggest they will be healthy and healthy plants are much less troubled than plants under stress even if a healthy plant does suffer at the hands of a pest or disease it will likely endure and recover without intervention on the part of the gardener some roses are prone to fungus problems such as black spot in hot humid areas cleaning up old foliage and cutting back affected canes is important for disease control spraying the leaves with bordeaux mixture a copperbased fungicide can help once symptoms appear follow the manufacturers instructions and a single application of lime sulfur applied in early spring while plants are still dormant will go far to prevent problems japanese beetles and rose chafers may be handpicked or a systemic pesticide may be used in spring check for rose slugs sawfly larvae that appear as tiny green caterpillars and skeletonize rose foliage and physically destroy them or spray with superfine horticultural oil companions roses bloom at the same time as peonies clematis delphinium and lilies and are ideal with many other perennials train nonclimbing clematis through larger shrub roses and grow viticella and texensis clematis varieties with the climbers pruning prune roses to remove deadwood to control or direct growth and to promote flowering wait until growth breaks from the canes in early spring before pruning deadwood can be removed at any time other pruning should be done in early spring on climbers rugosas english and modern roses at that time remove any weak or crossing branches remove a few of the old canes at the base of established climbers to stimulate new growth if the rose bush has become too tall the stems may be cut back by onethird to onehalf pruning to an outward facing bud to direct growth away from the interior of the plant if you grow onceblooming oldfashioned roses do not prune until after flowering is finished with the exception of the rugosas which produce attractive hips fruits remove the spent flowers of reblooming roses to promote more bloom cutting the stems back to the first large bud at the base of a set of five leaflets please note new dawn reblooms best if stems are cut back to the second set of five leaflets grafted roses will occasionally send up shoots from the rootstock which should be removed as soon as noticed reflowering many varieties of roses available today will bloom continuously or more sporadically through the growing season always remove spent blooms and cut the stems back to right above the first leaf with five leaflets please note new dawn reblooms best if stems are cut back to the second set of five leaflets transplanting roses may be moved in early spring when dormant especially if they are young plants large established roses are more of a challenge endofseason care much has been written about techniques for overwintering roses in cold climates in our experience the best way to get roses through winter is to choose plants adapted to your climate zone that said if you live near a roses cold limit and you garden on an exposed site or in an area where rapid temperature fluctuations are common you should mound two shovelfuls of composted manure garden soil compost or shredded leaves over the base of the plant in late fall after the ground freezes covering these mounds and the lower parts of the bushes with evergreen boughs will add protection pull the mounding material away from the stem as new growth emerges in spring do not prune roses back in fall wait until you see growth start along the canes in spring to prune branches injured over winter calendar of care early spring plant bareroot roses now and transplant young roses if needed check soil ph and add lime if ph is below  when new growth appears along the canes prune established roses to shape the bushes remove dead or damaged tissue and open up the interior to allow for good air circulation remove a few of the old canes at the base of established climbers to stimulate new growth if fungal disease is prevalent in your area spray while dormant with bordeaux mix lime sulfur or horticultural oil fertilize now gardeners in the south and west may wish to fertilize monthly from early spring until june resuming in august and september midspring watch for rose slugs and either handpick spray with a superfine horticultural oil or use a systemic insecticide fertilize roses again after the first flush of flowers watch for shoots coming from the rootstock below the graft and remove after the soil warms apply a generous layer of organic mulch late spring monitor plantings for japanese beetles and rose chafers and treat as needed watch for black spot powdery mildew or other foliar problems and treat with fungicides or neem products water early in the day so that foliage dries off before evening sets in summer clean up any fallen foliage and be diligent with deadheading continue watering if rainfall is sparse and keep rose beds weedfree some varieties of roses may need support especially if summer thunderstorms occur in your area as climbers send out new canes tie them to the trellis or fence fall if you live in a cold climate and grow roses that are not completely hardy in your area you may wish to protect them for the winter by mounding soil or compost around the base of the plants after the ground freezes and then adding evergreen boughs climbing roses may be detached from their supports laid down on the ground and covered with soil to get them through the winter this procedure is viable only on the smaller climbers but does work well with shorter roses grown on pillars videos videos how to grow roses related items organic gem® liquid fish fertilizer sku f  geranium rozanne sku f from  classic

other bush roses some of the modern climbing roses are the results of mutations climbing roses usually grow from  to  feet tall and they may have a heavy early bloom and then sporadic blooms the rest of the year or they may bloom all summer long depending on the cultivar climbing roses do not have the ability to cling to trellis or support by themselves they need to be tied and trained to grow on
