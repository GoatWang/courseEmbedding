this year on an organic basis we grew revenues by  basis points to  million driven by our broadcast enterprise and industrial platforms ebitda grew  yearoveryear from  million to  million ebitda margins expanded  basis points from  in the prioryear period to  eps in the first quarter was  compared to  in the prioryear period excluding the impact of the preferred equity issuance in july  earnings per share grew  as a result of this solid start to the year we are reiterating our full year revenue and eps guidance id like to thank our associates for their hard work during the quarter and their commitment to aggressively executing our strategic plan please turn to slide  for a review of our business segment results our formerlyknown segments of industrial it and network security will now be presented as the network solutions segment this is consistent with our organization structure and how we evaluate business results as a result we are now reporting four segments broadcast solutions enterprise solutions industrial solutions and network solutions segment information for the  quarters has been revised to conform to this change and is included as an appendix to this release turning now to the segments broadcast revenues in the quarter were  million compared to  million in the yearago period on an organic basis revenues increased by  basis points grass valley grew  organically recall that  represents year one of a new fouryear broadcast cycle for grass valley and year one is typically down compared to the prior year our first quarter performance supports our view that grass valley will outperform its historical year one trend we are especially pleased that the first quarter included another significant multimillion dollar order with a major network for our open architecture ip infrastructure system our broadband business however had a softer quarter with an organic decline of  we experienced a temporary pause isolated to two specific customers and expect this business to return to midsingle digit growth for both the second quarter and full year segment ebitda margins were  increasing  basis points from the prioryear period enterprise revenues increased  organically to  million endmarket demand for new nonresidential construction and smart buildings remains healthy as evidenced by the  growth in our innovative category a cable products which deliver data and power over ethernet additionally we experienced significant growth in our international markets ebitda margins in the fourth quarter were  normalizing as expected from fourth quarter  levels and increasing  basis points sequentially revenues in our industrial solutions platform increased  basis points organically discrete manufacturing our largest vertical experienced robust organic growth expanding  with solid demand from machine builders we are pleased with another quarter of growth in this market driven by increasing investments in automation oil and gas continue to be weak declining  yearoveryear recall that first quarter  benefited from favorable project timing we expect these headwinds to subside as we are seeing stabilization in this end market looking forward we are extremely encouraged by the overall industrial solutions orders which increased  yearoveryear and drove a booktobill ratio of  times ebitda margins increased  basis points from the yearago period to  driven by productivity initiatives and favorable mix revenues in our network solutions segment declined  organically from the prioryear period to  million in line with our expectations ebitda margins declined  basis points yearoveryear to  largely related to unfavorable product mix and increased investments in new products given the new segment presentation we thought it would be helpful to comment on the performance of the legacy platforms we were especially pleased with the formerlyknown industrial it platform which increased  organically including strong growth of  in discrete manufacturing as expected the headwinds persisted at tripwire which declined in the quarter importantly we are encouraged by the progress made in addressing the business challenges including significantly improved sales force retention a pipeline of quality projects and a number of new product launches in addition the comparisons are much more favorable beginning in the second quarter for the segment we expect second quarter sales to increase approximately  to  sequentially and  to  yearoveryear i will now ask henk to provide additional insight into our first quarter financial performance henk hendrikus derksen  belden inc thank you john i will start my comments with results for the quarter followed by a review of our segment results a discussion of the balance sheet and close with our cash flow performance as a reminder i will be referencing adjusted results today please turn to slide  for a detailed consolidated review revenues in the quarter were  million increasing  from  million in the first quarter  higher copper prices favorably impacted revenues by  million and currency translation reduced revenues by  million after adjusting for these factors revenues increased  basis points organically from the prioryear period sequentially revenues decreased  million from  million in line with typical seasonality gross profit margins for the quarter were  decreasing  basis points from the prioryear period mainly due to higher copper prices as a reminder when copper costs increase we raise selling prices resulting in higher revenue with minimal impact to gross profit dollars as a result gross profit margins decreased sequentially gross profit margins decreased  basis points due to the seasonal pattern of our grass valley business and network solutions platform operating expenses for the quarter were  million or  of revenues decreasing  million from the prioryear period driven by productivity initiatives sequentially operating expenses decreased  million ebitda was  million in the quarter compared to the prior year ebitda increased  million or  ebitda margins were  in the quarter increasing  basis points from the prioryear period and decreasing  basis points sequentially net interest expense of  million for the quarter decreased  from the prior year and increased  sequentially driven by the number of days in the period for the fullyear  we expect interest expense to be approximately  million the effective tax rate for the first quarter was  compared to  in the prior year and  in the prior quarter for financial modeling purposes we recommend using a  effective tax rate for the second quarter and fullyear  net income in the quarter was  million increasing  million or  from  million in the prioryear period earnings per share was  in the quarter compared to  in the prioryear period the dilutive impact of the preferred equity issuance in july  was  in the quarter please turn to slide  i will now discuss revenues and operating results by business segment our broadcast solutions segment generated revenues of  million in the first quarter revenues decreased by  from  million in the prior period currency translation had an unfavorable impact of  million on an organic basis revenues increased  basis points yearoveryear broadcast ebitda margins were  in the quarter increasing  basis points due to productivity improvements our enterprise solutions segment generated revenues of  million during the quarter growing  compared to the first quarter  higher copper prices increased revenues by  million while currency translation reduced revenues by  on an organic basis revenues increased  from the prioryear period ebitda margins were  in the quarter decreasing  basis points from the prior year and increasing  basis points sequentially as expected industrial solutions segment generated revenues of  million in the quarter an increase of  from  million in the prioryear period copper had a favorable impact of  million while currency translation reduced revenues by  on an organic basis segment revenues grew  basis points in the quarter we are pleased with this result and encouraged by robust order growth of  in the quarter ebitda margins of  increased  basis points yearoveryear driven by productivity initiatives and mix our network solutions segment generated revenues of  million down  from  million in the prioryear period currency translation had an unfavorable impact of  million in the quarter on an organic basis revenues declined  yearoveryear ebitda margins of  decreased  basis points from the prioryear period driven by product mix if you will turn to slide  ill begin with our balance sheet highlights our cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the first quarter was  million compared to  million in the prior quarter and  million in the prior year the yearoveryear increase reflects the improvements made to our balance sheet and robust free cash flow generation working capital turns were  turns improving  turns yearoveryear days sales outstanding was  days in the first quarter an increase of  days sequentially and  days yearoveryear as a reminder fourth quarter  days sales outstanding benefited from the timing of customer prepayments ppe turnover was  turns improving  turns yearoveryear our total debt principal at the end of the quarter was  billion compared to  billion in the fourth quarter and  billion in the first quarter  the yearoveryear decrease reflects both the reduction – the debt reduction in  and currency translation on our eurodenominated debt net leverage was  times net debt to ebitda at the end of the first quarter compared to  times in the prior quarter and a significant improvement from  times in the prioryear period please turn to slide eight for a few cash flow highlights cash flow from operations in the first quarter was negative  million compared to positive  million in the prior year reflecting the timing of customer payments net capital expenditures were  million for the quarter down  million yearoveryear as a result free cash flow was a use of  million in the first quarter  compared to a use of  in the prioryear period for the full year  we expect to achieve free cash flow in the range of  million to  million that completes my prepared remarks i would now like to turn this call back to our president ceo and chairman john stroup for the outlook john john s stroup  belden inc thank you henk please turn to slide nine for our outlook regarding the second quarter and full year  results we delivered solid first quarter results that were in line with our expectations as a result we are reiterating our full year  revenue and eps guidance our industrial enterprise and broadcast platforms will continue to perform well and capture share we expect our network solutions platform to return to growth as we benefit from the corrective actions taken approximately six months ago consistent with our commitment to continuous improvement we expect further ebitda margin expansion across the organization in  further we are well positioned with a number of attractive inorganic opportunities we anticipate second quarter  revenues to be between  million and  million and eps of  to  for the full year we continue to expect revenues between  billion and  billion and we continue to expect eps of  to  that concludes our prepared remarks lauren please open the call to questions questionandanswer session operator john stroup your first question is from noelle dilts with stifel noelle dilts  stifel nicolaus  co inc hi guys thanks good morning john s stroup  belden inc good morning noelle noelle dilts  stifel nicolaus  co inc i just wanted to dig into the broadcast platform a bit more first just given the slowdown that you saw on broadband can you just give us a reminder of the key drivers there and a better sense of whats driving that acceleration as you move into the remainder of the year and then if you could give us a sense on some of the trends that youre seeing at grass valley from both a geographic and a product standpoint john s stroup  belden inc sure so in the broadband business we saw a couple of our larger customers manage their inventory positions much more closely than they have in the past and also we saw them pause slightly on some of their marketing programs as theyre dealing with some of the consolidation in the industry based on our conversations with those customers we believe those are temporary and isolated to the first quarter and therefore our team – our broadband team feels good about the second quarter and feels good about the full year were really not concerned about it we view it as a very temporary phenomenon and then as it relates to grass valley revenue growth was more balanced this quarter from a geographic point of view our domestic business and our international business were both up about the same about  i would say that activity in the first quarter was – as we expected it was good i was actually just at the largest broadcast trade show annually every year last week met with all of our largest customers and its extraordinarily clear that our team is winning were winning the highprofile projects but more importantly i think our team is winning more than their fair share of the other projects so we exit first quarter very confident in the grass valley team and product line and the business and we feel confident that the situation with the broadband business is temporary noelle dilts  stifel nicolaus  co inc great and then shifting over to networking solutions with – regarding tripwire can you just give us an update on how the effort to crosssell into the industrial market are progressing and where you stand there john s stroup  belden inc so i would say the activities at tripwire on the industrial side are going well and the real challenge we have at tripwire and its the same challenge weve been talking about for the last two quarters is growth within the enterprise segment that continues to be the challenge and in particular growth within the enterprise segment in north america i do think the team has made a lot of progress we focused on improved sales force retention thats gone well we focused on a couple of important product launches one of which we made here in the last week which i think is important and we fully expect that well see the benefits of those activities starting in the second quarter which is why i mentioned noelle that we would expect this segment to grow in the second quarter sequentially double digit and on a yearoveryear basis  to  so i feel like were moving into a much better patch with tripwire but theres no question thats been a major area of focus for me and the other team members here at belden noelle dilts  stifel nicolaus  co inc all right and then if i may have one more can you give us an update on your ma pipeline and particularly where you stand with digi at this point john s stroup  belden inc so we have a number of opportunities within the pipeline that i would characterize as being in the advanced stages of our funnel and our activity i would hope that we would have something that we could announce in the notsodistant future as it pertains to digi in particular we really dont have anything more we can comment at this time were – maybe like a lot people were anxious to hear their earnings release later this week to see how theyre performing but really dont have anything else to comment at this point noelle dilts  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thank you john s stroup  belden inc thank you noelle operator sir next well go to shawn harrison with longbow research shawn m harrison  longbow research llc good morning john john s stroup  belden inc hey shawn shawn m harrison  longbow research llc just want to go back to tripwire in that legacy nomenclature but my back of the envelope says it was down maybe  yearoveryear in the first quarter is that right and then as we move into the second quarter what type of yearoveryear growth rate do you expect from tripwire do you just expect it to get back to kind of level bubble at that point of time john s stroup  belden inc yeah shawn so your math is pretty close i think the tripwire business in the first quarter was down about  so youre directionally correct in the second quarter we would expect the tripwire business on a yearoveryear business to be about flat and that would be kind of the turning point in my view of the business shawn so we would expect that we would see growth in the back half with tripwire and as i said on the earlier comments to noelle the improvement needs to come in north america enterprise its the largest vertical for them its the area where they struggle the most and as i said before we believe the root cause has been sales force retention and also new product development new product launches and i feel like weve made good progress on both so ive got a lot of confidence that were going to see that show up in the results starting in the second quarter shawn m harrison  longbow research llc okay its helpful and then second maybe just talk about the progress of both the industrial solutions business as well as the old industrial it business as the quarter progress in terms of growth in bookings and maybe what youve seen through april now john s stroup  belden inc so both of those businesses had very strong results in our discrete manufacturing vertical which is what you would have expected they diversed a little bit in oil and gas so our industrial connectivity – or sorry our industrial solutions business had more headwinds in oil and gas because they had a large project they shipped in the first quarter of last year i think it was in canada that was actually on the order book the year prior so you may recall shawn that in the first quarter last year we did a little bit better in the oil and gas vertical than what we expected and that was because of that project but if you look at it on a fullyear basis were expecting that were going to see growth in all of our verticals within our two industrial businesses except for oil and gas so on a fullyear basis were still expecting oil and gas to be down slightly were expecting our discrete business to be up somewhere between  to  were expecting process outside of oil and gas to be up  to  we had good orders in the quarter our orders at industrial solutions were up  we had a good booktobill order rates in april have been good activity is good so we came into the year thinking that our industrial businesses were wellpositioned i think they are our industrial it business was up  in the quarter so i would expect our industrial businesses to do very well throughout the year our enterprise businesses seem wellpositioned throughout the year our broadcast businesses i think are wellpositioned for me the focus is really on seeing the improvement at tripwire in the second quarter and then continuing to make progress on these inorganic activities shawn m harrison  longbow research llc okay very helpful and henk if i may just a clarification for sga into the second quarter on a dollar basis maybe where youd expect that to range hendrikus derksen  belden inc so slightly up from the first quarter roughly  million to  million up from the first quarter shawn shawn m harrison  longbow research llc perfect thanks guys and congrats on a good start to the year john s stroup  belden inc thank you operator and sir your next question comes from sherri scribner with deutsche bank sherri a scribner  deutsche bank securities inc hi thank you i just wanted to dig into the enterprise segment a little bit strong growth there and good growth on an inorganic basis but the margins came down i think you said it was in line with your expectations can you maybe talk through the trends that youre seeing there and what pressured margins on a yearoveryear basis john s stroup  belden inc yes sherri so one of the challenges our enterprise business has in the shortrun is when theres movement in copper prices within a given quarter sometimes theyre not able to pass the price increases on as quickly as they consume the inventory theyve already purchased so if there is a negative consequence of having high inventory turns its that in a environment of rising copper prices unfortunately we have to deal with those rising prices a little bit sooner than some of our competitors and therefore sometimes we have a slight mismatch between our pricing and the copper that were consuming in it as it relates to the products that were building so that was the big challenge for the enterprise team on a yearoveryear basis we did see improvement sequentially in enterprise from q to q but that was a bit of a challenge for us on a yearoveryear basis nothing else is going on product mix is good connector revenue was up substantially in the business on a yearoveryear basis thats favorable to mix cat a was up thats favorable to mix so its not anything that im concerned about sherri a scribner  deutsche bank securities inc and how long would you take – expected to take to pass on those higher copper prices would you expect to see more normalized margins in the second quarter or does it take more than two to three quarters john s stroup  belden inc it would normally be about  days so i would expect to see it show up in the second quarter results sherri a scribner  deutsche bank securities inc okay great and then john if i could just ask you sort of a macro question what is your feeling from customers about the macro outlook how are customers thinking about growth this year and how confident are they in spending thanks john s stroup  belden inc sure so it varies of course a little bit by segment but i would say the general mood is positive i think that the people that i talk to have some optimism as it relates to a more businessfriendly government in the united states a feeling that interest rates are going to remain relatively low even if they pick up a little bit by historical standards are going to remain low theres a lot of pentup demand i would say particularly in the industrial end markets so theres a real change i would say in sentiment with our customers now compared to even say six to nine months ago sherri a scribner  deutsche bank securities inc thanks so much john s stroup  belden inc thank you operator sir your next question comes from rod hall with jpmorgan ashwin x kesireddy  jpmorgan securities llc yeah hi thanks for taking my question this is ashwin on behalf of rod i want to go back to the discussion around weakness in the broadband market and see kind of what gives you the confidence that this would be isolated to probably just one quarter and the second question is on visibility across various businesses it looks like activity levels have gone better in enterprise and industrial markets so im just wondering like if we should be thinking about possible upside to the  guidance thanks john s stroup  belden inc sure so in order i would say that the reason that weve got confidence with the broadband business is because we have a number of large customer relationships that weve had for an extended period of time and our intimacy with those customers is high and very constructive and collaborative and we also have a very experienced management team with our broadband business and therefore they have a lot of credibility with us and so we have conversations with those customers frequently we have visibility to the movement of their product off their shelf under their inventory we have vmi in many cases so we have a lot of visibility into those customers and thats the reason why ive got optimism that the team is going to perform as they forecasted i would say the end market in enterprise are stable theyve been good for some time they continue to be good havent really seen much of a change in enterprise but theres no question that the market is improving in the industrial segment particularly in discrete and that discrete improvement is somewhat muted by the oil and gas headwinds that i believe are going to subside in the back half of the year so i think the strong demand in discrete is going to be more obvious to everybody in the second half when its not offset by some of the weakness in oil and gas ashwin x kesireddy  jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks a lot operator our next question comes from john quealy with canaccord john salvatore quealy  canaccord genuity inc hey good morning folks a couple of questions first i think henk you were talking about the gross margin change yearonyear if i get my numbers right  basis points with grass valley seasonality and some tripwire given the discussion on tripwire in q thus far can you just break out what the delta was grass valley versus tripwire it seems more tripwire hendrikus derksen  belden inc no the sequential – the change in margin youre talking to john was typical seasonality was from q to q john salvatore quealy  canaccord genuity inc got you yes got you hendrikus derksen  belden inc on a yearoveryear basis those profit margins came down slightly because of the math on the increase in our sales because of the passthrough of copper so if we adjust for that its effectively flat john salvatore quealy  canaccord genuity inc okay so tripwire isnt an unnecessary drag on the margin in q hendrikus derksen  belden inc thats correct john salvatore quealy  canaccord genuity inc okay okay secondly on digi or the potential tender on digi john is this sort of a feel or kill type of thing in your mind or is it open ended as a lot of ma comes and goes in your pipeline how should we think about it we just get a lot of questions around this particular transaction but how do you couch this particular one john s stroup  belden inc well i would say digi unlike most of the ma that were engaged in is obviously a little bit more public but digi continues to be in our opinion a highly attractive business where if it was a part of belden would be enormously valuable and shareholder value creative for both digi shareholders and belden shareholders so we continue to be very optimistic about the combination very interested in the combination and i would say at this point were very interested in seeing how they perform in the quarter ending march and maybe more importantly were very interested in how they see the rest of the year playing out so were just going to be listening very closely to their earnings release i think theyll go tomorrow if i remember correctly and then well continue to monitor john salvatore quealy  canaccord genuity inc okay thanks and then last for you john so at the broadcast show last week i was struck by a lot of the industry focusing on virtualization and not quite a lot of talk about hosting for broadcast customers but talk about some of the interplay there obviously some of the teams were all focused on proprietary to ip and analog to digital and things like these but from a business model perspective talk about virtualization and hosting and how you see that move forward thanks guys john s stroup  belden inc yes so i would say at the show there were two big themes one was this whole thing about how they do a better job leveraging it hardware and software through virtualization and hosting and of course this is all related to playout and then the second large trend was how they introduce ip into infrastructure investments and i feel like on the latter topic were extraordinarily well positioned weve got a great solution weve got a number of highprofile projects that were working on partnering in some cases with cisco and of course with our open architecture were very very well positioned i would say on the playout side there was an acknowledgment by a lot of the large broadcasters that their efforts are not going as quickly as they would have expected and thats somewhat maybe surprising to us our traditional linear playout our legacy business which grass valley and miranda have always very strong in continues to grow and i think thats because broadcasters recognize that although overthetop is important its still a relatively small percentage of their revenues its a very small percentage of their advertising and therefore making investments in their linear playout is important so id say its an industry thats still in flux its not surprising to see i would say volatility in results by companies ive heard this week we had one of our competitors harmonic went and theyre obviously big in playout and they disappointed and i think thats because theyre struggling to get their arms around whats happening in that segment john salvatore quealy  canaccord genuity inc and john as a followup just talking to some of the people there sports and live seemed to be very – to your characterization which i would agree with in terms of the broadcasters i heard sports and live was a little bit more encouraged around spending versus maybe some of the general content producers can you talk about – from an end market perspective for you folks i know youre more geared toward live but what are you hearing from customer sentiments by content market thank you john s stroup  belden inc yes yes thank you so thats exactly what were hearing is that sports and live both – and news by the way as well both are the best lever for our customers to generate advertising spend to generate revenue and those are the areas that theyre most interested in making their investments and so conversations we had last week with all the major networks and rights holders around investments in sports was very encouraging theres debate by the way about technology hdr versus k continues to be a debate but the good news is we are one of the first with a k camera i think we have the best hdr camera we clearly have the best switchers so i think when these customers make investments were extraordinarily wellpositioned operator our next question comes from matt mccall with seaport global securities matt mccall  seaport global securities llc thank you good morning everybody hendrikus derksen  belden inc good morning matt john s stroup  belden inc hi matt matt mccall  seaport global securities llc so john last quarter you gave some good insight into some pointofsale data i think you talked about it in enterprise and industrial i think one was strong and one was very strong can you give us an update on those trends and how theyre impacting your outlook john s stroup  belden inc so our pointofsale information was consistent with what we had seen in the fourth quarter meaning it was very strong it was also in line with our billings inventory came down a little bit in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter not a lot but some and therefore our pos was a little bit stronger than our billings data so i would say the pos data is consistent and supportive of how we view the year is going to play out matt mccall  seaport global securities llc okay all right lets see second question the new network segment can you talk about the margin outlook you have there i know in the quarter you said favorable mix investments in products you talked about elevated rd new segment kind of new numbers how do you want us to think about the quarter or the full year for network john s stroup  belden inc i think on a fullyear basis this segment ought to be generating ebitda margins around  and that would include healthy margins in both our hardware routers and switches wired and wireless switches as well as our cyber security software products and of course in both cases a very healthy rd investment but ebitda margins i would expect to be about  matt mccall  seaport global securities llc and does that include some recovery in tripwire beyond what youre forecasting for kind of the flattish number for q john s stroup  belden inc it does it includes tripwire performing as expected which will include improvement from the first quarter but it also includes a healthy investment in rd for new product development at tripwire as well matt mccall  seaport global securities llc okay okay and finally category a growth seems to slow a little bit sequentially did i hear that right and if so is it just a matter of more difficult comps is there something else going on i think last quarter it was  or  growth if i remember it correctly john s stroup  belden inc so it was up  in the first quarter i wouldnt read too much into that i mean i think thats a healthy growth level youre right i think it is a little bit lower than it was the quarter before but that product line is still a relatively small percentage of the total and it can be pretty strongly influenced by a big project here or there so its clearly the product category our team is leading with and it is the preferred product for a lot of greenfields because of the fact that it has power over ethernet in addition to high bandwidth matt mccall  seaport global securities llc okay thank you john operator well go next to william stein with suntrust william stein  suntrust robinson humphrey inc great thank you for taking my question really just on the network solutions combination im wondering if that combination reflects a sales reorganization too whereby perhaps you have no more dedicated tripwire sales people and theyre more selling solutions in the network end market john s stroup  belden inc no the tripwire sales force continues to be intact and predominantly focused in enterprise and government applications there is a lot more collaboration though with the belden industrial sales force on cyber security opportunities and there has been a lot more coordination between our legacy industrial it business and tripwire in some of the back office functions like finance for example theres also been some activity within the engineering group to help them improve their speed of new product development but the tripwire sales force remains intact independent with their own sales force leader who has global responsibility and again predominantly focused on enterprise and government end markets william stein  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thats helpful a couple more details on this though does this consolidation imply or should we take it to mean you no longer expect to sell tripwire into the broadcast end market and then id also love to hear your take on the difference between your tripwire results and those of your partner in some cases fireeye which looks like had very good results last night is that an indication that demand for this type of product is strong but the sales force sort of issues that youve had in the past are sort of overwhelming your ability to capitalize on that opportunity in the near term john s stroup  belden inc so the first question is that this change in reporting structure is a reflection of how were organized so the gentleman that is responsible for tripwire and industrial it same individual the financial information is consolidated at that level and has absolutely no significance as it relates to the opportunities with broadcast so we remain encouraged by opportunities in broadcast but were also realistic about the fact that thats probably going to come – the market is probably going to come slower than industrial given how nascent they are in the application of it in their workflow management now what just recently happened at netflix might be an interesting stimulus for broadcasters paying more attention to the consequences of ip because in the past that wouldnt have been possible because they would have been on proprietary network and we that conversations with a number of the large broadcasters about their cyber security initiatives i just think we have to be realistic that its not going to happen as swiftly as its happened within industrial and then your second question as it relates to how much of our challenge is market versus execution and i think that in this particular case we are dealing with both if you look at the fireeye results that came out yesterday and you look at their billings as opposed to their revenue because remember their revenue is recognized in prior period activity their billings were actually pretty weak and i would say somewhat consistent with us if you look at qualys for example which we compete with in vulnerability management which is only about  of our revenue they had a pretty good quarter and were seeing continued strength within vulnerability management but were seeing some softness within the scm product line which is about  of our revenue and then as ive said theres no question that our execution needs to improve at tripwire were doing really well outside of the united states were doing really well in verticals outside of enterprise but were not doing as well as we need to in our core market and i think that has to do with sales force retention which i think weve addressed as well as new product introduction that i think were currently addressing and weve incorporated that into our full year guidance william stein  suntrust robinson humphrey inc great thanks for the update john s stroup  belden inc youre welcome hendrikus derksen  belden inc thank you will operator our next question comes from greg mesniaeff with drexel hamilton greg mesniaeff  drexel hamilton llc yes good morning just to follow up on the commentary about addressing the sales force turnover at tripwire and the retention tools that you put in place are those tools now going to have to be implemented across the entire organization at belden or is it just really compartmentalized to tripwire john s stroup  belden inc i think its largely unique to our sales force at tripwire by the way some of the things we did there are things we had already done in other parts of the company so whether it was our ability to effectively communicate our ability to make certain that we had good alignment with our quota setting what i would consider to be just good sales practices that we needed to tidy up at tripwire which are not unique within belden but then the other thing that we did because we were seeing a lot of these feedback cyber security companies and earlystage pe cyber security companies get more aggressive with our salespeople we put in place a more lucrative compensation package for those folks that would kick in based on actual performance so more risk more reward for the individuals and of course that is a program that resonates well with our high performers and probably its a little bit concerning to those folks that are not performing as well and that has been in place now for i guess we announced it and described it maybe about five months ago and since putting that in place weve seen dramatic improvement in sales force turnover and i think that its – i think its working greg mesniaeff  drexel hamilton llc thank you john s stroup  belden inc youre welcome operator
