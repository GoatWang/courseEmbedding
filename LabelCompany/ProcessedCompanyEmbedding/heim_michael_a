prolotherapy and prp treatments regenerative injection treatments that work dr heim injecting prp platelet rich plasma injection to treat chronic achilles tendinitis harnessing the body’s natural ability to heal itself prolotherapy prp platelet rich plasma stem cells and ozone are nonsurgical regenerative injection treatments that stimulates the body’s own healing process to heal acute and chronic tendon ligament and cartilage injuries such as torn meniscus plantar fasciitis rotator cuff injuries carpal tunnel syndrome and tennis and golfer’s elbow among others it is believed than many injuries are a result of ligament and tendon laxity which cause instability and pain in our joints regenerative injection treatments are usually used when other treatments such as antiinflammatory medications physical therapy and surgery are not an option or have failed to provide benefit but can be used as first line treatment for these conditions as well during prolotherapy treatment a precise injection of a mild irritant solution such as lidocaine mixed with sterile dextrose and water is injected directly on the torn ligament stretched tendon or injured cartilage creating a mild or controlled injury that stimulates the body’s natural healing process this controlled inflammation increases blood flow to the area and naturally stimulates the body to repair itself this process brings growth factors and healing blood cells that encourage the growth of new ligament or tendon fibers this process results in a stronger tighter tissue structure that corrects instability and removes the source of pain during prp treatment a patient’s blood is drawn and then spun in a centrifuge to separate the red blood cells from the plasma the plasma is then injected directly into the area of injury using the same injection technique as prolotherapy plasma contains a high concentration of growth factors and healing blood cells so not only are you stimulating the body’s natural healing process with the injection but you are delivering a high concentration of the bodies natural healing cells directly to the site of injury and pain these areas typically have little blood flow which is why they fail to completely heal at times and can turn in to chronic injuries and pain prp is being widely used by professional athletes to recover from injuries quickly and without surgery stem cells are cells the body produces that have the ability to change in to any cell type when mixed with platelet rich plasma and injected in the same manner as prolotherapy and prp you combine the immune stimulating effects of prolotherapy the healing properties of prp and the tools to regenerate tissue although not currently approved by the fda stem cell treatments are being widely used worldwide for musculoskeletal disease and injury and provides a great alternative to conventional treatments such as surgery ozone gas is used as sole treatment or more commonly as an addition to prolotherapy prp for stem cell treatments ozone provides injured tissue with concentrated levels of oxygen one of the main requirements needed for healing it also stimulates the immune system increases circulation and reduces inflammation all of which helps to accelerate healing and reduce pain a single prolotherapy or prp treatment sets the stage for healing but the regenerative and strengthening that occurs continues for months after treatment although some patients may only need a single injection session treatment usually consists of a series of injections every  –  weeks until the desired result is obtained response from treatments depend on health and nutrition status of the patient severity of the injury and how long the injury has been present what to expect after treatment patients can expect to experience mild to moderate pain and inflammation after regenerative injection treatments this is normal and expected as the body goes through the normal inflammatory and injury repair process as if the area has a new injury pain subsides after  –  days and may be treated with non – antiinflammatory medication such as tylenol or a prescription pain medication it is important not to use antiinflammatory medication such as advil aleve ibuprofen naproxen or aspirin as they will inhibit the healing process after the initial discomfort patients may feel benefit right away but may take a couple weeks to start feeling improvement the repair process however can go on for  –  years after the treatment patients can generally return to activity within a week after treatment injuries and conditions commonly treated by our regenerative procedures include achilles tendonitis acl injuries biceps tendinosis golfer’s elbow iliotibial band syndrome ligament injuries osteoarthritis rotator cuff injuries sports injuries tennis elbow joint rejuvenation protocol avoid or delay surgery with dr heim’s joint rejuvenation program arthritis and injuries such as meniscus

prp and ozone administration nutritional supplements and a diet program designed to maximize your bodies ability to heal and regenerate the heim rejuvenation protocols do not just involve injecting

guidance to allow for maximum accuracy the heim regenerative medicine difference there are more and more practitioners adding prp treatments to their practices the training to truly understand and apply the principles of regenerative medicine however is crucial to to getting results many providers are simply injecting prp into the joint space of the knee for instance when in reality treatment must be targeted to the structures that maintain the integrity of the joint as a whole whereas one provider might perform a single injection to treat a knee dr heim will many times inject as many as  or more sights on the same knee in addition to injecting into the joint space the injection techniques used with regenerative medicine is truly an art that takes many hours of training in order to perfect in the last  months alone dr heim has attended over  hours of training including ultrasound guided injection training on human cadavers in addition he attended an intensive week long
