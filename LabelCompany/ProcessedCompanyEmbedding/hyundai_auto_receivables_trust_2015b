new yorkbusiness wireas part of its ongoing surveillance fitch ratings has taken the following rating actions on hyundai auto receivables trust a class a affirmed at aaasf with a stable outlook class a affirmed at aaasf with a stable outlook class b upgraded to aaasf from aasf outlook revised to stable from positive class c upgraded to aasf from asf with a positive outlook class d affirmed at bbbsf with a positive outlook key rating drivers the ratings are based on available credit enhancement ce and loss performance under the ce structure the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the current ratings and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the documents the ratings reflect the quality of hyundai capital america retail auto loan originations the strength of its servicing capabilities and the sound financial and legal structure of the transaction the positive outlook on the subordinate note reflects fitchs expectation that as loss coverage levels improve positive rating actions are likely over the course of the next year rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for the transaction lower loss coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coverage in fitchs initial review of the transaction the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to a x and x increase of fitchs base case loss expectation to date the transaction has exhibited strong performance consistent with fitchs initial expectations with rising loss coverage and multiple levels this increased loss coverage

credit loss proxy is  of the sv and rv loss proxy  evolving wholesale market the us wholesale vehicle market has been normalizing following strong performance in recent years fitch expects that

unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles andor increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case this would likely result in declines of credit enhancement and loss coverage levels available to the notes hence fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing the transactions initial base case rv and credit loss assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes the increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent moderate x and severe x
