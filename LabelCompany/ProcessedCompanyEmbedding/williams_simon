platform its products continue to be widely used in that sector today distributed and supported by ca inc synon pioneered what is now sometimes called architected rapid application development arad chronologyedit synon ltd was founded in london in  by simon williams ceo melinda horton coo and nick knowles cto with the objective of developing an application generator for the ibm system platform they were soon joined by simon haigh vp sales seed funding was provided by french connection a uk fashion house which later achieved notoriety for its fcuk advertising slogan synons first product was synon a programming productivity toolkit for the system launched in  in the same year the company appointed its first overseas distributors in australia and norway synons flagship product synon was launched in  and became an immediate success with system users the same year chris herron formerly ceo of fusion along with patrick batty of toronto and gerard wolf of chicago set up synon inc synons us sales and marketing subsidiary in larkspur california synon also established a worldwide distribution channel with subsidiaries in france germany australia hong kong and japan in  synon played a key role alongside ibm at the uk launch of its as platform the as version of synon was named synone in  synon along with bachman intersolv knowledgeware and systematica was chosen by ibm to be at the heart of adcycle its framework for application development and case ibm later acquired an equity stake in synon in  french connection sold its equity stake to general atlantic partners and ta associates two us vcs as a condition of the transaction synon moved its hq to larkspur and became a delaware corporation changing its name to synon corporation shortly afterwards chris herron became ceo simon williams who remained based in the uk continued as chairman and cto in  technicolor rome following the vision of it director vincenzo compagnoni used synon at that time a pioneer technology to develop its entire information system  rpg programs computerising the whole film laboratory supply chain and demonstrating the consistency of case tool technologies in  synon launched synon model applications an accounting package developed using synone in the same year the company won the queens awards for technology and for export becoming one of only a handful of companies ever to win both awards in the same year in  simon williams believing that the company was in danger of missing the clientserver technology wave left synon together with melinda horton to establish dysys a selffunded uk startup whose object was to develop a clientserver crossplatform successor to synone in  williams and horton sold dysys to synon and returned to the fold their new product obsydian was launched by synon in  by  synons revenue was  million with around  customers worldwide in  synon was acquired by sterling software of plano texas sterling continued to distribute and support synone and obsydian as coole and coolplex la crosse management systems of la crosse wisconsin acquired synon model applications from sterling and continues to distribute it as la crosse financials in  sterling was acquired by computer associates now ca which continues to distribute and develop synone and obsydian as ca e and ca plex simon williams went on to develop the associative model of data and to found lazysoft technologyedit as early as  synon pioneered the approach to development which in early  became known as architected rapid application development arad such tools use abstract patterns as building blocks to automatically generate the components of an application in synon developers use a specialized language to define an applications data model and the rules that ensure its integrity they then select from a set of around  prebuilt program design templates which perform edit display and print functions in full screen multiline and transaction full screen header above a multiline detail modes developers may further specialise the procedural logic of the selected templates and link templates together by using action diagrams the tool then automatically instantiates the specialized templates over the data model and generates highlevel language code in rpg or cobol without any further developer intervention it also generates the sql or dds code to define the necessary database tables and views synon kept precise productivity metrics during the internal development of its sma accounting system in total  days of effort were expended on development and qa over a month period which resulted in the creation of  million lines of hll code excluding comments in  programs this is equivalent to the production of  lines of fully tested and documented code per person per day the allin fully loaded cost including management design and enduser documentation was £ per program synon was also ahead of its time by adopting a strictly object oriented approach to the programs that it generated for instance programmers could not use native hll commands to operate on database tables instead all physical database creates changes and retrievals were encapsulated within individual templates which were in turn evoked by generated programs thus programs could be automatically regenerated with no manual intervention following changes to the structure of the database in  ca introduced an addon tool to ca e called web option which allows e customers to webenable their existing applications and to run those applications which were originally designed for an ibm greenscreen inside a standard web browser obsydian follows the same general principles as synon with the important exception that developers can create and reuse their own abstract design templates
