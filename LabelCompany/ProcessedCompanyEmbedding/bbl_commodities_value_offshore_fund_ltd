team along with him in this opalesquetv interview mr goldberg discusses how his relative value commodity approach differs from many other hedge fund peers in the sector and how the investment process more appropriately reflects the actions taken within an oil trading house the strategy is versatile in its application and expression and is designed to operate in different and changing market conditions trade expressions are predominantly designed through futures based spreads with a focus on the middle part of the futures curve whilst the strategy may take directional exposure it typically has no directional bias and provides diversity by being comprised of different trades through the petroleum complex which at times may be independently bullish or bearish in nature the foundation of the investment process is the fundamental analysis of micro supply and demand balances in global oil and micro oil market seeking to identify and capitalize on the potentially
