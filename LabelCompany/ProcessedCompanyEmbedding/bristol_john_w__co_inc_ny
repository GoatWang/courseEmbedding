home  john w bristol john w bristol  co inc is a privately owned independent investment adviser more about us investment products  john w bristol balanced a balanced portfolio format offers advantages both to the manager and to the client for the manager being able to use all three components of the portfolio construction — stock selection bond selection and asset allocation — allows for flexibility that produces more consistent returns for the client such as an endowment having a balanced manager can add value because the pivotal asset allocation decision is reviewed continuously by a professional investment organization rather than part time by an investment committee while providing substantial manager flexibility and oversight this framework does allow investment committees to set constraints on asset allocation equity in equity investing better than average company earnings and dividend growth over the long term generally produce the best returns hence we dedicate much of our work to identifying factors likely to cause such growth for both individual companies and for sectors of the economy however we recognize earnings and dividend prospects cannot be considered in a vacuum they must be related to the price of a security to similar investments and to alternative investments including riskfree bonds accordingly we quantify the prospective performance of various classes of assets at any given time then use these anticipated returns as a frame of reference for constructing our portfolio we rely heavily on a researchintensive tirekicking companybycompany approach to ascertain the key underpinnings driving longterm growth as we own stocks for at least three to five years on average a close understanding of what makes a company tick is particularly important to us no magic formula exists for investment success indeed past successes often seem to sow seeds of their own destruction we distrust dogma and try to remain flexible in addition we maintain portfolio diversity to dampen volatility our longterm goal is to provide clients with a growing stream of income while at a minimum maintaining the purchasing power of their capital bond in bonds normal interest rates sector valuations and individual security research drive our process  the relative importance depends on position in the interest rate cycle  our turnover tends to be low  we use foreign currency bonds when we believe they are appropriate  the overall quality of our bond portfolio has been consistently high contact us  john w bristol contact information for general

securities enables us as a group to make sounder decisions about individual securities this collaborative process also provides us with a base of knowledge for making judgments in the future our basic approach has remained constant over our history although we regularly finetune it the same team analyzes both bonds and stocks so that we have a good feel for the wider market environment when we
