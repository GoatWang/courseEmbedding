option strategy consists of selling writing call options to secure gains and generate premiums over a market cycle generally on  of the total value of the fund’s portfolio the fund will realize a gain or loss upon the expiration or closing of the option contract when an option is exercised the proceeds on sales of the underlying security for a written call option are adjusted by the amount of premium received or paid the risk in writing a call option is that the fund gives up the opportunity for profit if the market price of the security increases and the option is exercised risks may also arise from an illiquid secondary market or from the inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contract a decision as to whether when and how to sell options under the fund’s strategy involves the exercise of skill and judgment and even a wellconceived transaction may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or unexpected events when an option sold by the fund is exercised or closed out the fund may be required to sell portfolio securities or to deliver portfolio securities to the option purchaser to satisfy its obligations when it would not otherwise choose to do so or the fund may choose to sell portfolio securities to realize gains to offset the losses realized upon option exercise such sales or delivery would involve transaction costs borne by the fund and may also result in realization of taxable capital gains including shortterm capital gains taxed at ordinary income tax rates and may adversely impact the fund’s aftertax returnsthis fund has
