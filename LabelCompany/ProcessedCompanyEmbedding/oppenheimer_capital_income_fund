bond market is volatile and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities fixed income securities also carry inflation risk liquidity risk call risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss there is an options regulatory fee from  to  per contract which applies to both option buy and sell transactions the fee is subject to change stock markets are volatile and can fluctuate significantly in response to company industry political regulatory market or economic developments investing in stock involves risks including the loss of principal because of their narrow focus sector investments

is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency fidelity investments and its affiliates the fund’s sponsor have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time the municipal market can be affected by adverse tax legislative or

be exempt from state and local income taxes such interest dividends may be subject to federal andor state alternative minimum taxes certain funds normally seek to invest only in municipal securities generating income exempt from both federal income taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax however outcomes cannot be guaranteed and the funds may sometimes generate income subject to these taxes

bond market is volatile and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities fixed income securities also carry inflation risk liquidity risk call risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss there is an options regulatory fee from  to  per contract which applies to both option buy and sell transactions the fee is subject to change stock markets are volatile and can fluctuate significantly in response to company industry political regulatory market or economic developments investing in stock involves risks including the loss of principal because of their narrow focus sector investments
