reserved slave forgotten pleasures  nesselrode pie •the domestic frontforgotten pleasures  nesselrode pie •the domestic front forgotten pleasures — nesselrode pie last minute gift  pecan brittle have a very merry christmas  bourbon balls i don’t know if i have an old fashioned palate or if it’s my inner historian or if i’m just plain curious but whenever i hear about a recipe or a dish that is extinct my mouth starts watering i love poring through old cookbooks and finding recipes for foods that you just don’t see today — prune whip creamed chipped beef blancmange welsh rabbit but this particular forgotten dish — nesselrode pie — piqued my interest like no other if you’ve been reading this blog over the past few weeks you may have noticed that i am drawn to holiday recipes that feature booze or candied fruit peel or chocolate so when i heard about nesselrode pie — a cream pie flavored with rum and candied peel and garnished with chocolate — i pretty much thought that i may have found the ultimate holiday dessert traditionally nesselrode named after count karl nesselrode a th century russian diplomat featured candied chestnuts or chestnut puree also traditional to the holidays but for whatever reason probably largely related to the shocking labor and therefore expense associated with candying chestnuts nesselrode pie which was popular in new york in the ’s and ’s became associated with candied fruits no chestnuts and rum most of the recipes i could find featured a product called “nesselro” which contained candied fruits including cauliflower which supposedly mimicked the texture of chestnuts in a rum flavored syrup which i though i had tracked down a few years ago at the vermont country store but which sadly seems to be unobtainable instead i scoured the internet for recipes and combined them into one i thought would be a decadent holiday pie and an excellent alternative to the pumpkin and pecan you see this time of year i can’t promise that it’s authentic — i’ve never tasted another nesselrode pie but i can say that when my mom tasted it she said “this tastes like my childhood” and i can promise that if rum and fruit and chocolate float your boat this will be the holiday pie for you from  reviewsnesselrode pie authorkate wheelerserves prep time  minscook time  minstotal time  mins print ingredientsfor crumb crust½ c chocolate cookie

lovely little pie i’ve never heard of nesselrode before d katie b december   heyhttpwwwultimategourmetcomproductdetailsaspbrandraffettotypefruittoppingsnamenesslrofruittoppingboom apparently in stocki’m torn about this pie i don’t really like eggy custardy desserts eg flan anything featuring meringue those dutch babystyle sweet breakfast omelets but the forgotten favorite holds a powerful appeal for me would i be able to deal w the eggs do you think i can and do eat creme brulee and tiramisu… jason martin july   my family made the pie originally it a family recipe i am a desendant of ada nesslerott my grandmall kate  the domestic front december   katie —you are a true web sleuth however even though i am quite fond of nesselrode pie i’m not sure i’m  jars of nesselro fondbecause of the whipped cream this is definitely more on the creamy side than the eggy side plus the rum and chestnuts cover up that egg flavor but it is a cream pie which means it is custard based suz lipman december   i once referenced nesselrode pie in a fiction piece i loved the oldfashioned ring to it it’s great to really learn its history thanks for tracking down its origins and ingredients chris december   welsh rarebit – not rabbit there’s no rabbit involved kate december   ha chris — i know there’s no rabbit involved it’s actually a big debate which one is correct — the story i’ve heard and which sounds entirely plausible to me is that welsh rabbit is a pejorative term for the dish invented by the english that’s intended to comment on the poverty of the welsh i’ve heard yeas and nays on both sides but that’s the story i’m sticking to so i call it rabbit disneypal december   how funny you would post this – your timing is perfect for me i recently saw an episode of andy griffith and they were talking about this pie i heard it was in the mayberry cookbook so i sought it out lots of great recipes in that book btw i just bought the ingredients to make it – it is very similar to your only the crust is a traditional crust not a chocolate crumb crust i also am interested in long forgotten recipes apparently this was quite a popular pie for a while and then it just kind of disappeared gourmet mama december   this sounds fascinating     now i want to make it i love old recipes myself in fact i grew up with quite a few including the welsh rarebitrabbit which my mother used to make us for lunch since i’m half welsh i always thought it rather appropriate 😀 michael pheneger march   this is so great driving home this evening i remarked to my wife “what is nesselroad pie” for some reason i thought about that pie from my childhood i googled this and was directed here i looked at the recipe and sure enough those memories started comeing back as a practicing chef i eal with food daily in a large hotel i could almost taste the flavors of this recipe and can hardly wait to make it on my upcoming vacation the week after easter happy cooking everyone karl october   there was a bakery called sttuers french pastries in brooklyn greenwich village and somewhere in queens which produced an absolutely perfect nesselrode pie it’s neither flanlike or eggy and for years i’ve been looking for a bakery which would attempt to replicate my memories unfortunately sutters has been out of business for years and the last place i had a slice was sweets a fish restaurant down by the south street seaport at one time this pie was so ubiquitous in nyc that you could get it at any horn  hardardt automatif anyone locates a source for the finished pie please post it karl october   sorry it’s sutters not stutters mrs november   with all respect this recipe is outta whack arthur schwartz aka the food maven has been into food for half a century and has the most authentic recipe online cut paste httpwwwthefoodmavencomradiorecipesnesselrodehtml chestnut puree makes the mushy outcome pictured you can substitute candied fruits even just candied orange peel i usually soak the fruits in rum for a couple of days a third cup of raw rum is too overpowering in what should be a custard and cream filling the crust should be a plain fluted and flaky butter crust pre baked karl november   actually a graham cracker crust is perfect for this dessert mrs november   i sent kate a lazy version of nesselrode pie…it may lack culinary standards but in this age of nonexistent rum soaked chestnuts it serves us well karl consider an oreo chocolate cookie crust karl november   oreo cookies sacre bleu the count must be turning over in his grave mrs november   mon dieu not wthe oreo cream the cookie crust comes prepackaged like the graham cracker one i’ve embarrassed sweet kate enuf so let me wish you all a wonderful nesselrodeless happy thanksgiving i caved…doing a homemade ‘pumpkin pie  baked apples martyg january   just scanning the net and found the nesselrode comments and it brought back memories i’ve eaten it many times hortense spier made it and sold it to many places including peter lugers in brooklyn she made wonderful desserts and for me it was a tough decision between the nesselrode and the blueberry crumb this bit of nostalgia has disappeared unfortunately there was a bakery in brooklyn on morgan avenue that continued to make them for quite a while the name escapes me i guess it’s hostess twinkies now d brophy january   my mother used to make my favorite pie of all time…the nesselrode this was through the ’s and ’s and i believe she used  layers of bavarian cream rum flavoredcovered with unsweetened chocolate shavings she always said that it was not a true nesselrode pie but it was delicious the added benefit may be that you don’t have to find the nesselro ladychef march   great to see this old recipe revived madeleine kamman mentions nesselrode in her books and she did fold chestnut puree into the bavaroise but most of the boomer generation rejected anything that resembled fruitcake shudderbrowsing through my professional library in his  edition of the baker’s manual for quantity baking joseph amendola gives this version of nesselrode to use in his pie “soak together  ounces each of cherries pineapple and raisins  ounces of chestnuts and  ounce of rum” the mixture is folded into the filling at the end no chocolate he puts his filling in a regular prebaked pie shell baker february   my new pie country bakery has received a number of special requests for nesselrode pie so with a little research we have been making a delicious nesselrode pie for special orders not a fan of candied citron we use marons glacee chopped up along with just enough chestnut puree to give it good flavor without making it too heavy and we nestle it all in our classic butter crust top it with fresh whipped cream and lots of bittersweet chocolate shavings karl march   where are your locations baker march   we are based in the bronx though do not currently have a storefront we do wholesale baking and a small online retail for special local delivery jimboerger july   a couple ran the cafeteria where i worked years ago he was the manager and she was the cook and made the best pies ever one was the neselrode ihave made it many times and is much simpler than described here mine is ican evaporated milk one cup of milk  egg yolks i cup corn starch and  cup sugar beat thoroughly and cook over medium heat stiring constantly till mixture thickens remove from heat and stir i tbs butter and  tsp vanilla then stir in  cup chopped dates ans  cup candied cherrries quartered and  cup sliverered almons pour into a baked pie shell i either top it with merangue or shaved chocoolate either is to die for marleen november   i remember nesselrode pie very well and with affection gage and tollner in downtown brooklyn ny in the ’s and ’s served it it was certainly beautiful however it was a “heart attack” on a plate it probably was wipedout with the search for good for you foods a real loss ann january   i have a friend who makes nesselrode sauce for ice cream pound cake and whatever else she loves it do you have any history or information about a nesselrode sauce dougincal july   a cable station called me tv is running that girl marlo thomas’s sitcom from the ’s this week she played a waitress in a private club for gangsters and for their banquet’s dessert she served “the boys” individual nesselrode pies you could see whip cream and chocolate bits on their tops this was circa  kate july   it’s definitely a retro dessert maybe it will come back into fashion rita july   i remember nesselrode pie very well from the ’s and ’s we enjoyed it many times at ratner’s dairy restaurant on delancey street in the lower east side of manhattan delicious kate july   i love to hear stories like this if you try the recipe tell me how the taste compares inez edmundson september   i saw an episode of the andy griffith show and aunt bee made this pie noel october   found this pie in betty crocker’s cookbook no copyright still inside but i would guess mid ’s i am  and don’t remember my mom’s kitchen without it kate october   i’ll have to look through some of my vintage cookbooks sue december   my mom made nesselrode pie every year at christmas time she used the same candied fruit she used in her fruit cakes and made the crust of ground brazil nuts butter and sugar she said it became popular after the end of rationing after wwii because it perfectly expressed the decadent treats that had been denied during the war thanks for bringing it back bobbi september   i was actually looking for a nesslerode pie recipe when i found this one i made one once when i was a young married woman in the late ’s found my reicipe in a womans magazine at the time and can’t remember which one what i do remember is that the recipe was very labor intensive but turned out sooo delicious i remember shaving the chocolate curls for the top but not sure about the crust though pretty sure it was chocolate it was amazing but i never made it again just had a longing to find it and try it again and i appreciate all your researcheffort and enthusiasm it looks wonderful and i hope to make on these next holidays karen cushing april   i grew up with my mother making this nesselrode pie the story was that she and my dad were in nyc and had it at a resturant in the ’s or ’s she begged the waiter for the recipe and he gave it to her i have been making it only at christmas time for almost  years pastry shells…cooked separate  eggs combine the sligthly beaten egg yolks with   cups of whole milk  teaspoon salt and  cup of sugar in the top of a double boiler cook over simmering water until the mixture thickens and coats a spoon stir constantly soften one envelope of gelatin in  tablespoon of cool water and whisk into the hot mixtureuntil gelatin dissolves chill the mixture in refrigerator until mixture begins to thicken beat the  egg whites until stiff while gradually adding  sugar fold the egg whites into the thickening but not set egg mixture add  tablespoons of rum flavoring and  cup chopped marachino cherries mix gently divide and pour into the  cooked pie crusts sprinkle with  tablespoons shaved unsweetened chocolate refrigerate and serve after the filling is set corinne mahaffy november   thank you thank you kate for your wonderful site “the domestic front” trying to get to sleep last night i suddenly tasted nesselrode what a memory from the past my family love christmas pudding and at  i am tired of the same old same old i had turned the pudding bowls over to the kids but  years ago they were dumped back on me with a plea to make the puddings as they were too busy so much for retirement well i made the christmas pudding but after reading all about nesselrode on the internet today i have decided to make the nesselrode custard but put it in a pavlova meringue crust which i will make during christmas week and combine the two just before serving perhaps mounded with more whipping cream to heck with the fat and sugar — it is just one day wish me luck — and thanks again for renewing this memory kate tdf november   corinne thanks for the lovely note your pie sounds fabulous and i’m with you on an indulgent holiday we are also puddingeaters in our family – christmas dinner always features a steamed christmas pudding made with persimmons which i may one day share on the site happiest of holidays gerald robbins december   this brings back wonderful memories from my high school years in the early ’s my very first girl friend was my high school sweetheart in hollywood her dear mom who sadly passed away this year made this incredibly delicious nesselrode pie when i was invited as a dinner guest on a few occasions it was simply an unforgettable incredibly delicious taste experience no one in my dear friend’s family except her mom knew the origins of this pie recipe today i just was in touch with my old friend and she told me that she still has her mother’s recipe for nesselrode pie and promises to share it with me by sending it as she did so long ago when sadly i had lost it i read to her today the history of the pie and of the russian diplomat karl nesselrode a german jewish soldier who was working in the court of emperor alexander i in the early ’s nesselrode’s chief chef invented the pie in honor of nesselrode and his service to russia and named the pie after the diplomat i shared this information with my friend who found it extremely fascinating and she then surmised that perhaps her mother also knew the historic origin of nesselrode pie thank you for sharing this forgotten recipe tr january   this pie originally called for chestnut puree to be added to the cream filling american chestnut trees were totally killed out by a “blight” that went through this country many years ago most americans today have never heard of chestnuts or even seen them unless they have traveled to europe you could buy fresh hot roasted chestnuts from street vendors in very big cities back in the ’s in northeastern states anyway the death of the american chestnut caused the death of the true nesselrode pie kate tdf january   thanks for the note tr i know that chestnut trees are rare in america lulu september   love this recjpe these comments so funny how i found this lol as often happens on internet i started by looking up ansonia station in nyc

about june   posted by florian in baking recipes russian food tagged bavarian cream count karl nesselrode hortense spier nesselrode pie new york russia nesselrode part  the restaurateur the oldtimers and their pie you might remember the story of the nesselrode pudding or how paris’ best pastry chef created a dessert for the russian occupants while working for that turncoat talleyrand but perhaps your senile greatgrandparents have fondly reminisced about a popular dessert of their new york youth a symbol of a bygone era in a slightly different format the nesselrode pie i haven’t yet found any solid information on how the delicious chestnut pudding crossed the atlantic to eventually become a classic new york pie what i do know is that the pie as older locals used to know it was popularized by restaurateur hortense spier… according to the food maven hortense spier first started her business not as a pie bakery but as a brownstone restaurant on th st between columbus ave and central park west the restaurant closed before world war ii and mrs spier started baking her specialty pies for other restaurants besides the nesselrode there were lemon meringue banana cream and coconut custard pies by the mids these were the standard pies served in new york’s seafood restaurants and steakhouses when mrs spier died her daughter ruth and daughterinlaw mildred continued the business the pie was a popular dessert for the holiday season as you can see in this  article “nesselrode pie rings in new year” although already by that point the recipe didn’t necessarily include chestnuts in any form around the same time chocolate was added usually as shavings on top little by little industrialization of the american food supply resulted in the dessert’s drift into mediocrity could you imagine a pecan pie without pecans or a banana split without bananas well that’s what the nesselrode pie became one can still buy a product called “nesselro” which is or was made mostly of candied cauliflower — i still can’t decide if this is repulsive or intriguing mediocrity was followed by oblivion the new york times published a piece in  claiming that “you will find the name nesselrode on menus around the world” complete with recipes for both a pie and a charlotte the botched scan of the paper original makes these recipes very hard to read the one for pie is also partially available here yet in the very same new york times we learn in  that “nesselrode pie left our culinary consciousness about  years ago and has hardly been heard from since” great journalism guys fast forward  years and the new york times them again acknowledges in  that the dessert has gone the way of the dodo a long time ago and purports to have found what might be the very last nesselrode pie available at teena’s cake fair in canarsie brooklyn but alas teena’s closed a couple of years ago and so finally it seems that the only way to try nesselrode pie today is to make your own my recipe combines the old and the new the chestnuts prepared from scratch just like the candied fruits are the star of the show and their flavor should be prominent the addition of chocolate wasn’t a bad idea — the flavors pair well so i kept the chocolate but used it in two novel ways both in the crust and in a glaze the chocolate crust has a hint of bitterness that balances the sweetness of the filling it is important however that the chocolate glaze does not overpower the bavarian cream which is why i added cherry jelly to it another idea would be to add chestnut purée instead candied orange peel yields slightly over  oz  navel orange  oz water  oz sugar carefully peel and separate the orange into its natural segments reserve the segments for another usage cut the peel into ″ x ″ strips weigh  oz and discard the rest blanch the orange peel in boiling water for  minutes drain and repeat two more times in a small saucepan heat the water and sugar to  f stirring

restaurateur the oldtimers and their pie” inostrate october   at  funny and good writing of original recipes greetings from the netherlands david m rosenstein june   at  i remember fondly the nesselrode pie of the s and early s served at miller’s restaurant located in the woolworth building nyc the savor of chestnuts was a delight the candied fruits taste jewels and the pie was topped by a
