reportable aquatic diseases in canada    challenge intensive production  potential for rapid spread of disease lack of effective vaccines or treatments frequently poor management and biosecurity in developing regions delivery of potential preventatives or treatments opportunity improved management and biosecurity improved genetics including genome “editing” novel vaccines and therapeutics novel delivery systems  why aquaculture biotechnology • fish is a healthy food and an efficient source of high quality protein • many of world’s fisheries are maximally exploited • aquaculture must at least triple by  to hold per capita fish supply constant fao • genetics and husbandry practices generally primitive • biotechnology can improve efficiency and sustainability  the use of sirna technology may represent an opportunity for specific therapeutic solutions for many of the most damaging viral diseases of shrimp and fish  seafood is healthy nutritious and desirable fish are efficient converters of feed to human food capture fisheries have been at maximum production levels for twenty years aquaculture is an environmentally sustainable alternative production system current aquaculture management relies on biosecurity there are few approved drugs or biologicals many diseases of aquatic organisms are poorly understood outbreak of a disease like ems tsv wsd isav can destroy a

and ceo of aquabounty technologies statement by ronald l stotish phd president and ceo of aquabounty technologies jul    et from aquabounty technologies us senate letter to fda asking commissioner hamburg to halt approval process of aquadvantage salmon ignores  years of scientific study by the fda waltham mass july   prnewswireusnewswire  background on july   a letter to food and drug administration fda commissioner margaret hamburg signed by eight united states senators including senators mark begich dak and lisa murkowski rak asked the agency to cease the approval process for aquabounty technologies aquadvantage salmon the us fda has conducted a rigorous year review of thousands of pages of data and has concluded that these fish are exactly the same as any other atlantic salmon and therefore are safe for consumption in addition the fish will be sterile and required to be grown in selfcontained inland tanks posing no threat to the environment finally the united nations reports that the wild caught fisheries are severely stressed with major food species potentially extinct by  yet the demand for fish protein is exploding worldwide america currently imports more than  of the atlantic salmon consumed here while a handful of senators willfully ignore sciencebased research widely available to the public oddly several of the signers have previously criticized the agency for playing politics with science when the contraceptive plan b was under review statement we remain confident that the more deliberative body of the senate will refrain from interfering in the year scientific review by the us fda the facts about the safety and the environmental benefits of the fish have been made fully public by the fda it would be a dangerous precedent to react to a handful of legislators misinformed paranoia the real waste of taxpayer dollars would be to abandon the important american principle of sciencebased regulation responding instead to economic protectionist fears or subjective and emotional judgments this is an issue greater than our application an issue of american leadership in technology innovation and science based regulation source
