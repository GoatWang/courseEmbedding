jeffreybeingtherapycom facebook twitter facebook twitter select page  steps to a more confident you by jeffrey raich  apr  0  anxiety blog all depression mental healthwhat are your core values  this week as in every week i notice a theme something that all clients seem to speak about in my office i’m not sure if there’s a particular reason for this perhaps the winds of minnesota bring ideas and thoughts to all who come to my office more likely is that each week i hear something common among those whom i see whatever the reason i find it useful to think about these things and have decided to share some commonalities that all seem to experience  the reason for this is that often times we feel isolated in our own thoughts we assume that no one else feels this way in a recent study researchers looked at how comparing ourselves to others contributes to feels of depression specifically they looked at facebook but before we go further i’m not saying facebook causes depression only that it’s a place that can be studied as there are  billion users world wide what they found is because people post mostly positive statements and photos about their life others who view those posts often feel less than or down but why is this why should looking at other’s lives cause us to question our own life and then feel like we’re lacking it’s a complicated answer but one aspect of it is that we lack confidence and selfesteem at least in some parts of our life so let’s start at the beginning in order to feel confident you must have a solid core i like to compare this to weight lifting in order for us to lift weights or even get up and out of a chair we need a solid core we need to strengthen our mid section our stomachs sides and backs without this strength we will struggle to lift even the lightest of weights let alone our entire body once we have a solid core we can then move to bigger weights and more exercises and enjoy a full range of activities it’s the same in psychology without a solid core that is a knowledge of our values and also living them we will struggle with stress feeling lessthan always questioning ourselves our core vales are our driving force just like in the physical sense the core strength is what allows you to propel yourself forward and back the same is true for our psychological core strength it’s what allows us to make decisions and be confident in them  the question i get at this point often is just what are core values it’s a good question and one that most people probably haven’t thought about when was the last time you were asked that it certainly didn’t happen in school here’s a great definition from of all places the government “core values are not descriptions of the work we do or the strategies we employ to accomplish our mission the values underlie our work how interact with each other and which strategies we employ to fulfill our mission the core values are the basic elements of how we go about our work” i would add as this is specifically about work that we can substitute the words life or relationship or things for the word work  so now that we have a working definition of what core values are let’s look at some words that might fit into that here’s a list of words not in order of importance and certainly only a partial list that might be helpful in figuring out your specific core values accountability assertiveness balance boldness calmness community compassion control cooperation creativity curiosity decisiveness diligence dynamism economy effectiveness empathy exploration expressiveness fairness faith familyorientedness growth happiness honor humility intellectual status intuition joy love loyalty openness order originality professionalism prudence rigor sensitivity serenity service stability strategic temperance thankfulness truthseeking understanding this is a long list but not exhaustive by any means you are welcome to come up with your own words to be sure okay now we know both what core values are and have some examples of words that describe them the next step is pick yours try to pick  to  core values ones that really resonate with you try to be honest about what’s important rather than what you would like to have once you have your words they will become the foundation of your life  the last step is start living them let me explain by giving an example a core value for me might be connection if that’s the case than in order for me to live the most authentic life i can the decisions i make have to at least in some part stem from that word so if connection is a value and i choose to work in a field that is solitary i will most likely not feel fulfilled or joyful not to be confused with happy it will probably not give me much meaning or purpose however if i choose to follow a career that is about connection such as working as a therapist i will most likely find that meaning and authenticity  to sum up what has been said there are essentially four steps to finding and living an authentic life the first is to understand what a core value is the second is to list some words that represent core values the third is to choose the ones that are truly yours and lastly to make decisions and choices that follow from those values  i hope this helps to start to live the list you want top  foods for mental health by jeffrey raich  apr  0  blog all depression nutrition just what role does nutrition play in mental health why is it important and what can we do to feel better by eating let’s start by defining nutrition and diet nutrition is “the science that interprets the interaction of nutrients and other substances in food eg protein carbs fat etc in relation to maintenance growth reproduction health and disease of an organism” while diet is what we eat  with that said what we want is to change our diet to allow for more nutrition the reason this is so important is that nutrition is what helps us cope and deal with stress anxiety depression and all that life hurls at us what i mean by this is that if we eat a serving of meat for example chicken it is the nutrients that help us build serotonin immunity and the such that will combat colds flus and mental health issues  to that end here are the  best foods to help with mental health fish in study after study research has shown that those who consume omega fatty acids are less likely to experience depression and more likely to have heart health as well as cognitive and affect benefits one reason this is important is that our brains are made of mostly fat we need to nourish them with healthy positive sources and omegas are just such a source we can’t manufacture omegas so we need to get them from our foods omegas have also been shown to fight off depression in a study out of norway in the journal of affect disorders researchers showed that “those who regularly took cod liver oil which is rich in omega fatty acids were about 0 less likely to have symptoms of depression than those who did not the longer the participants took cod liver oil the less likely they were to have high levels of depression”  what can you do you can eat more fish but if your vegan or vegetarian you pick up some chia seeds or walnuts and throw them on your morning meal you can also find omega oil and capsules or ail available at most stores the goal is to get  to  grams a day vegetables we’ve all been told that we need to eat our veggies i’m sure it was the bane of most people’s existence as kids but research has shown that there are really good reasons why they help depression is often linked to inflammation no doubt you’ve heard how inflammation affects our bodies but did you know it affects our brains one way to deal with inflammation other than exercise is through foods such as dark leafy greens like spinach kale broccoli and collard greens the chart above is taken from dr weil and is his antiinflammatory food pyramid httpwwwdrweilcomdrwuart0drweilantiinflammatoryfoodpyramidhtml which suggests that the base of our diet should be mostly veggies with some fruit further in the journal nutrition journal where research about the use of diet vegetables to be specific to treat inflammation was published findings were shown that dietary treatment for inflammation in this case for ibd irritable bowl disease are effective as supplements to other treatments the link here is that diet alone won’t stop depression but combined with exercise sleep and therapy it can be a powerful aid  what can you do when it’s meal time throw some greens in your meal try to add a salad to lunch and dinner if you’re having pasta try to add some spinach to the sauce whatever you do and however much you add it’s better than none at all aim for a cup at each meal whole grains everywhere we look it seems some box or another is putting how many grams of whole grains are in their product while whole grains are great they are best found in their natural form brown rice oats whole wheat flour etc rather than in processed foods which generally have much added sugar  what’s great about whole grains of which all get turned to sugar in our body is that they’re packed with fiber which slows the absorption of that sugar into out blood stream that’s important so we don’t have a spike of energy followed by a crash of energy and mood it’s also important in fighting off diabetes as a sudden shock of sugar causes a sudden release of insulin over time our bodies become less able to handle these events which eventually may lead to type ii diabetes and inflammation  what can you do make sure most of your grains come from sources that aren’t prepared such as oats for oatmeal brown rice instead of uncle ben’s etc for the foods you do eat that are prepared such as bread and cereals try to find ones’ that have few ingredients sugar not listed as the first or second ingredient and have large amounts of fiber a  ratio of carbs to fiber lean meats is meat good is it bad and the controversy rages on wherever the final decision comes out one thing is true tryptophan is good and is needed lean meats such as turkey are a source of this protein most of us know this protein as what puts us to sleep on thanksgiving however that’s not entirely true most of what puts us to sleep is overeating but that’s for another post  what we’re concerned about here is what tryptophan does and specifically what it does is allow for the creation of serotonin the feel good chemical research has shown that those who suffer from depression have a lack of serotonin this is why ssri selectrive serotonin reuptake inhibitors drugs work they essentially reuse the serotonin that is spent but they don’t make it only tryptophan makes it  what you can do simply eat more lean meats a few times a week is all that’s needed don’t worry if you’re vegetarian there are options for you too sources such as seaweed spinach and mushrooms also have this chemical available  lowfat dairy again the argument rages about whether or not dairy should be part of one’s diet whether that gets decided or not what diary can provide is a source of vitamin d vitamin d amongst other things such as helping with building of bones is necessary to our lives and what researchers have shown is that those who suffer from major depression generally have a lower amount of this vitamin than those who don’t suffer from depression  according to research of the loyola school of nursing “effective detection and treatment of inadequate vitamin d levels in persons with depression and other mental disorders may be an easy and costeffective therapy which could improve patients’ longterm health outcomes as well as their quality of life” while sun is the major source of vitamin d there are others and lowfat dairy is one such source  what you can do get outside more of course in the winter here in minnesota that’s not going to happen so you can also find vitamin d in fish such as tuna and salmon some mushrooms as well as dietary supplements mental illness is a physical illness by jeffrey raich  mar  0  anxiety depression mental healththis week a german airline pilot andreas lubitz apparently intentionally crashed the jet he was flying killing himself and all  passengers on board the world wide response has been one of grief and sadness appropriately questions have been asked about how and why this happened and leaders from around the world have called this the saddest day they have also accused the pilot of being crazy but what’s the implication of that it seems that they are linking his depression with crazy and if this is the case that’s a problem for many reasons not the least of which is it perpetuates the stigma of depression what is depression perhaps it’s important to start with what depression is and isn’t before the term crazy gets bandied about depression is a disease the same as cancer or diabetes that affects the brain of a person which than causes issues with weight thinking sleep and and decision making ability according to the world health organization who more than  million people worldwide suffer from depression it is the leading cause of disability world wide and is a major contributor to the global burden of disease  but just what is depression depression according the the dsmv has the following symptoms to name a few depressed mood most of the day nearly every day diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities most of the day nearly every day insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning and diminished ability to think or concentrate or indecisiveness nearly every day is this starting to sound like a physical disease so why is there such stigma associated with depression why is it that those suffering from depression not to mention anxiety eating disorders and others feel they have to keep it such a secret why is it that we still say it’s different than all other physical diseases in an article in the british medical journal author lewis wolport writes about his own depression and the stigma of it he writes mental illnesses are perceived as different as they express themselves through those very characteristics that make us human – cognitive and affective and behavioural – and thus differ from physical illnesses mental illness is thus seen as embodying the core of the person and not just affecting some organ like the heart or lungs httpbmboxfordjournalsorgcontentfull his article is personal informative and well written there is one slight change that needs to be made however and it is this that it is different than psychical illnesses while it is true that’s the perception it is not true that’s what actually happens  to see this all one has to do is look at the brain scan of a person who suffers from depression as compared to one of a person who does not it is clear that there is a difference between the two while a brain scan cannot diagnosis depression or any other mental health issue it can start to show how and where in the brain a physical entity there is an effect  a look at how depression is a physical issue let’s say a person meets the clinical definition of depression to be separated from sadness grief etc how will this manifest itself physically first a person suffering from depression is more likely to lose interest in eating and thereby lose weight the converse is also true often people will gain weight as they eat more clearly this is a physical issue one that can have grave consequences not only does this potentially lead to further depression but too much weight gain leads to all sorts of issues including metabolic disease and too much weight lose leads to other issues such as too much stress on organs  there’s the lack of sleep that often comes while at the same time the person feels unmotivated to get out of bed again we all know what happens when we are sedentary we gain weight  than there’s the stress of being depressed when we’re depressed we feel alone isolated and scared all of which puts out bodies into a stress state and causes the release of cortisol this can be a problem that leads to other diseases such as cushing’s syndrome the symptoms of cushing’s are weight gain easy bruising edema hypertension diabetes and menstrual disturbances to name some  we could go on and talk about how depression affects every part of our body how it may ultimately leads to death and how it affects quality of life if there’re any questions about this andrew solomon wrote the noonday demon and most beautifully talks about his journey through depression but suffice it to say it there is clear evidence that depression is a physical illness perhaps what needs to be done instead of perpetuating the stigma is to accept that depression is experienced by many  million in america alone by some estimates and that the effects on quality of life affects many many others such as family and loved ones and coworkers  was mr lubitz depressed and did it affect his decision to crash the plane he was flying only time will tell what we need to remember however is that depression as separated from mr lubitz is a disease of the body and it’s organs it stems from the brain and affects every aspect of a person’s life physically emotionally and mentally as a result if we choose to perpetuate the stigma of it we will continue to have people who feel ostracized isolated and alone they will continue to not seek medical attention from those trained in depression and it’s treatment and they will continue to suffer needlessly   « older entries welcome to being and our new mental health blog follow us to get weekly posts about a subject that is directlyrelated to
