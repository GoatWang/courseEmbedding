generation services company dedicated to helping the largest consumerfacing brands identify engage and develop long term customer relationships   through a host of proprietary lead generation systems

capture targeted buyer data and use that data to generate revenues through both affiliate marketing and lead generation sales  nexus enterprise solutions inc is quickly expanding into a number of different verticals and currently serves as a lead generation engine for several of the nation’s largest companies in the insurance and financial service sectors   the company’s current business plans include expanding its lead generation services through online generation and offline generation     online generation includes the use of proprietary lead portals search engine optimization pay per click services email advertising online internet publishers website banner advertisements as well as the use of blogs social networking sites and affiliate networks and programs   offline generation includes the use of live phone leads whereby the company would use a predictive dialer call center and an overseas outsourced call center in order to generate potential leads for its customers     our revenue model is based on customer development we are a lead generating company that produces very high quality leads   a second source of the company’s revenue is derived by way of fees paid for our service option the cost of developing an automated system such as ours is prohibitive for a majority of companies we fulfill this need by allowing companies to use our technology forms landing pages etc for a fee we currently are back logged with the amount of companies looking to buy and sell leads to us our carriers and agencies  we are currently focusing our attention on the auto insurance market but expect to expand to other verticals in the very near future   nexus enterprise solutions inc nexus is redefining the current prospect and lead generation and acquisition industry by developing an information exchange marketplace which allows sellers and buyers of leads and other information assets to operate in an optimized transparent and efficient way to transact deals without the devaluation experienced in today’s markets and systems  this is accomplished primarily through systems and processes which enable disintermediation and enhanced business intelligence and management thereby empowering stakeholders on both sides of the transaction to make wellinformed and meaningful connections with each other   the administrative office of the company is located at  n federal highway suite  lighthouse point florida  and the company also rents offsite administrative and support services the company plans to use ii         these offices until it requires larger space

securities involves an exceptionally high degree of risk and is extremely speculative in nature you should carefully consider the risk factors listed below together with the information contained in this prospectus any reports we file with the sec and the documents referred to herein  following are what is believed are all of the material risks involved if one decides to purchase shares in this offering   risks associated with our company   we are an “emerging growth company” and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to “emerging growth companies” could make our common stock less attractive to investors   we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act for as long as we are an emerging growth company we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section b of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory “sayonpay” votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation we will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of i the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of  billion or more ii the last date of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock under this registration statement iii the date on which we have during the previous threeyear period issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt and iv the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the exchange act we will be deemed a large accelerated filer on the first day of the fiscal year after the market value of our common equity held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million measured on october    we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions available to emerging growth companies if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards an emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies   a company that elects to be treated as an emerging growth company shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of i the last day of the fiscal year during which it had total annual gross revenues of  as indexed for inflation ii the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock under this registration statement iii the date on which it has during the previous year period issued more than  in nonconvertible debt or iv the date on which is deemed to be a ‘large accelerated filer’ as defined by the sec which would generally occur upon it attaining a public float of at least  million   however we are choosing to “opt out” of such extended transition period and as a result we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for nonemerging growth companies section  of the jobs act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable   because the company auditors have issued a going concern opinion there is a substantial uncertainty that it will continue operations in which case one could lose one’s investment    the auditors have issued a going concern opinion because of the company’s recurring losses negative working capital stockholder’s deficit and the absence of revenuegenerating operations  this means that there is substantial doubt that it can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months the financial statements do not ii         include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about its ability to continue in business  as such it may have to cease operations and you could lose your entire investment   our officers and directors have limited public company experience  the company’s needs could exceed the amount of time or level of experience they may have  this could result in their inability to properly manage company affairs resulting in it remaining a startup company with no revenues or profits which could cause the loss of one’s entire investment    the company business plan does not provide for the hiring of any additional employees other than outlined in its plan of operations until sales will support the expense until that time the responsibility of developing the company’s business the offering and selling of the shares through this prospectus and fulfilling the reporting requirements of a public company all fall upon the three officers and two directors  while jason foster has experience serving a wide variety of organizations from small startups to fortune  companies none of our officers and directors have experience in a public company setting including serving as a principal accounting officer or principal financial officer  further they have no experience in complying with the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company and as a result they may not be able to operate successfully as a public company even if the company’s operations are successful  while each of the company’s officers and directors will use their best judgments to resolve all potential conflicts there is no formulated plan to resolve any possible conflict of interest with their other business activities and we cannot guarantee that any potential conflicts can be avoided  in the event they are unable to fulfill any aspect of their duties to the company it may experience a shortfall or complete lack of sales resulting in little or no profits and eventual closure of its business   since the company has shown a net loss since inception an investment in the shares offered herein is highly risky and could result in a complete loss of your investment if the company is unsuccessful in its business plans   based upon current plans the company expects to incur operating losses in future periods as it incurs significant expenses associated with the growth of its business  further there is no guarantee that it will be successful in realizing future revenues or in achieving or sustaining positive cash flow at any time in the future  any such failure could result in the possible closure of its business or force the company to seek additional capital through loans or additional sales of its equity securities to continue business operations which would dilute the value of any shares you purchase in this offering   the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to generate revenues which could result in a total loss of your investment if it is unsuccessful in its business plans   while the company has generated revenue which are reported in the financial statements included in this prospectus there can be no assurance that it will continue to generate revenues or that revenues will be sufficient to maintain its business  as a result one could lose all of one’s investment if the company is not successful in its proposed business plans   growth and development of operations will depend on the acceptance of the company’s proposed business  if the company’s services are not deemed desirable and suitable for purchase and it cannot establish a customer base it may not be able to generate future revenues which would result in a failure of the business and a loss of any investment one makes in the shares   the acceptance of the company’s lead generation services for its customers is critically important to its success the company cannot be certain that the services that it will be offering will be appealing and as a result there may not be any demand for these products and its sales could be limited and it may never realize any revenues in addition there are no assurances that if it alters or changes the products it offers in the future that the demand for these new products will develop and this could adversely affect our business and any possible revenues   if demand for the services the company plans to offer slows then its business would be materially affected which could result in the loss of your entire investment   ii         demand for the services which it intends to sell depends on many factors including             •   the number of clients the company is able to attract and retain over time           •   the economy and in periods of rapidly declining economic conditions customers may defer services such as ours in order to pay secured debts or debts that must be made in order to remain solvent           •   the competitive environment in the lead generation market that may force it to reduce prices below its desired pricing level or increase promotional spending           •   the ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers’ needs for lead generation services in a timely cost effective manner   for the long term demand for the products it plans to offer may be affected by             •   the ability to establish maintain and eventually grow market share in a competitive environment           •   delivery of its information globally geopolitical changes changes in trading regulations currency fluctuations natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items it purchases create communication issues or render product delivery difficult which could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profitability   all of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for the services it plans to offer which could adversely affect its sales cash flows and overall financial condition  an investor could lose his or her entire investment as a result      the loss of the services of the current officers and directors could severely impact the company business operations and future development which could result in a loss of revenues and one’s ability to ever sell any shares one purchases in this offering   the performance is substantially dependent upon the professional expertise of the current officers and board of directors  each has extensive expertise in the lead generation and services industry and the company is dependent on their abilities to develop its business if they are unable to perform their duties this could have an adverse effect on company business operations financial condition and operating results if it is unable to replace them with other individuals qualified to develop and market its business the loss of their services could result in a loss of revenues which could result in a reduction of the value of any shares you purchase in this offering as well as the complete loss of your investment   the company may not be able to successfully implement its business strategy which could adversely affect its business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  if the company cannot successfully implement its business strategy it could result in the loss of your investment     successful implementation of its business strategy depends on factors specific to stock trading platforms and the state of the financial industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond its control  adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on its business its financial condition and results of operations and cash flow   · the competitive environment in the lead generation industry that may force us to reduce prices below the optimal pricing level or increase promotional spending · its ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers’ needs for trading products in a timely cost effective manner and · its ability to establish maintain and eventually grow market share in a competitive environment   ii         there are no substantial barriers to entry into the industry and because the company does not currently have any copyright protection for the services it intends to sell there is no guarantee someone else will not duplicate its ideas and bring them to market before it does which could severely limit the company proposed sales and revenues  if the company cannot generate sales and revenues it could result in the loss of your investment   since it has no intellectual property protection unauthorized persons may attempt to copy aspects of its business including its services or marketing materials any encroachment upon the company corporate information including the unauthorized use of its brand name the use of a similar name by a competing company or a lawsuit initiated against it for infringement upon another companys proprietary information or improper use of their copyright may affect its ability to create brand name recognition cause customer confusion andor have a detrimental effect on its business  litigation or proceedings before the us or international patent and trademark offices may be necessary in the future to enforce the company intellectual property rights to protect its trade secrets and domain name andor to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  any such infringement litigation or adverse proceeding could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm its business operations andor results of operations  as a result an investor could lose his or her entire investment as the company intends to be conducting international business transactions it will be exposed to local business risks in different countries which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations which could result in the loss of your investment  the company intends to promote and sell some of its services internationally by way of using overseas outsourced call centers for its offline lead generation services and we expect to have customers or call centers located in several countries the company international operations will be subject to risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including but not necessarily limited to • new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions • potentially adverse tax consequences including imposition or increase of taxes on transactions or withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries • risk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments • legal restrictions on doing business in or with certain nations certain parties andor certain products and • local economic political and social conditions including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability   it may not be successful in developing and implementing policies and strategies to address the foregoing factors in a timely and effective manner in the locations where it will do business consequently the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on its base operations and upon its financial condition and results of operations since its services will be available over the internet in foreign countries and the company will have customers residing in foreign countries foreign jurisdictions may require it to qualify to do business in their country it will be required to comply with certain laws and regulations of each country in which it conducts business including laws and regulations currently in place or which may be enacted related to internet services available to the residents of each country from online sites located elsewhere the company operations in developing markets could expose it to political economic and regulatory risks that are greater than those it may face in established markets further its international operations may require it to comply with additional united states and international regulations  if the company fails to comply with the required domestic and international regulations or violates any such regulations it may not be able to generate sales and revenue necessary to continue its business plans which could result in the loss of your investment   for example it may be required to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which prohibits companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official or agent thereof for ii         the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business direct business to any person or corporate entity or obtain any unfair advantage the company may operate in some nations that have experienced significant levels of governmental corruption its employees agents and contractors including companies to which it outsources business operations may take actions in violation of its policies and legal requirements such violations even if prohibited by its policies and procedures could have an adverse effect on its business and reputation any failure by the company to ensure that its employees and agents comply with the fcpa and applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial civil and criminal penalties or restrictions on its ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions and its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected finally any additional regulatory requirements put in place by the united states or any foreign country in which the company operates may expose the company to additional liability and require the company to comply with complex and time consuming regulations in addition the company ability to attract and retain customers may be adversely affected if the reputations of the financial app industry online brokers as a whole or if particular service providers knowingly relay faulty data the perception of untrustworthiness within the stock trading industry or of financial apps could materially adversely affect its ability to attract and retain customers failure of thirdparty service providers upon which we rely could adversely affect our business and result in the loss of your investment  the company may rely on certain thirdparty service providers including data centers call centers direct posts aggregators publishers insurance carriers insurance agencies backoffice systems internet and wireless service providers and communications facilities any interruption in these thirdparty services or deterioration in their  performance or quality could adversely affect our business if its arrangement with any third party is terminated it may not be able to find alternative systems or service providers on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms this could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition results of operations and cash flows risks associated with this offering   the offering price of the company shares is arbitrary so there is no guarantee that the price at which you have purchased your shares will remain the same  a significant decrease in the price of our shares could result in the loss of your investment    the offering price of the company shares has been determined arbitrarily by the company and bears no relationship to the companys assets book value potential earnings or any other recognized criteria of value   the trading in the company shares will be regulated by securities and exchange commission rule g which established the definition of a “penny stock”   the effective result is that fewer purchasers are qualified by their brokers to purchase its shares and therefore a less liquid market for the investors to sell their shares  therefore you may have a difficult time selling your shares or you may not be able to sell your shares at all which could result in the loss of your investment   the shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the securities and exchange act of  and rules of the commission  the exchange act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are generally institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding  or  jointly with spouse or in transactions not recommended by the brokerdealer  for transactions covered by the penny stock rules a brokerdealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement prior to the sale  in addition the brokerdealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and ii         certain associated persons and deliver certain disclosures required by the commission  consequently the penny stock rules may make it difficult or impossible for you to resell any shares you may purchase   due to the lack of a trading market for our securities you may have difficulty selling any shares you purchase in this offering which could result in the loss of your investment   there is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus  we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the effectiveness of this registration statement to file an application to have our shares quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board otcbb however there is no guarantee that a trading market will ever develop  the otcbb is a regulated quotation service that displays realtime quotes last sale prices and volume information in overthecounter otc securities  the otcbb is not an issuer listing service market or exchange although the otcbb does not have any listing requirements per se to be eligible for quotation on the otcbb issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec or applicable regulatory authority market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement securities already quoted on the otcbb that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a  or  day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time the company cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved or that its stock will be quoted for sale  as of the date of this filing there have been no discussions or understandings between nexus enterprise solutions inc or anyone acting on its behalf with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for its securities  if no market is ever developed for our common stock it will be difficult or impossible for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering  in such case you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay if at all  in addition if the company fails to have its common stock quoted on a public trading market your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult if not impossible to ever resell your shares resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment   you will incur immediate and substantial dilution of the price you pay for your shares which could affect the overall monetary value of your shares  if the value of your shares significantly decreases you could lose your investment   the company’s existing stockholders acquired their shares at an average cost of  per share a cost per share substantially less than that which you will pay for the shares you purchase in this offering the price paid for the currently issued and outstanding common stock held by the selling shareholders was valued at an average of  per share the price paid for the currently issued and outstanding common stock held by company directors was valued at an average of  per share  accordingly any investment you make in these shares will result in the immediate and substantial dilution of the net tangible book value of those shares from the  you pay for them  upon completion of the offering the net tangible book value of your shares will be  per share  less than what you paid for them   the company officers and directors will continue to exercise significant control over our operations which means as a minority stockholder you would have no control over certain matters requiring stockholder approval that could affect your ability to ever resell any of your shares  if you are not able to resell any shares it may result in the loss of your investment   our executive officers and directors will continue to have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions including the election of directors approval of significant corporate transactions changes in control of the company or other matters that could affect your ability to ever resell your shares their interests may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and thus result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other stockholders   we may never pay dividends to shareholders which could reduce the monetary gain you may realize on your investment    ii         we have not declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock  we currently intend to retain our future earnings if any to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future   the declaration payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon among other things the results of our operations cash flows and financial condition operating and capital requirements and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant  there is no assurance that future dividends will be paid and if dividends are paid there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend  if the company does not pay dividends the company’s common stock may be less valuable because a return on an investor’s investment will only occur if the company’s stock price appreciates

companies that have securities registered under the exchange act from soliciting proxies or consents from shareholders without furnishing to shareholders and filing with the sec a proxy statement and form of proxy complying with the proxy rules  in addition so long as our common stock is not registered under the exchange act our directors and executive officers and beneficial holders of  or more

sponsored links or sponsored ads  and appear adjacent to or above organic results on search engine results pages or anywhere a web developer chooses on a content site   cost per click cpc varies

certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system   a purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to sell the stock the shares offered by this prospectus constitute penny stock under the securities and exchange act  the shares will remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future  the classification of penny stock makes it more difficult for a brokerdealer to sell the stock into a secondary market which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate hisher investment  any brokerdealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares in us will be subject to rules g through g of the securities and exchange act  rather than creating a need to comply with those rules some brokerdealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny stock   the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document which a contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stock in both public offerings and secondary trading b contains a description of the brokers or dealers duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the securities act of  as amended c contains a brief clear narrative description of a dealer market including bid and ask  price for the

the purchaser and receive the purchasers written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks and a signed and dated copy of

pay a percentage of the fees we earn for directing internet traffic to the insurance companies to those who direct the internet traffic to our ii         website as more customers access our website directly we will pay a smaller percentage of revenues to other websites even though the total cost of sales is expected to increase  in our initial stages of operations we incurred considerable costs

growth and development of the company business strategy depends on the basic principles of supply demand and correlated values are completely askew in the current lead and information asset marketplace – especially in the insurance and financial services verticals  some of the devaluation of these products can be ii         attributed to commoditization in a matured market however most of the forces causing this downward spiral of value can be directly attributed to the following factors   ·         extensive and growing intermediation between buyers and sellers   ·         selling legs to carriers agencies and aggregators   ·         forging partnerships to increase our lead traffic   ·         information quality issues driven in part from overall lower pricing to the seller   ·         cost prohibition and lack of technology expertise for many smaller medium and some large players provides a substantial barrier that forces many sellers to leverage long established aggregation partners   ·         market manipulation by larger players through exclusivity and preferred partner arrangements   ·         matured internet marketing techniques such as search engine optimization seo search engine marketing sem online advertising etc have driven marketing costs up to the point many good marketing companies have had to shift to other channels reducing available high quality sourced leads   a significant opportunity exists for the creation of an open market exchange that provides transparency visibility quality control and disintermediation to all participants  the initial verticals of insurance and other financial services leads are candidates to start but there are multiple other verticals and applications of the core technologies and systems which comprise the nexus exchange platform  the continuing plan of the company’s operations will be to expand our lead generation services which the company believes will also expand its customer base
