tommy corcoran spartacus educational tommy corcoran thomas corcoran the son of a lawyer was born in rhode island on th december  he was educated at brown university and harvard law school corcorans most important influence at university was professor felix frankfurter he wrote that corcoran was struggling very hard with the burden of inferiority imposed on him because of his irish catholicism frankfurter was impressed with corcorans progress and introduced him to his close friend supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes after graduating in  he was invited by holmes to become his legal clerk in  corcoran joined the law firm established by william mcadoo at the time it was run by george franklin and joseph cotton in  eugene meyer chairman of the federal reserve board was looking for a general counsel for the newly established reconstruction finance corporation after talks with franklin he appointed corcoran to this post meyer resigned in  and was replaced by jesse h jones after franklin d roosevelt defeated herbert hoover he asked felix frankfurter to assemble a legal team to review the nations securities laws frankfurter selected corcoran benjamin cohen and james landis for the task corcoran a member of the democratic party readily accepted the post together they drafted the legislation that created the securities and exchange commission william e leuchtenburg the author of franklin d roosevelt and the new deal  has pointed out corcoran was a new political type the expert who not only drafted legislation but maneuvered it through the treacherous corridors of capitol hill ray s cline added corcoran says that his greatest contribution to government in his long career was helping infiltrate smart young harvard law school products into every agency of government he felt the united states needed to develop a highly educated highly motivated public service corps that had not existed before roosevelts time the following year corcoran was involved in drafting the public utilities holding company act on st july  owen brewster claimed that corcoran threatened to stop construction on the passamaquoddy dam in his district unless he supported the holding company bill congress immediately ordered the rules committee to investigate the matter the senate investigation headed by hugo black eventually cleared corcoran of any wrongdoing corcoran wrote to a friend storms make a sailor  if he survives them thomas howard and david corcoran roosevelts personal secretary louis m howe died of pneumonia on th june  according to corcorans biographer david mckean peddling influence corcoran now replaced howe as roosevelts most trusted adviser and personal companion some of roosevelts ministers complained about corcorans growing influence henry morgenthau the secretary of the treasury claimed that corcoran was a crook as well as drafting new deal legislation roosevelt used corcoran as his special emissary to capitol hill elliott roosevelt wrote that apart from my father tom corcoran was the single most influential individual in the country in  corcoran used this influence to make sure sam rayburn of texas became speaker of the house this was a difficult task as james farley was advocating that john oconnor got the job corcorans increasing power was indicated by the fact that franklin d roosevelt brought an end to farleys campaign this was the beginning of a very close relationship that corcoran enjoyed with rayburn and the texas oil industry franklin d roosevelt began to have considerable problems with the supreme court the chief justice charles hughes had been the republican party presidential candidate in  hughes appointed by herbert hoover in  led the courts opposition to some of the proposed new deal legislation this included the ruling against the national recovery administration nra the agricultural adjustment act aaa and ten other new deal laws on nd february  franklin d roosevelt made a speech attacking the supreme court for its actions over new deal legislation he pointed out that seven of the nine judges charles hughes willis van devanter george sutherland harlan stone owen roberts benjamin cardozo and pierce butler had been appointed by republican presidents roosevelt had just won reelection by  votes and resented the fact that the justices could veto legislation that clearly had the support of the vast majority of the public roosevelt suggested that the age was a major problem as six of the judges were over  charles hughes willis van devanter james mcreynolds louis brandeis george sutherland and pierce butler roosevelt announced that he was going to ask congress to pass a bill enabling the president to expand the supreme court by adding one new judge up to a maximum off six for every current judge over the age of  hughes realized that roosevelts court reorganization bill would result in the court coming under the control of the democratic party behind the scenes hughes was busy doing deals to make sure that roosevelts bill would be defeated in congress tommy corcoran was giving the task by roosevelt to persuade congress to pass this proposed legislation this included working closely with i f stone of the new york post stone a strong opponent of the conservative supreme court agreed to write speeches for corcoran on this issue these speeches were then passed on to roosevelt supporters in congress in the past corcoran had relied heavily on the influence of his close friend burton wheeler chairman of the judiciary committee however wheeler had now turned against roosevelt wheeler even argued that franklin d roosevelt had been behind the assassination of huey long corcoran continued to campaign for the judicial court reorganization bill but he failed to persuade enough to get it passed even the most leftwing of all the justices louis brandeis opposed roosevelts attempt to pack the supreme court brandeis was also beginning to oppose some aspects of the new deal that he believed favored big business however members of the supreme court accepted they had to fall in line with public opinion on th march owen roberts announced that he had changed his mind about voting against minimum wage legislation hughes also reversed his opinion on the social security act and the national labour relations act nlra and by a  vote they were now declared to be constitutional then willis van devanter probably the most conservative of the justices announced his intention to resign he was replaced by hugo black a member of the democratic party and a strong supporter of the new deal in july  congress defeated the court reorganization bill by  however roosevelt had the satisfaction of knowing he had a supreme court that was now less likely to block his legislation corcoran later took credit for getting hugo black  felix frankfurter  william o douglas  and frank murphy  appointed to supreme court he also played an important role in defending black when it was discovered that he was a former member of the ku klux klan corcoran later claimed he wrote blacks statement asking for forgiveness time magazine september  corcoran also became involved in advising franklin d roosevelt over foreign policy although he had liberal views on domestic issues corcoran was passionately anticommunist this was partly because of his roman catholicism roosevelt initially favoured giving help to the republican government in spain however corcoran was a supporter of the fascist movement led by general francisco franco as drew pearson and jack anderson pointed out in their book the case against congress a compelling indictment of corruption on capitol hill “long before pope john and pope paul made it clear they were not in sympathy with the catholic hierarchy of spain the reactionary wing of the catholic church in the united states had been conducting one of the most efficient lobbies ever to operate on capital hill it was able to reverse completely american policy on spain during the spanish civil war thomas g corcoran a member of the roosevelt brain trust worked effectively at the white house to keep an embargo on all us arms to both sides” corcoran knew that adolf hitler and benito mussolini would continue to provide both men and arms to francisco franco roosevelts decision enabled fascism to win in spain and become entrenched in europe roosevelt later told his cabinet that he had made a grave mistake with respect to neutrality in the spanish civil war roosevelt was angry with tommy corcoran over his advice on spain he also began to see that corcoran was becoming a problem for the administration he had upset a lot of powerful figures in congress with his arm twisting tactics corcoran had also tried to unseat those who attempted to resist franklin d roosevelt for example walter george of georgia claimed that corcoran had the power of saying who shall be a senator and who shall not be a senator in june  an article appeared in the saturday evening post accused james roosevelt of being a war profiteer it was also claimed that the presidents son helped joseph kennedy to obtain the ambassador to great britain corcoran who was very close to james roosevelt got dragged into this scandal it was not the first time that corcoran had been accused of corrupt behaviour norman m littell a highranking justice department official told anna roosevelt that corcoran had become a liability to her father no quality is so essential in government as simple integrity and forthrightness ability and brilliance of mind are not enough corcorans fascist sympathies resulted in him becoming a firm advocate of isolationism he told friends that irish americans liked him remembered their parents repression at the hands of the british on one occasion harry hopkins told corcoran tom youre too catholic to trust the russians and too irish to trust the english tommy corcoran now found himself outside the inner circle in  he began telling friends that he was considering leaving government he told samuel irving rosenman i want to make a million dollars in one year thats all then im coming back to the government for the rest of my life corcorans plan was to become a political lobbyist on behalf of companies seeking to obtain government contracts a large number of government officials had their jobs because of corcoran it was payback time one day in early october  franklin d roosevelt told corcoran that he wanted him to resign from the administration he wanted him to carry out a covert mission and it was too politically dangerous to do this while serving in his government roosevelt believed that the best way of stopping japanese imperialism in asia was to arm the chinese government of chiang kaishek however congress was opposed to this idea as it was feared that this help might trigger a war with japan therefore roosevelts plan was for corcoran to establish a private corporation to provide assistance to the nationalist government in china roosevelt even supplied the name of the proposed company china defense supplies he also suggested that his uncle frederick delano should be cochairman of the company chiang nominated his former finance minister tseven soong as the other cochairman for reasons of secrecy corcoran took no title other than outside counsel for china defense supplies william s youngman was his frontman in china corcorans friend whitey willauer was moved to the foreign economic administration where he supervised the sending of supplies to china in this way corcoran was able to create an asian lendlease program corcoran also worked closely with claire lee chennault who had been working as a military adviser to chiang kaishek since  chennault told corcoran that if he was given the resources he could maintain an air force within china that could carry out raids against the japanese corcoran returned to the united states and managed to persuade franklin d roosevelt to approve the creation of the american volunteer group one hundred p fighters built by the curtisswright corporation intended for britain were redirected to chennault in china william pawley was curtisswrights representative in asia and he arranged for the p to be assembled in rangoon it was tommy corcorans son david who suggested that the american volunteer group should be called the flying tigers chennault liked the idea and asked his friend walt disney to design a tiger emblem for the planes on th april  roosevelt signed a secret executive order authorizing the american volunteer group to recruit reserve officers from the army navy and marines pawley suggested that the men should be recruited as flying instructors in july  ten pilots and  mechanics were supplied with fake passports and sailed from san francisco for rangoon when they arrived they were told that they were really involved in a secret war against japan to compensate for the risks involved the pilots were to be paid  a month  for a patrol leader in addition they were to receive  for every enemy plane they shot down the flying tigers were extremely effective in their raids on japanese positions and helped to slow down attempts to close the burma road a key supply route to china in seven months of fighting the flying tigers destroyed  planes at a loss of  men  while flying and  on the ground tommy corcoran had originally been an isolationist however he now knew that he could make a fortune out of the arms trade his first major client was henry j kaiser a successful businessman from california corcoran had helped kaiser obtain lucrative government contracts while working for the reconstruction finance corporation kaiser paid corcoran a retainer of  a year corcoran then introduced kaiser to william s knudsen head of the office of production management over the next few years kaiser obtained  million in building contracts at his ten shipyards kaisers two main business partners were stephen d bechtel and john a mccone kaiser had worked with bechtel in the s to build many of the major roads throughout california in  mccone became president of bechtelmccone on the outbreak of the second world war mccone joined forces with kaiser and bechtel to establish the california shipbuilding company with the help of corcoran the company obtained large government contracts to build ships in  it was reported that the company had made  million in wartime profits corcoran was also informed that a great deal of magnesium would be needed for building aircraft with the help of jesse h jones the boss of the reconstruction finance corporation kaiser was granted a loan to build a magnesium production plant in san jose california after the rfc loan was secured corcoran sent kaiser a bill requesting  in cash and a  stake in the magnesium production business another important client was the houston contracting firm of brown  root owned by george r brown and herman brown these brothers had been the major financiers of the political campaigns of lyndon b johnson corcoran arranged for the two men to meet william s knudsen records show that corcoran was paid  for advice conferences and negotiations related to shipbuilding contracts in  the brown brothers established the brown shipbuilding company on the houston ship channel over the next three years the company built  ships and employed  people this brought in revenue of  the government shipbuilding contract was eventually worth  yet until they got the contract brown  root had never built a single ship of any type corcorans work with china defense supplies caused some disquiet in roosevelts administration henry morgenthau was a prominent critic he argued that in effect corcoran was running an offthebooks operation in which a private company was diverting some of the war material destined for china to a private army the american volunteer group resistance also came from general george marshall and general joseph stilwell the american commander in asia marshall and stilwell both believed that chiang kaishek was completely corrupt and needed to be forced into introducing reforms stilwell complained about corcorans ability to present chiang in the best possible light with roosevelt stilwell wrote to marshall that the continued publication of chungking propaganda in the united states is an increasing handicap to my work he added we can pull them out of this cesspool but continued concessions have made the generalissimo believe he has only to insist and we will yield corcoran was also coming under pressure from the work he was doing for sterling pharmaceutical his brother david worked for the company and was responsible for getting corcoran the contract however it was revealed in  that sterling pharmaceutical had strong links with i g farben the fbi discovered that sterling had conspired with farben to control the sale of aspirin in other words had formed an aspirin cartel according to one fbi report sterling were employing nazi sympathizers in its offices in latin america rumours began to circulate that burton wheeler would announce that he was appointing a subcommittee to investigate the relations between american and german firms assistant attorney general thurman arnold announced he was ready to prosecute any american company aiding and abetting a german company in any part of the world on th april  the department of justice issued subpoenas to sterling pharmaceutical soon afterwards newspapers began to run negative stories about the company one claimed that sterling was helping the nazi propagandist joseph goebbels fulfill his pledge that americans would help hitler win the americas on nd june  roosevelt appointed francis b biddle as his new attorney general biddle was a close friend of corcorans the day after his appointment biddle accepted a settlement offer from sterling in which the company would pay a fine of five thousand dollars later it was agreed that sterling would abrogate all contracts with i g farben in congress there was speeches made calling for an investigation into the role played by corcoran in protecting the interests of sterling pharmaceutical senator lawrence smith argued it is common gossip in government circles that the long arm of tommy corcoran reaches into many agencies that he has placed many men in important positions and they in turn are amenable to his influences corcoran had also developed a close relationship with lyndon b johnson on th april  texas senator morris sheppard died corcoran agreed to help johnson in his campaign to replace sheppard this included helping johnson obtain approval of a rural electrification project from the rural electrification administration corcoran also arranged to franklin d roosevelt to make a speech on the eve of the polls criticizing johnsons opponent wilbert lee odaniel despite the efforts of corcoran odaniel defeated johnson by  votes on the suggestion of alvin j wirtz johnson decided to acquire ktbc a radio station in austin e g kingsberry and wesley west agreed to sell ktbc to johnson officially it was purchased by his wife lady bird johnson however it needed the approval of the federal communications commission fcr johnson asked corcoran for help with this matter this was not very difficult as the chairman of the fcr james fly was appointed by frank murphy as a favour for corcoran the fcc eventually approved the deal and johnson was able to use ktbc to amass a fortune of more than  million rumours continued to circulate about corcorans illegal activities harry s truman accused todd shipyards of hiring corcoran to help win government contracts in september  the new york times reported that corcoran was responsible for obtaining favourable treatment in the settlement of the justice department case brought against sterling pharmaceutical another newspaper reported that vice president henry wallace disapproves of the way mr corcoran has capitalized on the government associations to promote his lucrative law practice on th december  corcoran appeared before the senate defense investigation committee he admitted that business had been exceedingly good since he left roosevelts administration some members of the committee were convinced that corcorans activities revealed a need for more stringent lobbying restrictions senator carl hatch from new mexico introduced a bill that would prohibit former government employees from working with government departments or agencies for two years after leaving government service as david mckean points out in peddling influence the bill never made it out of the judiciary committee presumably because washington lobbyists persuaded their friends on the panel to kill it after the united states entered the war against japan germany and italy president franklin d roosevelt established the office of strategic services oss roosevelt selected colonel william donovan as the first director of the organization who had spent some time studying the special operations executive soe an organization set up by the british government in july  the oss had responsibility for collecting and analyzing information about countries at war with the united states the oss gradually took over the activities that corcoran had helped set up in china in  oss agents based in china included paul helliwell e howard hunt mitch werbell lucien conein john singlaub and ray cline according to an article in the wall street journal some oss members in china were paid for their work with fivepound sacks of opium in a letter to the senate defense investigation committee in november  norman m littell assistant attorney general for the lands division reported conversations between tommy corcoran and francis biddle that suggested that the two men had a corrupt relationship littell claimed that biddle seemed to be following instructions from corcoran in the letter littell asked the committee what has tommy corcoran got on biddle littell argued that during the investigation of the sterling pharmaceutical case biddle was completely dominated by tommy corcoran he added that this company was acting as an agent of nazi germany and that biddles decision to settle this case was the lowest point in the history of the department of justice since the harding administration this story was picked up by the national press and demands were made that the relationship between biddle and corcoran should be investigated sam rayburn made sure that no committee held a hearing on this issue charles van devander reported in the washington post that strong influence is being brought to bear to block an investigation by congress into the affairs of the department of justice including attorney general biddles allegedly close relationship with lawyer lobbyist tommy corcoran one moth after the dropping the atom bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki tommy corcoran joined with david corcoran and william s youngman to create a panamanian company rio carthy for the purpose of pursuing business ventures in asia and south america soon afterwards claire lee chennault and whiting willauer approached corcoran with the idea of creating a commercial airline in china to compete with cnac and catc corcoran agreed to use rio cathy as the legal vehicle for investing in the airline venture chiang kaishek agreed that his government would invest in the airline corcoran anticipated he would own  of the equity in the airline but chennault and willauer gave a greater percentage to the chinese government and corcorans share dropped to  civil air transport cat was officially launched on th january  corcoran approached his old friend fiorella laguardia the director general of the united nations relief and rehabilitation administration unrra he agreed to award a  million contract to deliver relief to china this contract kept them going for the first year but as the civil war intensified cat had difficulty maintaining its routes the oss had been disbanded in october  and was replaced by the war departments strategic service unit ssu paul helliwell became chief of the far east division of the ssu in  the ssu was replaced by the central intelligence agency cat needed another major customer and on th july  corcoran and claire lee chennault had a meeting with roscoe h hillenkoetter the new director of the cia hillenkoetter arranged for corcoran to meet frank wisner the director of the office of policy coordination wisner was in charge of the cias covert operations on st november  corcoran signed a formal agreement with the cia the agreement committed the agency to provide up to  to finance an cat airbase and  to fly agency personnel and equipment in and out of the mainland and to underwrite any shortfall that might result from any hazardous mission over the next few months cat airlifted personnel and equipment from chungking kweilin luchnow nanking and amoy in  lyndon b johnson decided to make a second run for the us senate his main opponent in the democratic primary texas was virtually a one party state and the most important elections were those that decided who would be the democratic party candidate was coke stevenson johnson was criticized by stevenson for supporting the tafthartley act the american federation of labor was also angry with johnson for supporting this legislation and at its june convention the afl broke a  year tradition of neutrality and endorsed stevenson johnson asked tommy corcoran to work behind the scenes at convincing union leaders that he was more prolabor than stevenson this he did and on th august  corcoran told harold ickes that he had a terrible time straightening out labor in the johnson campaign but he believed he had sorted the problem out on nd september unofficial results had stevenson winning by  votes however by the time the results became official johnson was declared the winner by  votes stevenson immediately claimed that he was a victim of election fraud on th september judge t whitfield davidson invalidated the results of the election and set a trial date johnson once again approached corcoran to solve the problem a meeting was held that was attended by corcoran francis biddle abe fortas joe rauh jim rowe and ben cohen it was decided to take the case directly to the supreme court a motion was drafted and sent to justice hugo black on th september justice black issued an order that put johnsons name back on the ballot later it was claimed by rauh that black made the decision following a meeting with corcoran on nd november  johnson easily defeated jack porter his republican party candidate coke stevenson now appealed to the subcommittee on elections and privileges of the senate rules and administration committee corcoran enjoyed a good relationship with senator styles bridges of new hampshire he was able to work behind the scenes to make sure that the ruling did not go against johnson corcoran later told johnson that he would have to repay bridges for what he had done for him regarding the election the johnsonstevenson case was also investigated by j edgar hoover and the fbi johnson was eventually cleared by hoover of corruption and was allowed to take his seat in the senate in  sam zemurray asked corcoran to join the united fruit company as a lobbyist and special counsel zemurray had problems with his business in guatemala in the s zemurray aligned united fruit closely with the government of president jorge ubico the company received import duty and real estate tax exemptions from ubico he also gave them hundreds of square miles of land united fruit controlled more land than any other individual or group it also owned the railway the electric utilities telegraph and the countrys only port at puerto barrios on the atlantic coast ubico was overthrown in  and following democratic elections juan jose arevalo became the new president arevalo a university professor who had been living in exile described himself as a spiritual socialist he implemented sweeping reforms by passing new laws that gave workers the right to form unions this included the  guatemalans who worked for united fruit zemurray feared that arevalo would also nationalize the land owned by united fruit in guatemala he asked corcoran to express his fears to senior political figures in washington corcoran began talks with key people in the government agencies and departments that shaped us policy in central america he argued that the us should use united fruit as an american beachhead against communism in the region in january  civil air transport cat relocated its base of operations to the island of formosa where chiang kaishek had established his new government the following month the soviet union and china signed a mutual defense pact two weeks later president harry s truman signed national security directive  which stated that “it is important to united states security interests that all practical measures be taken to prevent further communist expansion in southeast asia” the support of the government in formosa was to become a key aspect of this policy in february  frank wisner began negotiating with corcoran for the purchase of cat “in march using a ‘cutout’ banker or middleman the cia paid cat  to clear up arrearages  for future operations and a  million option on the business the money was then divided among the airline’s owners with corcoran and youngman receiving more than  for six years of legal fees and corcoran youngman and david corcoran dividing approximately  from the sale of the airline” paul helliwell was put in charge of this operation his deputy was desmond fitzgerald helliwells main job was to help chiang kaishek to prepare for a future invasion of communist china the cia created a pair of front companies to supply and finance the surviving forces of chiangs kmt helliwell w as put in charge of this operation this included establishing the sea supply corporation a shipping company in bangkok the cia now launched a secret war against china an office under commercial cover called western enterprises was opened on taiwan training and operational bases were established in taiwan and other offshore islands by  chiang kaishek claimed to have more than a million active guerrillas in china however according to john prados “ united states intelligence estimates at the time carried the more conservative figure of  or  only half of whom could be considered loyal to taiwan” after the war tommy corcoran continued his work as a paid lobbyist for sam zemurray and the united fruit company zemurray became concerned that captain jacobo arbenz one of the heroes of the  revolution would be elected as the new president of guatemala in the spring of  corcoran went to see thomas c mann the director of the state department’s office of interamerican affairs corcoran asked mann if he had any plans to prevent arbenz from being elected mann replied “that is for the people of that country to decide” unhappy with this reply corcoran paid a call on the allen dulles the deputy director of the cia dulles who represented united fruit in the s was far more interested in corcoran’s ideas “during their meeting dulles explained to corcoran that while the cia was sympathetic to united fruit he could not authorize any assistance without the support of the state department dulles assured corcoran however that whoever was elected as the next president of guatemala would not be allowed to nationalize the operations of united fruit” however political groups continued to resort to violence and in  major francisco arana was murdered the following year arbenz defeated manuel ygidoras to become guatemalas new president arbenz who obtained  of the votes took power on th march  corcoran then recruited robert la follette to work for united fruit corcoran arranged for la follette to lobby liberal members of congress the message was that arbenz was not a liberal but a dangerous leftwing radical this strategy was successful and congress was duly alarmed when on  th june  arbenz announced a new agrarian reform program  this included expropriating idle land on government and private estates and redistributed to peasants in lots of  to  acres the agrarian reform program managed to give  million acres to around  families for which the government paid  in bonds among the expropriated landowners was arbenz himself who had become into a landowner with the dowry of his wealthy wife around  farms were given to groups of peasants who organized themselves in cooperatives in march   acres of united fruit companys uncultivated land was taken by the government which offered compensation of  the company wanted  million for the land while the guatemalan government valued  per acre the american government valued it at  per acre as david mckean has pointed out this figure was “in line with the company’s own valuation of the property at least for tax purposes” however the company wanted  million for the land while the guatemalan government valued it at  per acre the company now valued it at  per acre corcoran contacted president anastasio somoza and warned him that the guatemalan revolution might spread to nicaragua somoza now made representations to harry s truman about what was happening in guatemala after discussions with walter bedell smith director of the cia a secret plan to overthrow arbenz operation fortune was developed part of this plan involved tommy corcoran arranging for small arms and ammunition to be loaded on a united fruit freighter and shipped to guatemala where the weapons would be distributed to dissidents when the secretary of state dean acheson discovered details of operation fortune he had a meeting with truman where he vigorously protested about the involvement of united fruit and the cia in the attempted overthrow of the democratically elected president jacobo arbenz as a result of acheson’s protests truman ordered the postponement of operation fortune tommy corcoran’s work was made easier by the election of dwight eisenhower in november  eisenhower’s personal secretary was anne whitman the wife of edmund whitman united fruit’s public relations director eisenhower appointed john peurifoy as ambassador to guatemala he soon made it clear that he believed that the arbenz government posed a threat to the america’s campaign against communism corcoran also arranged for whiting willauer his friend and partner in civil air transport to become us ambassador to honduras as willauer pointed out in a letter to claire lee chennault he worked day and night to arrange training sites and instructors plus air crews for the rebel air force and to keep the honduran government “in line so they would allow the revolutionary activity to continue” eisenhower also replaced dean acheson with john foster dulles his brother allen dulles became director of the cia the dulles brothers “had sat on the board of united fruit’s partner in the banana monopoly the schroder banking corporation” whereas “un ambassador henry cabot lodge was a stockholder and had been a strong defender of united fruit while a us senator” walter bedell smith was moved to the state department smith told corcoran he would do all he could to help in the overthrow of arbenz he added that he would like to work for united fruit once he retired from government office this request was granted and bedell smith was later to become a director of united fruit according to john prados the author of the presidents secret war corcoran’s meeting with “undersecretary of state walter bedell smith that summer and that conversation is recalled by cia officers as the clear starting point of that plan” evan thomas the author of the very best me daring early years of the cia  has added that “with his usual energy and skill corcoran beseeched the u s government to overthrow arbenz” the new cia plan to overthrow jacobo arbenz was called “operation success” allen dulles became the executive agent and arranged for tracey barnes and richard bissell to plan and execute the operation bissell later claimed that he had been aware of the problem since reading a document published by the state department that claimed “the communists already exercise in guatemala a political influence far out of proportion to their small numerical strength this influence will probably continue to grow during  the political situation in guatemala adversely effects u s interests and constitutes a potential threat to us security” bissell does not point out that the source of this information was tommy corcoran and the united fruit company john prados argues that it was barnes and bissell who “coordinated the washington end of the planning and logistics for the guatemala operation” as deputy director for plans it was frank wisner’s responsibility to select the field commander for operation success kim roosevelt was first choice but he turned it down and instead the job went to albert hanley the cia station chief in korea hanley was told to report to joseph caldwell king director of the cia’s western hemisphere division king had previously worked for the fbi where he had responsibility for all intelligence operations in latin america king suggested hanley meet tommy corcoran hanley did not like the idea king replied “if you think you can run this operation without united fruit you’re crazy” although hanley refused to work with corcoran allen dulles kept him fully informed of the latest developments in planning the overthrow of arbenz tracey barnes brought in david atlee phillips to run a “black” propaganda radio station according to phillips he was reluctant to take part in the overthrow of a democratically elected president barnes replied “it’s not a question of arbenz nor of guatemala we have solid intelligence that the soviets intended to throw substantial support to arbenz… guatemala is bordered by honduras british honduras salvador and mexico it’s unacceptable to have a commie running guatemala” barnes also appointed e howard hunt as chief of political action in his autobiography undercover  hunt claims that “barnes swore me to special secrecy and revealed that the national security council under eisenhower and vice president nixon had ordered the overthrow of guatemala’s communist regime” hunt was not convinced by this explanation he pointed out that  months previously he had suggested to the director of the cia that arbenz needed to be dealt with however the idea had been rejected hunt was now told that “ washington lawyer thomas g corcoran had among his clients the united fruit company united fruit like many american corporations in guatemala had watched with growing dismay nationalization confiscation and other strong measures affecting their foreign holdings finally a landreform edict issued by arbenz proved the final straw and tommy the cork had begun lobbying in behalf of united fruit and against arbenz following this special impetus our project had been approved by the national security council and was already under way” albert hanley brought in rip robertson to take charge of the paramilitary side of the operation robertson had been hanley’s deputy in korea and had “enjoyed going along on the behindthelines missions with the cia guerrillas in violation of standing orders from washington” one of those who worked with robertson in operation success was david morales also in the team was henry hecksher who operated under cover in guatemala to supply frontline reports john foster dulles decided that he “needed a civilian adviser to the state department team to help expediate operation success dulles chose a friend of corcoran’s william pawley a miamibased millionaire” david mckean goes on to point out that pawley had worked with corcoran chennault and willauer in helping to set up the flying tigers and in transforming civil air transport into a cia airline mckean adds that his most important qualification for the job was his “long association with rightwing latin america dictators” the rebel “liberation army” was formed and trained in nicaragua this was not a problem as president anastasio somoza and been warning the united states government since  that that the guatemalan revolution might spread to nicaragua the rebel army of  men were trained by rip robertson their commander was a disaffected guatemalan army officer carlos castillo armas it was clear that a  man army was unlikely to be able to overthrow the guatemalan government tracey barnes believed that if the rebels could gain control of the skies and bomb guatemala city they could create panic and arbenz might be fooled into accepting defeat according to richard bissell somoza was willing to provide cover for this covert operation however this was on the understanding that these aircraft would be provided by the united states dwight eisenhower agreed to supply somoza with a “small pirate air force to bomb arbenz into submission” to fly these planes the cia recruited american mercenaries like jerry delarm before the bombing of guatemala city the rebel army was moved to honduras where tommy corcoran’s business partner whiting willauer was ambassador the plan was for them to pretend to be the “vanguard of a much larger army seeking to liberate their homeland from the marxists” arbenz became aware of this cia plot to overthrow him guatemalan police made several arrests in his memoirs eisenhower described these arrests as a “reign of terror” and falsely claimed that “agents of international communism in guatemala continued their efforts to penetrate and subvert their neighboring central american states using consular agents for their political purposes and fomenting political assassinations and strikes sydney gruson of the new york times began to investigate this story journalists working for time magazine also tried to write about these attempts to destabilize arbenz’s government frank wisner head of operation mockingbird asked allen dulles to make sure that the american public never discovered the plot to overthrow arbenz arthur hays sulzberger the publisher of the new york times agreed to stop gruson from writing the story henry luce was also willing to arrange for the time magazine reports to be rewritten at the editorial offices in new york the cia propaganda campaign included the distribution of  copies of a pamphlet entitled chronology of communism in guatemala  they also produced three films on guatemala for showing free in cinemas faked photographs were distributed that claimed to show the mutilated bodies of opponents of arbenz david atlee phillips and e howard hunt were responsible for running the cias voice of liberation radio station broadcasts began on  st may  they also arranged for the distribution of posters and pamphlets over  articles based on information provided by the cia were placed in newspapers and magazines by the united states information agency the voice of liberation reported massive defections from arbenz’s army according to david atlee phillips the radio station “broadcast that two columns of rebel soldiers were converging on guatemala city in fact castillo armas and his makeshift army were still encamped six miles inside the border far from the capital” as phillips later admitted the “highways were crowded but with frightened citizens fleeing guatemala city and not with soldiers approaching it” as e howard hunt pointed out “our powerful transmitter overrode the guatemalan national radio broadcasting messages to confuse and divide the population from its military overlords” there was no popular uprising on  th june the cia reported to dwight eisenhower that castillo armas had not been able to take his assigned objective zacapa his seaborne force had also failed to capture puerto barrios according to john prados it all now depended on “whiting willauer’s rebel air force” however that was not going to plan and on th june winston churchill the british prime minister berated eisenhower when a cia plane sank a british merchant vessel heading for guatemala the bombing had been ordered by rip robertson without first gaining permission from the cia or eisenhower robertson had been convinced that the springfjord was a “czech arms carrying freighter” in reality it had been carrying only coffee and cotton frank wisner had to make a personal apology for the incident and the cia later quietly reimbursed lloyd’s of london insurers of the springfjord  the  million they had paid out on the ship arbenz had been convinced by the voice of liberation reports that his army was deserting richard bissell believes that this is when arbenz made his main mistake jacobo arbenz decided to distribute weapons to the “people’s organizations and the political parties” as bissell later explained “the conservative men who constituted the leadership of guatemala’s army viewed this action as the final unacceptable leftward lurch and they told arbenz they would no longer support him he resigned and fled to mexico”president harry truman became highly suspicious of corcorans activities and he arranged for fbi director j edgar hoover to place a tap on his phone despite his shady business dealings he was never convicted of a criminal offence thomas corcoran died on th december  assassination of john f kennedy encyclopedia primary sources  robert dallek lone star rising lyndon johnson and his times  by the middle of  fdr worried that deficit spending was leading to high inflation believed that the government needed to curb its outlays ickes who had jurisdiction over the pwa feared that money allocated to texas dams would line the pockets of builders overcharging the government in the summer of  however johnson persuaded the white house to commit another  million to the marshall ford dam a third of the additional  million promised in  the prospect of throwing some  men out of work and of halting construction on a project that would ultimately save texas millions of dollars in flood damages played a large part in the decision unless the marshall ford construction was continued an lcra memo warned  percent of the  men on the job would be fired and floods like one in june  costing over  million would continue to plague southcentral texas on july  in a ceremony at the white house james roosevelt the presidents son and secretary handed johnson who was accompanied by wirtz and members of the lcra board the presidents order granting the  million joking with the delegation jimmy roosevelt said that johnson had kept him busy so much of the time on the texas project that he will have to catch up on his sleep now the president is happy to do this for your congressman  jimmy added in response to repeated prodding by johnson the administration provided another  million over the next four years to complete the network of texas dams the expenditure paid handsome dividends in lower unemployment flood prevention and more abundant and cheaper electric power the dambuilding also served lyndons political interests and the wellbeing of brown  root a construction company in austin controlled by george and herman brown with lyndons help they won government contracts that turned a small roadbuilding firm into a multimillion dollar business their success gave lyndon a financial angel that could help secure his political future as tommy corcoran put it later a young guy might be as wise as solomon as winning as will rogers and as popular as santa claus but if he didnt have a firm financial base his opponents could squeeze him when roosevelt told me to take care of the boy corcoran added that meant to watch out for his financial backers too in lyndons case there was just this little road building firm brown and root run by a pair of germans  robert a caro lyndon johnson master of the senate  jenkins wrote warren woodward on january  ed clark tells me that he has received some assistance from h e butt i wonder if you could go by and pick it up and put it with the other we put away before i left texas clark says that browns money was for the presidential run for which johnson was gearing up that january and that butts was for johnson to contribute to the campaigns of other senators but that often he and the other men providing johnson with funds werent even sure which of these two purposes the funding were for how could you know ed clark was to say if johnson wanted to give some senator money for some campaign johnson would pass the word to give money to me or jesse kellam or cliff carter and it would find its way into johnsons hands and it would be the same if he wanted money for his own campaign and a lot of the money that was given to johnson both for other candidates and for himself was in cash all we knew was that lyndon asked for it and we gave it tommy corcoran was to say this atmosphere would pervade lyndon johnsons fundraising all during his years in the senate he would pass the word  often by telephoning sometimes by having jenkins telephone  to brown or dark or connally and the cash would be collected down in texas and flown to washington or a johnson was in austin would be delivered to him there when word was received that some was available john connally recalls he would board a plane in fort worth or dallas and id go get it or walter would get it woody would go get it we had a lot of people who would go get it and deliver it the idea that walter or woody or wilton woods would skim some is ridiculous we had couriers or dark says if george or me were going up anyway wed take it ourselves and tommy corcoran was often bringing johnson cash from new york unions mostly as contributions to liberal senators whom the unions wanted to support asked how he knew that the money found its way into johnsons hands clark laughed and said because sometimes i gave it to him it would be in an envelope both clark and wild said that johnson wanted the contributions given outside the office to either jenkins or bobby baker or to another johnson aide cliff carter but neither wild nor clark trusted either baker or carter  jake esterline was interviewed by jack pfeiffer on th november  jack pfeiffer i have a question and it is what was pawleys relation to this whole operation and your relation with pawley seems to have been quite close too jake esterline i think it was a hangover relationship from the things that bill pawley had done as quite a wheel with a number of very senior people during the guatemalan operation  that they felt that bill who had been very closely tied into cuba  that he was a very prominent man in florida that there were a lot of things that he might be able to do in the sense of getting things lined up in florida for us and also his ties with nixon and with other republican politicos i used to deal with him quite a bit before from my point of view we never let bill pawley know any of the intimacies about our operations or what we were doing he never knew where our bases were or things of that sort he never knew anything specific about our operations but he was doing an awful lot of things on his own with the exiles some of the people that he had known in cuba in the sugar business etc i guess he actually was instrumental in running boats and things in and out of cuba getting people out and what not and a variety of things that were not connected with us in any way he was a political factor from the standpoint from jcs standpoint i dont know whether tommy corcoran entered in at this point i think tommy corcoran was strictly in guatemala i guess corcoran didnt come into this thing at least not very much jack pfeiffer his name turns up once or twice jake esterline yes i met him once in connection with cuba but i dont remember who for jc king but i dont remember why at this point it wasnt anything of any significance my feeling with pawley he was such a hawk and he was every second week he wanted to kill somebody inside  it was from my standpoint  we were trying to keep him from doing things to cause problems for us this was almost a standing operation jack pfeiffer this is what i was wondering because tracy barnes i know on a number of occasions seemed to make it quite clear that what the agency had to be careful of was getting hung with a reactionary label and then at the same time that was going on here is all of this conversation back and forth with pawley and his visits jake esterline really to keep him from doing something to upset the applecart from our standpoint in that sense i did fill that role in part for a long time and the net result of the thing is that bill thinks i am a dangerous leftist today if i hadnt been a foot dragger or hadnt taken all these dissenting opinions of this things in cuba would have been a lot better jack pfeiffer was pawley actually involved in the covert operation in guatemala jake esterline yes he well i am sure he was in a jack pfeiffer i mean with you as far as you jake esterline not i personally but he was involved with state department i said rubottom a couple of times i didnt mean rubottom i meant rusk he was involved  especially in guatemala with rubottom or whoever secretary of state was and seville sacassaa and somoza and whoever secretary of defense was in getting the planes from the defense dept having them painted over the decals painted over and flown to nicaragua where they became the defense force for that operation jack pfeiffer i ran across some comment that he had made to livingston merchant jake esterline they were good friends and knew each other but to my knowledge he never had any involvement like that during the bay of pigs days although youd have to ask ted shackley about what they did later because i think he ran some things into cuba for ted shackley jack pfeiffer that is beyond my period of interest he was involved in a great amount of fund raising activity in the new york area apparently  pushing or raising funds in the new york area  wasnt droller involved in this too what was your relation with droller were you directing drollers activities or was dave phillips running droller jake esterline oh i sort of ran droller except i never knew what tracy barnes was going to do next when i turned my back droller was suchan ambitious fellow trying to run in trying to run circles around everybody for his own aggrandizement that you never knew but droller would never have had any continuing contact with pawley because they had met only once and i recall pawley saying that he never wanted to talk to that you know what again he was very unhappy that somebody like gerry he just didnt like gerrys looks he didnt like his accent he was very unfair about gerry and i dont mean to be unfair about gerry  the only thing is that gerry was insanely ambitious he was his own worst enemy that was all we just didnt think that tracy really understood it that well or if tracy did he coudnt articulate he wouldnt articulate it that well tracy was one of the sweetest guys that ever lived but he coudnt ever draw a straight line between two points jack pfeiffer what about jfk jake esterline jfk was an uninitiated fellow who had been in the wars but he hadnt been exposed to any world politics or crises yet if he had something else as a warm up he might have made different decisions than he made at that time i think he was kind of a victim of the thing i blame nixon far more than i do kennedy for the equivocations and the loss of time and what not that led to the ultimate disaster goodwin i just thought was a sleazy little selfseeker who i didnt feel safe with any secret his consorting with che guevara in montevideo had rather upset me at the time jack pfeiffer how about mcnamara did you get involved with him at all jake esterline no jack pfeiffer bobby kennedy jake esterline i wouldnt even tell you off tape i didnt like him hes dead god rest his soul  ray s cline secrets spies and scholars blueprint of the essential cia  thomas g tommy corcoran washingtons durable political lawyer and an early new deal braintruster from harvard law school says that his greatest contribution to government in his long career was helping infiltrate smart young harvard law school products into every agency of government he felt the united states needed to develop a highly educated highly motivated public service corps that had not existed before roosevelts time donovan did much the same for career experts in international affairs by collecting in one place a galaxy of experience and ability the likes of which even the state department had never seen many of these later drifted away but a core remained to create a tradition and eventually to take key jobs in a mature intelligence system of the kind the united states required for coping with twentieth century problems  david mckean peddling influence  corcoran ever the loyal soldier to roosevelt agreed to help and visited his old friends in the senate including senators burton wheeler of montana worth clark of montana and robert la follette of wisconsin a few weeks later corcoran reported to the president that while these men were opposed to involvement in europe he did not believe that a modest aid program to china would cause them serious concern after evaluating corcorans optimistic assessment roosevelt conveyed to him again through lauchlin currie that he wanted to establish a private corporation to provide assistance to the chinese corcoran thought the presidents idea was ingenious and later wrote that if wed tried to set up a government corporation per se or do the work out of a federal office there would have been devil to pay on the hill instead corcoran set up a civilian corporation which he chartered in delaware and at the suggestion of the president named china defense supplies it would be as corcoran later recalled the entire lend lease operation for asia in order to provide the company with the stamp of respectability roosevelt arranged for his elderly uncle frederick delano whod spent a lifetime in the china trade to be cochairman the other chairman was t v soong chiangs personal representative who frequently visited washington to lobby for aid to his government soong a harvard graduate was also chiangs finance minister as well as his banker and his brotherinlaw and he was a close friend of david corcoran whom he had met when the younger corcoran was working in the far east after getting the green light to proceed with the establishment of china defense supplies corcoran hired a staff to run the company with delano and soong as the chairmen corcoran went about appointing a politically savvy management team first he asked his brother david to take a leave of absence from sterling to become president although david corcoran was an extremely competent manager sterling was then under investigation by the department of justice and davids appointment could be cynically viewed as an attempt by tommy to protect his brother from the investigation by shielding him with a quasigovernment role next he appointed a bright young lawyer named bill youngman as general counsel youngman had previously clerked for judge learned hand and after ben cohen recommended him he landed a job as general counsel at the federal power commission to direct the program from china corcoran chose whitey willauer who had been his brother howards roommate at exeter princeton and harvard law school corcoran had previously helped willauer get a job at the federal aviation administration and he knew willauer was crazy about china after helping to establish and run china defense supplies willauer moved over to the foreign economic administration where he supervised both lendlease to china and purchases from china lastly corcoran arranged for the marine corps to detail quinn shaughnessy who like corcoran was a graduate of harvard law school shaughnessy was given the task of locating and acquiring goods supplies and weapons for the chinese corcoran took no title himself other than outside counsel for china defense supplies he paid himself five thousand dollars to set up the company but didnt want his affiliation with it to interfere with his incipient lobbying practice  william e leuchtenburg franklin d roosevelt and the new deal  the shy modest cohen a jew from muncie indiana was a former brandeis law clerk who had developed into a brilliant legislative draftsman corcoran an irishman from a rhode island mill town had gone from harvard law school to washington in  to serve as secretary to mr justice holmes holmes found him quite noisy quite satisfactory and quite noisy roosevelt had discovered corcoran and cohen who had teamed up to draft wall street regulatory legislation to be remarkably resourceful in resolving knotty governmental problems and by the spring of  the boys as frankfurter called them were playing key roles in the new deal corcoran was a new political type the expert who not only drafted legislation but maneuvered it through the treacherous corridors of capitol hill two washington reporters wrote of him he could play the accordion sing any song you cared to mention read aeschylus in the original quote dante and montaigne by the yard tell an excellent story write a great bill like the securities exchange act prepare a presidential speech tread the labyrinthine maze of palace politics or chart the future course of a democracy with equal ease he lived with cohen and five other new dealers in a house on r street as early as the spring of  gop congressmen were learning to ignore the sponsors of new deal legislation and level their attacks at the scarletfever boys from the little red house in georgetown in the first two years of the new deal the brandeisians chafed as the nra advocates sat at the presidents right hand they rejoiced only in the tva since it both checked monopoly and accentuated decentralization and in the regulation of securities issues and the stock market which marked the success of brandeis earlier crusade against the money power not until  did the brandeisians make their way that year saw the triumph of the decentralizers in the fight over the social security bill and the enhanced power in tva of frankfurters follower david lilienthal brandeis himself had a direct hand in the most important victory of all the invalidation of the nra  david mckean peddling influence  corcoran had only been out of the government for a short time but he was running the asian lendlease program and working to defend against both the justice department inquiry and a potential congressional investigation into sterling pharmaceutical corcoran assembled a defense team led by john cahill his former classmate at harvard law school and an associate of his at cotton and franklin cahill was the us attorney in new york and not coincidentally had been working with thurman arnold the assistant attorney general for antitrust matters supervising the department of justices inquiry into sterling at corcorans urging cahill resigned his post on february   to enter private practice there were no laws prohibiting him from representing a client in a case on which he had been working and notwithstanding a clear conflict of interest cahill immediately began representing sterling pharmaceutical now that he had help on the sterling case corcoran began to take on new business his first major client was henry j kaiser a west coast businessman who had made a fortune from government contracts primarily in helping build the boulder and shasta dams corcoran had first met kaiser when corcoran was an attorney at the rfc and he harold ickes and david lilienthal established the bonneville power administration now as the country prepared for war kaiser recognized that the governments procurement program offered many exceptional business opportunities kaiser needed to know the people in washington who were making the decisions and he called on tommy corcoran for assistance corcoran was able to open doors for kaiser all over town at the white house corcoran introduced him to several people including lauchlin currie at the federal reserve corcoran arranged a meeting with the chairman marriner eccles who had been introduced to kaiser several years earlier when eccles was a construction magnate in utah corcoran later boasted that through his contacts at the interior department he denied the bonneville power administration to alcoa the giant aluminum company and helped secure it for kaiser corcoran also helped at the war department where he introduced kaiser to william knudsen the former chief executive of general motors who had been appointed at the end of  to command the office of production management to coordinate defense preparations over the course of the next few years kaiser arranged for  million in building contracts at his ten shipyards eight of which were located on the west coast he netted a profit on each ship of between  to  and made millions with his assembly methods he pioneered group medicine at his companies creating what eventually became kaiser permanente a precursor to todays health maintenance organizations  david mckean peddling influence  in late  johnson approached e g kingsbery an ultraconservative austin businessman who owned a half interest in ktbc kingsbery had opposed johnsons candidacy but after the congressman helped kingsberys son gain admission to the us naval academy at annapolis the businessman was indebted to him johnson told kingsbery im not a newspaperman not a lawyer and i might get beat sometime i did have a secondclass teachers certificate but its expired and i want to get into some business impressed by johnsons energy and initiative kingsbery told johnson that he wanted to pay his obligation to him and simply gave him his halfinterest option the option to buy the other half was owned by the wesley west family who had extensive holdings in the oil industry and owned the austin daily tribune a conservative daily just a day or two before christmas johnson traveled to plano county to work out a deal with wesley west at his ranch johnson charmed the older man who later recalled i didnt like lyndon johnson but said after meeting him hes a pretty good fellow i believe ill sell it to him with the two halfinterest options johnson had only one more obstacle to overcome in his purchase of the station  approval from the federal communications commission to help navigate the process johnson called tommy corcoran when corcoran left government and had been looking for clients johnson made sure that he was placed on retainer by the houston contracting firm of brown and root owned by george and herman brown who had financed lyndons previous campaigns corcoran had been paid as much as fifteen thousand dollars for advice conferences and negotiations related to shipbuilding contracts now it was johnson looking to corcoran to help him with a business proposition corcoran did not disappoint as corcoran later told johnsons biographer robert caro i helped out all up and down the line corcoran had an important contact at the fcc james fly the chairman of the commission had been his classmate at harvard law school and owed his appointment in good measure to corcoran justice frank murphy later told felix frankfurter that he had helped get fly the position as a favor to tommy corcoran according to murphy it was at toms request that i gave the former chairman a ten thousand dollar a year job so as to create a vacancy into which fly was placed  david mckean peddling influence  as planning for the us plot progressed corcoran and other top officials at united fruit became anxious about identifying a future leader who would establish favorable relations between the government and the company secretary of state dulles moved to add acivilian adviser to the state department team to help expedite operation success dulles chose a friend of corcorans william pawley a miamibased millionaire who along with corcoran chennault and willauer had helped set up the flying tigers in the early ros and then helped several years later to transform it into the cias airline civil air transport besides his association with corcoran pawleys most important qualification for the job was that he had a long history of association with rightwing latin american dictators cia director dulles had grown disillusioned with j c king and asked colonel albert haney the cia station chief in korea to be the us field commander for the operation haney enthusiastically accepted although he was apparently unaware of the role that the united fruit company had played in his selection haney had been a colleague of kings and though king was no longer directing the operation he remained a member of the agency planning team he suggested that haney meet with tom corcoran to see about arming the insurgency force with the weapons that had been mothballed in a new york warehouse after the failed operation fortune when the supremely confident haney said he didnt need any help from a washington lawyer king rebuked him if you think you can run this operation without united fruit youre crazy the close working relationship between the cia and united fruit was perhaps best epitomized by allen dulless encouragement to the company to help select an expedition commander for the planned invasion after the cias first choice was vetoed by the state department united fruit proposed corcova cerna a guatemalan lawyer and coffee grower cerna had long worked for the company as a paid legal adviser and even though corcoran referred to him as a liberal he believed that cerna would not interfere with the companys land holdings and operations after cerna was hospitalized with throat cancer a third candidate colonel carlos castillo armas emerged as the compromise choice according to united fruits thomas mccann when the central intelligence agency finally launched operation success in late june  united fruit was involved at every level from neighboring honduras ambassador willauer corcorans former business partner directed bombing raids on guatemala city mccann was told that the cia even shipped down the weapons used in the uprising in united fruit boats on june   colonel armas ousted the arbenz government and ordered the arrest of all communist leaders in guatemala while the coup was successful a dark chapter was opened in american support for right wing military dictators in central america  david mckean peddling influence  in february  the new york times reported that while senator johnson stubbornly contends that he has no plans or expectations of becoming a candidate several aides including corcoran were working for him behind the scenes the article quoted corcoran as suggesting that he was used for the testing of new ideas three months earlier corcorans good friend the seventyeightyear old speaker of the house sam rayburn had returned to his home state of texas to announce the formation of an unofficial johnson for president campaign rayburns announcement followed that of senator john f kennedy who had declared his candidacy for the presidency in the senate caucus room a month earlier and senator hubert humphrey who had tossed his hat into the ring at the beginning of the new year sensing that he had a greater name recognition than any of the declared candidates and desperately seeking vindication after two stinging previous defeats adali stevenson allowed others to present his case senator stuart symington had decided to wait in the wings hoping that in a deadlocked convention he would become the consensus alternative corcoran was one of a number of prominent new dealerera luminaries including eliot janeway dean acheson and william o douglas who were supporting lyndon johnson presidential chronicler theodore white later called the group a loose and highly ineffective coalition which was not entirely fair since it did manage to raise nearly  for johnsons undeclared candidacy lbj himself decided not to campaign actively as majority leader he believed he couldnt neglect his senate duties to mount a fullscale campaign  david mckean peddling influence  in late  however corcoran was preoccupied with a political scandal only weeks after johnson was sworn in as president bobby baker got into trouble for fraud and tax evasion baker had been lbjs closest aide and most important adviser in the senate he and corcoran had known each other for many years and although never close friends their mutual respect for lyndon johnson and the fact that they were both political operators meant that they saw one another often tommy had actually helped baker buy his house in the affluent section of washington known as spring valley corcoran had learned that baker and his wife who was expecting their third child were looking for a larger home at the time tommy was representing tenneco and he knew that a house under construction  originally intended for one of the companys vice presidents who had been recalled to texas  was slated to go on the market for  baker was encouraged to put in a bid of  which was accepted although baker never recalled doing any special favor for corcoran in return tommy always knew that he was owed one in january  baker was indicted by the us attorney in washington for tax evasion the former capitol hill aide sought out john lane whom he had known in the senate and who by now had established a small but highly regarded law practice lane did not have a whitecollar defense practice but he knew that tommy corcorans brother howard practiced in new york with boris kostelanitz a respected attorney who had handled several criminal tax cases lane and baker went to see corcoran in his office as they sat and talked on corcorans leather couch corcorans secretary came in and told baker that attorney general robert kennedy was on the telephone kennedy wanted to assure baker that he had not personally ordered the case against him and that his knowledge of the case came only from newspaper clippings baker retained kostelanitz to defend him on the charges of tax evasion and retained edward bennett williams the renowned criminal lawyer as his counsel the case was assigned to judge oliver gasch of the district court after several judges reportedly rejected it because they personally knew baker ironically gasch a close friend of howard corcorans owed his appointment to tommy corcoran but much to bakers chagrin corcoran didnt intercede on his behalf probably because lyndon johnson never asked him the president according to one lawyer close to the case didnt want to touch baker with a ten foot pole spartacus ebooks related readingpeddling influence tommy corcoran spartacus educational tommy corcoran thomas corcoran the son of a lawyer was born in rhode island on th december  he was educated at brown university and harvard law school corcorans most important influence at university was professor felix frankfurter he wrote that corcoran was struggling very hard with the burden of inferiority imposed on him because of his irish catholicism frankfurter was impressed with corcorans progress and introduced him to his close friend supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes after graduating in  he was invited by holmes to become his legal clerk in  corcoran joined the law firm established by william mcadoo at the time it was run by george franklin and joseph cotton in  eugene meyer chairman of the federal reserve board was looking for a general counsel for the newly established reconstruction finance corporation after talks with franklin he appointed corcoran to this post meyer resigned in  and was replaced by jesse h jones after franklin d roosevelt defeated herbert hoover he asked felix frankfurter to assemble a legal team to review the nations securities laws frankfurter selected corcoran benjamin cohen and james landis for the task corcoran a member of the democratic party readily accepted the post together

claimed that corcoran threatened to stop construction on the passamaquoddy dam in his district unless he supported the holding company bill congress immediately ordered the rules committee to investigate the matter the senate investigation headed by hugo black eventually cleared corcoran of any wrongdoing corcoran wrote to a friend storms make a sailor  if he survives them thomas howard and david corcoran roosevelts personal secretary louis m howe died of pneumonia on th june  according to corcorans biographer david mckean peddling influence corcoran now replaced howe as roosevelts most trusted adviser and personal companion some of roosevelts ministers complained about corcorans growing influence henry morgenthau the secretary of the treasury claimed that corcoran was a crook as well as drafting new deal legislation roosevelt used corcoran as his special emissary to capitol hill elliott roosevelt wrote that apart from my father tom corcoran was the single most influential individual in the country in  corcoran used this influence to make sure sam rayburn of texas became speaker of the house this was a difficult task as james farley was advocating that john oconnor got the job corcorans increasing power was indicated by the fact that franklin d roosevelt brought an end to farleys campaign this was the beginning of a very close relationship that corcoran enjoyed with rayburn and the texas oil industry franklin d roosevelt began to have considerable problems with the supreme court the chief justice charles hughes had been the republican party presidential candidate in  hughes appointed by herbert hoover in  led the courts opposition to some of the proposed new deal legislation this included the ruling against the national recovery administration nra the agricultural adjustment act aaa and ten other new deal laws on nd february  franklin d roosevelt made a speech attacking the supreme court for its actions over new deal legislation he pointed out that seven of the nine judges charles hughes willis van devanter george sutherland harlan stone owen roberts benjamin cardozo and pierce butler had been appointed by republican presidents roosevelt had just won reelection by  votes and resented the fact that the justices could veto legislation that clearly had the support of the vast majority of the public roosevelt suggested that the age was a major problem as six of the judges were over  charles hughes willis van devanter james mcreynolds louis brandeis george sutherland and pierce butler roosevelt announced that he was going to ask congress to pass a bill enabling the president to expand the supreme court by adding one new judge up to a maximum off six for every current judge over the age of  hughes realized that roosevelts court reorganization bill would result in the court coming under the control of the democratic party behind the scenes hughes was busy doing deals to make sure that roosevelts bill would be defeated in congress tommy corcoran was giving the task by roosevelt to persuade congress to pass this proposed legislation this included working closely with i f stone of the new york post stone a strong opponent of the conservative supreme court agreed to write speeches for corcoran on this issue these speeches were then passed on to roosevelt supporters in congress in the past corcoran had relied heavily on the influence of his close friend burton wheeler chairman of the judiciary committee however wheeler had now turned against roosevelt wheeler even argued that franklin d roosevelt had been behind the assassination of huey long corcoran continued to campaign for the judicial court reorganization bill but he failed to persuade enough to get it passed even the most leftwing of all the justices louis brandeis opposed roosevelts attempt to pack the supreme court brandeis was also beginning to oppose some aspects of the new deal that he believed favored big business however members of the supreme court accepted they had to fall in line with public opinion on th march owen roberts announced that he had changed his mind about voting against minimum wage legislation hughes also reversed his opinion on the social security act and the national labour relations act nlra and by a  vote they were now declared to be constitutional then willis van devanter probably the most conservative of the justices announced his intention to resign he was replaced by hugo black a member of the democratic party and a strong supporter of the new deal in july  congress defeated the court reorganization bill by  however roosevelt had the satisfaction of knowing he had a supreme court that was now less likely to block his legislation corcoran later took credit for getting hugo black  felix frankfurter  william o douglas  and frank murphy  appointed to supreme court he also played an important role in defending black when it was discovered that he was a former member of the ku klux klan corcoran later claimed he wrote blacks statement asking for forgiveness time magazine september  corcoran also became involved in advising franklin d roosevelt over foreign policy although he had liberal views on domestic issues corcoran was passionately anticommunist this was partly because of his roman catholicism roosevelt initially favoured giving help to the republican government in spain however corcoran was a supporter of the fascist movement led by general francisco franco as drew pearson and jack anderson pointed out in their book the case against congress a compelling indictment of corruption on capitol hill “long before pope john and pope paul made it clear they were not in sympathy with the catholic hierarchy of spain the reactionary wing of the catholic church in the united states had been conducting one of the most efficient lobbies ever to operate on capital hill it was able to reverse completely american policy on spain during the spanish civil war thomas g corcoran a member of the roosevelt brain trust worked effectively at the white house to keep an embargo on all us arms to both sides” corcoran knew that adolf hitler and benito mussolini would continue to provide both men and arms to francisco franco roosevelts decision enabled fascism to win in spain and become entrenched in europe roosevelt later told his cabinet that he had made a grave mistake with respect to neutrality in the spanish civil war roosevelt was angry with tommy corcoran over his advice on spain he also began to see that corcoran was becoming a problem for the administration he had upset a lot of powerful figures in congress with his arm twisting tactics corcoran had also tried to unseat those who attempted to resist franklin d roosevelt for example walter george of georgia claimed that corcoran had the power of saying who shall be a senator and who shall not be a senator in june  an article appeared in the saturday evening post accused james roosevelt of being a war profiteer it was also claimed that the presidents son helped joseph kennedy to obtain the ambassador to great britain corcoran who was very close to james roosevelt got dragged into this scandal it was not the first time that corcoran had been accused of corrupt behaviour norman m littell a highranking justice department official told anna roosevelt that corcoran had become a liability to her father no quality is so essential in government as simple integrity and forthrightness ability and brilliance of mind are not enough corcorans fascist sympathies resulted in him becoming a firm advocate of isolationism he told friends that irish americans liked him remembered their parents repression at the hands of the british on one occasion harry hopkins told corcoran tom youre too catholic to trust the russians and too irish to trust the english tommy corcoran now found himself outside the inner circle in  he began telling friends that he was considering leaving government he told samuel irving rosenman i want to make a million dollars in one year thats all then im coming back to the government for the rest of my life corcorans plan was to become a political lobbyist on behalf of companies seeking to obtain government contracts a large number of government officials had their jobs because of corcoran it was payback time one day in early october  franklin d roosevelt told corcoran that he wanted him to resign from the administration he wanted him to carry out a covert mission and it was too politically dangerous to do this while serving in his government roosevelt believed that the best way of stopping japanese imperialism in asia was to arm the chinese government of chiang kaishek however congress was opposed to this idea as it was feared that this help might trigger a war with japan therefore roosevelts plan was for corcoran to establish a private corporation to provide assistance to the nationalist government in china roosevelt even supplied the name of the proposed company china defense supplies he also suggested that his uncle frederick delano should be cochairman of the company chiang nominated his former finance minister tseven soong as the other cochairman for reasons of secrecy corcoran took no title other than outside counsel for china defense supplies william s youngman was his frontman in china corcorans friend whitey willauer was moved to the foreign economic administration where he supervised the sending of supplies to china in this way corcoran was able to create an asian lendlease program corcoran also worked closely with claire lee chennault who had been working as a military adviser to chiang kaishek since  chennault told corcoran that if he was given the resources he could maintain an air force within china that could carry out raids against the japanese corcoran returned to the united states and managed to persuade franklin d roosevelt to approve the creation of the american volunteer group one hundred p fighters built by the curtisswright corporation intended for britain were redirected to chennault in china william pawley was curtisswrights representative in asia and he arranged for the p to be assembled in rangoon it was tommy corcorans son david who suggested that the american volunteer group should be called the flying tigers chennault liked the idea and asked his friend walt disney to design a tiger emblem for the planes on th april  roosevelt signed a secret executive order authorizing the american volunteer group to recruit reserve officers from the army navy and marines pawley suggested that the men should be recruited as flying instructors in july  ten pilots and  mechanics were supplied with fake passports and sailed from san francisco for rangoon when they arrived they were told that they were really involved in a secret war against japan to compensate for the risks involved the pilots were to be paid  a month  for a patrol leader in addition they were to receive  for every enemy plane they shot down the flying tigers were extremely effective in their raids on japanese positions and helped to slow down attempts to close the burma road a key supply route to china in seven months of fighting the flying tigers destroyed  planes at a loss of  men  while flying and  on the ground tommy corcoran had originally been an isolationist however he now knew that he could make a fortune out of the arms trade his first major client was henry j kaiser a successful businessman from california corcoran had helped kaiser obtain lucrative government contracts while working for the reconstruction finance corporation kaiser paid corcoran a retainer of  a year corcoran then introduced kaiser to william s knudsen head of the office of production management over the next few years kaiser obtained  million in building contracts at his ten shipyards kaisers two main business partners were stephen d bechtel and john a mccone kaiser had worked with bechtel in the s to build many of the major roads throughout california in  mccone became president of bechtelmccone on the outbreak of the second world war mccone joined forces with kaiser and bechtel to establish the california shipbuilding company with the help of corcoran the company obtained large government contracts to build ships in  it was reported that the company had made  million in wartime profits corcoran was also informed that a great deal of magnesium would be needed for building aircraft with the help of jesse h jones the boss of the reconstruction finance corporation kaiser was granted a loan to build a magnesium production plant in san jose california after the rfc loan was secured corcoran sent kaiser a bill requesting  in cash and a  stake in the magnesium production business another important client was the houston contracting firm of brown  root owned by george r brown and herman brown these brothers had been the major financiers of the political campaigns of lyndon b johnson corcoran arranged for the two men to meet william s knudsen records show that corcoran was paid  for advice conferences and negotiations related to shipbuilding contracts in  the brown brothers established the brown shipbuilding company on the houston ship channel over the next three years the company built  ships and employed  people this brought in revenue of  the government shipbuilding contract was eventually worth  yet until they got the contract brown  root had never built a single ship of any type corcorans work with china defense supplies caused some disquiet in roosevelts administration henry morgenthau was a prominent critic he argued that in effect corcoran was running an offthebooks operation in which a private company was diverting some of the war material destined for china to a private army the american volunteer group resistance also came from general george marshall and general joseph stilwell the american commander in asia marshall and stilwell both believed that chiang kaishek was completely corrupt and needed to be forced into introducing reforms stilwell complained about corcorans ability to present chiang in the best possible light with roosevelt stilwell wrote to marshall that the continued publication of chungking propaganda in the united states is an increasing handicap to my work he added we can pull them out of this cesspool but continued concessions have made the generalissimo believe he has only to insist and we will yield corcoran was also coming under pressure from the work he was doing for sterling pharmaceutical his brother david worked for the company and was responsible for getting corcoran the contract however it was revealed in  that sterling pharmaceutical had strong links with i g farben the fbi discovered that sterling had conspired with farben to control the sale of aspirin in other words had formed an aspirin cartel according to one fbi report sterling were employing nazi sympathizers in its offices in latin america rumours began to circulate that burton wheeler would announce that he was appointing a subcommittee to investigate the relations between american and german firms assistant attorney general thurman arnold announced he was ready to prosecute any american company aiding and abetting a german company in any part of the world on th april  the department of justice issued subpoenas to sterling pharmaceutical soon afterwards newspapers began to run negative stories about the company one claimed that sterling was helping the nazi propagandist joseph goebbels fulfill his pledge that americans would help hitler win the americas on nd june  roosevelt appointed francis b biddle as his new attorney general biddle was a close friend of corcorans the day after his appointment biddle accepted a settlement offer from sterling in which the company would pay a fine of five thousand dollars later it was agreed that sterling would abrogate all contracts with i g farben in congress there was speeches made calling for an investigation into the role played by corcoran in protecting the interests of sterling pharmaceutical senator lawrence smith argued it is common gossip in government circles that the long arm of tommy corcoran reaches into many agencies that he has placed many men in important positions and they in turn are amenable to his influences corcoran had also developed a close relationship with lyndon b johnson on th april  texas senator morris sheppard died corcoran agreed to help johnson in his campaign to replace sheppard this included helping johnson obtain approval of a rural electrification project from the rural electrification administration corcoran also arranged to franklin d roosevelt to make a speech on the eve of the polls criticizing johnsons opponent wilbert lee odaniel despite the efforts of corcoran odaniel defeated johnson by  votes on the suggestion of alvin j wirtz johnson decided to acquire ktbc a radio station in austin e g kingsberry and wesley west agreed to sell ktbc to johnson officially it was purchased by his wife lady bird johnson however it needed the approval of the federal communications commission fcr johnson asked corcoran for help with this matter this was not very difficult as the chairman of the fcr james fly was appointed by frank murphy as a favour for corcoran the fcc eventually approved the deal and johnson was able to use ktbc to amass a fortune of more than  million rumours continued to circulate about corcorans illegal activities harry s truman accused todd shipyards of hiring corcoran to help win government contracts in september  the new york times reported that corcoran was responsible for obtaining favourable treatment in the settlement of the justice department case brought against sterling pharmaceutical another newspaper reported that vice president henry wallace disapproves of the way mr corcoran has capitalized on the government associations to promote his lucrative law practice on th december  corcoran appeared before the senate defense investigation committee he admitted that business had been exceedingly good since he left roosevelts administration some members of the committee were convinced that corcorans activities revealed a need for more stringent lobbying restrictions senator carl hatch from new mexico introduced a bill that would prohibit former government employees from working with government departments or agencies for two years after leaving government service as david mckean points out in peddling influence the bill never made it out of the judiciary committee presumably because washington lobbyists persuaded their friends on the panel to kill it after the united states entered the war against japan germany and italy president franklin d roosevelt established the office of strategic services oss roosevelt selected colonel william donovan as the first director of the organization who had spent some time studying the special operations executive soe an organization set up by the british government in july  the oss had responsibility for collecting and analyzing information about countries at war with the united states the oss gradually took over the activities that corcoran had helped set up in china in  oss agents based in china included paul helliwell e howard hunt mitch werbell lucien conein john singlaub and ray cline according to an article in the wall street journal some oss members in china were paid for their work with fivepound sacks of opium in a letter to the senate defense investigation committee in november  norman m littell assistant attorney general for the lands division reported conversations between tommy corcoran and francis biddle that suggested that the two men had a corrupt relationship littell claimed that biddle seemed to be following instructions from corcoran in the letter littell asked the committee what has tommy corcoran got on biddle littell argued that during the investigation of the sterling pharmaceutical case biddle was completely dominated by tommy corcoran he added that this company was acting as an agent of nazi germany and that biddles decision to settle this case was the lowest point in the history of the department of justice since the harding administration this story was picked up by the national press and demands were made that the relationship between biddle and corcoran should be investigated sam rayburn made sure that no committee held a hearing on this issue charles van devander reported in the washington post that strong influence is being brought to bear to block an investigation by congress into the affairs of the department of justice including attorney general biddles allegedly close relationship with lawyer lobbyist tommy corcoran one moth after the dropping the atom bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki tommy corcoran joined with david corcoran and william s youngman to create a panamanian company rio carthy for the purpose of pursuing business ventures in asia and south america soon afterwards claire lee chennault and whiting willauer approached corcoran with the idea of creating a commercial airline in china to compete with cnac and catc corcoran agreed to use rio cathy as the legal vehicle for investing in the airline venture chiang kaishek agreed that his government would invest in the airline corcoran anticipated he would own  of the equity in the airline but chennault and willauer gave a greater percentage to the chinese government and corcorans share dropped to  civil air transport cat was officially launched on th january  corcoran approached his old friend fiorella laguardia the director general of the united nations relief and rehabilitation administration unrra he agreed to award a  million contract to deliver relief to china this contract kept them going for the first year but as the civil war intensified cat had difficulty maintaining its routes the oss had been disbanded in october  and was replaced by the war departments strategic service unit ssu paul helliwell became chief of the far east division of the ssu in  the ssu was replaced by the central intelligence agency cat needed another major customer and on th july  corcoran and claire lee chennault had a meeting with roscoe h hillenkoetter the new director of the cia hillenkoetter arranged for corcoran to meet frank wisner the director of the office of policy coordination wisner was in charge of the cias covert operations on st november  corcoran signed a formal agreement with the cia the agreement committed the agency to provide up to  to finance an cat airbase and  to fly agency personnel and equipment in and out of the mainland and to underwrite any shortfall that might result from any hazardous mission over the next few months cat airlifted personnel and equipment from chungking kweilin luchnow nanking and amoy in  lyndon b johnson decided to make a second run for the us senate his main opponent in the democratic primary texas was virtually a one party state and the most important elections were those that decided who would be the democratic party candidate was coke stevenson johnson was criticized by stevenson for supporting the tafthartley act the american federation of labor was also angry with johnson for supporting this legislation and at its june convention the afl broke a  year tradition of neutrality and endorsed stevenson johnson asked tommy corcoran to work behind the scenes at convincing union leaders that he was more prolabor than stevenson this he did and on th august  corcoran told harold ickes that he had a terrible time straightening out labor in the johnson campaign but he believed he had sorted the problem out on nd september unofficial results had stevenson winning by  votes however by the time the results became official johnson was declared the winner by  votes stevenson immediately claimed that he was a victim of election fraud on th september judge t whitfield davidson invalidated the results of the election and set a trial date johnson once again approached corcoran to solve the problem a meeting was held that was attended by corcoran francis biddle abe fortas joe rauh jim rowe and ben cohen it was decided to take the case directly to the supreme court a motion was drafted and sent to justice hugo black on th september justice black issued an order that put johnsons name back on the ballot later it was claimed by rauh that black made the decision following a meeting with corcoran on nd november  johnson easily defeated jack porter his republican party candidate coke stevenson now appealed to the subcommittee on elections and privileges of the senate rules and administration committee corcoran enjoyed a good relationship with senator styles bridges of new hampshire he was able to work behind the scenes to make sure that the ruling did not go against johnson corcoran later told johnson that he would have to repay bridges for what he had done for him regarding the election the johnsonstevenson case was also investigated by j edgar hoover and the fbi johnson was eventually cleared by hoover of corruption and was allowed to take his seat in the senate in  sam zemurray asked corcoran to join the united fruit company as a lobbyist and special counsel zemurray had problems with his business in guatemala in the s zemurray aligned united fruit closely with the government of president jorge ubico the company received import duty and real estate tax exemptions from ubico he also gave them hundreds of square miles of land united fruit controlled more land than any other individual or group it also owned the railway the electric utilities telegraph and the countrys only port at puerto barrios on the atlantic coast ubico was overthrown in  and following democratic elections juan jose arevalo became the new president arevalo a university professor who had been living in exile described himself as a spiritual socialist he implemented sweeping reforms by passing new laws that gave workers the right to form unions this included the  guatemalans who worked for united fruit zemurray feared that arevalo would also nationalize the land owned by united fruit in guatemala he asked corcoran to express his fears to senior political figures in washington corcoran began talks with key people in the government agencies and departments that shaped us policy in central america he argued that the us should use united fruit as an american beachhead against communism in the region in january  civil air transport cat relocated its base of operations to the island of formosa where chiang kaishek had established his new government the following month the soviet union and china signed a mutual defense pact two weeks later president harry s truman signed national security directive  which stated that “it is important to united states security interests that all practical measures be taken to prevent further communist expansion in southeast asia” the support of the government in formosa was to become a key aspect of this policy in february  frank wisner began negotiating with corcoran for the purchase of cat “in march using a ‘cutout’ banker or middleman the cia paid cat  to clear up arrearages  for future operations and a  million option on the business the money was then divided among the airline’s owners with corcoran and youngman receiving more than  for six years of legal fees and corcoran youngman and david corcoran dividing approximately  from the sale of the airline” paul helliwell was put in charge of this operation his deputy was desmond fitzgerald helliwells main job was to help chiang kaishek to prepare for a future invasion of communist china the cia created a pair of front companies to supply and finance the surviving forces of chiangs kmt helliwell w as put in charge of this operation this included establishing the sea supply corporation a shipping company in bangkok the cia now launched a secret war against china an office under commercial cover called western enterprises was opened on taiwan training and operational bases were established in taiwan and other offshore islands by  chiang kaishek claimed to have more than a million active guerrillas in china however according to john prados “ united states intelligence estimates at the time carried the more conservative figure of  or  only half of whom could be considered loyal to taiwan” after the war tommy corcoran continued his work as a paid lobbyist for sam zemurray and the united fruit company zemurray became concerned that captain jacobo arbenz one of the heroes of the  revolution would be elected as the new president of guatemala in the spring of  corcoran went to see thomas c mann the director of the state department’s office of interamerican affairs corcoran asked mann if he had any plans to prevent arbenz from being elected mann replied “that is for the people of that country to decide” unhappy with this reply corcoran paid a call on the allen dulles the deputy director of the cia dulles who represented united fruit in the s was far more interested in corcoran’s ideas “during their meeting dulles explained to corcoran that while the cia was sympathetic to united fruit he could not authorize any assistance without the support of the state department dulles assured corcoran however that whoever was elected as the next president of guatemala would not be allowed to nationalize the operations of united fruit” however political groups continued to resort to violence and in  major francisco arana was murdered the following year arbenz defeated manuel ygidoras to become guatemalas new president arbenz who obtained  of the votes took power on th march  corcoran then recruited robert la follette to work for united fruit corcoran arranged for la follette to lobby liberal members of congress the message was that arbenz was not a liberal but a dangerous leftwing radical this strategy was successful and congress was duly alarmed when on  th june  arbenz announced a new agrarian reform program  this included expropriating idle land on government and private estates and redistributed to peasants in lots of  to  acres the agrarian reform program managed to give  million acres to around  families for which the government paid  in bonds among the expropriated landowners was arbenz himself who had become into a landowner with the dowry of his wealthy wife around  farms were given to groups of peasants who organized themselves in cooperatives in march   acres of united fruit companys uncultivated land was taken by the government which offered compensation of  the company wanted  million for the land while the guatemalan government valued  per acre the american government valued it at  per acre as david mckean has pointed out this figure was “in line with the company’s own valuation of the property at least for tax purposes” however the company wanted  million for the land while the guatemalan government valued it at  per acre the company now valued it at  per acre corcoran contacted president anastasio somoza and warned him that the guatemalan revolution might spread to nicaragua somoza now made representations to harry s truman about what was happening in guatemala after discussions with walter bedell smith director of the cia a secret plan to overthrow arbenz operation fortune was developed part of this plan involved tommy corcoran arranging for small arms and ammunition to be loaded on a united fruit freighter and shipped to guatemala where the weapons would be distributed to dissidents when the secretary of state dean acheson discovered details of operation fortune he had a meeting with truman where he vigorously protested about the involvement of united fruit and the cia in the attempted overthrow of the democratically elected president jacobo arbenz as a result of acheson’s protests truman ordered the postponement of operation fortune tommy corcoran’s work was made easier by the election of dwight eisenhower in november  eisenhower’s personal secretary was anne whitman the wife of edmund whitman united fruit’s public relations director eisenhower appointed john peurifoy as ambassador to guatemala he soon made it clear that he believed that the arbenz government posed a threat to the america’s campaign against communism corcoran also arranged for whiting willauer his friend and partner in civil air transport to become us ambassador to honduras as willauer pointed out in a letter to claire lee chennault he worked day and night to arrange training sites and instructors plus air crews for the rebel air force and to keep the honduran government “in line so they would allow the revolutionary activity to continue” eisenhower also replaced dean acheson with john foster dulles his brother allen dulles became director of the cia the dulles brothers “had sat on the board of united fruit’s partner in the banana monopoly the schroder banking corporation” whereas “un ambassador henry cabot lodge was a stockholder and had been a strong defender of united fruit while a us senator” walter bedell smith was moved to the state department smith told corcoran he would do all he could to help in the overthrow of arbenz he added that he would like to work for united fruit once he retired from government office this request was granted and bedell smith was later to become a director of united fruit according to john prados the author of the presidents secret war corcoran’s meeting with “undersecretary of state walter bedell smith that summer and that conversation is recalled by cia officers as the clear starting point of that plan” evan thomas the author of the very best me daring early years of the cia  has added that “with his usual energy and skill corcoran beseeched the u s government to overthrow arbenz” the new cia plan to overthrow jacobo arbenz was called “operation success” allen dulles became the executive agent and arranged for tracey barnes and richard bissell to plan and execute the operation bissell later claimed that he had been aware of the problem since reading a document published by the state department that claimed “the communists already exercise in guatemala a political influence far out of proportion to their small numerical strength this influence will probably continue to grow during  the political situation in guatemala adversely effects u s interests and constitutes a potential threat to us security” bissell does not point out that the source of this information was tommy corcoran and the united fruit company john prados argues that it was barnes and bissell who “coordinated the washington end of the planning and logistics for the guatemala operation” as deputy director for plans it was frank wisner’s responsibility to select the field commander for operation success kim roosevelt was first choice but he turned it down and instead the job went to albert hanley the cia station chief in korea hanley was told to report to joseph caldwell king director of the cia’s western hemisphere division king had previously worked for the fbi where he had responsibility for all intelligence operations in latin america king suggested hanley meet tommy corcoran hanley did not like the idea king replied “if you think you can run this operation without united fruit you’re crazy” although hanley refused to work with corcoran allen dulles kept him fully informed of the latest developments in planning the overthrow of arbenz tracey barnes brought in david atlee phillips to run a “black” propaganda radio station according to phillips he was reluctant to take part in the overthrow of a democratically elected president barnes replied “it’s not a question of arbenz nor of guatemala we have solid intelligence that the soviets intended to throw substantial support to arbenz… guatemala is bordered by honduras british honduras salvador and mexico it’s unacceptable to have a commie running guatemala” barnes also appointed e howard hunt as chief of political action in his autobiography undercover  hunt claims that “barnes swore me to special secrecy and revealed that the national security council under eisenhower and vice president nixon had ordered the overthrow of guatemala’s communist regime” hunt was not convinced by this explanation he pointed out that  months previously he had suggested to the director of the cia that arbenz needed to be dealt with however the idea had been rejected hunt was now told that “ washington lawyer thomas g corcoran had among his clients the united fruit company united fruit like many american corporations in guatemala had watched with growing dismay nationalization confiscation and other strong measures affecting their foreign holdings finally a landreform edict issued by arbenz proved the final straw and tommy the cork had begun lobbying in behalf of united fruit and against arbenz following this special impetus our project had been approved by the national security council and was already under way” albert hanley brought in rip robertson to take charge of the paramilitary side of the operation robertson had been hanley’s deputy in korea and had “enjoyed going along on the behindthelines missions with the cia guerrillas in violation of standing orders from washington” one of those who worked with robertson in operation success was david morales also in the team was henry hecksher who operated under cover in guatemala to supply frontline reports john foster dulles decided that he “needed a civilian adviser to the state department team to help expediate operation success dulles chose a friend of corcoran’s william pawley a miamibased millionaire” david mckean goes on to point out that pawley had worked with corcoran chennault and willauer in helping to set up the flying tigers and in transforming civil air transport into a cia airline mckean adds that his most important qualification for the job was his “long association with rightwing latin america dictators” the rebel “liberation army” was formed and trained in nicaragua this was not a problem as president anastasio somoza and been warning the united states government since  that that the guatemalan revolution might spread to nicaragua the rebel army of  men were trained by rip robertson their commander was a disaffected guatemalan army officer carlos castillo armas it was clear that a  man army was unlikely to be able to overthrow the guatemalan government tracey barnes believed that if the rebels could gain control of the skies and bomb guatemala city they could create panic and arbenz might be fooled into accepting defeat according to richard bissell somoza was willing to provide cover for this covert operation however this was on the understanding that these aircraft would be provided by the united states dwight eisenhower agreed to supply somoza with a “small pirate air force to bomb arbenz into submission” to fly these planes the cia recruited american mercenaries like jerry delarm before the bombing of guatemala city the rebel army was moved to honduras where tommy corcoran’s business partner whiting willauer was ambassador the plan was for them to pretend to be the “vanguard of a much larger army seeking to liberate their homeland from the marxists” arbenz became aware of this cia plot to overthrow him guatemalan police made several arrests in his memoirs eisenhower described these arrests as a “reign of terror” and falsely claimed that “agents of international communism in guatemala continued their efforts to penetrate and subvert their neighboring central american states using consular agents for their political purposes and fomenting political assassinations and strikes sydney gruson of the new york times began to investigate this story journalists working for time magazine also tried to write about these attempts to destabilize arbenz’s government frank wisner head of operation mockingbird asked allen dulles to make sure that the american public never discovered the plot to overthrow arbenz arthur hays sulzberger the publisher of the new york times agreed to stop gruson from writing the story henry luce was also willing to arrange for the time magazine reports to be rewritten at the editorial offices in new york the cia propaganda campaign included the distribution of  copies of a pamphlet entitled chronology of communism in guatemala  they also produced three films on guatemala for showing free in cinemas faked photographs were distributed that claimed to show the mutilated bodies of opponents of arbenz david atlee phillips and e howard hunt were responsible for running the cias voice of liberation radio station broadcasts began on  st may  they also arranged for the distribution of posters and pamphlets over  articles based on information provided by the cia were placed in newspapers and magazines by the united states information agency the voice of liberation reported massive defections from arbenz’s army according to david atlee phillips the radio station “broadcast that two columns of rebel soldiers were converging on guatemala city in fact castillo armas and his makeshift army were still encamped six miles inside the border far from the capital” as phillips later admitted the “highways were crowded but with frightened citizens fleeing guatemala city and not with soldiers approaching it” as e howard hunt pointed out “our powerful transmitter overrode the guatemalan national radio broadcasting messages to confuse and divide the population from its military overlords” there was no popular uprising on  th june the cia reported to dwight eisenhower that castillo armas had not been able to take his assigned objective zacapa his seaborne force had also failed to capture puerto barrios according to john prados it all now depended on “whiting willauer’s rebel air force” however that was not going to plan and on th june winston churchill the british prime minister berated eisenhower when a cia plane sank a british merchant vessel heading for guatemala the bombing had been ordered by rip robertson without first gaining permission from the cia or eisenhower robertson had been convinced that the springfjord was a “czech arms carrying freighter” in reality it had been carrying only coffee and cotton frank wisner had to make a personal apology for the incident and the cia later quietly reimbursed lloyd’s of london insurers of the springfjord  the  million they had paid out on the ship arbenz had been convinced by the voice of liberation reports that his army was deserting richard bissell believes that this is when arbenz made his main mistake jacobo arbenz decided to distribute weapons to the “people’s organizations and the political parties” as bissell later explained “the conservative men who constituted the leadership of guatemala’s army viewed this action as the final unacceptable leftward lurch and they told arbenz they would no longer support him he resigned and fled to mexico”president harry truman became highly suspicious of corcorans activities and he arranged for fbi director j edgar hoover to place a tap on his phone despite his shady business dealings he was never convicted of a criminal offence thomas corcoran died on th december  assassination of john f kennedy encyclopedia primary sources  robert dallek lone star rising lyndon johnson and his times  by the middle of  fdr worried that deficit spending was leading to high inflation believed that the government needed to curb its outlays ickes who had jurisdiction over the pwa feared that money allocated to texas dams would line the pockets of builders overcharging the government in the summer of  however johnson persuaded the white house to commit another  million to the marshall ford dam a third of the additional  million promised in  the prospect of throwing some  men out of work and of halting construction on a project that would ultimately save texas millions of dollars in flood damages played a large part in the decision unless the marshall ford construction was continued an lcra memo warned  percent of the  men on the job would be fired and floods like one in june  costing over  million would continue to plague southcentral texas on july  in a ceremony at the white house james roosevelt the presidents son and secretary handed johnson who was accompanied by wirtz and members of the lcra board the presidents order granting the  million joking with the delegation jimmy roosevelt said that johnson had kept him busy so much of the time on the texas project that he will have to catch up on his sleep now the president is happy to do this for your congressman  jimmy added in response to repeated prodding by johnson the administration provided another  million over the next four years to complete the network of texas dams the expenditure paid handsome dividends in lower unemployment flood prevention and more abundant and cheaper electric power the dambuilding also served lyndons political interests and the wellbeing of brown  root a construction company in austin controlled by george and herman brown with lyndons help they won government contracts that turned a small roadbuilding firm into a multimillion dollar business their success gave lyndon a financial angel that could help secure his political future as tommy corcoran put it later a young guy might be as wise as solomon as winning as will rogers and as popular as santa claus but if he didnt have a firm financial base his opponents could squeeze him when roosevelt told me to take care of the boy corcoran added that meant to watch out for his financial backers too in lyndons case there was just this little road building firm brown and root run by a pair of germans  robert a caro lyndon johnson master of the senate  jenkins wrote warren woodward on january  ed clark tells me that he has received some assistance from h e butt i wonder if you could go by and pick it up and put it with the other we put away before i left texas clark says that browns money was for the presidential run for which johnson was gearing up that january and that butts was for johnson to contribute to the campaigns of other senators but that often he and the other men providing johnson with funds werent even sure which of these two purposes the funding were for how could you know ed clark was to say if johnson wanted to give some senator money for some campaign johnson would pass the word to give money to me or jesse kellam or cliff carter and it would find its way into johnsons hands and it would be the same if he wanted money for his own campaign and a lot of the money that was given to johnson both for other candidates and for himself was in cash all we knew was that lyndon asked for it and we gave it tommy corcoran was to say this atmosphere would pervade lyndon johnsons fundraising all during his years in the senate he would pass the word  often by telephoning sometimes by having jenkins telephone  to brown or dark or connally and the cash would be collected down in texas and flown to washington or a johnson was in austin would be delivered to him there when word was received that some was available john connally recalls he would board a plane in fort worth or dallas and id go get it or walter would get it woody would go get it we had a lot of people who would go get it and deliver it the idea that walter or woody or wilton woods would skim some is ridiculous we had couriers or dark says if george or me were going up anyway wed take it ourselves and tommy corcoran was often bringing johnson cash from new york unions mostly as contributions to liberal senators whom the unions wanted to support asked how he knew that the money found its way into johnsons hands clark laughed and said because sometimes i gave it to him it would be in an envelope both clark and wild said that johnson wanted the contributions given outside the office to either jenkins or bobby baker or to another johnson aide cliff carter but neither wild nor clark trusted either baker or carter  jake esterline was interviewed by jack pfeiffer on th november  jack pfeiffer i have a question and it is what was pawleys relation to this whole operation and your relation with pawley seems to have been quite close too jake esterline i think it was a hangover relationship from the things that bill pawley had done as quite a wheel with a number of very senior people during the guatemalan operation  that they felt that bill who had been very closely tied into cuba  that he was a very prominent man in florida that there were a lot of things that he might be able to do in the sense of getting things lined up in florida for us and also his ties with nixon and with other republican politicos i used to deal with him quite a bit before from my point of view we never let bill pawley know any of the intimacies about our operations or what we were doing he never knew where our bases were or things of that sort he never knew anything specific about our operations but he was doing an awful lot of things on his own with the exiles some of the people that he had known in cuba in the sugar business etc i guess he actually was instrumental in running boats and things in and out of cuba getting people out and what not and a variety of things that were not connected with us in any way he was a political factor from the standpoint from jcs standpoint i dont know whether tommy corcoran entered in at this point i think tommy corcoran was strictly in guatemala i guess corcoran didnt come into this thing at least not very much jack pfeiffer his name turns up once or twice jake esterline yes i met him once in connection with cuba but i dont remember who for jc king but i dont remember why at this point it wasnt anything of any significance my feeling with pawley he was such a hawk and he was every second week he wanted to kill somebody inside  it was from my standpoint  we were trying to keep him from doing things to cause problems for us this was almost a standing operation jack pfeiffer this is what i was wondering because tracy barnes i know on a number of occasions seemed to make it quite clear that what the agency had to be careful of was getting hung with a reactionary label and then at the same time that was going on here is all of this conversation back and forth with pawley and his visits jake esterline really to keep him from doing something to upset the applecart from our standpoint in that sense i did fill that role in part for a long time and the net result of the thing is that bill thinks i am a dangerous leftist today if i hadnt been a foot dragger or hadnt taken all these dissenting opinions of this things in cuba would have been a lot better jack pfeiffer was pawley actually involved in the covert operation in guatemala jake esterline yes he well i am sure he was in a jack pfeiffer i mean with you as far as you jake esterline not i personally but he was involved with state department i said rubottom a couple of times i didnt mean rubottom i meant rusk he was involved  especially in guatemala with rubottom or whoever secretary of state was and seville sacassaa and somoza and whoever secretary of defense was in getting the planes from the defense dept having them painted over the decals painted over and flown to nicaragua where they became the defense force for that operation jack pfeiffer i ran across some comment that he had made to livingston merchant jake esterline they were good friends and knew each other but to my knowledge he never had any involvement like that during the bay of pigs days although youd have to ask ted shackley about what they did later because i think he ran some things into cuba for ted shackley jack pfeiffer that is beyond my period of interest he was involved in a great amount of fund raising activity in the new york area apparently  pushing or raising funds in the new york area  wasnt droller involved in this too what was your relation with droller were you directing drollers activities or was dave phillips running droller jake esterline oh i sort of ran droller except i never knew what tracy barnes was going to do next when i turned my back droller was suchan ambitious fellow trying to run in trying to run circles around everybody for his own aggrandizement that you never knew but droller would never have had any continuing contact with pawley because they had met only once and i recall pawley saying that he never wanted to talk to that you know what again he was very unhappy that somebody like gerry he just didnt like gerrys looks he didnt like his accent he was very unfair about gerry and i dont mean to be unfair about gerry  the only thing is that gerry was insanely ambitious he was his own worst enemy that was all we just didnt think that tracy really understood it that well or if tracy did he coudnt articulate he wouldnt articulate it that well tracy was one of the sweetest guys that ever lived but he coudnt ever draw a straight line between two points jack pfeiffer what about jfk jake esterline jfk was an uninitiated fellow who had been in the wars but he hadnt been exposed to any world politics or crises yet if he had something else as a warm up he might have made different decisions than he made at that time i think he was kind of a victim of the thing i blame nixon far more than i do kennedy for the equivocations and the loss of time and what not that led to the ultimate disaster goodwin i just thought was a sleazy little selfseeker who i didnt feel safe with any secret his consorting with che guevara in montevideo had rather upset me at the time jack pfeiffer how about mcnamara did you get involved with him at all jake esterline no jack pfeiffer bobby kennedy jake esterline i wouldnt even tell you off tape i didnt like him hes dead god rest his soul  ray s cline secrets spies and scholars blueprint of the essential cia  thomas g tommy corcoran washingtons durable political lawyer and an early new deal braintruster from harvard law school says that his greatest contribution to government in his long career was helping infiltrate smart young harvard law school products into every agency of government he felt the united states needed to develop a highly educated highly motivated public service corps that had not existed before roosevelts time donovan did much the same for career experts in international affairs by collecting in one place a galaxy of experience and ability the likes of which even the state department had never seen many of these later drifted away but a core remained to create a tradition and eventually to take key jobs in a mature intelligence system of the kind the united states required for coping with twentieth century problems  david mckean peddling influence  corcoran ever the loyal soldier to roosevelt agreed to help and visited his old friends in the senate including senators burton wheeler of montana worth clark of montana and robert la follette of wisconsin a few weeks later corcoran reported to the president that while these men were opposed to involvement in europe he did not believe that a modest aid program to china would cause them serious concern after evaluating corcorans optimistic assessment roosevelt conveyed to him again through lauchlin currie that he wanted to establish a private corporation to provide assistance to the chinese corcoran thought the presidents idea was ingenious and later wrote that if wed tried to set up a government corporation per se or do the work out of a federal office there would have been devil to pay on the hill instead corcoran set up a civilian corporation which he chartered in delaware and at the suggestion of the president named china defense supplies it would be as corcoran later recalled the entire lend lease operation for asia in order to provide the company with the stamp of respectability roosevelt arranged for his elderly uncle frederick delano whod spent a lifetime in the china trade to be cochairman the other chairman was t v soong chiangs personal representative who frequently visited washington to lobby for aid to his government soong a harvard graduate was also chiangs finance minister as well as his banker and his brotherinlaw and he was a close friend of david corcoran whom he had met when the younger corcoran was working in the far east after getting the green light to proceed with the establishment of china defense supplies corcoran hired a staff to run the company with delano and soong as the chairmen corcoran went about appointing a politically savvy management team first he asked his brother david to take a leave of absence from sterling to become president although david corcoran was an extremely competent manager sterling was then under investigation by the department of justice and davids appointment could be cynically viewed as an attempt by tommy to protect his brother from the investigation by shielding him with a quasigovernment role next he appointed a bright young lawyer named bill youngman as general counsel youngman had previously clerked for judge learned hand and after ben cohen recommended him he landed a job as general counsel at the federal power commission to direct the program from china corcoran chose whitey willauer who had been his brother howards roommate at exeter princeton and harvard law school corcoran had previously helped willauer get a job at the federal aviation administration and he knew willauer was crazy about china after helping to establish and run china defense supplies willauer moved over to the foreign economic administration where he supervised both lendlease to china and purchases from china lastly corcoran arranged for the marine corps to detail quinn shaughnessy who like corcoran was a graduate of harvard law school shaughnessy was given the task of locating and acquiring goods supplies and weapons for the chinese corcoran took no title himself other than outside counsel for china defense supplies he paid himself five thousand dollars to set up the company but didnt want his affiliation with it to interfere with his incipient lobbying practice  william e leuchtenburg franklin d roosevelt and the new deal  the shy modest cohen a jew from muncie indiana was a former brandeis law clerk who had developed into a brilliant legislative draftsman corcoran an irishman from a rhode island mill town had gone from harvard law school to washington in  to serve as secretary to mr justice holmes holmes found him quite noisy quite satisfactory and quite noisy roosevelt had discovered corcoran and cohen who had teamed up to draft wall street regulatory legislation to be remarkably resourceful in resolving knotty governmental problems and by the spring of  the boys as frankfurter called them were playing key roles in the new deal corcoran was a new political type the expert who not only drafted legislation but maneuvered it through the treacherous corridors of capitol hill two washington reporters wrote of him he could play the accordion sing any song you cared to mention read aeschylus in the original quote dante and montaigne by the yard tell an excellent story write a great bill like the securities exchange act prepare a presidential speech tread the labyrinthine maze of palace politics or chart the future course of a democracy with equal ease he lived with cohen and five other new dealers in a house on r street as early as the spring of  gop congressmen were learning to ignore the sponsors of new deal legislation and level their attacks at the scarletfever boys from the little red house in georgetown in the first two years of the new deal the brandeisians chafed as the nra advocates sat at the presidents right hand they rejoiced only in the tva since it both checked monopoly and accentuated decentralization and in the regulation of securities issues and the stock market which marked the success of brandeis earlier crusade against the money power not until  did the brandeisians make their way that year saw the triumph of the decentralizers in the fight over the social security bill and the enhanced power in tva of frankfurters follower david lilienthal brandeis himself had a direct hand in the most important victory of all the invalidation of the nra  david mckean peddling influence  corcoran had only been out of the government for a short time but he was running the asian lendlease program and working to defend against both the justice department inquiry and a potential congressional investigation into sterling pharmaceutical corcoran assembled a defense team led by john cahill his former classmate at harvard law school and an associate of his at cotton and franklin cahill was the us attorney in new york and not coincidentally had been working with thurman arnold the assistant attorney general for antitrust matters supervising the department of justices inquiry into sterling at corcorans urging cahill resigned his post on february   to enter private practice there were no laws prohibiting him from representing a client in a case on which he had been working and notwithstanding a clear conflict of interest cahill immediately began representing sterling pharmaceutical now that he had help on the sterling case corcoran began to take on new business his first major client was henry j kaiser a west coast businessman who had made a fortune from government contracts primarily in helping build the boulder and shasta dams corcoran had first met kaiser when corcoran was an attorney at the rfc and he harold ickes and david lilienthal established the bonneville power administration now as the country prepared for war kaiser recognized that the governments procurement program offered many exceptional business opportunities kaiser needed to know the people in washington who were making the decisions and he called on tommy corcoran for assistance corcoran was able to open doors for kaiser all over town at the white house corcoran introduced him to several people including lauchlin currie at the federal reserve corcoran arranged a meeting with the chairman marriner eccles who had been introduced to kaiser several years earlier when eccles was a construction magnate in utah corcoran later boasted that through his contacts at the interior department he denied the bonneville power administration to alcoa the giant aluminum company and helped secure it for kaiser corcoran also helped at the war department where he introduced kaiser to william knudsen the former chief executive of general motors who had been appointed at the end of  to command the office of production management to coordinate defense preparations over the course of the next few years kaiser arranged for  million in building contracts at his ten shipyards eight of which were located on the west coast he netted a profit on each ship of between  to  and made millions with his assembly methods he pioneered group medicine at his companies creating what eventually became kaiser permanente a precursor to todays health maintenance organizations  david mckean peddling influence  in late  johnson approached e g kingsbery an ultraconservative austin businessman who owned a half interest in ktbc kingsbery had opposed johnsons candidacy but after the congressman helped kingsberys son gain admission to the us naval academy at annapolis the businessman was indebted to him johnson told kingsbery im not a newspaperman not a lawyer and i might get beat sometime i did have a secondclass teachers certificate but its expired and i want to get into some business impressed by johnsons energy and initiative kingsbery told johnson that he wanted to pay his obligation to him and simply gave him his halfinterest option the option to buy the other half was owned by the wesley west family who had extensive holdings in the oil industry and owned the austin daily tribune a conservative daily just a day or two before christmas johnson traveled to plano county to work out a deal with wesley west at his ranch johnson charmed the older man who later recalled i didnt like lyndon johnson but said after meeting him hes a pretty good fellow i believe ill sell it to him with the two halfinterest options johnson had only one more obstacle to overcome in his purchase of the station  approval from the federal communications commission to help navigate the process johnson called tommy corcoran when corcoran left government and had been looking for clients johnson made sure that he was placed on retainer by the houston contracting firm of brown and root owned by george and herman brown who had financed lyndons previous campaigns corcoran had been paid as much as fifteen thousand dollars for advice conferences and negotiations related to shipbuilding contracts now it was johnson looking to corcoran to help him with a business proposition corcoran did not disappoint as corcoran later told johnsons biographer robert caro i helped out all up and down the line corcoran had an important contact at the fcc james fly the chairman of the commission had been his classmate at harvard law school and owed his appointment in good measure to corcoran justice frank murphy later told felix frankfurter that he had helped get fly the position as a favor to tommy corcoran according to murphy it was at toms request that i gave the former chairman a ten thousand dollar a year job so as to create a vacancy into which fly was placed  david mckean peddling influence  as planning for the us plot progressed corcoran and other top officials at united fruit became anxious about identifying a future leader who would establish favorable relations between the government and the company secretary of state dulles moved to add acivilian adviser to the state department team to help expedite operation success dulles chose a friend of corcorans william pawley a miamibased millionaire who along with corcoran chennault and willauer had helped set up the flying tigers in the early ros and then helped several years later to transform it into the cias airline civil air transport besides his association with corcoran pawleys most important qualification for the job was that he had a long history of association with rightwing latin american dictators cia director dulles had grown disillusioned with j c king and asked colonel albert haney the cia station chief in korea to be the us field commander for the operation haney enthusiastically accepted although he was apparently unaware of the role that the united fruit company had played in his selection haney had been a colleague of kings and though king was no longer directing the operation he remained a member of the agency planning team he suggested that haney meet with tom corcoran to see about arming the insurgency force with the weapons that had been mothballed in a new york warehouse after the failed operation fortune when the supremely confident haney said he didnt need any help from a washington lawyer king rebuked him if you think you can run this operation without united fruit youre crazy the close working relationship between the cia and united fruit was perhaps best epitomized by allen dulless encouragement to the company to help select an expedition commander for the planned invasion after the cias first choice was vetoed by the state department united fruit proposed corcova cerna a guatemalan lawyer and coffee grower cerna had long worked for the company as a paid legal adviser and even though corcoran referred to him as a liberal he believed that cerna would not interfere with the companys land holdings and operations after cerna was hospitalized with throat cancer a third candidate colonel carlos castillo armas emerged as the compromise choice according to united fruits thomas mccann when the central intelligence agency finally launched operation success in late june  united fruit was involved at every level from neighboring honduras ambassador willauer corcorans former business partner directed bombing raids on guatemala city mccann was told that the cia even shipped down the weapons used in the uprising in united fruit boats on june   colonel armas ousted the arbenz government and ordered the arrest of all communist leaders in guatemala while the coup was successful a dark chapter was opened in american support for right wing military dictators in central america  david mckean peddling influence  in february  the new york times reported that while senator johnson stubbornly contends that he has no plans or expectations of becoming a candidate several aides including corcoran were working for him behind the scenes the article quoted corcoran as suggesting that he was used for the testing of new ideas three months earlier corcorans good friend the seventyeightyear old speaker of the house sam rayburn had returned to his home state of texas to announce the formation of an unofficial johnson for president campaign rayburns announcement followed that of senator john f kennedy who had declared his candidacy for the presidency in the senate caucus room a month earlier and senator hubert humphrey who had tossed his hat into the ring at the beginning of the new year sensing that he had a greater name recognition than any of the declared candidates and desperately seeking vindication after two stinging previous defeats adali stevenson allowed others to present his case senator stuart symington had decided to wait in the wings hoping that in a deadlocked convention he would become the consensus alternative corcoran was one of a number of prominent new dealerera luminaries including eliot janeway dean acheson and william o douglas who were supporting lyndon johnson presidential chronicler theodore white later called the group a loose and highly ineffective coalition which was not entirely fair since it did manage to raise nearly  for johnsons undeclared candidacy lbj himself decided not to campaign actively as majority leader he believed he couldnt neglect his senate duties to mount a fullscale campaign  david mckean peddling influence  in late  however corcoran was preoccupied with a political scandal only weeks after johnson was sworn in as president bobby baker got into trouble for fraud and tax evasion baker had been lbjs closest aide and most important adviser in the senate he and corcoran had known each other for many years and although never close friends their mutual respect for lyndon johnson and the fact that they were both political operators meant that they saw one another often tommy had actually helped baker buy his house in the affluent section of washington known as spring valley corcoran had learned that baker and his wife who was expecting their third child were looking for a larger home at the time tommy was representing tenneco and he knew that a house under construction  originally intended for one of the companys vice presidents who had been recalled to texas  was slated to go on the market for  baker was encouraged to put in a bid of  which was accepted although baker never recalled doing any special favor for corcoran in return tommy always knew that he was owed one in january  baker was indicted by the us attorney in washington for tax evasion the former capitol hill aide sought out john lane whom he had known in the senate and who by now had established a small but highly regarded law practice lane did not have a whitecollar defense practice but he knew that tommy corcorans brother howard practiced in new york with boris kostelanitz a respected attorney who had handled several criminal tax cases lane and baker went to see corcoran in his office as they sat and talked on corcorans leather couch corcorans secretary came in and told baker that attorney general robert kennedy was on the telephone kennedy wanted to assure baker that he had not personally ordered the case against him and that his knowledge of the case came only from newspaper clippings baker retained kostelanitz to defend him on the charges of tax evasion and retained edward bennett williams the renowned criminal lawyer as his counsel the case was assigned to judge oliver gasch of the district court after several judges reportedly rejected it because they personally knew baker ironically gasch a close friend of howard corcorans owed his appointment to tommy corcoran but much to bakers chagrin corcoran didnt intercede on his behalf probably because lyndon johnson never asked him the president according to one lawyer close to the case didnt want to touch baker with a ten foot pole spartacus ebooks related readingpeddling influence american history spartacus

brief joseph dirienzo fanwood for respondentcrossappellant dirienzo  wallerstein attorneys  mr dirienzo and james s rehberger on the brief the opinion of the court was delivered byplaintiff thomas corcoran sustained a severe injury to his left eye while using a pair of needle nose pliers sold by defendant sears roebuck corporation and manufactured by western forge   plaintiff sued defendant alleging a manufacturing defect   a jury  found in favor of defendant finding no manufacturing defect   plaintiff appeals and defendant crossappealsplaintiff contends on appeal that the judge erred in   denying plaintiffs motion to introduce into evidence the expert report of martin glickman phd an expert retained but not called by the defense as an adoptive admission   improperly instructing the jury as to the use of circumstantial evidence to prove a manufacturing defect   allowing defendants expert to rely upon inadmissible hearsay concerning the manufacturing and quality control processes in effect at western forge in   and  precluding plaintiffs counsel from crossexamining defendants expert as to federal specifications which were not adopted by defendant as part of its own manufacturing specifications   we find no trial error warranting our intervention and affirm the judgment under review   accordingly we need not address the issues presented in the crossappealthe accident occurred on october   while plaintiff was working in his fathers driveway attempting to replace the rear brakes on his friends station wagon   plaintiff used his fathers tools to perform the brake job   he testified that he used the subject needle nose pliers which he described as being in “good condition” to remove without incident the brake springs from the brake assembly   once the springs were out plaintiff was able to remove the brake shoes   plaintiff then began to replace the brake shoes by reversing the processwhile seated on a tire plaintiff looked to see if the brake spring was aligned with the assembly thereby placing his eye in line with and within inches of the spring   he held the needle nose pliers in his left hand gripped the spring at approximately the pliers eighth serration and pulled the spring from left to right towards his face in an effort to reconnect the spring between the brake shoe and the brake selfadjuster   according to plaintiff at that moment the pliers “broke” causing them to release from the spring and hit him in the left eye plaintiffs father immediately drove plaintiff to the hospital   the emergency admission record indicated  “patient states a pair of needle nose pliers slipped and penetrated his left eyeball”   plaintiff later denied making that statementupon returning home plaintiff retrieved the needle nose pliers which his friend had placed back in plaintiffs fathers tool box and brought the pliers to his bedroom where it remained for approximately one year to eighteen months   plaintiff testified that he was unable to find the inch section of the jaw tip that had broken off the pliersthe pliers involved in this incident was manufactured by western forge in  and sold by defendant under the craftsman brand   defendant admitted that the pliers had “an indefinite life provided ․ it was properly used and cared for”peter elliot plaintiffs expert in the areas of failure analysis metallurgy and forensic engineering testified that the pliers was defective when manufactured   he explained that when he examined the pliers in  inch of one of the jaws from the tip to approximately the third serration of the pliers was missing   he also observed that the pliers was dirty and had “bits of surface rusting and general deterioration”   the fractured surface was covered with corrosion and very little of the original fractured surface was left for examination   he said his finding was consistent with the pliers having been stored in a garagetype environment for approximately eighteen months   elliot testified that the rust corrosion found on the pliers did not have an effect upon the mechanical behavior of the tool or cause the fracture   the corrosion in his opinion occurred after the fracture   elliot also observed that the fractured surface had some “superficial” damage which in his opinion also occurred after the fracture   according to elliot this damage was consistent with wear and tear caused by other tools coming in contact or rubbing against the pliers   he did not observe any evidence of prior abuse of the tool   elliots findings attributed to post fracture occurrences were at odds with plaintiffs testimony that the pliers were isolated and kept in  his room after the accident if as plaintiff contended the pliers broke on the date of the accidentafter observing the pliers elliot removed loose debris and some of the rust   he then cut a small segment off the end of the broken jaw and examined that segment under an electron microscope   he observed a series of small quench cracks and voids   the tip of the unfractured jaw was also removed and examined under the electron microscope   he also found small quench cracks on the unbroken tipelliot explained that quench cracks were caused when metal in this case steel is heated and then quickly cooled   in his opinion the quench cracks were caused by the improper quenching or heat treatment of the pliers   he determined that the surface features of the broken part of the pliers were typical of a brittle fracture or a “a sharp break” with no corresponding evidence of stretching   according to elliot a brittle fracture “occurs without warning” and is “very quick”   it results from “some fault” in the heat treatment of the plierselliot also conducted hardness measurements on the pliers and determined that the tool did not deviate from the american national standard institute “ansi” standards   additionally the metallurgical properties were consistent with good metallurgical standards   he admitted that he had not conducted any tests on the pliers to determine whether the cracks he had discovered were sufficiently deep to cause a brittle fracturein contrast douglas mckittrick an employee of western forge and defendants expert in metallurgy and metallurgical testing testified that the pliers was properly heattreated and did not contain quench cracks or other manufacturing defects   mckittrick first examined the pliers in  after elliot cut off the tips   he observed that the pliers contained surface imperfections that are common in forged tools   he said that the imperfections are not quench cracks did not constitute a manufacturing defect and would not cause the pliers to break as part of mckittricks testimony a slide show was presented to the jury to demonstrate the method by which pliers were manufactured at the time of the trial   according to mckittrick western forge was using the same furnaces at the time of trial that had been used in  when the pliers were manufactured   the furnaces had high temperature thermometers to record the temperature inside the furnace   the pliers were initially heated to  degrees fahrenheit then dropped into oil which quickly cools the steel to  degrees fahrenheit and changes the molecular structure of the steel from austenite to martinsite  “martinsite is the hardest structure that you can form in any steel”as the steel cools it does not contract like most other materials but rather expands   the outside layer of the metal part of the pliers cools and hardens first into a hard outer shell   a quench crack occurs when there is an imperfection in the hard outer layer which allows the cooling inner layer to expand out   mckittrick testified that quench cracks are large not microscopic and follow the grain structure of the steel down towards the center of the metal   according to mckittrick “the last place” you would expect to see a quench crack is across the tip of the jaw of the pliers because that area is relatively thin and would cool down at approximately the same rate   thus quench cracks would usually occur in the thicker part of the toolmckittrick concluded that a ductile fracture occurred in this case   such fractures are not caused by quench cracks but rather by an “overload condition” or “prying” with the tip of the pliers   mckittrick explained that needle nose pliers are not designed for prying   normal use of the pliers would not cause the tip to fracture in such a manner   moreover in his opinion had the pliers been defectively manufactured they would not have lasted ten years before failingadditionally mckittrick agreed with plaintiffs experts opinion that the corrosion that had accumulated over the fractured surface had been formed as a result of exposure to a garagetype environment   however because plaintiff had testified that the pliers had  been stored in his bedroom after the accident mckittrick opined that the fracture and the corrosion must have occurred before the date of the accidentiplaintiff argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to introduce into evidence the expert report of martin glickman phd an expert retained but not called by the defense   plaintiff proposed to offer the report of glickman as an adoptive admission pursuant to njre b because defendant supplied it in reply to an interrogatory and did not expressly state that the report was not an adoptive admission   plaintiff also argues the trial judge erred in denying his application to use glickmans report in his crossexamination of mckittrickadefendant responded to plaintiffs interrogatory  in which plaintiff had requested information regarding defendants experts that it had not “decided which if any persons it expects to call as an expert witness” and reserved “the right to supplement”   subsequently in a letter dated june   defense counsel without referring to any specific interrogatory wrote to plaintiffs counselenclosed please find a copy of the expert report of martin e glickman phd the defendant ․ hereby amends its answers to interrogatories to include this report and name dr glickman as an expert who may be called to testify at the time of trial   i have also orally conferred with dr glickman concerning the presence of quench cracks and he advises that based on his observations he finds no sign of quench cracks and therefore this issue was not included in his reportin his report glickman wrote that the metallurgical structure of the pliers was “fully consistent with the ansi specifications and the observed hardness values measured by the plaintiffs expert”   he concluded that the pliers was “properly heat treated” and the fracture was caused by a reasonably fit man squeezing forcefully on the steel brake spring and pulling the spring against one of the jaws of the pliers   glickman also concluded that the ductile not brittle overload fracture of this pliers tip occurred suddenly and without warning  the user would have had little or no chance to detect the onset of the impending fracture   upon fracturing the pulling force was released suddenly unbalancing the applied forces   the user caught unaware could not adjust the pulling force quickly enough thereby allowing acceleration towards his face of the pliers and his hand and arm   thus the plaintiffs description of the subsequent accident seems entirely consistent with the fracture of the pliers tip and its sequelaeplaintiff requested that he be permitted to refer to glickmans report in his opening statement and informed the court that he intended to offer it into evidence as an adoptive admission   defense counsel maintained that he had informed plaintiff that glickman was withdrawn as an expert   glickman was apparently withdrawn because he had refused to conduct tests on pliers to support his conclusion that the pliers could be broken by squeezing on a hard object and also because mckittrick disagreed with that conclusion the trial judge held that glickmans report was not an adoptive admission   we agree with the trial judge   experts reports are statements but unlike answers to interrogatories are not statements of a party and therefore cannot be treated as an admission simply because a party furnished them in discovery  skibinski v smith  njsuper    ad  appdiv   the reports themselves are hearsay and generally are not admissible  hill v cochran  njsuper    ad  appdiv njre b however provides an exception to the hearsay rule forb a statement offered against a party which is․ a statement whose content the party has adopted by word or conduct or in whose truth the party has manifested belief․an experts report can be admissible as an adoptive admission of a party pursuant to njre b in some instances when the party provides the report in response to specific interrogatories and thus adopts the contents as its admission  ratner v general motors corp  njsuper   n   ad  appdiv  skibinski supra  njsuper at   ad   mehalick v schwartz  njsuper    ad  law divin determining whether the submission of an experts report is an adoptive admission courts have focused on the wording of the interrogatory   for example in skibinski supra this court held that the plaintiffs attachment of the experts report to his answers to interrogatories did not constitute an adoptive admission because the interrogatories propounded by the defendants had merely contained a request for a copy of an experts report   ibid thus we held that a response to that interrogatory did “not produce admissions that can be used to limit the experts testimony at trial”   ibidsimilarly in mehalick v schwartz supra the defendant doctor in a medical malpractice case sought to introduce the plaintiffs expert report in evidence   the court held the report was inadmissible and explained that the interrogatories served by the defendant “simply asked for the names and addresses of expert witnesses the subject matter on which the expert was to testify a summary of the grounds for each opinion and for a copy of the report pursuant to r a”  id at   ad   “the interrogatory as worded did not ask for factual information from plaintiff which was within plaintiffs knowledge as in sallo v sabatino  njsuper    ad  appdiv  but rather asked for the opinion to be given by the expert and as a result cannot be considered as an adoptive admission of plaintiffs”   njsuper at   ad here plaintiff asked for “the substance of the facts and opinions as to which the expert is expected to testify” in interrogatory b and thus if defendant had responded “see attached experts report” to that interrogatory glickmans report would have constituted an adoptive admission  skibinski supra  njsuper at   ad    but defendant never responded to interrogatory  by referring to glickmans report and therefore it did not constitute an adoptive admission there is nothing in defendants correspondence indicating that defendant adopted the contents of glickmans report   moreover there is no indication that defendant submitted that report in response to any specific interrogatoryfor example to question b which asked for the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify or to c which asked for a summary of the basis for each opinion   defendant might have been simply responding to question e which simply asked for copies of all experts reportsif plaintiff wanted to determine whether defendant was adopting glickmans report he could have moved for more specific answers to interrogatories   r    if he had and if defendant had responded to interrogatory  “see my experts report” or answered b using the content of glickmans report the report or answer would have been admissible   plaintiff however did not move to compel defendant to do so  thus the trial judge properly held that the report was inadmissible under the adoptive admission exception to the hearsay rule  njre b  skibinski supra nevertheless plaintiff argues that defendants failure to include a disclaimer that the report was not an adoptive admission in its letter of june   compels the conclusion that defendant was relying upon the report and that it was an adoptive admission   a party may include “an expression that the party does not adopt the report” and such an expression “is a sufficient disclaimer of the report”  serrano v levitsky  njsuper    ad  law div   that is not to say however that the failure to include a disclaimer automatically converts the report to an adoptive admission   plaintiff provides no authority for that proposition and we fail to find a basis for it in the principles that undergird njre b or our case lawbnext plaintiff argues that the trial judge erred in denying his application to use glickmans report in his crossexamination of  mckittrick   during the trial the judge conducted a njre  hearing to determine if mckittrick had relied upon glickmans report in formulating his conclusionsin mckittricks initial report submitted to plaintiff in november  he concluded that there were “no manufacturing or metallurgical defects present in the pliers” and that “the failure of the tool was not associated with a quench crack”   however mckittrick stated that he was “unable to form a final opinion on the cause of failure of the tool in question as several important pieces of information are not available”   he noted that if the portion of the pliers that had been cut could be removed from its plastic casing which it ultimately was then “additional information could be gathered to help in the formation of a final opinion”mckittrick also testified at the hearing that he had received glickmans report at least by june  and admitted that he had reviewed the report and that some of glickmans comments had confirmed his initial opinions   mckittrick testified however that he had not relied upon glickmans report in formulating his conclusions essentially because he disagreed with glickmans conclusion that a reasonably fit man could fracture the tip of the pliers by squeezing on a hard object   mckittrick testified that “my experience using these tools told me that these tools dont fail in that manner”   as such mckittrick testified that he had disagreed with glickmans conclusion that plaintiffs description of the accident was “entirely consistent with the fracture of the pliers tips”   he also disagreed with some of the methodology used by glickman and stated that glickmans assumptions on the strength and hardness of the material used to make the pliers were not consistent with western forges testingafter receiving glickmans report mckittrick performed testing to determine if a person could break the tips of the pliers by squeezing and pulling a spring and found that it could not be done   mckittrick testified that before he had conducted those tests he was of the opinion that the pliers would not fail and it did not the trial judge denied plaintiffs motion to permit him to use glickmans report for purposes of crossexamination   the judge found that mckittrick had not relied upon glickmans report in formulating his opinions and thus it was not admissible to impeach mckittricks credibility   plaintiff was therefore precluded from admitting glickmans report because it was “impermissible hearsay” that is an opinion that could not be tested by crossexamination it is improper to crossexamine a witness about inadmissible hearsay documents upon which the expert has not relied in forming his opinion  state v pennington  nj    ad   overruled on other grounds by state v brunson  nj   ad     because the trial judges finding that mckittrick did not rely upon glickmans report in forming his conclusion was supported by the evidence taken at the njre  hearing the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in precluding plaintiff from crossexamining mckittrick on the contents of glickmans reportin an analogous case crispin v volkswagenwerk ag  njsuper    ad  appdiv certif denied  nj   ad   we held that the trial judge did not err in precluding the defense attorney from questioning the plaintiffs expert in a products liability case concerning conclusions reached in a government agencys report   the court found that although plaintiffs expert had supervised the product testing described in the report while he was employed by the agency “he did not participate in the preparation of the ‘conclusions and ‘final observations of the ․ report”  id at   ad    additionally the report was released to the public after the expert had left the agency the expert “was not aware of the fact that the report had been issued and the expert disagreed strenuously with the conclusions contained in the document”  id at   ad even if we were to conclude that mckittrick had relied upon glickmans opinion in formulating his conclusions reversal is not  warranted because plaintiff cannot show prejudice   r    it must be remembered that glickman stated in his report that the pliers had been properly heattreated complied with ansi hardness specifications and did not contain quench cracks   thus glickmans conclusions were contrary to plaintiffs experts conclusions and did not support plaintiffs theory that the pliers had been improperly manufactured   while glickmans conclusion that a reasonably fit person could break the pliers by pulling on them and “the plaintiffs description of the subsequent accident seems entirely consistent with the fracture of the pliers tip” to support a design defect theory that theory was not presented by plaintiff in this case   thus the evidence was irrelevant as to plaintiffs liability theoryiiplaintiff argues as plain error that the trial judges charge on the use of circumstantial evidence to prove a manufacturing defect was erroneous and confusingduring the charge conference the trial judge stated that he intended to charge the jury in accord with model jury charge civil § c  entitled “manufacturing defect” which provides as followsa manufacturing defect may be established by proof that as a result of a defect or flaw which happened during production or while in defendants control the product failed to perform safelyyou must decide what the condition of the product as planned should have been according to defendants design specifications or performance standards and what its condition was as it was made   if you find there is no difference between the two conditions then you cannot say there was a manufacturing defect   if there was a difference you must decide if that difference made the product not reasonably safe for its intended or reasonably foreseeable uses   if the answer is “yes” then you have found the product to be defective   plaintiff need not prove that defendant knew of the defect nor that defendant caused the defect to occurin judging whether there was a manufacturing defect in the product this may be shown to you by the plaintiff in one of three ways   first of all it may be demonstrated by direct evidence such as a defective part   secondly you may infer that there was a defect by reasoning from the circumstances and facts shown   third if you find from the evidence that there is no other cause for the accident other than a manufacturing defect you may find a defect existed defendant objected to the charge on the ground that plaintiff had failed to present any evidence from which the jury could infer that there was a defect   plaintiff however did not object to the charge   the trial judge overruled defendants objection   the judges charge was substantially similar to model jury charge civil § c supra and was also substantially in accord with plaintiffs request to chargeplaintiff now argues that the judges charge was confusing because the jury “might have believed that plaintiff had to prove that there existed a specific difference or defect from the design specification or performance standards in order to find a manufacturing defect”   plaintiff contends the trial judge should have “told the jury in the alternative if the plaintiff could not or did not prove a specific defect they could infer from circumstantial evidence that there was a defect”it is fair to infer from plaintiffs failure to object to the charge that in the context of the trial any confusion created by the instruction which went unnoticed by skilled counsel was equally insignificant from the jurys perspective  state v macon  nj    ad    graves v church  dwight co  njsuper    ad  appdiv certif denied  nj   ad     nevertheless some discussion is warranted to determine whether there was plain error that is error “clearly capable of producing an unjust result”   r  “in a products liability case the injured plaintiff is not required to prove a specific manufacturers defect”  moraca v ford motor co  nj    ad    accord consalo v general motors  njsuper    ad  appdiv explaining that an “inability to prove a defect by direct evidence is not fatal to a plaintiffs case” certif denied  nj   ad    “if the proofs permit an inference that the accident was caused by some defect whether identifiable or not a jury issue as to liability is presented”  moraca supra  nj at   ad  thus where direct evidence is unavailable “a plaintiff may prove a defect either by circumstantial evidence which would permit an inference that a dangerous and defective condition existed prior to sale or by negating other causes in order to make it reasonable to infer that a dangerous condition existed while defendant had control of the product”   consalo supra  njsuper at   ad  citing suter v san angelo foundry  mach co  nj    ad     “additional circumstantial evidence such as proof of proper use handling or operation of the product and the nature of the malfunction may be enough to satisfy the requirement that something was wrong with it”  scanlon v general motors corp  nj    ad   the trial judge correctly charged the jury that it could “infer that there was a defect by reasoning from the circumstances and facts shown”   contrary to plaintiffs representation the judge did not charge the jury that “plaintiff must establish a specific defect” although a manufacturing defect can be established by direct evidence and plaintiff attempted to prove as muchthe trial judge charged the jury substantially in accord with the model charge to the effect that plaintiff could establish a manufacturing defect “in one of three ways  first of all it may be demonstrated by direct evidence such as a defective part  secondly you may infer that there was a defect from the circumstances and facts shown  third if you find from the evidence that there is no cause for the accident other than a manufacturing defect you may find a defect existed”   in our view the instructions gave plaintiff more than the facts warrantediiiplaintiff argues that the trial judge erred in allowing mckittrick to testify as to the manufacturing and quality control processes in effect in  because such testimony was based upon inadmissible hearsay mckittrick admitted that he had been employed at western forge only since  while the pliers involved in this case were manufactured in    he admitted that there were no written records describing the quality assurance procedures utilized in  nor were there any records to show whether the batch from which the subject pliers came were testedin the absence of written documents mckittrick derived his knowledge from talking to people who had worked for western forge in    he said that it was a “part of his job ․ to know what everyone was doing at western forge”   as such he became “quite familiar with the quality procedures” including hardness testing that was followed in according to mckittrick western forge had been conducting hardness tests on its tools for years and some of its hardness testers dated “back before anybody in the courtroom was ․ born”   he learned through his inquiry that in  the year these pliers were manufactured hardness testing was done on samples from every batch of pliers to determine if they were properly heat treated   if any of the test pliers failed the hardness testing the whole batch was “quarantined”plaintiffs objection to the admission of mckittricks testimony as to the quality control procedures employed by western forge in  on the ground that it was inadmissible hearsay was overruled   on appeal plaintiff contends that the hearsay upon which mckittrick relied in the subject portion of his testimony “should have been excluded as it does not meet or fall within any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule under njre  or njre ”   no other authority is cited in support of plaintiffs argument plaintiff fails to consider the provisions of njre    mckittrick was both an employee of defendant and an expert witness in the case   accordingly as an expert he was permitted to rely upon facts constituting hearsay so long as they are “of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in  forming opinions or inferences upon the subject”  ibid the hearsay statements so considered are not admitted to establish the truth of their contents but to apprise the jury of the basis of the experts opinion  blanks v murphy  njsuper    ad  appdivan expert need not rely solely upon documentary hearsay statements in order to qualify under the rule   it is equally permissible to rely upon “interviews” and “discussions” with persons having relevant knowledge for the formation of an opinion  ryan v kdi sylvan pools inc  nj    ad    state v smith  njsuper    ad  appdiv certif denied  nj   ad     mckittricks conversations with coemployees concerning the production and quality control process in  were in the nature of the “interviews” and “discussions” that were the subject of the foregoing cases   had the objection been focused on njre  at the time of trial the judge would have been alerted to inquire into the issue of whether experts in the field about which the mckittrick was testifying reasonably rely on information of that type   ryan supra  nj at   ad    as the record stands there was no such inquiry because the objection was not properly focused   thus we examine the issue in the context of plain error mckittrick testified that he was employed by western forge in the capacity of a metallurgical engineer and product safety officer   in that capacity he was involved in material selection and “recipes for how our materials sic supposed to be heat treated and annealed”   his duties took him to “the production floor and getting his hands dirty looking at parts”   another function he performs is “to appear in court and talk technically about what we do and explain what we do”   in specific reference to his familiarity with the procedures in use in  mckittrick explained that he learned them “as part of my job” only a part of which is testifying as an expert   in light of the fact that defendants record retention policy was such that actual quality control  records for that period would have been destroyed by the time mckittrick became employed by defendant it is natural that he would seek out this type of information to perform his job description within the company   thus based upon the record we think it is selfevident that the hearsay statements upon which mckittrick relied were of the type anyone in his position would naturally rely upon   the admission of the testimony did not constitute plain error but even if we were to concede error for the purpose of discussion the error was harmless   under the new jersey product liability act a product that causes harm is defective in the manufacturing context if it “deviated from the design specifications formulae or performance standards of the manufacturer”  njsa aca   as we understand the record the engineering prints containing the specifications relevant to the product as it was intended to be manufactured in  were available for review and comparison against the actual pliers that caused plaintiffs injury   as mckittrick testified he did not need the quality control records pertaining to the batch of which the subject pliers was a member to determine whether it met specifications so long as he had the tool and the specifications to compare it against   he was correctthe injurycausing product may be measured against the same product as manufactured according to the manufacturers standards   if the particular product used by the plaintiff fails to conform to those standards or other units of the same kind it is defectiveobrien v muskin corp  nj    ad   even if defendant had the best quality control in the world if the pliers was defective because it deviated from defendants specifications and the defect caused plaintiffs injuries defendant would be liable  id at   ad    that is the essence of strict liability in tortthus we disagree with plaintiffs contention that the hearsay information that mckittrick relayed through his testimony was “at the heart of the case”   rather it was at best a tangential issue and at worst irrelevant   in any event it did not have the capacity  to prejudice plaintiff   the judges instructions to the jury properly focused the jurys attention on the thrust of plaintiffs liability theory and the simple question of whether the product deviated from defendants manufacturing specificationsivplaintiff argues that the trial judge erred in precluding the crossexamination of mckittrick as to federal specifications which were not adopted by defendant as part of its manufacturing specificationsin response to interrogatories propounded by plaintiff defendant stated that it had adopted some sections of the federal specification gggpe published by the general services administration as part of its manufacturing specifications   defendant listed the specific sections it had adoptedduring crossexamination plaintiff attempted to question mckittrick concerning why defendant had not adopted several other sections of those federal specifications in its manufacturing process   defense counsel objected   plaintiffs counsel conceded that defendant was not obligated to adopt or follow any of the gggpe specificationsnevertheless plaintiff wanted to ask mckittrick why defendant had not adopted gggpe §  jaw hardness which provided that “jaws shall show a hardness value of not less than  and not more than  on the rockwell ‘c’ scale when tested as specified in  hardness”  gggpe §  surfaces “all surfaces shall be free from pits nodules burrs cracks and other defects which may adversely affect the performance of the tool   surfaces usually ground or otherwise finished and provided with one of the coatings specified in  coatings shall have a maximum surface roughness of  microinches․  ”  gggpe §§  responsibility for inspection   inspection of materials and components   sampling procedures   testing   hardness  pliers with cutting edges  and  handleload tests   the trial judge held that plaintiff could  not crossexamine mckittrick as to why defendant had not adopted the abovecited specifications because the specifications were only relevant to a design defect case not a manufacturing defect case   we agree much of what we said in our discussion of the previous issue concerning the focus of proofs in a manufacturing defect case apply here as well   the federal specifications adopted by western forge were relevant and properly admitted to establish the manufacturing standards employed by western forge against which the offending product must be compared  njsa aca   in contrast the federal specifications that were not adopted by western forge in its manufacturing process were not relevant to the determination of this action because they were not used by western forge in its own design or performance specifications   thus the only relevant inquiries were what specifications did defendant use in manufacturing these pliers and whether the pliers complied with such specifications   the specifications mentioned above not adopted by defendant were not relevant to that determinationwhether the federal standards were or were not minimal standards whether those standards should have been adopted and whether the failure to adopt them resulted in a product defect would have been relevant in a design defect case   but this was not such a case   plaintiffs expert did not testify that the federal specifications cited by plaintiff should have been adopted by defendant or that the failure to do so resulted in the defect   therefore the trial judge did not err in sustaining defendants objectionaffirmedkeefe jad findlaw career center attorney corporate counsel academic judicial clerk summer
