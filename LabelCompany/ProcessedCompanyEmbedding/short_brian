maybe i should have ordered it in mango but was afraid that it was too colourful maybe i would like it even more without ruffle bottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend    of  customers found this review helpful    lovely dress by g from ottawa area i have long admired brian bailey pieces  but as i definitely do not have a models body i never found any pieces that would work for me but i still watch every one of brians shows on tsc then he introduced this piece and i immediately thought it would work on my body type unfortunately i ordered the wrong size and had to return it it is true to size  but i didnt know that prior to ordering and consequently ordered one size up it was definitely too large fortunately after returning the st one i found the same dress at  the price and in the size i need  yippeethis dress is well made comfortable and just the right amount of something very classy it is not overly fussy and you can breath easy in it i am wellpast the bodyhugging styles that are so popular today and i think they are great on the young with young bodies but no so much for the dare i say mature bodies this dress hits all the right notes minimal jewellery nice shoes maybe some kind of matching shawlscarf and you are ready to go to virtually any occasion i ordered it for an early september wedding and think it will be just fine thank you brian for including styles that mature women can relate to bottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend     too small but nice dress by tsc regular shopper from calgary i am usually a size small but in brian bailey i am a size medium i found out with this dress unfortunatelyi ordered both the black and the olive mango in size small but found too tight in the arms and on my hips and backside so returned both today and ordered a size medium in the other dress same as this one but on final sale previous reviewer mentions the item number to find itthis dress was awesome with the lining helping it skim the body versus cling to the body love the ruffle and the neckline is different but cool both the black and the olive mango were very nice colourshoping my next bb dress in a size medium will do the trickvery nice flattering and elongating fit to this dress bottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend     not good on me by linda from richmond bc from richmond bc this dress arrived in a box wrapped in plastic excellent however the dress does absolutely nothing for me i ordered a large in black  perhaps the medium would have been better the problem for me is the ruffle it hung funny i am rather busty so the dress hung like a sack from the chest down and when i looked at it from the side i looked huge the ruffle stuck out i read the reviews first and they were positive however i noticed in the photos the model was not shown standing sideways probably a reason for that anyway all styles do not work on every body as far as the dress and material go it is a good weight is lined i like the neckline as well one thing i noticed is that right in the front at the v it was reverse stitched not good anyway thats the scoop bottom line no i would not recommend this to a friend
