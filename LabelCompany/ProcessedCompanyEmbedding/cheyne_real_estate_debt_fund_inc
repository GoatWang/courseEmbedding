demand for real estate finance print the cheyne real estate credit holdings fund iii also known as crech iii aims to capitalise on the continuing dislocation of the european real estate debt markets and meet the growing demand for real estate finance   like its predecessors crech i and crech ii the crech iii fund will invest in mainly uk and german real estate opportunities across the debt spectrum and via a range of instruments these include senior loans mezzanine loans equity and special situations workouts   these funds focus on midmarket borrowers constrained by more stringent lending criteria of traditional real estate lenders as well as by the bias among nonbank players for larger ticket loans    “as european banks continue to retreat from real estate lending due to increasing regulatory pressures cheyne is able to step into the void with a viable financing solution for midmarket borrowers who are increasingly recognising the team’s ability to understand complex real estate financing needs and execute creative solutions in a short timeframe” stuart fiertz cofounder of cheyne said    cheyne capital’s real estate debt team is headed by ravi stickney with graham
