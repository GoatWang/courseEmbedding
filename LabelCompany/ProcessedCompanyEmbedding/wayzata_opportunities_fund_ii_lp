pursuant to  usc §§  and  for discharge injunctive relief and attorneys fees and costs the interpleaderdefendants do not oppose bnps motion the only dispute among the parties concerns the source from which the attorneys fees and costs should be paid for the following reasons bnps motion is granted including its request that attorneys fees and costs be paid from the stake background the following is a summary of undisputed facts that are pertinent to the present motion additional background is set forth in the opinion dated december   see bnp paribas v wayzata opportunities fund ii lp no  civ  dlc  wl  sdny dec   the december  opinion in a credit agreement dated january   the credit agreement certain financial institutions the lenders agreed to make loans to a company now known as propex fabrics inc propex bnp in addition to being a lender is the administrative agent under the credit agreement in that capacity bnp is responsible for distributing proceeds from the sale of propexs collateral and certain payments if an event of default occurs under the credit agreement on january   propex filed for bankruptcy which constituted an event of default under the credit agreement on march  the bankruptcy court authorized propex to sell substantially all of its assets bnp as administrative agent held the proceeds from the sale bnp made a pro rata share distribution of a portion of the proceeds to the lenders in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement prior to making any distributions however bnp withheld a total of  to pay certain administrative costs expected to be incurred by bnp as administrative agent the reserved amount the reserved amount included  which amount is the subject of this interpleader action the stake under section ix of the credit agreement propex agreed to pay the fees and expenses incurred by administrative agent and lenders in enforcing any obligations under the credit agreement pursuant to this provision certain lenders the participating lenders requested in a letter dated april   that bnp pay the fees and expenses incurred by them in connection with the filing of a conditional objection to the sale of propexs assets in the bankruptcy court the enforcement fees and expenses the enforcement fees and expenses totaled  in a letter dated may  the participating lenders demanded that bnp distribute this amount ie the stake to them the same day a representative of another lender wayzata opportunities fund ii lp wayzata communicated to bnp that wayzata would initiate legal proceedings against bnp if it distributed the stake to the participating lenders on june  bnp filed this interpleader action pursuant to  usc §  requesting that the court resolve the distribution of the stake on june  bnp deposited the stake with the courts registry and made no claim to the stake all of the named interpleaderdefendants were served with the complaint on september  the participating lenders filed a motion for summary judgment seeking an order instructing bnp to distribute the stake to them wayzata filed an opposition on october  in which it argued inter alia that section ix of the credit agreement did not authorize payment of the enforcement fees and expenses sought by the participating lenders instead wayzata sought a pro rata distribution of the stake to all lenders the december  opinion rejected wayzatas interpretation of the credit agreement granted the participating lenders motion for summary judgment and ordered that the stake be returned to bnp for distribution to the participating lenders see bnp paribas  wl  at  on march   bnp filed the instant motion pursuant to  usc §§  and  for an order  discharging bnp from all further liability with respect to the stake  permanently enjoining all further actions by the named interpleader defendants with regard to the stake and  awarding bnp attorneys fees and costs of  incurred in bringing the interpleader action on march  the participating lenders filed their response the participating lenders do not oppose bnps motion except insofar as it seeks payment of attorneys fess and costs from the stake the participating lenders contend that bnps attorneys fees and costs should be paid from the reserved amount or alternatively by wayzata on april  bnp filed its reply and wayzata filed a response like the participating lenders wayzata does not oppose bnps motion wayzata objects however to the participating lenders position that wayzata should bear bnps attorneys fees and costs discussion  interpleader relief under  usc §  a district court has jurisdiction of any civil action of interpleader involving money or property worth  or more where two or more adverse claimants of diverse citizenship as defined in  usc §  are claiming or may claim to be entitled to such money or property if the plaintiff has deposited the money or property with the court ny life ins co v conn dev auth  fd   d cir  citation omitted in such an action the court is to hear and determine the case and may discharge the plaintiff from further liability may enter a permanent injunction restraining the claimants from proceeding in any state or united states court in a suit to affect the property and may make all appropriate orders to enforce its judgment id citing  usc §  see also mendez v tiaacref  fd   d cir  before discharging a stakeholder under §  the court must first determine whether the requirements of  usc §  have been met mendez  fd at  there is no dispute that the requirements of  usc §  have been met and that bnp is entitled to the relief it seeks bnp is a disinterested stakeholder and made no claim against the stake the stake which is valued at more than  was deposited in the courts registry on june   further at least two competing claims were asserted against the stake by claimants of diverse citizenship accordingly pursuant to  usc §  bnp shall be discharged from all further liability with respect to the stake and a permanent injunction shall be entered enjoining all further actions by the named interpleader defendants with regard to the stake  attorneys fees and costs a disinterested stakeholder who asserts interpleader is entitled to be awarded costs and attorneys fees septembertide pub bv v stein and day inc  fd   d cir  see also as krediit pank v chase manhattan bank  fd   d cir  per curiam attorneys fees and costs are generally awarded against the interpleader fund but may in the discretion of the court be taxed against one of the parties when their conduct justifies it septembertide  fd at  citing prudential ins co of am v boyd  fd   th cir  see also globe indem co v puget sound co  fd   d cir  the plaintiff in interpleader is entitled to costs usually including a reasonable attorneys fee to be paid out of the fund brought into court ultimately an award of attorneys fees and costs is left to the sound discretion of district court travelers indem co v israel  fd   d cir  the participating lenders and wayzata do not dispute that bnp is entitled to reimbursement of its attorneys fees and costs or that the amount requested is reasonable the only disagreement is the source of funds to be used to reimburse bnp the participating lenders however fail to provide a sufficient reason to deviate from the general rule that a disinterested stakeholders fees and costs should be paid from the stake septembertide  fd at  see also prudential ins  fd at  the award of costs and attorneys fees in an interpleader action is generally to be imposed against the party who has benefited from the interpleader action contrary to the contention of the participating lenders no funds remain in the reserved amount from which bnp can pay its attorneys fees and costs further the argument that wayzata should bear bnps fees and costs because the december  opinion rejected wayzatas arguments concerning the interpretation of the credit agreement is unavailing the participating lenders have not shown that wayzatas litigation posture was so unreasonable or frivolous as to warrant taxing wayzata with bnps fees and costs see septembertide  fd at  nor is there any evidence that wayzata obstructed or unreasonably prolonged the interpleader process accordingly bnps attorneys fees and costs shall be paid from the stake conclusion bnps march   motion is granted pursuant to  usc §§  and  bnp is hereby discharged from all further liability and the interpleaderdefendants are permanently enjoined from all further actions with regard to the stake bnp is awarded attorneys fees and costs of  to be paid from the stake so ordered footnotes  to date approximately  in payments have been made by bnp from the reserved amount including the  paid into the courts registry in connection with this
