individual i lived an active lifestylewent to the gym regularly and even used the best pre workout and post workout supplements i used protein and creatine powders as well but it wasnt until my first cycle of taking some true legal anabolic supplements that i seen drastic improvements in my physique my muscle growth and fat loss was amazing my strength was just ridiculous and i was shocked that through all my internet research i never even knew these amazing muscle pills existed  my tipthese products are most often referred to as legal steroids or muscle building supplements my first anabolic stack was the muscle labs  pack muscle growth kit it consisted of the dianabol aka dbol  the anadrol aka drol  deccabolan aka decasteroid and wisndrolv my beofre and after photo was after using only  stacks  note that i purchased  stacks and was given a rd for free the time frame was approximately  days from start to finish i took the dianabol  times daily like morning breakfast and dinner i took my deca once daily before bed than took my anadrol with lunch sometimes  tablets i used my winsdrol as a pre workout supplement so i used  capsules about  minutes rior to training as soon as i completed this cycle for about  days i instantly repeated the cycle all over againobviously my anabolic cycle worked for me my diet was relatively common sensesteak chicken ricewater muscle milk and creatine i ate about every hour i noticed the anabolic supplements especially the dianabol made me hungry increase in hunger is a good indicator of anabolism which is your bodies way of saying yo i need more protein to feed this muscle i ate just about every hour but i just made sure i ate something healthy i will end my review on this note i have since continued using other products from muscle labs usa and i continue to improve if you wanna bulk up use the dianabol and anadrol if you wanna get abs fast use the winsdrol and deccabolan i had no side effects at all except my appetite and an increased sex drive without a doubt these supplements work for building muscle mass and losing fatsimple as that  michael goldberg hi i wanted to share with you my before and after
