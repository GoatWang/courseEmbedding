industries inc executives ron fenech bill fenech and don clark plan to address the “vision” and gameplan of their new company — grand design rv co — from a booth at the recreation vehicle industry association’s rvia th annual national rv trade show nov  at the kentucky exposition center kec in louisville they’ll also present their case at a special  am wednesday nov  kickoff breakfast in the whitley meeting room at the crown plaza hotel right after the rvi leadership prayer breakfast grand design rv is currently setting up shop with fewer than  employees in a acre  squarefoot former manufactured housing plant near the indiana toll road north of middlebury ind “it’s something that we’ve had on our minds now for a lot of years” reported don clark president and coowner of grand design who formerly served as president of thor’s goshen indbased dutchmen mfg inc “you know we’ve all had our own careers and we always had this in the back of our minds — to take what we’ve learned in the industry and really do something special and unique that we could totally control we knew it was going to happen but we just didn’t know when and we wanted the timing to be right” “we’ve all been talking about what brought us to this point” added ron fenech who exited his position as president of thor’s rv group in september of  “and for me it was just time for a different chapter as much as anything i’m an entrepreneur at heart and i really felt that pull” clark and the fenech brothers also operating as coowners are preparing for the debut of their first line of midpriced solitudebrand “extended stay” fifthwheels at the florida rv trade association’s frvta florida rv supershow in january with a startup staff that includes general manager marc hauser and vice president of service operations jerry mccarthy both former dutchmen executives in the big picture meanwhile they’ll operate from the perspective of a company in a postrecessionary market that’s inhabited by fewer dealers but often by larger and more multistore retailers “we’ll talk at our breakfast about the vision of our new company and hold a qa session” said bill fenech who resigned as president of elkhart indbased thor motor coach inc in mid “we’re going to be real strategic in who we sign — we’ve got to get dealers who buy into our philosophy of what we’re doing and we want dealers who want to carry our full line of products “we’re going to market grand design rv as much as we’re going to market the individual brand names” he added “we’re not going to have sister products or clones at the same price points in the same market as another dealer we’re not going to produce them at all we’re going to be very selective in the dealers we sign” all three in turn say their driving interest in launching grand design for which a serious ramp up in production will begin in december is to have the opportunity to build a privately held rv manufacturing firm in which they retain plenty of control “the bottom line is that we’re not doing this just for the money or for an exit strategy” added bill fenech “we don’t have a ‘plan b’ to go sell it or anything like that we want to build a great company — whether it’s a year company or a year company or less if something happens before that we’re going to let the market tell us that but at the end of the day we’re going to build a great company and we’re going to do it our way and we’re going to build it slowly and methodically” filed under breaking news news in focustagged grand design rv co ron fenech rv industry comments one

former president of thor’s rv group is back in northern indiana after a hectic week at the louisville show he told rvbusinesscom that he and his partners brother bill fenech and longtime associate don clark are pretty pleased with the way things are going “we were very excited by the reaction to the news that we were coming back into the marketplace but more importantly the dealer reaction to how we were going to position the company in regard to products that we were going to introduce and most significantly the fact that we were going to pick one dealer per market who would have our full line of grand design products and that we would not be building sister or cloned products under the grand design name” says fenech who played a key role in building goshen indbased keystone rv co into a national player as well as thor’s largest single division “all the dealers seem to be reacting very positively to it and that — more than anything really — is gratifying at this point” in fact fenech whose new firm has begun signing up selected dealerships says the positive reception at grand design’s louisville show meeting wasn’t any different than what they’ve been receiving elsewhere throughout the country “yeah part of it i think is that there was some anticipation that we would be coming back into the marketplace” he added “we’ve built a lot of relationships over the years we think that dealers recognize they can trust us and they believe in our track record so they’re giving us a chance to talk to them seriously about joining forces “part of it i think that is rather appealing is that we’re taking things back to how the business was done  or  years ago when companies had one dealer in a market and i think in today’s market with so much internet shopping the fact that there’s fewer dealers in the market and credit isn’t flowing as it was back in the early s that we are providing a way for dealers to build margin with the distribution strategy we’ll put in place and i think that’s what they’re reacting to”     filed under breaking news news in focustagged grand design rv ron fenech fenechs and clark reveal plan to rv audience november   by bob ashley ·

rvbusiness · leave a comment  the rv dealers international conventionexpo scheduled for oct  at the rio allsuite hotel  casino in las vegas nev comes at a crucial time for the us economy in general and the rv industry in particular as both work their way out of the tough recession of  on one hand the industry’s rebound has exceeded expectations in many ways especially for manufacturers suppliers and retailers aligned with the right towable recreational vehicle brands on the other hand however the aftershocks of the great recession are obviously still with us in terms of unemployment stock market fluctuations and a general discomfort among many americans with regard to the general state of the economy and while most americans assume that the worst is over many of the nation’s durable good manufacturers – including rv builders — are still looking to bridge their way to the next year and the next level of recovery and to find a comfort zone in this new postrecessionary age mike molino “there is a consensus we have to recalibrate our definition of what is a good business environment” said mike molino president of the fairfax vabased recreation vehicle dealers association rvda lead sponsor of october’s annual conexpo “we’re not going to get back to the unit years any time soon we’ll probably never return to that the next couple of years will be tough but doable if dealers stay within the cash structure they have they will survive the consumer will come back — slowly we won’t see a significant increase in sales until there is more certainty about the state of the economy i’m not so sure the election of  will bring more certainty that might just bring more confusion” but molino generally a realist does tend to see the cup half full “the dealers who are still in business for the most part are the ones who will survive” he maintained “the dealers coming to the convention are in good shape the shakeout is well on its way to being complete but it’s not totally over dealers are telling me they have inventory but are paying more finance charges on the inventory they have than they used to and retail financiers are very stringent on who they are lending money to so the ability to buy a recreational vehicle the threshold for buying is higher and the ability to buy is a lot lower “another dynamic is that there is uncertainty among businesses both large and small and that drives employment and employment drives the mentality of the economy” molino continued “when a consumer is hearing levels of unemployment we currently have around  it’s still not conducive to them going out and buying an rv even if they can afford to get a loan for an rv until unemployment goes down and employment rises we will have some issues” a new era for the industry as

active committee under convention chairman peter albano between him and my staff and the volunteers on the committee i think they have put together the most pertinent program for dealers and the management level of staff i’ve ever seen” as ever of course there will be an aggressive educational component including workshops on everything from wholesale and retail financing options to new inventory management strategies and how to reach new customers through innovative marketing communications and the  convention will again feature an exhibit hall filled with the rv industry’s leading oem and supplier companies offering products and services to help dealers improve profitability but attendees will notice significant changes starting with the brand committee meetings closed door sessions in which dealers meet as a group with representatives of the recreational vehicle brands they carry rvda’s “partners in progress” brand committees among other things will work on important dealermanufacturer issues and address results of rvda’s dealer satisfaction index dsi “we’ve restructured the brand committees meetings so they come early in the session” molino explained “we tried to make it so there is no conflict between the committee meetings and anything else they want to do i think it will enhance the experience for the dealers especially the manufacturers” peter albano

we need to change and get some new blood into the system and see how we’re running the sessions break it up and make it new” albano owner of american rv in the memphis suburb of olive branch miss told
