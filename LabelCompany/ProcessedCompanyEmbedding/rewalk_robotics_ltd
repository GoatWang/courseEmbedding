to rehabilitate stroke patients posted jan   by lora kolodny lorakolodny  shares next story grail is raising at least  billion to fund its early cancer screening test the bostonbased company that was first to provide robotic legs to paralyzed veterans in the us rewalk robotics ltd has a new product in development that you won’t see this week at ces the device is a “soft exoskeleton” designed to help people who have lower limb disability but who have not severed their spinal cord or otherwise become paraplegic according to rewalk ceo larry jasinski “many people who have had a stroke can stand up but cannot lift their feet well or cannot put their legs down or propel the leg on their own to walk if you could help them move their legs but not have to put a big structure around them it would be a very attractive option” the new product will help rewalk broaden its market addressing patients recovering from a stroke or dealing with everything from the effects of old age to diseases that impair their mobility like ms and parkinson’s disease the soft exoskeleton could be utilized by these patients either longterm or as part of a rehab process today rewalk’s soft exoskeleton prototype looks more like something a rock climber might wear than transformer parts its main elements are a belt and fanny pack with motors and a computer within cables that extend down the legs knee braces to keep them in place and sensorladen footplates that can fit into a sneaker or other soft shoe the waist belt weighs about eight pounds and the cables braces and footplates add about two more pounds to the total weight at this point rewalk acquired the initial technology design from the wyss institute at harvard which had begun developing a “biologically inspired smart suit” the medexo with funding from the us defense advanced research projects agency darpa back in  darpa has long had an interest in technology that can be applied to help soldiers or medics walk farther or for longer and carry more weight in the field jasinski tells techcrunch that one reason for the tech transfer deal was that harvard researchers had a great design but needed to marry it with expertise around motors gears and software to make it work in the real world rewalk had done all that with its earlier systems and had also figured out how to work with the fda and the va to get its devices approved for veteran benefits reimbursements here’s how the new technology helps a patient walk on their own jasinski explained “think about a bicycle you have cables that transfer force down a line to close a brake down on the bike’s tires this uses the same principle but is obviously more complex one cable runs along the outside part on the front of your leg and another on the back the motor and gear are on your waist attached to the cables a lightweight brace worn on your calf keeps the cables in place the computer and our software will tell the motor to turn just enough to lift the cable pull it and get you ground clearance then propel your foot forward sensors in a footplate in your shoe send data to the computer to let it know everything about your position and when you are walking” rewalk will begin clinical studies of its soft exoskeletons in the back half of  the company seeks to make the device available in  pending fda approvals the soft exoskeleton will initially have power sufficient to move the legs or be constantly walking for two hours at a stretch the company will seek distribution again through the va health system and private sector rehab centers that already pay for “gait training” systems for stroke patients later the product could be adapted for those with diseases like ms which strikes more women than men and usually is diagnosed in a person’s late s or early s or parkinson’s “if you had a stroke and you were laying in a hospital bed for  days theoretically you could lose  percent to  percent of your muscle mass” jasinski said if you could use this in recovery you’d have a much better chance at regaining your mobility in full is the hope with ms and parkinson’s we think about using this to walk more and put off laterstage developments” featured image

estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses will be approximately  million or approximately  million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ordinary shares in full we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes including sales and marketing expenditures aimed at growing our business and research and development expenditures focused on product development we expect that the net proceeds from this offering will be sufficient for us to expand our sales marketing and training infrastructure and for our other current development activities including adapting rewalk for other indications and the development of our next generation of rewalk we may also use net proceeds from this offering to make acquisitions or investments in complementary companies or technologies although we do not have any agreement or understanding with respect to any such acquisition or investment at this time we do not currently have specific plans or commitments with respect to the net proceeds from this offering and accordingly are unable to quantify the allocation of such proceeds among the various potential uses we will have broad discretion in the way that we use the net proceeds of this offering the market in which we operate is characterized by active competition and rapid technological change and we expect competition to increase competition arises from providers of other mobility systems and prosthetic devices we are aware of a number of other companies developing competing technology and devices and some of these competitors may have greater resources greater name recognition broader product lines or larger customer bases than we do our principal competitors in the medical exoskeleton market consist of ekso bionics otc ekso rex bionics london stock exchange rxb cyberdyne tokyo stock exchange  and parker hannifin nyse ph we believe we have key competitive advantages over these companies such as our tiltsensor technology that provides a selfinitiated walking experience more natural gait and functional walking speed slimmer and lighter design rewalk’s ability to support its own weight and broad user specifications additionally we are not aware of any medical exoskeleton product that is cleared or in the process of seeking clearance from the fda for personal use rewalk personal is the first medical exoskeleton cleared by the fda for personal use in the united states in addition we compete with alternative devices and alternative therapies including treadmillbased gait therapies such as those offered by hocoma alterg aretech and reha technology other medical device or robotics companies academic and research institutions or others may develop new technologies or therapies that provide a superior walking experience are more effective in treating the secondary medical conditions that we target or are less expensive than our current or future products our technologies and products could be rendered obsolete by such developments we may also compete with other treatments and technologies that address the secondary medical conditions that rewalk seeks to mitigate company description we are an innovative medical device company that is designing developing and commercializing exoskeletons that allow wheelchairbound individuals with mobility impairments or other medical conditions the ability to stand and walk once again we have developed and are continuing to commercialize rewalk an exoskeleton that uses our patented tiltsensor technology and an onboard computer and motion sensors to drive motorized legs that power movement current rewalk designs are intended for people with paraplegia a spinal cord injury resulting in complete or incomplete paralysis of the legs who have the use of their upper bodies and arms we currently offer two products rewalk personal and rewalk rehabilitation rewalk personal is designed for everyday use by individuals at home and in their communities and is customfit for each user rewalk rehabilitation is designed for the clinical rehabilitation environment where it provides valuable exercise and therapy it also enables individuals to evaluate their capacity for using rewalk personal in the future in  we launched rewalk rehabilitation for use in hospitals and rehabilitation centers in the united states and europe we began marketing rewalk personal in europe with ce mark clearance at the end of  and received fda clearance to market it in the united states in june  rewalk is the first exoskeleton cleared by the fda for personal use in the future we will need to obtain approval from the applicable regulatory agency of any additional jurisdiction in which we seek to market rewalk rewalk is a breakthrough product that can fundamentally change the health and life experiences of users rewalk is currently the only commercialized exoskeleton using a tilt sensor to restore selfinitiated walking designed for allday use rewalk is batterypowered and consists of a light wearable exoskeleton with integrated motors at the joints an array of sensors and a computerbased control system to power knee and hip movement rewalk controls movement using subtle changes in the user’s center of gravity a forward tilt of the upper body is sensed by the system which initiates the first step repeated body shifting generates a sequence of steps which allows for natural gait with functional walking speed because the exoskeleton supports its own weight users do not expend unnecessary energy while walking while rewalk does not allow sidetoside actuation users are able to turn by shifting their weight to the side rewalk also allows users to sit stand and in some cases climb and descend stairs rewalk users are able to independently operate the devices and most are able to put on and remove the devices by themselves however our safety guidelines and fda specifications require users to be accompanied by a trained companion published clinical studies demonstrate rewalk’s ability to deliver a natural gait and functional walking speed which has not been shown in studies for any competing exoskeleton in addition our interim analysis of an ongoing clinical study and our experience working with health care practitioners and rewalk users suggests that rewalk has the potential to provide secondary health benefits these benefits include reducing pain and spasticity and improving bowel and urinary tract function body and bone composition metabolism and physical fitness as well as reducing hospitalizations and dependence on medications because of these secondary medical benefits we believe that rewalk has the ability to reduce the lifetime healthcare costs of individuals with spinal cord injuries making it economically attractive for individuals and thirdparty payors while we believe that rewalk offers significant advantages over competing technologies and therapies disadvantages include the time it takes for a user to put on rewalk the slower pace of rewalk compared to a wheelchair the weight of rewalk when carried which makes it more burdensome for a companion to transport than a wheelchair and the requirement that users be accompanied by a trained companion we believe that the current design of rewalk provides a functional technical base that can be easily adapted to address medical indications other than paraplegia that affect the ability to walk we are currently engaged in research and development efforts to adapt rewalk to address the mobility needs of quadriplegia and multiple sclerosis patients and in the future we plan to address these needs in stroke and cerebral palsy patients we are also developing our next generation of rewalk with a more efficient drive mechanism slimmer profile and lighter body as well as other improvements development of rewalk took over a decade and was spurred by the experiences of our founder dr amit goffer himself a quadriplegic as of august   we had placed  rewalk rehabilitation and  rewalk personal systems  of which were purchased by our customers and  of which were placed with clinics and distributors for training market development and clinical testing through august   we have trained over  rewalk users representing over  hours of use our commercialization strategy is to penetrate rehabilitation centers hospitals and similar facilities that treat patients with spinal cord injuries to become an integral part of their rehabilitation programs and to develop a broad based training network with these facilities to prepare users for home and community use according to the national spinal cord injury statistical center  of persons with spinal cord injuries are sent to private noninstitutional residences in most cases their homes after hospital discharge as a result while the majority of our sales to date have been rewalk rehabilitation units the primary focus of our commercialization efforts going forward will be marketing rewalk personal for routine use at home work or in the community and we expect sales of rewalk personal to account for the substantial majority of our revenues in the future we expect to generate revenues from a combination of selfpayors and thirdparty payors while no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement by thirdparty payors currently exists for electronic exoskeleton technologies such as rewalk in the united states or elsewhere we plan to pursue various paths of reimbursement and support fundraising efforts by institutions and clinics in july  the james j peters va hospital bronx new york announced that it would be fully committed to supporting the procurement of rewalk personal and providing the staffing support needed for all eligible veterans with spinal cord injury for whom rewalk is clinically indicated as the first hospital to research the healthrelated benefits of an exoskeletal walking device for people with spinal cord injury the bronx va experience supports the clinical use of rewalk and similar fdaapproved technologies we believe that additional vas will adopt similar policies in the future  we are incorporated under the laws of the state of israel our corporate headquarters are located at kochav yokneam building floor
