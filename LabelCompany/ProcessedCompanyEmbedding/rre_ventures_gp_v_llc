what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers hedge fund industry – assets under management usd billions

provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha managed funds which do are a good way

breitman — tezos unleashed july  jason black amlg welcome back to the latest episode of flux i’m excited for today’s episode we have kathleen breitman cofounder and ceo of tezos tezos is many things but fundamentally it’s a blockchainbased smart contracts platform with builtin governance mechanisms which allows for formal coordination and upgrades to the protocol it’s a powerful idea which we’re going to unpack more in this conversation but the key thing is that there is onchain governance capability and a functional scripting language these are desirable traits that people now argue have been missing from other protocols such as ethereum which is a leading contender i’d been sent several emails about tezos and being a terrible email shirker didn’t follow up on them but the fates brought kathleen and i together a few weeks ago at a conference in england we were standing outside it was freezing and my fingers were falling off when jack herrick jackh introduced us we extricated ourselves from the conference found one of those portable office pods and shut ourselves in there to chat crypto we both spent time at the wall street journal under mary kissel shout out to marykissel if she’s listening and bridgewater the mega hedge fund in the woods of connecticut no need to read out kathleen’s extensive bio here but she’s crammed an impressive amount in the last five years since graduating from cornell she was a consultant at accenture and also worked on strategy for r the consortium of  banks focused on blockchain tech she left there in  to pursue tezos so that’s a longwinded introduction to kathleen i’m especially excited to have her here today because we’re bang in the middle of the tezos ico or fundraiser so i will include a disclaimer before we beginthe ensuing conversation is not a recommendation that any listener participate in the fundraise do your own research you should never invest in something you don’t understandbut i hope you learn something from this conversation nevertheless welcome kathleenkb thank you aliceamlg i guess we should start at the beginning and explain the origins of tezos you’re the ceo and cofounder along with your husband arthur husbandwife team and he’s the cto the architect you told me you guys met at a cryptoanarchist meetup in new york in  what is the story there and what kind of pickup lines does one hear at an anarchist meetupkb it all starts off in a in a bar near nyu in  i was debriefing with my debate team we had just lost mightily to a better school in a debate there was a party going on at the bar and i was  years old and was very tempted at this party by the freeflowing beer a hot commodity for  year olds i met this guy named tennyson tennyson and i got along just fine and he insisted i come with him to a lunch the next day he left out a lot of details the dealbreaker probably would been that it was crypto anarchist lunch — minor detail the theme of the lunch was not disclosedso i went in and this guy made a beeline at me i was a little weirded out but tennyson had told arthur all about me prior to this and i guess he thought that it would be a good match so shout out to tennyson he said “hello nice to meet you welcome to the media” he was friendly and gregarious and tried to figure out all the things i would like and not like he namedropped that he knew milton friedman’s grandson when i mentioned i liked milton friedman we just kept on talking and i really enjoyed speaking to him and he seemed smart and nice and funny i meandered through the rest of my saturday the way i would normally then he texted me later and i texted him and we wound up meeting at another bar then we wound up going to dinner —amlg and you covered all of milton friedmankb oh yes it was a rich intellectual history of the friedmans basically we just started talking and we haven’t stoppedamlg and arthur was a quant right he was at some high frequency trading shops shops being goldmankb yes he studied math and computer science and physics over in france then he wanted to work in finance france isn’t a great place to make a living if you’re under the age of like  so instead of going to london which he didn’t really care for he decided to make his bets on new york so he went to nyu where he studied under nassem taleb and the financial engineering group then he became a quant so he was doing high frequency trading and market making for foreign etfs in particularamlg you’ve said that arthur is the brains and you’re at the brawn what do you mean by thatkb arthur is really the technical architect he came up with the structure tezos has gone in and out of fashion — the ideas — over the last three or four years people really took interest in it last year when the dao occurred this was a fantastic heist of sorts a digital heistalmg could you explain what happened there with the dao hackin april   of all ether m at the time was deposited into the dao a smart contract computer program running on ethereum a few bad lines of code in the contract enabled a hacker to steal m in june  the community ultimately decided to resolve the hack by hard forking ethereum which resulted in two coins eth and etckb there was a project that aspired to be a decentralized venture capital organization on the ethereum blockchain called the dao they had about  million dollars worth of ether pledged to the contract this was an ambitious undertaking and the people who created the dao didn’t do a super thorough job of security audits and wondering if they could actually mobilize this vision they had created so a clever hacker gave himself some of the ether out of this contract to the tune of  million dollars out of the  millionamlg that’s a good stealkb not bad if you can get it so this forced a conversation in the ethereum community as to whether or not there ought to be a do over call it a mulligan if you will on this whole dao fiasco that led to a split in the chain of ethereum which is how we got two versions ethereum classic which is favored by some people in the community because it didn’t unwind this transaction — it forced people to deal with the consequences of this heist and then regular ethereum or ethereum as we know it today which basically called a do over this was ultimately a governance question and the whole nexus of tezos is — governance is very much a part of blockchains we can’t divorce the math and computer science aspect from the overall governing philosophy so this forced a conversationamlg so when there’s a fork and a community has to vote on a direction there’s basically an informal process that’s determined by perceptions perception of which fork seems most authoritative or valid or which constituents shout the loudest which is what we saw after the dao hack this is the problem you’re trying to solve with tezos — you’re trying to formalize the process of how one upgrades a protocolkb so the tezos position paper examines the potential threats to bitcoin ethereum was not factored into the analysis in the initial white paper or position paper but yes essentially the idea is that ultimately these systems are very fragile in the sense that if you have undue influence over the protocol on this soft level you can render different results at the protocol levelyou see this with bitcoin you have core developers who have personalities and it kind of becomes a cult of personality over who you’re with and people taking sides on twitter but there’s no meaningful way to enact change in the sense that ultimately you’re at the behest of miners in china over which version of the protocol is actually deployedamlg so your mechanism allows blockchain to change the blockchain itself very meta turtles all the way down there your central idea was — you saw this fallacy underlying bitcoin that code can solve everything or as arthur puts it nothing bad can happen to bitcoin because math but really blockchains are embedded in society society can be compromised so this is what you’re getting at with tezos right the question i have that follows — under the current construction isn’t there a risk that the network favors the people who are more technical the more technical stakeholders who are knowledgeable about anything that you would vote to change what do you do for the non technicallysavvy tokenholdersread more in the tezos overviewkb that’s a good question we have what’s called delegated proofofstake in our system essentially what this means is that everyone who owns a token can become a validator in the network or they can actually assign that right to someone else and that person can vote on their behalf so there is going to be some element of politicking but at least it’ll be something where people can express that in a much more legitimate way than just saying that that guy’s right because —amlg so sort of a proxy votekb it’s a proxy vote yes some people call it liquid democracyamlg but you can never really remove the element of humans influencing other humans’ ideas right it’s just the voting piecekb most definitely that’s an important caveat that’s why it’s an experimental piece of technology ultimately this is still going by people’s judgment which is of course always subject to some sort of fallacy the main innovation with tezos is giving a way to air legitimacy on the chain right now it’s sinuous as to how decisions are made by making things more explicit we hope that we can get more useful conversations goingthere has been a longstanding debate over how to increase the bitcoin block size under the current mb block capacity network congestion is resulting in higher transaction times and processing fees bip and segwit form two of the top scaling proposals and are set to update the network on august st dubbed bitcoin independence day there is a possibility of a chain split an event that would result in two separate bitcoins more infoamlg it’s super relevant now since we’re seeing this play out with massive battles over block size in bitcoin whether to go with bip or segwit maybe you could just fit tezos into the landscape for the listeners you’ve said previously that the bitcoin model is so decentralized that it’s beholden to these populist campaigns and there’s this governance deadlock then on the other side ethereum is moving very fast but is very centralized because the foundation has a lot of clout over the protocol where do you fit on that spectrumkb in some ways we’re choosing a middle ground between the two and in other ways we’re taking a radically different approach so a little about how tezos governance works in its first iteration what we’re going to do is a twophased vote we’re taking our cues from the republic of venice and we’re doing affirmative voting on the first iteration so what would you like to test so say six people have proposed these things and they all have different tradeoffs what we want to actually test and see if it’s useful for the protocol what’s the proposition hereamlg then that proposition has to pass a threshold to get the main votekb yes after testing we’ll spin up a testnet it will say for example well you said that this preserves privacy but we actually found that it does notamlg what happens if you don’t get people over a certain level some of the dao propositions won only  or  the voteskb one way of approaching that is delegation — making it easy to not have to think critically about every proposal if you take a vacation you shouldn’t have to worry too much about the networkamlg right and it’s very easy to bash every option downkb but we also adjust the quorum every time for instance maybe people just want two people making all the decisions that’s a weird outcome certainly but it’s possibleamlg is it possible that ethereum could change its governance structurekb they could introduce different roles for people they could introduce something like a representative democracy but the innovation with tezos is that we can actually iterate on our governance model we can adjust it at the meta level that’s something you have to bake into the protocol at the base layeramlg they really can’t bake it in at this stage — it’s donekb i think it would be remarkably difficult i’m not going to underestimate vitalik of course but with tezos we don’t just have this governance layer we also have a way of pushing the upgrades out to everyone it’s one and the same making it a very powerful mechanism whereas bitcoin and ethereum still have manual processes for updating their chainamlg you’ve said yours is modular with the three layers swappable — you can swap things in and outtezos distinguishes three protocols the network transaction and consensus protocols the transaction and consensus layers are implemented in an isolated module plugged into a generic network shell responsible for maintaining the blockchainkb yes it’s called a hot swap on the protocolamlg hot swap on the protocol well vitalik is a brilliant guy but i did love the fact that your smart contract language is michelson—kb michelson at least that’s how french developers pronounce it i actually don’t know i mispronounce everything —amlg how’s your blockchain frenchkb better than my blockchain englishamlg but so it’s a reference to the michelsonmorley experiment which disproved aether right not to be confused with ether that’s hilarious i love that you guys throw those little things inkb it’s the only cheeky thing we’ve doneamlg the other interesting thing is that you’ve built in incentives for developers — bounties and invoice potential on the chainkb yes so i think a big failing of open source technology nowadays is that you basically have corporates sponsoring it because they use it in some capacity and that’s kind of how these things are governed but outside of a group of enthusiasts and people who have a vested interest in its success you don’t find too many people actively trying to contribute just for the sake of it or for pecuniary gain we decided early on that that would be a massive inhibitor to innovation in these blockchain protocols because at the beginning at least they seem to appeal to ideologues — which mind you is fine — but i like the idea of having someone from a university who’s been studying something on the periphery and incentivizing them to contribute to the protocol even if they don’t find the ideological aspects of it appetizingamlg for the mercenary engineers out therekb there are many of themamlg really you guys have been working on this for a while but it feels like you’re just making your entrance onto the scene more in the grand scheme of course it’s still very early but surely many of the folks interested in the space have already taken stakes in other competing ledgers how have you navigated these existing vested interests and converted people to the tezzie religion i know you’ve said that community building has turned out to be one of the hardest partskb it’s genuinely really tough i think that’s part of the reason we did an uncapped crowd sale when we were thinking of the best way to get tezos backing from people it wasn’t obvious to us how to do it but one way is to make sure that everyone has the ability to take part in the ecosystem people having an interest in you and contributing to your fundraiser is a way to get them interested in the technologyamlg you really opened it up broadly with the fundraiserkb absolutelyamlg should we not be saying icokb i mean it is a fundraiser people call it an ico but it is a fundraiser i was thinking of making tote bags like pbs tote bagsamlg because people are donating to a nonprofitkb exactly and the nonprofit is recommending an allocation of tokensamlg let’s step back for a second and lay out the landscape for people who haven’t seen all the headlines on icos what’s a quick explainer on an initial coin offering and what have you done so farkb basically there are a number of new projects in this space and one way to distribute the token is to simply receive donations to their blockchain and then in return you get the token and typically they’ll price it at a certain number of bitcoin or ethereum and deploy it right away so it’s an alternative financing structure for some projects and for some projects it’s a distribution mechanismamlg and the tokens are not securitieskb i mean in some cases they could be right like if you have a claim on a line of revenue arguably that’s a security but with tezos you’re basically getting computing power on a decentralized blockchainamlg so in your case they’re not as of today it’s thursday july th pm about  bitcoin and  ethereum have been contributed with seven days to go it’s so exciting it’s like a reality showlet’s get into some of the questions that have been raised — we ought to cover a few i admit when i first heard some of the facts about tezos i was skeptical it’s easy to fall into cynicism there’s all these keyboard warriors on reddit throwing out one liners but the papers you’ve put out actually give clear and wellthought out answers to some of these mainstream public questions i want to get into a few of them the first thing i want to ask is about the pushback over the fact that the fundraiser is uncapped uncapped meaning there’s no upper limit on the funds you can raise the limit is just the time the window in which you’re raising — two weeks in the tezos overview you state the reason for this which i will read here“there is no cap on the amount of contributions that will be accepted this is done in order to ensure that participation is not limited only to insiders or the fast fingered the tezos team believes that an uncapped fundraiser will promote a widespread distribution of the tokens a necessary prerequisite to launching a robust network”so that inclusive argument instinctively makes sense to me but of course the problem with democracy is democracy the system itself crowds don’t always get things right and in this case your crowd may be speculators there’s been a lot of speculative buying in china for instance do you worry about who the tokenholders are and whether their incentives are aligned with tezoskb it’s tough we didn’t do much marketing outside of the us well rather arthur and i are based in the us and we talk about the technology in mainstream us press outlets and sometimes it’s picked up in asian outlets we mostly have just been evangelizing about the technology but certainly there are a lot of people who are interested in the more speculative aspects i think there’s a lot of fervor and froth in the marketplace right now that does make it a bit odd to launch something that’s more communitybased on some level when there’s a lot of people who are just profitseeking i suppose i do worry but ultimately we’re appealing to people’s rational selfinterest so at the end of the day i hope that the proper incentives will align themselvesamlg and that the tokens end up in the right hands with people who align with your valueskb yesamlg let’s talk about the structure which is the other question people ask and fiduciary liabilities you’ve laid out the tezos foundation’s goal is to promote the use of the tezos protocol so participants in the crowd sale donate to the swiss foundation which in turn provides the contributors with a token allocation you’ve said the foundation will spend on conferences marketing funding developers if your director decided he wanted to buy an island in the caribbean who votes on that how does the corporate structure workkb that’s a good question part of the reason this is not a security is because you have no claim on the revenue and that includes the revenue from the fundraiser the tezos foundation is at the behest of the swiss nonprofit authority which has a clear directive to adhere to whatever the tezos foundation sets out to do so if johann wants to buy a caribbean island where there there’s a ton of ocaml programmers that’s kosher if johann wants —amlg so if they program better there it’s ok — as long as productivity goes upkb ha yes if johann wants to buy a caribbean island because he wants to run it on the tezos blockchain in some way i guess that falls in line with it but if he wants to do it because — well he’s quite pale so i don’t know if he wants to go tanning — but if he wants to go on vacation and buy an island that would not be ok you could theoretically hold him accountable under swiss law and i think that the foundation ought to survey the community for major decisions to reflect their will better but there’s no explicit voting mechanism on it part of the reason that’s not such a bad thing is that anyone can contribute to the protocol there’s the foundation which has veto power for one year but other than that they don’t have any favored status in the protocolamlg it’s amazing how you’re paving the way and there doesn’t seem to be any regulatory framework for what you’re doing what was your thinking on going to switzerland i know that the us money transmission laws are nuts on a state by state basis it’s so complex here but it sounds like it’s complex there as well what are your thoughts on how the regulatory framework will evolvekb well johann is the founder of the crypto valley in zug which is a canton in zurich it has a ton of bitcoin companies it has a ton of watching companies located there and including ethereum foundationamlg so i guess they paved the way do you think others will follow — do you think there’s a best practice being set herekb i think so there are other a few other places — gnosis which is an ethereum prediction market token i think they had their token sale out of gibraltar estonia wants to do work around this i think the ethereum foundation itself is actually in singapore right now so there’s all sorts of accommodating usually small nations that are willing to work with youamlg you gotta love the small nations so the other major thing that’s gone on during the fundraiser which you’ve had to deal with is serious attacks i’ve seen phishing attempts all over the internet fake accounts on twitter reddit it seems like you’ve learned a lot about ddos resilience and you’ve probably a lot of sleepless nights how have you managed key security during this processkb oh geez it’s a good question we have some very clever engineers is the short answer the long answer is that my husband is a hobbyist infosec researcher so he thought of an elaborate way of securing the site against ddos measures he worked with friends at aws and cloudflare who were willing to give us some of their time and services we have a pretty sophisticated operation going on right now we’ll be releasing a white paper that goes over what we did and we will be licensing out the software apparently it was quite an undertaking the long and short of it is that it was a lot of work with the phishing honestly it was about communicating to the group that there would be no presale deals and being hardasses when people were askingamlg what were the main channels twitter or reddit or where did you —kb we made the mistake of creating a slack channel which was terrible because you can dm people without any permissioning on who can dm who so there were people private messaging and trying to convince folks that they were on the insideamlg do you have any idea who these people arekb it’s funny because three weeks before the sale someone masqueraded as emin gün sirer who’s one of our advisors a professor at cornell he was pretending to be someone who could get someone in on the sale this guy used the photo that emin uses on twitter and his name and likeness but the one snag in his plan was that he registered with his main email so i was immediately able to be like hey gün this guy is pretending to be youamlg not a good infosec move really i at least use my hotmail account when i’m registering to hack thingskb that’s very good of you now i know but yes you just get very unsophisticated people you get both idiots and then you get folks who go out in full force we had a group that was making accounts that said community manager with a woman’s name every  minutes and had to shut it down manually it was really badwhat i learned from this whole process is that slack is terrible for public groups it’s terrible on a few levels it’s terrible because the dm aspect you don’t have any control over you don’t have granular permissions as to who can control what and you don’t have threading of conversations what broke arthur and me in the first three or four months after we announced tezos was going to be released was people who kept asking the same questions over and over again it drove us crazyamlg like whatkb when ico what cap why no cap people would get irritated that the questions are repeated people would get irritated that arthur and i would not take the time to go into thoughtful answers every timeamlg you could just point them to the answerkb you could yes but they want to hear from you just to be sure that grated on us whereas with reddit people like to yell and they like —amlg i only observe on reddit i don’t dare say anything because i get smacked down quicklykb the only way to win is not to play but at least with reddit you can reference threads and iterate on that so you don’t get the same questions over and over again that’s really a big thing with slackamlg why is it there so much nastiness in the blockchain crypto world — is it just smart people with opinions strongly held or is it monetary reasonskb i think people are just naturally inclined towards taking sides you see this in politics too “i’m team ethereum ethereum is going up x why don’t you like ethereum why do you think you’re better than ethereum” rightamlg but actually it seems like you cooperate with a lot of the other folks in the space i mean zcash zooko — he’s one of your advisors rightkb oh yes zooko in general we have a good working relationship with most of the people in the space that we admire it’s really folks who can’t evaluate our technology who get really upset with us and start to caterwaul you can’t let that get to you honestly if you look back at ethereum people were much more vicious so we got off pretty easy on the vilification front most of the attacks have been very personal but i’ve been on the internet since i was  and i worked at bridgewater so i have thick skinamlg all the character building you neededkb exactly you’ll have to come at me a little harder if you want to hurt my feelingsamlg how do you cope with the stress the two of you i guess you’re both moving around internationally and busy but you are in a relationship with each other —kb i mean it’s compartmentalizing sometimes it’s “ok right now you’re my business partner and i’m telling you that this is a terrible idea” and sometimes it’s “i know you’re stressed out we should really talk about this but let’s first see a movie or watch bad tv” i think we just know each other really wellamlg what is your goto bad tvkb the new like  spin off designated survivor it’s just so awfulamlg your brain doesn’t even need to be switched onkb it’s just its so stupid it’s really fantastic because it’s like conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory and you can’t quite trace itamlg and your parents now know that you’re doing this right i know you were “a financial software engineer” for a whilekb yeah i was doing “accounting software” now they’re on to me my mother unfortunately has learned what reddit is like but she still loves me which is great she doesn’t seem to be assuaged by the arguments that i’m an incompetent boob or just terrible so i’ve got that going my mother still loves meamlg i’m curious to zoom out for a minute on your selfidentification as an ancap what exactly is an anarchist capitalist in rough termskb in general its someone who believes that markets do a better job of distributing goods than the government they tend to have a preference against government aggression in any formamlg you put at the top of your white paper “laissez faire les proprietaires” which sums up a lot of this you’ve said the whole cypherpunk movement is about using the internet to free people both informationally but also financially it’s interesting to think about how tezos and the work you’ve been doing builds upon decades of thinking privacy advocates have been organizing in silicon valley since the s — guys like david chaum timothy may and that cypherpunk mailing list which then evolved into the cryptography mailing list where you got started i have a quote from may’s manifesto which i thought would be fun to read“just as the technology of printing altered and reduce the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions” that was  —  or so odd years before bitcoin people have wanted this for a long time and then cryptocurrencies raised their head again in the mid s and then boom satoshi where do you see yourself fitting into this long history of crypto anarchist capitalistskb to your point it’s been a series of failures and a series of people who are a bit too far ahead of their time so i hope my timing is right it is just massively experimental so we have to take that into account bitcoin is the new fad it’s the new fashion people like to talk about it because it invites people to think about a world without intermediaries as they know it that’s cool maybe bitcoin isn’t the end game maybe it’s some other application that’s built but i think it’s a very inspirational piece of technologyamlg where did it start for you was there an atlas shrugged moment when you were young did you read some bookkb my parents are both pretty far to the right and classical conservatives my dad subscribed to national review when i was little and it was like read this so i grew up with a more rightleaning bias then i read milton friedman when i was like  he died in  when i was  and i read his obituary written by amity shlaes it was eloquent and talked about how friedman really cared about people’s ability to prosper and make commerce for themselves and that was a nice idea i think instinctually i don’t like being told what to do i don’t like any form of tyranny even the more mundane types like being told to go to classamlg i’m surprised you made it through collegekb i’m surprised too my parents are surprised i made it through college i’m surprised i made it through high school so i think just habitually i didn’t like authority and given that i was already oriented towards the right and caring more about markets than anything else as a way to distribute resources it seemed like a natural fit both with my upbringing and my own instinctual biasesamlg i was on twitter this morning and i thought you would enjoy this article that andy weissman of usv tweeted out so a prominent theoretical physicist yaneer baryam who crunches big data and generally analyzes complex systems — he actually accurately predicted the arab spring — he borrowed mathematical frameworks from quantum field theory and did a study on government he found something that we have already been thinking about — that hierarchal systems no longer work given how complex society has become and how globally interconnected we are hierarchies used to work in smaller kingdoms but since the s there’s been a breakdown whether it’s a financial crisis or environmental issues or diseases it’s just too complex for a few entities or people at the top to respond to and decide on policy at the end of this analysis he proposed a shift to “horizontal distributed governance” which to me points straight to youkb why didn’t he publish this like six weeks agoamlg he also looks at the brain if you think about the brain there isn’t one neuron telling the other neurons what to do there’s a collective behavior that’s responsible for how we think and decide as you read this research you think ok this makes sense everything is too complex but then what’s the mechanismkb yeah part of the reason that we set up tezos the way we did — and we could have been way more prescriptive with the initial governance model — the reason we chose a vanilla twophase vote was because we didn’t want to be too prescriptive it took society thousands of years to come upon the institutions that we have today there are subtleties that you just can’t quite capture you can’t capture them for a variety of reasons part of the limitation is that tezos is going to be digital commonwealth that means it’s not going to be particularly tangible outside of the world of the internet but also there’s a lot of counterintuitive things when you look at government and the way it works today and the way liabilities workone of my favorite books which has just been updated is david friedman’s “legal systems very different from ours” it talks about things like punishment structures in different societies and cultures it’s interesting because you’re always trying to optimize for one thing and you’re not always super sure what types of incentives you’re building in one of my favorite anecdotes is that in the s in vietnam they used to give money out for rat pelts the idea was they wanted to get rats out of the cities what happened instead was that there were elaborate rat farms you can’t always fine tune human behavior you never quite know it’s going to happen so it’s best to take a wait and see approach and see how communities emerge and how they selforganizeamlg why the name tezoskb when we were coming up with the name arthur wanted an original com so he wrote an algorithm to find an unclaimed com that was pronounceable in english apparently it’s slang in colombian teenager speak on twitter for “expert” so that’s a massive freebieamlg i was looking for hidden meanings in the logo it looks like there’s a three in therekb the logo is a unicode character ua from a mayan language the t and z there i bought the unicode character “dot com” in case anyone tries to get cheeky though if anyone types that in i want to meet them and say come work with me so it’ll double as a resumebuilding exerciseamlg so what happens next the fundraiser finishes next week then what what do you think will be the killer app — to use the worst term in venture capital who are your core customers what types of use cases are you excited aboutkb in general i think people have been trying to seek out the killer app of blockchains a bit too eagerly and haven’t really waited to see if the technology itself is reliable so we’re trying to build the most consistently executed blockchain that we can that’s on the engineering side but then realistically this has to have some utility i think there are cool use cases around things like online gaming those are kind of low hanging fruit in my opinion where this starts to get interesting is where you can integrate with more traditional industries and start to break the wall there what does a completely decentralized microinsurance agency look like what does a secondary market look like i’m pursuing some interesting partnerships and business development ideas i don’t want to show my cards too early but i think it’s going to be an interesting summer for tezos from that perspectivei’ve been approached by any number of businesses from healthcare to finance to online gaming all of which i think have a potential use case the problem becomes how do you prioritize your time i know for me i’d rather be doing business development meetings and going around evangelizing the technology rather than making sure that the fundraiser is set up in a secure way alas the responsible thing to do was to man the fundraiser and make sure it got out in the best and most professional way and not focus so much on doing pocs really what i want to do for tezos in the next year is kind of prove the need for smart contracts as a way to in some ways disintermediate third parties and in other ways to prove that there could be a completely digital economy that worksamlg how are you going to come down from all of this is there going to be  hours or  hours where you don’t have to caffeinate and you can decompresskb i tried that — it did not work i don’t know i’m kind of on a high right now i guess because we didn’t think this would ever happen tezos has been dead in the water several times over it’s surreal that people are connecting to the message i’m really happy about that it’s great gratification for arthur and myselfamlg thats awesome so i know we’ve both got to get going — thank you so much for taking the time to chatkb thank you for having me comment our investment in clarity money march  cooper zelnick rre ventures is excited to announce our series b investment in clarity money the nextgeneration personal financial manager focused on empowering consumers with an intelligent financial advocatethe recent proliferation of apps targeted at improving users’ financial health is no secret over the past few years dozens of companies have

effective and ondemand addiction treatment program for the millions of americans struggling with substance use originally offered exclusively through employers workit’s treatment program is now available directly to consumers delivering a crucial service to individuals freedom from addictionaddiction is an enormous problem in the united states affecting over  million americans with an additional  million engaged in risky patterns of use with alcohol andor drugs of those only  receive adequate treatment often because existing treatment options are too expensive too disruptive to be practical or do not align with their health goals what’s worse is that access to treatment is often not enough relapse rates associated with traditional addiction treatment programs exceed while new evidencebased treatment modalities and technological innovations have improved our understanding of addiction that understanding has yet to be implemented in the form of accessible affordable evidencebased care for highneed individuals with most diseases clinicians seek to identify isolate and then treat conditions as early as possible reducing costs and boosting outcomes but when it comes to addiction we wait until patients have “crashed” and only then begin to treat the underlying conditions the costs are staggering in this case about  billion annually and all too often the outcomes for individuals and their loved ones are catastrophicworkit health is solving this problem by delivering care which is affordable evidencebased judgmentfree and accessible to all individuals on their own terms moreover their program is sustainable individuals receive ongoing care beyond the initial ninetyday program and if this methodology for treating addiction seems obvious the implications of the program cannot be overstated workit’s program contains  core modules my mission body mind heart spirit and tribe users who have finished the core program continue to onward which provides continued support in the form of engaging curriculum and aftercare the promise of workit health for consumers is exceedingly powerful finally seeking treatment for addiction or risky behaviors is not at odds with continuing to work to live and to remain in one’s community workit’s program delivers a value proposition for employers which far exceeds the mere reduction of staff turnover absenteeism and workplace accidents as well the true promise of workit is the promise of compassionate visionary and highly effective treatment for everyone regardless of circumstance geographic location or ability to paywe’re honored to join lisa robin and the rest of the workit health team as they realize their vision and revolutionize the way addiction is understood perceived and treated across the united states comment our investment in pebble post february  jason black today we are excited to announce our lead investment in pebblepost’s m series bover the last decade advertising and marketing technology has gone through a massive transformation digital retargeting social media channels personalization and  most recently  programmatic have quickly become vital to the success of the modern cmo to date though one marketing channel has been left behind direct mailunderstandably so bits and bytes are the low hanging fruit our own portfolio reflects some of the players in that first wave of revolution sailthru leverages this flexibility to build email software that individually personalized email based on hundreds of data points beeswax enables companies to programmatically buy ads across the web based on a company’s proprietary data sets at scale and tweak and tune that optimization in real timebut as digital channels start to saturate marketers are looking for new differentiated and highly engaging ways to reconnect with their existing customers and intelligently reach out to new ones despite the disadvantages of printing and delivering a piece of snail mail direct mail is a massive industry byr for one simple reason — it works it works despite the fact that the most sophisticated providers rely solely on demographic and geotargeting data the tools and capabilities however have kept modern marketing professionals from wading into its opaque slow moving industryenter pebblepost to call pebblepost a direct mail company is like calling amazon a bookstore by marrying the best of traditional direct mail with the best of digital advertising the company empowers marketers to transform realtime interest and intent data into high quality personalized postcards and catalogs this enables pebblepost to reengage existing customers and critically target website prospects who have yet to convert because it begins online the pebblepost

full x digital retargeting campaignsas venture investors we invest in companies that use data and technology as a leverage point to create new business opportunities and build in stepfunction increases in performance and usability pebblepost does both in a big waywe couldn’t be more excited to be a partner along their journey in transforming what direct mail can do for brands around the globe comment our investment in knock home selling finally enters the age of the internet january  raju rishi rre ventures is excited to announce our series a investment in knock the modern way to sell your home knock — cofounded by former trulia founding team members sean black and jamie glenn along with cofounder and chief architect karan sakhuja — utilizes historical market and transaction data machine learning and intelligent pricing algorithms to predict home prices with unparalleled accuracy and to alleviate the pain of selling and buying a home by guaranteeing individuals the ability to sell their home within  weeks knock reduces the hassle uncertainty and inefficiency of selling a home and by offering to buy homes outright from homeowners knock solves a key pain point for the  of us homebuyers who must sell their existing home in order to afford a new onethe proliferation of techenabled marketplaces represents disruption at its best in aggregating a near limitless number of potential buyers and sellers these marketplaces have the potential to increase price transparency and drive transactional efficiency this not only creates value for businesses but drives significant value to consumers saving people money and time and nowhere are these savings more important than in the residential real estate market given that buying a home is often the most significant financial decision an individual will makeover the past several years the promise of fully efficient marketplaces has been realized even in historically slowmoving industries like commercial real estate today startups like floors and the square foot an rre portfolio company are bringing commercial listings online while hightower another rre portfolio company which recently merged with vts is driving efficiency by arming brokers with intelligent tools for managing leasing workflowsyet despite this proliferation of new marketplace businesses one space has been left behind until now there has been no true techenabled marketplace for selling residential real estate we believe that this market is finally ripe for disruption and there exists no better team to execute against knock’s visionby bringing listings online in a searchable way companies like zillow create transparency in the residential real estate market enabling consumers to search directly for properties however the actual transaction process remains time consuming inefficient and expensive for sellers and buyers alike while zillow renders properties searchable potential buyers and sellers are still forced to contact a broker hire a series of professionals to assist with the closing process and wait months to complete a transaction and the stakes are high if a sale falls through a family may no longer be able to afford the new house they were planning to buyknock solves this problem in an elegant and thoughtful way the immediate resonance of knock’s value proposition with consumers serves as further evidence that despite the prevalence of online real estate listings actually buying and selling a home remains a legacy experience fundamentally knock is a transactionoriented marketplace for real estate two of knock’s cofounders having deep domain expertise as founding team members of trulia made knock an especially compelling investment for us moreover the rest of the knock team are uniquely positioned to solve this problem the promise of knock is that a homeowner can sell his or her house within six weeks or that knock will buy it directly this is the promise of the truly efficient marketplace we couldn’t be more excited to work with sean jamie and the rest of the team at knockthank you to my rre colleague cooper zelnick for helping with this post  comment building bridges and the future of healthcare january  raju rishi rre ventures is excited to announce our series b investment in redox the modern api for healthcare redox is building a highly scalable network which integrates healthcare applications and health systems today redox is the leading healthcare integration platform with the largest ecosystem of enterprise applications and tomorrow redox will become a powerful force for the achievement of better data better patient care and better outcomes across our nation’s entire healthcare systemthe thesis which led to our investment in redox is simple said raju rishi and cooper zelnick who have joined redoxs board the proliferation of consumer healthcare devices the explosion of healthcare applications and the trend towards datadriven healthcare creates an enormous opportunity for patients providers and payers alike however the complexity of legacy electronic health records and other healthcare technologies has made it increasingly difficult for healthcare system cios to keep up with the demands of both doctors and patients for application integrations as a result healthcare feels like an industry left behind by the data revolution we believe that the true promise of valuebased care and dramatically improved outcomes will not be realized until new technologies can rapidly penetrate existing healthcare systemsafter meeting luke niko and james redox’s three cofounders we knew we had found the team to solve this problem and since launching in  they’ve done just that their extensive backgrounds in healthcare interoperability all three worked for epic systems in madison wisconsin makes them uniquely positioned to understand and solve this key problem in healthcare our partnership with redox represents not only an investment in a painful problem within a massive space but also an investment in an unparalleled team of passionate domain expertsredox is the first and only company developing a networked approach to healthcare interoperability after evaluating the landscape of interoperability solution providers we came to believe that businesses enabling oneoff pointtopoint healthcare connections fall short of achieving the ultimate goal of data liquidity in healthcare redox with its scalable reusable infrastructure and standardized data models has created a unique elegant and exceedingly valuable solution to this problemcoupled with the redox team’s deep technical expertise the company’s location in madison wisconsin gives redox several key competitive advantages beyond unparalleled access to craft beer and cheese curds luke niko james and the rest of the redox team are recognized as thought leaders within madison’s health tech ecosystem enabling the company to recruit talent operate efficiently and secure key partnerships in a large and growing market we look forward to working closely with the redox team as they help payors providers and patients work together to realize the promise of better cheaper smarter healthcare for everyone  comment rre ventures gp v llc top holdings whalewisdom search all search f filers only search sec filer
