keith busse built sdi by taking risks story print create a hardcopy of this page font size default font size larger font size posted sunday july    am keith busse built sdi by taking risks by rick farrant rfarrantfwbusinesscom kpcnewscom   comments keith busse relaxed and assured in a brown leather chair in his wellappointed fort wayne office was several minutes into his earnest explanation about the importance of education he had talked about how education had helped him rise from a childhood of modest means how it can help others and why his company and foundation give millions of dollars to educational initiatives and then suddenly he paused his face stiffened and tears pooled in his eyes when he resumed speaking the voice was soft and halting “if i could give every deserving kid in this community an opportunity to be educated i’d do it” he said his voice trailing to a whisper “i believe that” he paused again brushed at the tears on his cheeks and fought for composure “i just know how hard i struggled” he continued “if i can make the path clearer better for others then responsible people i think give back i love kids” this from a man who is at the helm of the nation’s fifthlargest producer of carbon steel products — a company he said that could generate as much as  billion in revenue this year and produce   to  million tons of steel this from a man whose net worth by his own admission is in the tens of millions of dollars and who owns homes in aboite township lake wawasee and sarasota fla give the yearold founder chairman and ceo of steel dynamics inc any reasonable time to talk about his life and career and education children and family will be recurring topics but so too will be his love for the art of a deal and his perpetual attraction to risks and life’s edges whether it’s driving a race car flying a world war ii airplane or buying the fastest jet skis and snowmobiles on the market he is a complex selfmade maverick of great compassion shrewd leadership uncommon daring and community influence such stature wasn’t in his plan he said all he ever really wanted growing up in fort wayne was to become an engineer — because he loved tinkering with things — and raise a family he never had a thought of running a large company or acquiring significant wealth in fact the mere idea of affluence was far from his reach as a child his story told in measured friendly and sometimes folksy tones is he said a testament to hard work and perseverance his father earl and mother roxie pieced together jobs to keep busse and his younger sister marsha fed clothed and schooled his father was a firefighter who also took jobs pounding tent stakes for area fairs and delivering flowers his mother worked government jobs including helping register voters what they couldn’t give busse in financial privilege they made up for in values that he tries to follow to this day “the value system they gave me was excellent” he said “it revolved around honesty integrity work ethic — things of that nature “i was raised in a parochial grade school and if nothing else felt that the ten commandments were value systems we should live by none of us do and we all break some commandments along the way but i never stole anything in my life you either work hard to get it or you don’t get it and you don’t take advantage of people “i was always raised to treat people well be polite and to respect them respect was a big thing in my family honesty and integrity were big things” armed with those values and a dedication to his schoolwork busse applied and was accepted to purdue university in west lafayette upon graduating from north side high school he was rocketready to fulfill his dream of becoming an engineer — until the matter of tuition came up “mom and pop said ‘son where are you getting the money’ i assumed that since my friends were going off to college — iu and purdue — that i’d go off to college and the money would be taken care of somehow i’d have to work when i was down there i understood that but the system of lending money to students — you know student loans — didn’t exist back then to my knowledge” he asked his godfather charles diek for advice and his godfather told him “sometimes the path you mentally choose in your head isn’t the trail you end up driving your cart down i know you wanted to be an engineer but the money for that kind of education is not in place at this point in time” diek loaned busse  and suggested busse go to international business college to get a twoyear degree in accounting busse complied and helped pay for his schooling by pumping gas and unloading tires and batteries at a montgomery ward service station after graduating he took several accounting jobs got married began raising a family and decided to go back to school to further his education at thensaint francis college he landed through tireless work significant accounting and management jobs at wayne pump co and later dresser industries while obtaining a bachelor’s degree in business from saint francis and a master’s degree in business from indiana universitypurdue university fort wayne the marriage meanwhile was the first of two in busse’s life and busse is unusually forthright in his assessment of the demise of both in hindsight he understands the dynamics that led to the divorces and even today harbors a regret or two but he has profound pride in the five nowgrown children those marriages brought — dawn michael angela christopher and aaron — and in a sixth “semiadopted” child whose story underscores busse’s passion for giving young people opportunity he met anastasia grotov then  on a business trip to russia in the early ’s and with the blessing of anastasia’s father fulfilled her dream of visiting america anastasia spent several months living with busse’s family eventually went on to graduate with a finance degree from the university of california at berkeley and she and her russianborn physicist husband yuri are now steel dynamics employees busse’s dream — or rather the dream he never imagined as a child — was still a ways off after he finished college and joined charlotte ncbased nucor in  at the age of  but with the help of mentor and nucor legendary leader ken iverson he steadily rose through the ranks of the company became vice president and set the course for unthinkable success busse tells stories of risk and innovation at nucor of helping keep his division afloat during the recession of the early ’s — sometimes with a profit cushion of only a few hundred dollars — and of playing an instrumental role in nucor’s unveiling of a minimill later in the decade that revolutionized steelmaking that minimill constructed for  million in crawfordsville and employing advanced german technology used electric arc furnaces instead of blast furnaces cast ribbons of steel  inches thick instead of nearly a foot thick and in all phases was more efficient and less expensive than the operations of “big boys” like us steel and bethlehem steel busse’s involvement with the technology made him and colleagues mark millett and richard teets jr hot commodities and all three were on the verge of going their separate ways when busse said he invited them to a meeting and a beer at a crawfordsville holiday inn “i postulated” he said “that instead of all of us going our separate ways in life and leaving nucor that we ought to think about doing this minimill technology ourselves because there’s no one else who knows how to do it “’right now we’re pretty unique characters’ i told them ‘and we might have a shot at going out and raising  million to create a brand new steel company which hadn’t been done in a hundred years’ “of course they looked at me laughed at me and thought i was nuts” but the three eventually worked up a business plan raised  million in financing and got started on sdi’s butler plant in  of the  million about  came from busse millett and teets there were a fair number of doubters that the three could pull it off busse said but today steel dynamics’ influence in the steelmaking industry is unquestioned publicly held sdi has five steel mills utilizing minimill technology — in butler columbia city pittsboro roanoke va and huntington wva — and four galvanizing facilities it purchased local metal recycler omnisource corp in  and operates  recycling centers around the country sdi employs more than  people the risk busse said paid off like so many other risks he’s taken he once invested in a fort wayne gun shop hh firearms and helped elevate the business’ profits he recently became a shareholder in dealership holdings llc the entity that oversees the string of kelley auto dealerships and said restructuring has already boosted the enterprise’s bottom line even the mere act of steelmaking itself he pointed out carries risk “there’s something exciting about degree hot metal that’s dangerous” he said “i mean it’s like living on the edge” then he quickly added “in this business you cannot afford to have an accident because somebody loses their life so our safety record is the most important thing we focus on inside this company safety safety safety safety” one venture that didn’t pan out was a partnership in a corvette classics museum along interstate  that never seemed to draw enough visitors busse said he still has  of the corvettes once housed in the museum but his overall record of success and penchant for always staying active always trying new things and caring about people — his employees his family and the community at large — has propelled busse’s name to prominence in recent years he serves on no fewer than seven boards of regional organizations and is spearheading business advocacy through the recent formation of the regional chamber of northeast indiana since  busse’s name has also been attached to four educationrelated facilities in northeast indiana the keith busse school of business and entrepreneurial leadership at the university of saint francis the steel dynamics inc keith e busse technology center at ivy tech community collegenortheast the keith e bussesteel dynamics athletic and recreation center at trine university and the keith busse steel dynamics alumni center under construction at ipfw steel dynamics or its foundation donated hefty amounts to each project but busse said he never asked that his name or his company’s name be emblazoned front and center that simply wouldn’t be in keeping with his humble beginnings or his heart for giving others a shot at success “they don’t have to put my name on it” he said sipping coffee from a plain styrofoam cup “it’s not what’s important it’s not about ego for me “if the people who receive the benefit of all this have done their homework and they understand that i’m someone who has pulled himself up by his bootstraps — i was not born with a silver spoon — i guess what’s refreshing about being known to others is that it creates a cando spirit in them it’s important that they understand that an education is valuable and that it is a gift and that they can go out and do things with that gift “i hope it’s an inspiration” he said “i know i would be inspired by someone who went out and in spite of all the odds being against him did something with his life” sdi timeline  sdi is incorporated and construction
