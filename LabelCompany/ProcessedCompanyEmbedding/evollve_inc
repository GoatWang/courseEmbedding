for detecting color and contrast allowing it to follow paths drawn on a white piece of paper or generated by an accompanying tablet app there is some measure of artificial intelligence baked into ozobot’s firmware allowing it to make random decisions on where to turn when the line it’s following ends up in an intersection but ozobot can also be told how to behave differently by simply introducing specific colored sequences into the path it’s following for example if it rolls over a sequence of blue red blue it will turn around and reverse direction where as blue green blue will
