dick young richardcyoungcomthe online home of author and investor dick young dick young i am head of global investment strategy for richard c young  co ltd naples florida and newport ri i founded the company which today is run by my son matt to provide investment management services for discerning conservative retired and soontoberetired investors our company’s focus is on a prudent mix of dividends and interest combined with patience and the profound longterm power of the two most important words in investing compound interest i began my investment studies while still a student at shaker heights high school in ohio and completed my initial studies as an investment major bs at babson college in the early ’s i began my investment career with the help of ed rosenberg at clayton securities in boston this was followed by an extended period in institutional research and trading first with model roland and then with hoenig  co in the late ’s i founded young research  publishing to publish young’s world money forecast a page monthly report for institutional investors corporate financial officers business owners and individual international investors my focus was on us monetary policy us economic momentum world currencies and gold today i continue my research in each of these areas and develop our family investment company’s strategy based on this research since  i have focused increasingly on the mounting threat of radical islamic terrorism and its potential impact on us investors although i wish it were different no other threat is as important in understanding the potential longterm risks and rewards for us investors back in the early ’s i began to focus on inference reading as my preferred methodology for forming investment strategy most of my day is spent reading i don’t commute attend meetings supervise employees belong to boards or spend much time on the phone i read the computer of course in an invaluable support tool but it is books authoritative journals industry and trade reports and long running special interest periodicals that provide my foundation and while i wish politics did not have to be a primary consideration for investors history demonstrates that it does us companies and thus the securities of us companies perform best in an environment of low taxes low inflation low interest rates reduced central government regulation and small government in order for america’s internationally focused business enterprises to maintain their most competitive edge there is an urgent need in this country for sweeping tax and judicial system reform i am a powerful supporter of the originalist approach to constitutional interpretation i believe as associate justice thomas believes that “we should interpret the constitution as drafted not as we would have it drafted” many of the foundation principles i look to as forming the ideal setting for internationally competitive us business enterprises are articulated by the republican study committee which reviews every piece of legislation under consideration on the house floor the six guiding principles printed on the rsc’s “conservative check card” are  less government  lower taxes  personal responsibility  individual freedom  stronger families and  domestic tranquility and national defense i am a cato institute benefactor strong supporter of the american conservative paleoconservative thought and the swiss way nro patron and life member of the national rifle association nra i am also a florida concealed weapons license holder in terms of domestic tranquility my focus is on the us constitution’s second amendment which states “a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed” my home state of florida i live in key west leads the way in second amendment rights for americans florida passed its landmark castle doctrine self defense law in  and passed the preservation and protection of the right to keep and bear arms in motor vehicles act the biggest lobby in washington is the nra with over four million members and the nra is of course america’s leading proponent of second amendment rights for all in his campaign for governor louisiana governor bobby jindal produced an excellent position paper entitled fresh start for louisiana governor jindal’s driving theme is to eliminate roadblocks that stifle investment and to develop new incentives to expand louisiana’s economy governor jindal has a lot to teach our backwardlooking rustbelt states like ohio as the wall street journal notes “ohio’s most crippling handicap may be that its politiciansand thus its employersare still in the grip of such industrial unions as the united auto workers ohio is a ‘closed shop’ state which means workers can be forced to join a union whether they wish to or not ohio has an economy suppressed by high taxes and work rules that impose heavy costs on employers texas by comparison embraces free trade keeps taxes low doesn’t impose unions on business and has tooled itself for st century competition” tort reform is another major focus of mine and has proven itself extremely useful in promoting better health care as a recent wall street journal editorial also noted “over the past three years some  mds have flooded into texas” and trial lawyers are pouring out texas governor perry and louisiana governor jindal obviously are students of supplyside economics cutting marginal tax rates to boost incentives to supply labor and capital to encourage private output is powerful medicine cutting government spending to free resources for private use is a hallmark of supplyside economics a sound currency is the lynchpin using deficits to power demand is off the radar and money growth must be curbed to combat inflation in june of  milton friedman told wall street journal readers “to mr reagan of course holding down government spending was a means to an end not an end in itself few people in human history have contributed more to the achievement of human freedom than ronald wilson reagan” in the conscience of a conservative barry goldwater wrote “the graduated tax is a confiscation tax its effect and to a large extent its aim is to bring down all men to a common level many of the leading proponents of the graduated tax frankly admit that their purpose is to redistribute the nation’s wealth their aim is an egalitarian societyan objective that does violence both to the charter of the republic and the laws of nature we are all equal in the eyes of god but we are equal in no other respect artificial devices for enforcing equality among unequal men must be rejected if we would restore that charter and honor those laws one problem with regards to taxes then is to enforce justice – to abolish the graduated features of our tax law and the sooner we get at the job the better” the wsj noted recently that senator goldwater’s smallgovernment strongmilitary anticommunist alternative to a democratic governmentcanfixit philosophy stemmed from the new deal as mr goldwater wrote in his  book “my aim is not to pass laws but to repeal them” i have developed richardcyoungcom as an ongoing forum to deliver daily updated content on many areas of my direct focus included here are terrorism and politics as well as personal interests that include music health and travel with special emphasis on key west at wwwyounginvestmentscom i introduce you to our family investment management company please feel free to call and
