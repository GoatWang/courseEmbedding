superior riskadjusted returns for all stakeholders through disciplined acquisitions sustainable harvests and welltimed sales strategy our objective is to maximize total returns for our shareholders by providing ongoing dividends derived from sustainable harvesting from our existing portfolios of highquality us timberlands  we also intend to selectively pursue timberland acquisition opportunities with focused efforts in the most commercially desirable timberproducing regions of the us south and us pacific northwest although we may also pursue opportunistic acquisitions outside of these regions the current housing market recovery and supply disruptions in canadian timber markets bode well for increasing demand for our timber products from domestic as well as offshore users over the longterm we do not engage in timberrelated manufacturing operations which allows us to focus on optimal management of our timberlands and prevents us from being exposed to the risks inherent in direct ownership of timberrelated manufacturing operations more property highlights catchmark manages approximately  acres of highquality commercial timberland located in alabama florida georgia louisiana
