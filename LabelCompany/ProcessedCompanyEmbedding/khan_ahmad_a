advised the british to appoint muslims to assist in administration to prevent what he called ‘haramzadgi’ a vulgar deed such as the mutiny maulana altaf hussain hali wrote in the biography of sir syed that as soon as sir syed reached muradabad he began to write the pamphlet entitled the causes of the indian revolt asbabebaghawatehind in which he did his best to clear the people of india and especially the muslims of the charge of mutiny in spite of the obvious danger he made a courageous and thorough report of the accusations people were making against the government and refused the theory which the british had invented to explain the causes of the mutiny when the work was finished without waiting for an english translation sir syed sent the urdu version to be printed at the mufassilat gazette press in agra within a few weeks he received  copies back from the printers his friend warned him not to send the pamphlet to parliament or to the government of india rae shankar

own people of his country and of the government itself he said that if he came to any harm while doing something that would greatly benefit the rulers and the subjects of india alike he would gladly suffer whatever befell him when rae shankar das saw that sir syeds mind was made up and nothing could be done to change it he wept and remained silent after performing a supplementary prayer and asking gods blessing sir syed sent almost all the  copies of his pamphlet to england one to the government and kept the rest himself when the government of india had the book translated and presented before the council lord canning the governorgeneral and sir bartle frere accepted it as a sincere and friendly report the foreign secretary cecil beadon however severely attacked it calling it an extremely seditious pamphlet he wanted a proper inquiry into the matter and said that the author unless he could give a satisfactory explanation should be harshly dealt with since no other member of the council agreed with his opinion his attack did no harm later sir syed was invited to attend lord cannings durbar in farrukhabad and happened to meet the foreign secretary there he told sir syed that he was displeased with the pamphlet and added that if he had really had the governments interests at heart he would not have made his opinion known in this way throughout the country he would have communicated it directly to the government sir syed replied that he had only had  copies printed the majority of which he had sent to england one had been given to the government of india and the remaining copies were still in his possession furthermore he had the receipt to prove it he was aware he added that the view of the rulers had been distorted by the stress and anxieties of the times which made it difficult to put even the most straightforward problem in its right perspective it was for this reason that he had not communicated his thoughts publicly he promised that for every copy that could be found circulating in india he would personally pay  rupees at first beadon was not convinced and asked sir syed over and over again if he was sure that no other copy had been distributed in india sir syed reassured him on this matter and beadon never mentioned it again later he became one of sir syeds strongest supporters many official translations were made of the urdu text of the causes of the indian revolt the one undertaken by the india office formed the subject of many discussions and debates the pamphlet was also translated by the government of india and several members of parliament but no version was offered to the public a translation which had been started by a government official was finished by sir syeds great friend colonel gfi graham and finally published in  influence of mirza ghalibedit the court of akbar an illustration from a manuscript of the aineakbari in  he finished his scholarly well researched and illustrated edition of abul fazls aine akbari itself an extraordinarily difficult book having finished the work to his satisfaction and believing that mirza asadullah khan ghalib was a person who would appreciate his labours syed ahmad approached the great ghalib to write a taqriz in the convention of the times a laudatory foreword for it ghalib obliged but what he did produce was a short persian poem castigating the aine akbari and by implication the imperial sumptuous literate and learned mughal culture of which it was a product the least that could be said against it was that the book had little value even as an antique document ghalib practically reprimanded syed ahmad khan for wasting his talents and time on dead things worse he praised skyhigh the sahibs of england who at that time held all the keys to all the a’ins in this world the poem was unexpected but it came at the time when syed ahmad khans thought and feelings themselves were inclining toward change ghalib seemed to be acutely aware of a europeanenglishsponsored change in world polity especially indian polity syed ahmad might well have been piqued at ghalibs admonitions but he would also have realized that ghalibs reading of the situation though not nuanced enough was basically accurate syed ahmad khan may also have felt that he being better informed about the english and the outside world should have himself seen the change that now seemed to be just round the corner sir syed ahmad khan never again wrote a word in praise of the aine akbari and in fact gave up taking active interest in history and archaeology he did edit another two historical texts over the next few years but neither of them was anything like the ain a vast and triumphalist document on the governance of akbar scholarly worksedit first issue of the

reputation of a cultured scholar in  he completed the jilaulqulub bi zikril mahbub and the tuhfaihasan along with the tahsil fi jarisaqil in  these works focused on religious and cultural subjects in  he published the two works namiqa dar bayan masala tasawwurishaikh and silsilat ulmulk he released the second edition of ansarassanadid in  he also started work on a commentary on the bible – the first by a muslim – in which he argued that islam was the closest religion to christianity with a common lineage from abrahamic religions he began with genesis and matthew the first books of the old and new testament but quit his project before even completing those first two his other writings such as loyal muhammadans of india tabyinulkalam and a series of essays on the life of muhammad and subjects subsidiary therein helped to create cordial relations between the british authorities and the muslim community throughout his life syed ahmad found time for literary and scholarly pursuits

insurrections aided and led by the east india company and the british empire had diminished the extent and power of the mughal state reducing its monarch to figurehead with his elder brother syed muhammad bin muttaqi khan sir syed was raised in a large house in a wealthy area of the city they were raised in strict accordance with mughal noble traditions and exposed to politics their mother azizunnisa played a formative role in sir syeds early life raising him with rigid discipline with a strong emphasis on modern education sir syed was taught to read and understand the holy quran by a female tutor which was unusual at the time he received an education traditional to muslim nobility in delhi under the charge of lord wellesley  sir syed was trained in persian arabic urdu and orthodox religious subjectscitation needed he read the works of muslim scholars and writers such as sahbai rumi and ghalibcitation needed other tutors instructed him in mathematics astronomy and islamic jurisprudence sir syed was also adept at swimming wrestling and other sports he took an active part in the mughal courts cultural activities his elder brother founded the citys first printing press in the urdu language along with the journal sayyadulakbarcitation needed sir syed pursued the study of medicine for several years but did not complete the course until the death of his father in  sir syed had lived a life customary for an affluent young muslim noble upon his fathers death he inherited the titles of his grandfather and father and was awarded the title of arif jung by the emperor bahadur shah zafar financial difficulties put an end to sir syeds formal education although he continued to study in private using books on a variety of subjects sir syed assumed editorship of his brothers journal and rejected offers of employment from the mughal court careeredit nawab mohsinulmulk sir syed ahmed khan justice syed mahmood he was the first muslim to serve as a high court judge in the british raj having recognized the steady decline in mughal political power sir syed decided to enter the service of the east india company he could not enter the english civil service because it was only in the s that natives were admitted he did not attend the east india company college which was not a college and did not grant degrees in law or anything else his first appointment was as a serestadar lit clerk at the courts of law in agra responsible for recordkeeping and managing court affairs in  he was promoted to the title of munshi in  he was appointed to a highranking post at the court in muradabad where he began working on his most famous literary work acquainted with highranking british officials sir syed obtained close knowledge about british colonial politics during his service at the courts at the outbreak of the indian rebellion on  may  sir syed was serving as the chief assessment officer at the court in bijnorcitation needed northern india became the scene of the most intense fighting the conflict had left large numbers of civilians dead erstwhile centres of muslim power such as delhi agra lucknow and kanpur were severely affected sir syed was personally affected by the violence and the ending of the mughal dynasty amongst many other longstanding kingdomscitation needed sir syed and many other muslims took this as a defeat of muslim society he lost several close relatives who died in the violence although he succeeded in rescuing his mother from the turmoil she died in meerut owing to the privations she had experienced social reforms in the muslim society were initiated by abdul latif who founded the mohammedan literary society in bengal sir syed ahmed khan established the mao college which eventually became the aligarh muslim university he opposed ignorance superstitions and evil customs prevalent in indian muslim society he firmly believed that muslim society would not progress without the acquisition of western education and science as time passed sir syed began stressing on idea of pragmatic modernism and started advocating for strong interfaith relations between islam and christianity causes of the indian revoltedit sir syed supported the british during the  uprising a role which has been criticised by some nationalists such as jamaluddin afghani in  sir syed published the booklet asbabebaghawatehind the causes of the indian revolt in which he studied the causes of the indian revolt in this his most famous work he rejected the common notion that the conspiracy was planned by muslim élites who were insecure at the diminishing influence of muslim monarchs he blamed the british east india company for its aggressive expansion as well as the ignorance of british politicians regarding indian culture sir syed advised the british to appoint muslims to assist in administration to prevent what he called ‘haramzadgi’ a vulgar deed such as the mutiny maulana altaf hussain hali wrote in the biography of sir syed that as soon as sir syed reached muradabad he began to write the pamphlet entitled the causes of the indian revolt asbabebaghawatehind in which he did his best to clear the people of india and especially the muslims of the charge of mutiny in spite of the obvious danger he made a courageous and thorough report of the accusations people were making against the government and refused the theory which the british had invented to explain the causes of the mutiny when the work was finished without waiting for an english translation sir syed sent the urdu version to be printed at the mufassilat gazette press in agra within a few weeks he received  copies back from the printers his friend warned him not to send the pamphlet to parliament or to the government of india rae shankar das a great friend of sir syed begged him to burn the books rather than put his life in danger sir syed replied that he was bringing these matters to the attention of the british for the good of his own people of his country and of the government itself he said that if he came to any harm while doing something that would greatly benefit the rulers and the subjects of india alike he would gladly suffer whatever befell him when rae shankar das saw that sir syeds mind was made up and nothing could be done to change it he wept and remained silent after performing a supplementary prayer and asking gods blessing sir syed sent almost all the  copies of his pamphlet to england one to the government and kept the rest himself when the government of india had the book translated and presented before the council lord canning the governorgeneral and sir bartle frere accepted it as a sincere and friendly report the foreign secretary cecil beadon however severely attacked it calling it an extremely seditious pamphlet he wanted a proper inquiry into the matter and said that the author unless he could give a satisfactory explanation should be harshly dealt with since no other member of the council agreed with his opinion his attack did no harm later sir syed was invited to attend lord cannings durbar in farrukhabad and happened to meet the foreign secretary there he told sir syed that he was displeased with the pamphlet and added that if he had really had the governments interests at heart he would not have made his opinion known in this way throughout the country he would have communicated it directly to the government sir syed replied that he had only had  copies printed the majority of which he had sent to england one had been given to the government of india and the remaining copies were still in his possession furthermore he had the receipt to prove it he was aware he added that the view of the rulers had been distorted by the stress and anxieties of the times which made it difficult to put even the most straightforward problem in its right perspective it was for this reason that he had not communicated his thoughts publicly he promised that for every copy that could be found circulating in india he would personally pay  rupees at first beadon was not convinced and asked sir syed over and over again if he was sure that no other copy had been distributed in india sir syed reassured him on this matter and beadon never mentioned it again later he became one of sir syeds strongest supporters many official translations were made of the urdu text of the causes of the indian revolt the one undertaken by the india office formed the subject of many discussions and debates the pamphlet was also translated by the government of india and several members of parliament but no version was offered to the public a translation which had been started by a government official was finished by sir syeds great friend colonel gfi graham and finally published in  influence of mirza ghalibedit the court of akbar an illustration from a manuscript of the aineakbari in  he finished his scholarly well researched and illustrated edition of abul fazls aine akbari itself an extraordinarily difficult book having finished the work to his satisfaction and believing that mirza asadullah khan ghalib was a person who would appreciate his labours syed ahmad approached the great ghalib to write a taqriz in the convention of the times a laudatory foreword for it ghalib obliged but what he did produce was a short persian poem castigating the aine akbari and by implication the imperial sumptuous literate and learned mughal culture of which it was a product the least that could be said against it was that the book had little value even as an antique document ghalib practically reprimanded syed ahmad khan for wasting his talents and time on dead things worse he praised skyhigh the sahibs of england who at that time held all the keys to all the a’ins in this world the poem was unexpected but it came at the time when syed ahmad khans thought and feelings themselves were inclining toward change ghalib seemed to be acutely aware of a europeanenglishsponsored change in world polity especially indian polity syed ahmad might well have been piqued at ghalibs admonitions but he would also have realized that ghalibs reading of the situation though not nuanced enough was basically accurate syed ahmad khan may also have felt that he being better informed about the english and the outside world should have himself seen the change that now seemed to be just round the corner sir syed ahmad khan never again wrote a word in praise of the aine akbari and in fact gave up taking active interest in history and archaeology he did edit another two historical texts over the next few years but neither of them was anything like the ain a vast and triumphalist document on the governance of akbar scholarly worksedit first issue of the journal muhammadan social reformer dated  december  it was a pioneering publication initiated by sir syed to promote liberal ideas in muslim society while continuing to work as a junior clerk sir syed began focusing on writing from the age of  in  on various subjects from mechanics to educational issues mainly in urdu where he wrote at least  pages his career as an author began when he published a series of treatises in urdu on religious subjects in  he published the book asaarussanadeed great monuments documenting antiquities of delhi dating from the medieval era this work earned him the reputation of a cultured scholar in  he completed the jilaulqulub bi zikril mahbub and the tuhfaihasan along with the tahsil fi jarisaqil in  these works focused on religious and cultural subjects in  he published the two works namiqa dar bayan masala tasawwurishaikh and silsilat ulmulk he released the second edition of ansarassanadid in  he also started work on a commentary on the bible – the first by a muslim – in which he argued that islam was the closest religion to christianity with a common lineage from abrahamic religions he began with genesis and matthew the first books of the old and new testament but quit his project before even completing those first two his other writings such as loyal muhammadans of india tabyinulkalam and a series of essays on the life of muhammad and subjects subsidiary therein helped to create cordial relations between the british authorities and the muslim community throughout his life syed ahmad found time for literary and scholarly pursuits the range of his literary and scholarly interests was very wide history politics archaeology journalism literature religion and science the scope of his major writings is indeed amazing majority are

advised the british to appoint muslims to assist in administration to prevent what he called ‘haramzadgi’ a vulgar deed such as the mutiny maulana altaf hussain hali wrote in the biography of sir syed

especially the muslims of the charge of mutiny in spite of the obvious danger he made a courageous and thorough report of the accusations people were making against the government and refused the theory which the british had invented to explain the causes of the mutiny when the work was finished without waiting for an english translation sir syed sent the urdu version to be printed at the mufassilat gazette press in agra within a few weeks he received  copies back from the printers his friend warned him not to send the pamphlet to parliament or to the government of india rae shankar

own people of his country and of the government itself he said that if he came to any harm while doing something that would greatly benefit the rulers and the subjects of india alike he would gladly suffer whatever befell him when rae shankar das saw that sir syeds mind was made up and nothing could be done to change it he wept and remained silent after performing a supplementary prayer and asking gods blessing sir syed sent almost all the  copies of his pamphlet to england one to the government and kept the rest himself when the government of india had the book translated and presented before the council lord canning the governorgeneral and sir bartle frere accepted it as a sincere and friendly report the foreign secretary cecil beadon however severely attacked it calling it an extremely seditious pamphlet he wanted a proper inquiry into the matter and said that the author unless he could give a satisfactory explanation should be harshly dealt with since no other member of the council agreed with his opinion his attack did no harm later sir syed was invited to attend lord cannings durbar in farrukhabad and happened to meet the foreign secretary there he told sir syed that he was displeased with the pamphlet and added that if he had really had the governments interests at heart he would not have made his opinion known in this way throughout the country he would have communicated it directly to the government sir syed replied that he had only had  copies printed the majority of which he had sent to england one had been given to the government of india and the remaining copies were still in his possession furthermore he had the receipt to prove it he was aware he added that the view of the rulers had been distorted by the stress and anxieties of the times which made it difficult to put even the most straightforward problem in its right perspective it was for this reason that he had not communicated his thoughts publicly he promised that for every copy that could be found circulating in india he would personally pay  rupees at first beadon was not convinced and asked sir syed over and over again if he was sure that no other copy had been distributed in india sir syed reassured him on this matter and beadon never mentioned it again later he became one of sir syeds strongest supporters many official translations were made of the urdu text of the causes of the indian revolt the one undertaken by the india office formed the subject of many discussions and debates the pamphlet was also translated by the government of india and several members of parliament but no version was offered to the public a translation which had been started by a government official was finished by sir syeds great friend colonel gfi graham and finally published in  influence of mirza ghalibedit the court of akbar an illustration from a manuscript of the aineakbari in  he finished his scholarly well researched and illustrated edition of abul fazls aine akbari itself an extraordinarily difficult book having finished the work to his satisfaction and believing that mirza asadullah khan ghalib was a person who would appreciate his labours syed ahmad approached the great ghalib to write a taqriz in the convention of the times a laudatory foreword for it ghalib obliged but what he did produce was a short persian poem castigating the aine akbari and by implication the imperial sumptuous literate and learned mughal culture of which it was a product the least that could be said against it was that the book had little value even as an antique document ghalib practically reprimanded syed ahmad khan for wasting his talents and time on dead things worse he praised skyhigh the sahibs of england who at that time held all the keys to all the a’ins in this world the poem was unexpected but it came at the time when syed ahmad khans thought and feelings themselves were inclining toward change ghalib seemed to be acutely aware of a europeanenglishsponsored change in world polity especially indian polity syed ahmad might well have been piqued at ghalibs admonitions but he would also have realized that ghalibs reading of the situation though not nuanced enough was basically accurate syed ahmad khan may also have felt that he being better informed about the english and the outside world should have himself seen the change that now seemed to be just round the corner sir syed ahmad khan never again wrote a word in praise of the aine akbari and in fact gave up taking active interest in history and archaeology he did edit another two historical texts over the next few years but neither of them was anything like the ain a vast and triumphalist document on the governance of akbar scholarly worksedit first issue of the

he published the two works namiqa dar bayan masala tasawwurishaikh and silsilat ulmulk he released the second edition of ansarassanadid in  he also started work on a commentary on the bible – the

and new testament but quit his project before even completing those first two his other writings such as loyal muhammadans of india tabyinulkalam and a series of essays on the life of muhammad and

azizunnisa played a formative role in sir syeds early life raising him with rigid discipline with a strong emphasis on modern education sir syed was taught to read and understand the holy quran by a

brothers journal and rejected offers of employment from the mughal court careeredit nawab mohsinulmulk sir syed ahmed khan justice syed mahmood he was the first muslim to serve as a high court judge in the british raj having recognized the steady decline in mughal political power sir syed decided to enter the service of the east india company he could not enter the english civil service because it was only in the s that natives were admitted he did not attend the east india company college which was not a college and did not grant degrees in law or anything else his first appointment was as

affected by the violence and the ending of the mughal dynasty amongst many other longstanding kingdomscitation needed sir syed and many other muslims took this as a defeat of muslim society he lost several close relatives who died in the violence although he succeeded in rescuing his mother from the turmoil she died in meerut owing to the privations she had experienced social reforms in the muslim society were initiated by abdul latif who founded the mohammedan literary society in bengal sir syed ahmed khan established the mao college which eventually became the aligarh muslim university

syed supported the british during the  uprising a role which has been criticised by some nationalists such as jamaluddin afghani in  sir syed published the booklet asbabebaghawatehind the causes of the indian revolt in which he studied the causes of the indian revolt in this his most famous work he rejected the common notion that the conspiracy was planned by muslim élites who were insecure at the diminishing influence of muslim monarchs he blamed the british east india company for its aggressive expansion as well as the ignorance of british politicians regarding indian culture sir syed advised the british to appoint muslims to assist in administration to prevent what he called ‘haramzadgi’ a vulgar deed such as the mutiny maulana altaf hussain hali wrote in the biography of sir syed that as soon as sir syed reached muradabad he began to write the pamphlet entitled the causes of the indian revolt asbabebaghawatehind in which he did his best to clear the people of india and especially the muslims of the charge of mutiny in spite of the obvious danger he made a courageous and thorough report of the accusations people were making against the government and refused the theory which the british had invented to explain the causes of the mutiny when the work was finished without waiting for an english translation sir syed sent the urdu version to be printed at the mufassilat gazette press in agra within a few weeks he received  copies back from the printers his friend warned him not to send the pamphlet to parliament or to the government of india rae shankar das a great friend of sir syed begged him to burn the books rather than put his life in danger sir syed replied that he was bringing these matters to the attention of the british for the good of his own people of his country and of the government itself he said that if he came to any harm while doing something that would greatly benefit the rulers and the subjects of india alike he would gladly suffer whatever befell him when rae shankar das saw that sir syeds mind was made up and nothing could be done to change it he wept and remained silent after performing a supplementary prayer and asking gods blessing sir syed sent almost all the  copies of his pamphlet to england one to the government and kept the rest himself when the government of india had the book translated and presented before the council lord canning the governorgeneral and sir bartle frere accepted it as a sincere and friendly report the foreign secretary cecil beadon however severely attacked it calling it an extremely seditious pamphlet he wanted a proper inquiry into the matter and said that the author unless he could give a satisfactory explanation should be harshly dealt with since no other member of the council agreed with his opinion his attack did no harm later sir syed was invited to attend lord cannings durbar in farrukhabad and happened to meet the foreign secretary there he told sir syed that he was displeased with the pamphlet and added that if he had really had the governments interests at heart he would not have made his opinion known in this way throughout the country he would have communicated it directly to the government sir syed replied that he had only had  copies printed the majority of which he had sent to england one had been given to the government of india and the remaining copies were still in his possession furthermore he had the receipt to prove it he was aware he added that the view of the rulers had been distorted by the stress and anxieties of the times which made it difficult to put even the most straightforward problem in its right perspective it was for this reason that he had not communicated his thoughts publicly he promised that for every copy that could be found circulating in india he would personally pay  rupees at first beadon was not convinced and asked sir syed over and over again if he was sure that no other copy had been distributed in india sir syed reassured him on this matter and beadon never mentioned it again later he became one of sir syeds strongest supporters many official translations were made of the urdu text of the causes of the indian revolt the one undertaken by the india office formed the subject of many discussions and debates the pamphlet was also translated by the government of india and several members of parliament but no version was offered to the public a translation which had been started by a government official was finished by sir syeds great friend colonel gfi graham and finally published in  influence of mirza ghalibedit the court of akbar an illustration from a manuscript of the aineakbari in  he finished his scholarly well researched and illustrated edition of abul fazls aine akbari itself an extraordinarily difficult book having finished the work to his satisfaction and believing that mirza asadullah khan ghalib was a person who would appreciate his labours syed ahmad approached the great ghalib to write a taqriz in the convention of the times a laudatory foreword for it ghalib obliged but what he did produce was a short persian poem castigating the aine akbari and by implication the imperial sumptuous literate and learned mughal culture of which it was a product the least that could be said against it was that the book had little value even as an antique document ghalib practically reprimanded syed ahmad khan for wasting his talents and time on dead things worse he praised skyhigh the sahibs of england who at that time held all the keys to all the a’ins in this world the poem was unexpected but it came at the time when syed ahmad khans thought and feelings themselves were inclining toward change ghalib seemed to be acutely aware of a europeanenglishsponsored change in world polity especially indian polity syed ahmad might well have been piqued at ghalibs admonitions but he would also have realized that ghalibs reading of the situation though not nuanced enough was basically accurate syed ahmad khan may also have felt that he being better informed about the english and the outside world should have himself seen the change that now seemed to be just round the corner sir syed ahmad khan never again wrote a word in praise of the aine akbari and in fact gave up taking active interest in history and archaeology he did edit another two historical texts over the next few years but neither of them was anything like the ain a vast and triumphalist document on the governance of akbar scholarly worksedit first issue of the journal muhammadan social reformer dated  december  it was a pioneering publication initiated by sir syed to promote liberal ideas in muslim society while continuing to work as a junior clerk sir syed began focusing on writing from the age of  in  on various subjects from mechanics to educational issues mainly in urdu where he wrote at least  pages his career as an author began when he published a series of treatises in urdu on religious subjects in  he published the book asaarussanadeed great monuments documenting antiquities of delhi dating from the medieval era this work earned him the reputation of a cultured scholar in  he completed the jilaulqulub bi zikril mahbub and the tuhfaihasan along with the tahsil fi jarisaqil in  these works focused on religious and cultural subjects in  he published the two works namiqa dar bayan masala tasawwurishaikh and silsilat ulmulk he released the second edition of ansarassanadid in  he also started work on a commentary on the bible – the first by a muslim – in which he argued that islam was the closest religion to christianity with a common lineage from abrahamic religions he began with genesis and matthew the first books of the old and new testament but quit his project before even completing those first two his other writings such as loyal muhammadans of india tabyinulkalam and a series of essays on the life of muhammad and subjects subsidiary therein helped to create cordial relations between the british authorities and the muslim community throughout his life syed ahmad found time for literary and scholarly pursuits the range of his literary and scholarly interests was very wide history politics archaeology journalism literature religion and science the scope of his major writings is indeed amazing majority are

borrowers in trade or in industry since this finance supported trade national welfare and prosperity while many jurists declared all interest to be riba according to sir syed this was based on their

suffer whatever befell him when rae shankar das saw that sir syeds mind was made up and nothing could be done to change it he wept and remained silent after performing a supplementary prayer and asking gods blessing sir syed sent almost all the  copies of his pamphlet to england one to the government and kept the rest himself when the government of india had the book translated and presented before the council lord canning the governorgeneral and sir bartle frere accepted it as a sincere and friendly report the foreign secretary cecil beadon however severely attacked it calling it an extremely seditious pamphlet he wanted a proper inquiry into the matter and said that the author unless he could give a satisfactory explanation should be harshly dealt with since no other member of the council agreed with his opinion his attack did no harm later sir syed was invited to attend lord cannings durbar in farrukhabad and happened to meet the foreign secretary there he told sir syed that he was displeased with the pamphlet and added that if he had really had the governments interests at heart he would not have made his opinion known in this way throughout the country he would have communicated it directly to the government sir syed replied that he had only had  copies printed the majority of which he had sent to england one had been given to the government of india and the remaining copies were still in his possession furthermore he had the receipt to prove it he was aware he added that the view of the rulers had been distorted by the stress and anxieties of the times which made it difficult to put even the most straightforward problem in its right perspective it was for this reason that he had not communicated his thoughts publicly he promised that for every copy that could be found circulating in india he would personally pay  rupees at first beadon was not convinced and asked sir syed over and over again if he was sure that no other copy had been distributed in india sir syed reassured him on this matter and beadon never mentioned it again later he became one of sir syeds strongest supporters many official translations were made of the urdu text of the causes of the indian revolt the one undertaken by the india office formed the subject of many discussions and debates the pamphlet was also translated by the government of india and several members of parliament but no version was offered to the public a translation which had been started by a government official was finished by sir syeds great friend colonel gfi graham and finally published in  influence of mirza ghalibedit the court of akbar an illustration from a manuscript of the aineakbari in  he finished his scholarly well researched and illustrated edition of abul fazls aine akbari itself an extraordinarily difficult book having finished the work to his satisfaction and believing that mirza asadullah khan ghalib was a person who would appreciate his labours syed ahmad approached the great ghalib to write a taqriz in the convention of the times a laudatory foreword for it ghalib obliged but what he did produce was a short persian poem castigating the aine akbari and by implication the imperial sumptuous literate and learned mughal culture of which it was a product the least that could be said against it was that the book had little value even as an antique document ghalib practically reprimanded syed ahmad khan for wasting his talents and time on dead things worse he praised skyhigh the sahibs of england who at that time held all the keys to all the a’ins in this world the poem was unexpected but it came at the time when syed ahmad khans thought and feelings themselves were inclining toward change ghalib seemed to be acutely aware of a europeanenglishsponsored change in world polity especially indian polity syed ahmad might well have been piqued at ghalibs admonitions but he would also have realized that ghalibs reading of the situation though not nuanced enough was basically accurate syed ahmad khan may also have felt that he being better informed about the english and the outside world should have himself seen the change that now seemed to be just round the corner sir syed ahmad khan never again wrote a word in praise of the aine akbari and in fact gave up taking active interest in history and archaeology he did edit another two historical texts over the next few years but neither of them was anything like the ain a vast and triumphalist document on the governance of akbar scholarly worksedit first issue of the journal muhammadan social reformer dated  december  it was a pioneering publication initiated by sir syed to promote liberal ideas in muslim society while continuing to work as a junior clerk sir syed

series of treatises in urdu on religious subjects in  he published the book asaarussanadeed great monuments documenting antiquities of delhi dating from the medieval era this work earned him the reputation of a cultured scholar in  he completed the jilaulqulub bi zikril mahbub and the tuhfaihasan along with the tahsil fi jarisaqil in  these works focused on religious and cultural subjects in  he published the two works namiqa dar bayan masala tasawwurishaikh and silsilat ulmulk he released the second edition of ansarassanadid in  he also started work on a commentary on the bible – the first by a muslim – in which he argued that islam was the closest religion to christianity with a common lineage from abrahamic religions he began with genesis and matthew the first books of the old and new testament but quit his project before even completing those first two his other writings such as loyal muhammadans of india tabyinulkalam and a series of essays on the life of muhammad and
