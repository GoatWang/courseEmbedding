edition continuing developments in histopathology have motivated the inclusion of four new chapters cytology immunohistology quality control and assessment and the autopsy the increasing use of cytology in clinical practice and advances in techniques and diagnostic interpretation justify the devotion of more space than formerly to this important topic immunohistology now merits a separate chapter because it has a status beyond that of being just another special stain and there are certain aspects of technique and interpretation that are peculiar to it quality control and assessment in histopathology are very topical and important now that greater attention is being paid to cost effectiveness and the auditing of many aspects of clinical practice the autopsy is an integral part of the professional life of a histopathologist and though it lacks the immediate clinical impact of the biopsy diagnosis it nevertheless constitutes an important activity in all hospitals without detailing dissection techniques i have provided some information and guidance about the autopsy which i believe will be useful to trainees and of interest to others the remainder of the book has been
