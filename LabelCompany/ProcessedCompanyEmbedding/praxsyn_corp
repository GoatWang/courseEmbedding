its chairman and ceo praxsyn corporation globenewswire    irvine calif june   globe newswire  praxsyn corporation pxyn published a letter on april   to its shareholders from greg sundem its chairman and chief executive officer  this letter is from mr sundem to update the company’s shareholders as to the company’s business and operations as of this date  dear shareholders i wanted to take an opportunity to update you as to our delay in filing our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   and our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march    regrettably we are delayed in our filings due to being in the final phase of our business reorganization and restructure of our operations  i anticipate that the strong measures that i have instituted will have an overall positive effect on the company  to that end since my last letter to the shareholders we have commenced taking new prescriptions that do not require any upfront marketing costs allowing us to greatly reduce the front end cost of new receivables i together with our cfocoo and general counselsecretary have deferred salaries until the company’s overall cash flow has improved however as the rate of collections on our existing accounts receivable is rapidly increasing this deferral is projected to end within the next few payroll cycles commenced negotiations to restructure our long term debt commenced the planning of establishing our first pharmacy outside the state of california in the next few weeks we plan to publish our form k for the fiscal year ended december   and shortly thereafter publish our form q for the quarter ended march   commence our california sales of workers’ compensation cases that are preapproved commence auxiliary sales into out of state markets with what we believe will have substantially faster payment on claims in order to further increase our shareholder value we are still planning to acquire or become an fda approved and fully licensed drug manufacturing facility so that we may offer products that we may sell to other pharmacies hospitals and clinics pursue accretive acquisitions of laboratories and other medical providers who enjoy rapid claims payments further diversify into additional medical industry profit centers finally we plan to vastly improve communications with our shareholders to this end we plan to frequently release

pxyn announces today it will publish a letter to its shareholders from its chairman and ceo regarding the company’s business and operations   dear shareholders on march   i accepted the position as the chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer unfortunately due to many factors the company’s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending december   which was due on that same date will not be filed in a timely manner  we took the available  day extension however even with the extension we will still need additional time to complete our annual report during  we generated a substantial working capital deficit we are delaying the filing of our form k in order to finish reorganizing our operations in order to dramatically reduce our deficit  prior to the release of the annual report we have or will have negotiated settlements with our vendors to reduce our marketing related debt by at least  reduced inefficiencies in executive staff in order to massively reduce overhead cutting more than  in annual payroll and currently myself our cfocoo and our general counselsecretary are deferring salaries until the company’s overall cash flow is improved and written down certain other assets in order to eliminate any  income tax liability   however to ensure that this situation will not repeated we will no longer process workers’ compensation related prescriptions unless our costs are fully funded prior to the date of service in order to further increase our shareholder value we plan in the future to expand our sales efforts more fully into private insurance markets where payment is preapproved by insurance carriers pursue workers’ compensation cases that are already preapproved enter into negotiations with insurance carriers in order to dramatically reduce reimbursement rates thereby ensuring prompt payment of all claims if successful we will reduce the cost of care for our patients their insurers and ultimately their employers as well become fully licensed in all  states as soon as practicable expeditiously eliminate our long term debt contract with marketing groups in other states to more fully diversify our product lines and markets acquire an fda approved and fully licensed drug manufacturing facility so that we may offer patients pain management creams and other products at massively reduced prices under single ndc numbers so that we sell to other pharmacies hospitals and clinics pursue accretive acquisitions of laboratories and other medical providers who enjoy rapid claims payments and further diversify into additional medical industry profit centers   finally we plan to vastly improve communications with our shareholders to this end we plan to frequently release company news through regular press releases hold investor teleconferences with the release of each subsequent annual and quarterly filing and hire dedicated investor relations staff   the last two years have seen many great strides and
