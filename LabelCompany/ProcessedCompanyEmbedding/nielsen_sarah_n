growth in nearly every aspect of our business the continuing strong demand for our motorized products has produced very positive comparisons with our financial performance of a year ago motor home shipments for the quarter were the highest weve experienced in  years with an increase of  compared to the same period last year in addition retail demand for our motorized products has grown throughout the year with a  increase when comparing the first  fiscal quarters of  to fiscal  dealer inventory has increased by  when comparing the same time periods we believe the level of dealer inventory is good and well aligned with current market conditions having our dealers appropriately stocked with fresh product is an important driver of retail activity ultimately leading to increased wholesale orders our motorized sales order backlog has grown in each of the last  consecutive quarters at the end of the third quarter it had grown in every motorized category and was up  yearoveryear this is a reflection of our dealer networks confidence in our motor home products as well as their confidence in the overall industry as they prepare for the summer season increased demand for our motor homes continues to be driven by the introduction of exciting and innovative new products our wellearned reputation for producing quality rvs and the financial stability of our company as a result of this improved demand weve been increasing our production throughout the past  months when measured as units produced per production day our production in the third quarter of fiscal  increased nearly  compared to the units produced per production day in the same quarter last year we also made progress at towables during the third quarter we had good response to new products that were introduced at our dealer days event in late april as evidenced by the increase in sales order backlog compared to the second quarter of fiscal  we believe the rv market will continue to grow as the us economy recovers the most recent rv industry forecast by dr curtin of the university of michigan consumer survey research center shows continued growth throughout calendar year  and  well

more importantly our operating income dollars grew by over  on a yeartodate basis our operating income has grown nearly x compared to a year ago one factor that assisted in the growth of operating income in the quarter was a low level of sales incentives as compared to a year ago this was marginally offset by the seasonal mix that historically occurs in our fiscal third quarter during the third quarter rental and valuepriced products accounted for nearly  of our net revenue dollars while the rental sales are generally a onceayear phenomenon the increase in valuepriced product volume appears to be a trend we anticipated this shift and fully intend to capitalize on this dynamic going forward as you may recall a year ago we introduced a valuepriced class a gas product that retailed for  this was well received at the retail and wholesale level and has been a large component of our financial performance over the last  months to further exploit the shift in the industry we introduced a valuepriced class c product last fall and additional offerings in the class a diesel and class c products at our third quarter dealer days event generally speaking value price and rental products achieve a lower gross margin therefore even as our net revenue grew on a consecutivequarter basis our gross margin percentage remained constant at  although our gross margin remained level when measured as a percentage of net sales we did make strides to our overall financial goal of increasing ebitda our quarterly ebitda grew by nearly  when comparing the third quarter to the second quarter of  in the coming quarters we do not expect to face the same factors that impacted our gross margins in the third quarter typically we do not have rental sales in the summer selling season in addition we have faced very little commodity pressure and currently do not foresee significant changes in that area we would expect these factors to be an accelerator to gross margins and ebitda in the coming quarters the balance sheet is also in a strong position at the end of the third quarter we had over  million in cash shortterm investments and accounts receivable during the quarter we generated over  million in cash from operations this was primarily attributed to a decrease in our inventory levels which declined by  million inside the period since the close of the quarter we have liquidated a portion of our auction rate security portfolio we received a small partial redemption at par and sold another position at  of par as we stated in the past our intent for capital allocation is to first reinvest in the business and second return value to our shareholders weve executed this plan in fiscal  by doubling our capex in the first  months as compared to a year ago and we have repurchased  million worth of equity on a yeartodate basis we expect to follow this strategy going forward unless there is a substantial change in the business or an unexpected opportunity in regard to towables we did incur an operating loss of  in our third quarter however as randy noted much progress was made specifically we saw improvements in the warranty and service area as warranty expense was lower than previous quarters at our dealer day event in late april we rolled out electronic retail signature registration for new towable owners an industry first electronic retail registrations are completed by the customer at the dealership when they take delivery which initiates warranty coverage immediately our next step in the fourth quarter is to eliminate paper warranty claims and migrate to an electronic process this will allow us to react more quickly to warranty items as we will have the information sooner a positive for the dealer and the retail consumer these actions coupled with a more robust quality improvement process have improved the overall quality of our products which in turn have helped to drive our warranty costs lower i will now turn the call over to the operator for the questionandanswer portion of the call questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question is from the line of kathryn thompson thompson research group kathryn i thompson  thompson research group llc just going back to the margin impact that you talked about in your prepared comments how much have you  if youre looking in terms of just buckets on a percentage basis or if you wanted to give out in terms basis points how much was related to the towable segment that you referred to versus trying to keep up with production demand on the motorized side and it doesnt sound like discounting was an impact in the quarter but if you could help us understand really what was  what were the big drivers and how will that change going forward sarah n nielsen well when i look at the third quarter compared to last years third quarter and we look at the expansion in margins and the key contributing factors quantified on a percentage basis about half of the improvement is a function of lower incentives and half of the improvement is a function of higher volumes and better fixed cost leverage or absorption so that being said when we look on a sequential basis the key drivers for having a fairly constant margin between second and third was a function of the mix of what we sold and rental being in that category and also new product introductions at that value priced segment of the business now on a prospective basis were not going to have rental that for us is typically a onequarter dynamic weve had a lot of new product also introduced that we highlighted at our dealer day event some of those products really start from a production standpoint inside our fourth quarter so those are more products that will be delivered in quarters  and forward of fiscal  in material numbers but i guess those would maybe be the first comments i would make in response to your questions and i dont know if i covered it sufficiently for you ill let you followup kathryn i thompson  thompson research group llc yes no no that helps and how have you been in terms of  i know that labor had been an issue just get  in other words getting enough labor to meet demand do you feel like youre up to speed on the labor side randy j potts kathryn yes were right where we need to be labors always a challenge when youre growing and i think there might have been some perception out there that it was a bigger challenge than it was we did find the people we needed to achieve the production rates we had scheduled we worked a lot of overtime and we have hired a lot of people but were at a  were fully staffed at this point for the production rate that we plan to have through the summer kathryn i thompson  thompson research group llc okay are there  have there been any changes in order rates over the past  days with the greater discussion of rising interest rates in the market sarah n nielsen no we havent really seen a change from the standpoint of the orders from the dealers thats been consistent and the mix as well has been fairly consistent so we havent seen that impact the order volume operator your next question is from the line of craig kennison robert w baird craig r kennison  robert w baird  co incorporated research division maybe start with the backlog randy its a huge number can you ship all of that product in q or do you not just have the production capacity to do so randy j potts it isnt so much a production capacity issue craig as it is some supply constraints weve spoken to this in the past that theres a few industry constraints most notable for gas a body chassis so thats an industrywide ongoing concern the dealer bodies know that so i think that certainly drives some aggressive order placement so theres a few other less significant types of constraints but the ford gas a chassis would be the biggest one theres no question but that if there were a larger supply of those chassis wed be at higher production rates right now to build those out we wouldnt sit on them sarah n nielsen and id also follow up  maybe just to add to that craig in regards to new product introductions that also impacts the timing of when we would be shipping products and when you look in the class a diesel segment a portion of those orders reflect great interest in a product that we showed at that event that production is starting here in the coming weeks after the th of july holiday and so that is really going to be a quarter  impact for us and prospectively and we also showed a new class b product which production starts late enough where that really can impact our q deliveries so theres a impact i would say in a lot of the different categories in our backlog for different reasons that are indications of why the backlog is as large as it is great interest in  to randys point it does create a dynamic where a lot more dealers put their orders in to have a spot in line as well as the interest in new things that we have shown them when i look back at the backlog at the end of our second quarter we shipped a little over  of that inside of q and we faced a lot of those a similar challenges a quarter ago that really hasnt been any significant change in the ford class a chassis constraint for us randy j potts another thing that enters into that craig is some dealers place forward orders and they might not want but even though we could build it today they may not want it for a few months so were not going to build it ahead of time craig r kennison  robert w baird  co incorporated research division thats all excellent is there anything that you would say thats artificial then about the backlog in other words dealers know they can place the order today just to get in line maybe to improve their priority in line they may over order and knowing that they can cancel at a future date randy j potts well thats always a concern we havent seen anything like that and looking at the size of our order bank and the quality of the orders the types of products that are being ordered and what our sales are and where the market seems to be going i dont have any reason to be concerned about that but yes it could happen sarah n nielsen weve seen such a good increase in the retail registration activity on our product specifically that also helps support where the backlog is at the dealer inventory out there in the channel is so fresh and the growth that weve seen in recent months is completely supportable and really it could move upward based on the growing retail demand craig r kennison  robert w baird  co incorporated research division and then just again a follow up on the point you made sarah to what extent is the backlog comprised of new products that really didnt exist a year ago so not existing orders that are growing because of a strong appetite but demand for new products that didnt exist sarah n nielsen i can probably easily give you a metric that relates to products that we just showed at our dealer day event and its probably  of our backlog would be in those categories but it would grow if i would incorporate the minnie winnie that we showed late last fall and thats in the c category i mean weve been producing that and expanding floor plans and a year ago when we introduced some of the new offerings in the class a gas segment wed also expand upon that but if we just concentrate on very very new product that we showed in the recent event its under  craig r kennison  robert w baird  co incorporated research division and i think i heard you correctly that some of that backlog is comprised of products that you will not ship until after the fourth quarter sarah n nielsen yes notably for the new offerings its not going to be a quarter  shipment in just in light of the production starts craig r kennison  robert w baird  co incorporated research division thats all helpful shifting gears if i may to asps could you provide the asps for motor homes and towables by category sarah n nielsen certainly from a class a gas perspective our asp was  as compared to  a year ago so thats down almost  very much impacted by new offerings that we have in that category on the class a diesel side it was fairly flat  versus  so it was up only up  our class a gas in total based on the mix of what we sold averaged or  im sorry class a category in total was  as compared to  so all a function of that class a gas impact thats down about  our cs remained fairly flat  versus  and then our a c mix in total was  versus  so thats down  from a class b perspective our average was  versus  so that was up over  and all in we saw an asp of  versus  on the towables side our travel trailer asp was  versus  so thats down almost  very much influenced by the minis in its popularity from a fiscal perspective it was  versus  and that was down over  so the blended asp for all of the towables shipped in the quarter was  versus  down  craig r kennison  robert w baird  co incorporated research division and a couple of other questions if i may just a point of clarification on rental units when you ship those into the channel theyre immediately essentially sold and they dont qualify as inventory for the dealer in that metric that you report is that correct sarah n nielsen right they are immediately retailed craig r kennison  robert w baird  co incorporated research division got it that is helpful and then sarah getting back to the margin question and what kathryn had to say there as well can you help us understand your fixed versus your variable margin within cost of goods sold today sarah n nielsen yes in the quarter that were reporting our fixed costs as a percentage of revenue were  and a year ago the same quarter it was  so as i touched upon that was half of the reason we saw such improvement on our margins yearoveryear well be filing our q as planned tomorrow so we go into great detail on our variable and our fixed costs there but those added volumes in this fiscal year have really been a pretty significant contributing factor to a lower level of our fixed costs and thats positively impacting the margins operator your next question is from the line of david whiston morningstar david whiston  morningstar inc research division i guess first on auction rate securities is  can you talk a little bit about that market is it getting better given the sale and do you think you can sell the rest of them in the next  months sarah n nielsen yes we were happy to see the activity so the shortterm investments that we reported have all been redeemed here inside of june and there is some other momentum going on in that category so i think its reasonable that we could have the rest of the long term which is as we presented about  million work through inside of  months and maybe even faster than that david whiston  morningstar inc research division great what was the capacity utilization for the quarter randy j potts around  a little less than  is where we would place it david whiston  morningstar inc research division okay and somewhat related to that is staffing you said earlier today that you are adequately staffed for now but last quarter we talked about on the assembly you are one shift with overtime so at what point with the backlog and your utilization would you ever want to just go  shifts straight time in assembly and no overtime there randy j potts yes weve never run multiple shifts in final assembly in the way our manufacturing organization is set up and the nature of the product would make that very difficult we do run multiple shifts in many of the support areas and we already do run multiple shifts in select areas so weve always measured our plant capacity in a single shift in the final assembly area so over time maximum staffing single shift final assembly is really how we calculate our capacity and beyond that we would have to find other facilities or as we have in the past to expand final assembly capacity sarah n nielsen and i would add too the production run rate that we are at and have been at essentially for the last  months now the greatest opportunity with the demand would be in the class a gas category of product which we dont have the chassis to support increasing that run rate and the additional demand in some of the other product categories are a function of new products which based on the timing of when well launch them were producing those as soon and as quickly as we can but based on how that is laid into the schedule it wouldnt at this point require  we couldnt support running faster than we are today so i wanted maybe just to add that in regards to why were running at the levels we are right now david whiston  morningstar inc research division okay thats helpful just finally on mix the class c you had a higher mix in the quarter relative to where its been for the yeartodate i know you talked at the beginning of the call about the value product but you made it seem like that was more in the class a segment so can you just talk about why c was higher in q randy j potts well the valuepriced product does affect the c categories too notably in a product we introduced in the last year our  the micro  the minnie winnie and the spirit those are fullsized c body products designed to make us more competitive in that market and they are proving to be very popular and were rolling out new floorplans as the year goes on in the third quarter we were just in the process of introducing our third floorplan and ultimately well have more floorplans than that so i think that probably had the effect that youre looking for sarah n nielsen and we also had rental product that was sold inside the quarter that was in the class c category so that is another element of why the c deliveries were up sequentially randy j potts but again that was  that is a third quarter phenomenon the popularity of the minnie and spirit product we expect to be ongoing david whiston  morningstar inc research division okay and just one more question probably for either of you now that were well into summer obviously its been a very tremendous improvement yearoveryear in your deliveries but can you say it was better than expected or about where you expected randy j potts well i guess that youd have to reflect back on when the expectation was made a year ago we were really starting to see an improvement in the market last summer i think we went on record as saying that even last summer and last fall we reacted to the market change and the success of our products in the market with a little bit of a guarded optimism and we probably  we had an opportunity to be more aggressive than we were but of course you never quite know how to react to those changes so i think by the time we got into the fall and winter the signs were certainly more positive the order outlook was more solid and stronger and we were really starting to hit it hard and thats why we talked to some of the labor constraints that we did in the spring because we did go through quite a growth spurt there things are pretty stable right now youre going into a slower season but we are bringing a lot of new products on that that as sarah mentioned are going to keep us busy so we continue to be optimistic operator operator instructions your next question is from the line of barry vogel from barry vogel and associates barry vogel great job youre really doing very well with your product innovation and you seem to be scoring across the board you did mention sarah  million share buyback was that since youve started it or was that for the first  months of this year sarah n nielsen the first  months of this year barry vogel and how many shares did you purchase sarah n nielsen on a cumulative basis barry vogel i mean just for the  months for the  months sarah n nielsen ill have to do the quick math here when i look at  why dont you let  you go on the next question ill make sure i have that answer for you barry vogel okay the next question is  concerns your investments in towables and i noticed and again even though its a small  well its infinitesimal part of the business and the fact that youre losing money every quarter but it was done i believe and randy correct me if im wrong to get another leg into the business with obviously the largest part of the rv business which is towables and so can you give us an assessment of where you are at this time and in light of the fact this was some decent deterioration in your backlog numbers i believe based on your figures in your press release fifth wheel backlogs were down  from last year at this time and fifth wheel shipments were down  from the third quarter of fiscal  so im wondering going forward whats your outlook now in terms of getting that to become a decent profit contributor randy j potts well barry i guess ill speak to the bigger picture and then let sarah talk about a few of the details as shes very involved in that towable segment or piece of our business now we are disappointed with where were at we were planning to be profitable at this point were not giving up as you said it is a very big opportunity a lot  many of the pieces of our strategy have worked very well it most notably the winnebagobranded product had been very well received by the dealers we had good momentum  years  years into it we lost that its our own fault the towable change  and this kind of ties into that  im sorry the fifth wheel change and this kind of ties into that we had a lot of momentum with a new product we introduced called the raven line and we just didnt stay on top of it and we had a lot of missteps there we are committed to getting it right and participating in that great opportunity so thats where i see it from the top and ill let sarah speak to more detail but sarah n nielsen well the first thing i would highlight is that we showed a lot of new towable product at the dealer day event in late april in categories that covers both fifth wheels and the winnebagobranded product and in our sunnybrookbranded product and we saw our order position sequentially from q to q grow in light of what we showed to the dealers and their interest in that product so we did see a positive a sequential impact but youre right on a yearoveryear basis it is lower part of the contributing factor to the weaker fifth wheel performance relates to the raven that randy touched upon where we had quality issues and production issues in one specific plant that caused a lot of our financial challenges in the first half of this year and we talked about this event last quarter as well and one of the actions that we took to improve upon that and change course was to idle that plant where the production problems were and weve hired a new plant manager and now production is resuming here in the fourth quarter so part of our decline in deliveries and in our asps for towables has been kind of a period of time where we were not producing the product and we had a little bit of a void on some of that category that would satisfy the fifth wheel demand on the sunnybrook side on the winnebago side too weve really refreshed the fifth wheel offerings that we have there but a lot of time and energy had been put into this in the last  or  to  months johnny hernandez is working really hard with the team there and were starting to see some of the efforts really take shape and turnaround some of the trends that we had seen our goal is still to operationally breakeven in the fourth quarter and have  have this be an accretive profitable piece of our business for the consolidated results randy j potts i think the good news barry is we know what went wrong we know what we need to do to get it right so its not a mystery and were going to keep working at it sarah n nielsen also to follow up to your question on how many shares purchased this  or this fiscal year we purchased approximately  shares this year at an average  a little under  a share barry vogel yes going forward it looks to me like youre going to generate significant excess cash as long as the business continues to move forward and you have a great balance sheet obviously so does your appetite end at a certain price point for the shares sarah n nielsen well we still have a buyback authorization in place that gives us a lot of room to continue to purchase and were going to use the methodology that we put into place almost a year ago now basically laying out a grid based on our forward outlook and i anticipate we will continue to be active but its more opportunistic and its not necessarily at a predetermined dollar amount in any one quarter barry vogel so with the stock at  or   im not sure exactly where it is right now this second  would that  is it conceivable given your feelings of your forwardlooking outlook that you just mentioned and your cash generation your great balance sheet that you could buy some shares at  or  sarah n nielsen yes barry barry vogel okay thats pretty good oh i know what i want i want whats your new estimate of capex this year on da sarah n nielsen were looking at capex coming a little bit lower for the fiscal year than we had commented on last quarter i think it will be in the  million range and depreciation slightly less than that for the year we only have one quarter left and were in the middle of planning for  in detail and we can share that with you at our october conference call on those numbers for the next fiscal year operator at this time im showing no further questions in queue i would like to turn the conference back over to mr randy potts for any closing remarks randy j potts thank you the rv market continues to rebound creating growth opportunities for us within both the motor home and towable businesses were pleased with the progress weve made within the last year and remain focused on continuing that successful trend profitably thank you for joining our call this morning we look forward to talking with you again on thursday october  when we report our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal
