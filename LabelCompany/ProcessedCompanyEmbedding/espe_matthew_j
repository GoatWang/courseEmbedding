business that provided a channel to connect customers and suppliers in the totalbusinesssolutions industry ikon could continue to grow as a leader in the industry only if customers on both ends of the channel were satisfied ikon board members saw espe as the perfect candidate to lead their company into the future management strategy at ge espe began with ge in  and worked on his masters degree

ges digitized onlinesales tools to help salespeople audit customers existing lighting systems and suggest costefficient alternatives one such tool was the ge lighting auditor gela which espe

espe that in tough times it was important to return to the basics he instituted a cleanup of inefficiencies and paid particular attention to customers feedback by june  espe had led ge into its largestever newproduct launch with a multimilliondollar marketing campaign to promote the reveal light bulb the lamp produced a crisp white light that was more appealing than the yellowish light produced by all previous light bulbs espe was quoted in a ge press release as commenting that people would now be able to see their world in a whole new light press release june  he also noted that  percent of trial users preferred the new bulb which filtered out the yellowish tint through a naturalearth element neodymium that ge added to the glass improvements in efficiency and color of halogen and fluorescent lamps were predicted to encourage growth in ges industrial and commercial lighting sector espes 3 years in supply and sales management were important in helping him define his strategy i have a lot of empathy for inside salespeople and outside salespeople we are always soliciting advice from our distributors just like anything else it starts with listening to the voice of the customer he said electrical wholesaling june   after listening to requests from ges distributoradvisory council espe focused on improving ges digitized onlinesales tools to help salespeople audit customers existing lighting systems and suggest costefficient alternatives one such tool was the ge lighting auditor gela which espe used—among other applications—to target the relatively untapped

ge lighting applied for a patent after developing a special phosphor for its led lamps which improved the life span by more than  hours over a conventional bulb life increased durability and dramatically decreased energy consumption espe however would not see the results of his strategy come to fruition as the head of ge lighting after jeffrey immelt took over as ges new ceo in  he came under pressure from investors to simplify ges structure because the lighting and appliance arms were growing more slowly than other ge divisions primarily due to a sluggish economy and competition

four hundred ios employees ikon would keep a portion of the lease portfolio and the companies signed a fiveyear agreement that could be renewed for a further three or five years in which ikon would continue to earn fees on leased copiers financed by ge this would provide a positive income stream for ikon espe noted that ge would have the motivation to run the business as we did creating an
