canadian company transcanada pipelines ltd was incorporated in  to undertake the construction of a natural gas pipeline across canada the financing of the project was split  between american and canadian interests two applicants originally expressed interest in moving gas east canadian delhi oil company now called tcpl proposed moving gas to the major cities of eastern canada by an allcanadian route while western pipelines wanted to stop at winnipeg with a branch line south to sell into the midwestern united states in  cd howe a member of the cabinet of canada of a liberal government forced the two companies to merge with the allcanadian route preferred over its more economical but americanrouted competitor this imposed solution reflected problems encountered with the construction of the interprovincial oil pipeline despite the speed of its construction the earlier line caused angry debate in parliament with the opposition arguing that canadian centres deserved consideration before american customers and that the main pipeline carrying canadian oil should be laid in canadian soil by constructing its natural gas mainline along an entirely canadian route tcpl accommodated nationalist sentiments solving a political problem for the federal government the regulatory process for tcpl proved long and arduous after rejecting proposals twice alberta finally granted its permission to export gas from the province in  at first the province waited for explorers to prove gas reserves sufficient for its thirtyyear needs intending to only allow exports in excess of those needs after clearing this hurdle the federal government virtually compelled tcpl into a merger with western pipelines when this reorganized tcpl went before the federal power commission for permission to sell gas into the united states the americans greeted it coolly the fpc proved sceptical of the projects financing and unimpressed with albertas reserves politicsedit main article pipeline debate the kilometre section crossing the canadian shield was the most difficult leg of the pipeline believing construction costs could make the line uneconomic private sector sponsors refused to finance this portion of the line since the federal government wanted the line laid for nationalistic reasons the reigning liberals put a bill before parliament to create a crown corporation to build and own the canadian shield portion of the line leasing it back to tcpl the louis st laurent government aggressively restricted debate on this bill in order to get construction underway by june  knowing that delays beyond that month would postpone the entire project a year the use of closure created a parliamentary scandal known as the great pipeline debate this parliamentary episode contributed to the governments defeat at the polls in  ending many years of liberal rule and bringing in a government under prime minister john diefenbaker the bill was passed and construction of the transcanada pipeline began a stock trading scandal surrounding northern ontario natural gas the contractor for the northern ontario leg of the pipeline also implicated sudbury mayor leo landreville and ontario provincial cabinet ministers philip kelly william griesinger and clare mapledoram between  and  constructionedit the completion of this project was a spectacular technological achievement in the first three years of construction – workers installed  kilometres of pipe stretching from the albertasaskatchewan border to toronto and montreal gas service to regina and winnipeg commenced in  and the line reached the lakehead before the end of that year building the canadian shield leg required continual blasting for one  metres  ft stretch the construction crew drilled  metres  ft holes into the rock three abreast at centimetre intervals dynamite broke up other stretches  metres  ft at a time on  october  a final weld completed the line and on  october the
