article share print business celebrity dick smith has at least for now won the right to keep his ozemite trade mark registration on  august  the federal court overturned a trade marks office decision to remove the ozemite trade mark from the register because of nonuse giving guidance on what activities will qualify as use of a trade mark dick smith investments pty ltd v ramsey  fca  aussiemite vs ozemite first to market vs first to trade marks office dick smith had been fighting for over  years with his rival roger ramsey who produced a similar product under the aussiemite trade mark from

dated from  despite much publicity problems with the products taste meant it did not come to market until  in the meantime roger ramsey had been selling a competing yeastbased spread called aussiemite since  and had registered the aussiemite trade mark in  over protests from dick smith foods in  roger ramsey applied to have the ozemite trade mark cancelled alleging it had not been used for in good faith in the three years prior to  dick smith foods relied unsuccessfully on two instances of use a skit on the abcs satirical chaser television program where mr smith wore a tshirt featuring the ozemite logo and  an adelaide radio segment where mr smith reiterated his intent to launch an australian ozemite product dick smith foods appealed the trade marks office decision to the federal court media can be use of the mark in relation to the goods there were three issues before the court was the trade marks office wrong to find there had been no use  if the trade mark had not been used were there obstacles that excused the nonuse  should the court exercise the discretion not to cancel the registration justice katzmann held that use did not require that any goods had actually been sold or offered for sale but there must have been an objective intention to use the mark in relation to the goods she accepted that the purpose of dick smiths media appearances was to revive if not maintain interest in the ozemite product and so constituted an expression of a genuine intent to use the mark for commercial purposes this was sufficient to establish good faith use of the trade mark in the event that she was wrong about there being use she held that the production delays would not excuse the nonuse the unavailability of necessary ingredients was not the reason ozemite had not been brought to market the reason was dick smiths foods quest to achieve a particular taste and this was not referrable to external trading factors which previous case law held were necessary on the third issue justice katzmann considered that even if there had been no use of the mark she would have used the available discretion to leave the mark on the register a range of considerations led to this conclusion including the way in which roger ramsey had sought to trade off dick smiths reputation in ozemite over the years the equities between the parties and the lessen of public confusion favoured the ozemite mark remaining on the register ramsey has said that an appeal to the full federal court will be filed related knowledge get in touch get in touch information is loading disclaimer clayton
