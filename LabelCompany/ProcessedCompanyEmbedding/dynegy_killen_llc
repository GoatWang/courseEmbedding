massively accretive to adjusted ebitda and free cash flow per share in  and beyond he said flexon added that dynegy intends to honor the terms of the collective bargaining agreements in both

for dukes assets along with the blackstone group lp riverstone holdings llc energy investors funds and ecp paul patterson a longtime utility and power analyst at glenrock associates llc said the deal wasnt all that surprising the more of these deals take place you have to wonder how much will remain to be done he said a key factor could be the desire on the part of hybrid utilities to shed their nonregulated businesses dynegy said the addition of ecps and dukes assets complement dynegys existing assets and retail business by adding significant scale and fuel diversification in markets in which the company participates but lacks scale of the  megawatts being acquired dynegy said  megwatts are modern combined cycle natural gas plants and  megawatts are environmentally compliant coal generation plants dynegy said the deals will quadruple the size of its pjm fleet and boost its new england fleet sevenfold and will be  ebitda accretive and  free cash flow accretive next year dynegy
