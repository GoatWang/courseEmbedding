price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the fund uses nav as its measure of fair value of an investment in an investee when i the funds investment does not have a readily determinable fair value and ii the nav of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of investment company accounting including measurement of the underlying investments at fair value in evaluating the level at which the fair value measurement of the funds

certain restrictions at the measurement date            aq aggregated alpha strategies fund llc notes to financial statements continued unaudited   june          significant accounting policies continued     a portfolio valuation continued   the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows   level    quoted prices in active markets for identical investments level    fair value of investments in investment funds with the ability to redeem in full within one quarter from the measurement date level    fair value of investments in investment funds that do not have the ability to redeem within one quarter from the measurement date the fund recognizes transfers into and out of the levels indicated above and transfers between an investment funds liquid holdings and side pocket holdings at the end of the reporting period all transfers into and out of level  can be found in the level  reconciliation table within the schedule of portfolio investments the fund considers all investment funds with the ability to redeem in full within one quarter of the measurement date at the investment funds nav to be level  gaap provides guidance in determining whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when compared with normal market activity for such asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities gaap also provides guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction with regards to such an asset or liability is not orderly in its consideration the fund must consider inputs and

are provided fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities requires greater disaggregation than the funds line items in the statement of assets liabilities and members capital the fund determines the appropriate classes for those disclosures on the basis of the nature and risks of the assets and liabilities and their classification in the fair value hierarchy ie

the prospectus carefully for a description of the risks associated with an investment in jll income property trust some of these risks include but are not limited to the following since there is no public trading market for shares of our common stock repurchases of shares by us after a oneyear minimum holding period will likely be the only way to dispose of your shares after a required oneyear holding period we limit the amount of shares that may be repurchased under our repurchase plan to approximately  of our net asset value nav per quarter and  of our nav per annum because our assets will consist primarily of properties that generally cannot be readily liquidated we may not have sufficient liquid resources to satisfy repurchase requests further our board of directors may modify or suspend our repurchase plan if it deems such action to be in the best interest of our stockholders as a result our shares have limited liquidity and at times may be illiquid the purchase and redemption price for shares of our common stock will be based on the nav of each class of common stock and will not be based on any public trading market because valuation of properties is inherently subjective our nav may not accurately reflect the actual price at which our assets could be liquidated on any given day we are dependent on our advisor to conduct our operations we will pay substantial fees to our advisor which increases your risk of loss we have a history of operating losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability our advisor will face conflicts of interest as a result of among other things time constraints allocation of investment opportunities and the fact that the fees it will receive for services rendered to us will be based on our nav which it is responsible for calculating the amount of distributions we make is uncertain and there is no assurance that future distributions will be made we may pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations including without limitation the sale of assets borrowings or offering proceeds our use of leverage increases the risk of your investment if we fail to maintain our status as a reit and no relief provisions apply we would be subject to serious adverse tax consequences that would cause a significant reduction in our cash available for distribution to our stockholders and potentially have a negative impact on our nav forwardlooking statement disclosure this literature contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws and regulations these
