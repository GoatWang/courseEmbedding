gamble twitter  google   august    print  email here are  things to know about joe swedish the ceo who jumped from a major health system to a major health insurer joe swedish has served as president and ceo of indianapolisbased wellpoint one of the countrys largest health insurers since march  this week wellpoint announced plans to change its corporate name to anthem the change is expected to better align the companys brands and better reflect its strategy wellpoint currently does business as anthem blue cross anthem blue cross and blue shield blue cross and blue shield of georgia and empire blue cross blue shield empire blue cross in new york service areas as well as other subsidiaries below are  things to know about mr swedish  this is mr swedishs first experience leading a health plan mr swedish  previously served as president and ceo of livonia michbased trinity health an integrated delivery system that spanned  states since  in that role mr swedish oversaw growth in revenue from  billion in  to roughly  billion in  in  mr swedish negotiated and initiated trinity healths merger with newtown square pabased catholic health east which created the countrys second largest nonprofit health system che trinity the merger was completed after mr swedish left trinity for wellpoint now known as anthem  the day after anthem named mr swedish as ceo its stock fell by  percent according to a wall street journal report this may have been due to a gap in expectations as the hospital leader was not well known among managed care investors who were anticipating an industry veteran after the departure of angela braly who stepped down as ceo of anthem in  amid shareholder concern about company performance  mr swedish works to make himself an accessible chief chuck lauer former publisher of modern healthcare describes mr swedish as a people person and a servant leader ive never heard anyone say he doesnt treat people well says mr lauer ive always been quite taken with the fact that he doesnt try to talk around something hell talk about it straight out in his early days as anthem ceo mr swedish sat down with some of the companys largest shareholders for a tough evening session with analysts who quizzed him about why he was chosen for the ceo role over other insurance executives who were rumored to be candidates according to a wall street journal report mr swedish has also toured anthems operations joined staffers in their lunchrooms to answer questions met with politicians on capitol hill and sat down with president barack obama with a handful of other health insurance ceos to discuss how the insurance industry could collaborate with the administration for healthcare reform  many healthcare experts think anthem was smart to hire mr swedish and bring a seasoned provider perspective into the payer world mr swedish also recognizes his potential to make payers and providers less polarizing to one another at the  american college of healthcare executives congress in chicago an attendee told mr swedish in good humor that he was about to move to the dark side mr swedish brought an earnest interpretation to the language i always said payers were on the dark sideand im certain that on the other side payers would say health providers are on the dark side he said but im trying to figure out this conversation if theres a dark side theres a light side quite frankly im not too put off by the term going to the dark side if thats the side im on we need to marry dark and light it sounds philosophical but i think it represents where were going as an industry   longtime health system leaders now find themselves at opposite sides of the table with one of their former colleagues but at least one health system ceo says not much has changed lloyd dean president and ceo of san franciscobased dignity health has known mr swedish for more than  years he said the two share mutual respect which helps keep their conversations grounded i dont have to hesitate to tell him how wrong i think he is mr dean told the wall street journal he doesnt sugarcoat it back either  mr swedish been clear about his plans to diversify anthem were not old blue mr swedish told the new york times earlier this year if we position ourselves simply as an insurance company we are going to fail in the early months of the healthcare exchange rollout anthem emerged as the largest participant in the newly created state marketplaces anthem also increased the number of people it insures through medicaid as it acquired amerigroup a large medicaid managed care company in  the company recently began offering telemedicine services for minor ailments to  million of its members and it has also expanded its provider networks to provide patients with greater access to care anthem is also taking some unique steps to reduce healthcare costs it crafted a program in which it offers oncologists monthly payments of  for each patient treated in compliance with one of the insurers recommended treatment pathways the insurer launched the program in six states on july  and plans to implement it throughout its entire network by mid  in its most recent financials anthem reported an  percent decrease in secondquarter net income from  million in the  to  million in  for the three months ended june  the insurer reported total revenues of approximately  billion up  percent from  billion in the second quarter of  total expenses also increased by  percent to  billion  mr swedish has demonstrated a firm commitment to diversity and he hasnt hesitated to show some teeth to promote this value one of the first things he did as ceo of trinity health was appoint a chief diversity officer reinforcing the message that diversity was a top priority i went to my board and i shared my anxiety about our organization not having a diversity and inclusion spirit that i would like to see in terms of building a unified leadership team mr swedish said soon after trinity enacted a plan in which all hospitals had to perform diversity and inclusion audits if one organization failed to complete the audit the entire bonus plan was shut down upon completion the audits shed light on some significant red flags the board didnt represent the fabric of the community and senior management didnt reflect the fabric of the community said mr swedish so the audits immediately ignited the desire to affect change   mr swedish was born in richmond va and his parents were european world war ii refugees he received his bachelors degree in political science from the university of north carolina at charlotte and worked through college loading trucks from  am to  am he later earned his masters degree in health administration from duke university in durham nc  mr swedish is passionate about fly fishing he devotes international travel to the hobby which is reportedly a release for mr swedishs competitive streak the wall street journal reported that a giant tarpon once dragged mr swedish for about two miles before the ceo was able to reel in the pound fish    mr swedish serves on the board of directors for the blue cross and blue shield association the national institute for health care management and americas health insurance plans he also serves on the board of trustees for the american hospital association health
