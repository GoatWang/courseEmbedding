how how can nextshares potentially reduce fund capital gains distributions mutual fund investors can get hit with big tax bills whether or not their funds increase in value mutual funds are frequently forced to sell securities they own to meet withdrawals by fund shareholders sales of fund positions at a gain can trigger capital gains distributions – and associated taxes – for the funds remaining shareholders in fact sales to meet investor outflows are often a leading cause of fund capital gains distributions nextshares work differently when nextshares investors sell their shares they don’t normally transact with the fund instead they trade through a broker to sell their shares to someone else buyers may include other longterm investors or professional traders acting as market makers in the funds shares because the nextshares fund itself is not involved in these transactions the fund isnt required to sell securities to raise cash – so no capital gains distributions are triggered for remaining fund shareholders when market makers and other large investors accumulate sufficient shares of a nextshares fund they can redeem their shares from the fund by transacting through intermediaries called authorized participants here too nextshares work differently than mutual funds like etfs most nextshares funds meet redemptions through authorized participants primarily in kind

guarantee that the fund will declare dividends  distribution rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through todays date and then dividing by the most recent market price the distribution consists of the sum of net investment income net realized shortterm capital gains net realized longterm capital gains and return of capital distribution rates may vary any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration date for the next distribution see the funds a notices if any located under the news  literature section of the website

account the funds total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load past performance is not indicative of future results  leverage is a technique where a closedend funds manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate seeking to increase yield and total return use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses  market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions which can differ from regulatory financial reports forms ncsr and nq that are based on trade date recording of security transactions holdings are subject to change risk considerations investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost the debt securities in which the fund invests are subject to certain risks including issuer risk reinvestment risk prepayment risk credit risk and interest rate risk issuer risk is the risk that the value of fixedincome securities may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the funds portfolio will decline if the fund invests the proceeds from matured traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the fund portfolios current earnings rate prepayment risk is the risk that upon a prepayment the actual outstanding debt on which the fund derives interest income will be reduced credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest andor principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result interest rate risk is the risk that fixedincome securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates the fund invests in noninvestment grade debt instruments commonly referred to as highyield securities high yield securities are
