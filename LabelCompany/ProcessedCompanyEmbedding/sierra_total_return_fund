the fund undertakes no duty to update any forwardlooking statement made herein all forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this press release important risk information investors should carefully consider the investment objectives risks charges and expenses of the fund this and other important information about the fund is contained in the prospectus which can be obtained by contacting your financial advisor or visiting wwwsierratotalreturnfundcom the prospectus should be read carefully before investing investing in the fund involves risks including but not limited to the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or all of your investment the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective depends in part on the ability of its investment adviser to effectively allocate the assets of the fund among the various securities and investments in which the fund invests there can be no assurance that the actual allocations will be effective in achieving the fund’s investment objective or delivering positive returns investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate and an investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost alternative investment funds etfs interval funds and closedend funds in which the fund may invest are subject to management and other expenses which will be indirectly paid by the fund preferred securities are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk convertible securities are typically issued as bonds debentures notes or preferred shares with the option to convert into or exchanged for a specified amount of common stock as a result convertible securities are hybrids that have characteristics of both bonds and common stocks and are subject to risks associated with both debt securities and equity securities issuers of debt securities may not make scheduled interest and principal payments resulting in losses to the fund typically a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixedincome securities the use of leverage such as borrowing money to purchase securities will cause the fund to incur additional expenses and magnify the fund’s gains or losses there currently is no secondary market for the fund’s shares and the fund expects that no secondary market will develop limited liquidity is expected to be provided to shareholders only through the fund’s quarterly repurchase offers regardless of how the fund performs the fund is an interval fund and as such has adopted a fundamental policy to make one repurchase offer of each class of outstanding shares at the net asset value or nav of that class of shares per year in addition to this mandatory repurchase offer the fund intends to make three additional repurchase offers in each year investments in lesserknown small and medium capitalization companies may be more vulnerable than larger more established organizations the fund’s investments may be negatively affected by the broad investment environment and capital markets in which the fund invests including the real estate market the debt market andor the equity securities market the value of the fund’s investments will increase or decrease based on changes in the prices of the investments that it holds this will cause the value of the fund’s shares to increase or decrease the fund is “nondiversified” under the investment company act of  as amended since changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause a greater fluctuation in the fund’s net asset value than in a “diversified” fund the fund is not intended to be a complete investment program sc distributors is the exclusive wholesale marketing agent for

risks associated with both debt securities and equity securities issuers of debt securities may not make scheduled interest and principal payments resulting in losses to the fund typically a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixedincome securities the use of leverage such as borrowing money to purchase securities will cause the fund to incur additional expenses and magnify
