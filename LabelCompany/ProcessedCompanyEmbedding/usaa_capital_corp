of reliable and economical auto insurance usaa is headquartered in northwest san antonio texas occupying  acres  ha a former horse farm in the largest singleoccupancy office building in the world exceeding the size of the pentagon usaa is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing most of its business is conducted over the internet or telephone using employees instead of agents until the s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail in the late s usaa began a transition from mail to phonebased sales and service a tollfree number was launched in  and internet sales and service were

insurance policies were not included for nonmilitary members due to eligibility restrictions during this period usaa changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website this proved controversial as usaa did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as consumer affairs top  complaints and reviews about usaa usaa is not better business bureau accredited lines of businessedit property casualty and life insuranceedit usaa offers a range of personal

and can be purchased as well as held by usaa investment accounts or imco target marketedit usaas mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market which consists of members of the us military and their immediate families to that end the association has always marketed directly to members of the us military usaa membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel including those on active duty those in the national guard and reserve officer candidates in commissioning programs academy rotc ocsots and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably children of usaa members are also eligible to purchase usaas pc insurance products and former members of usaa are allowed to resume membership at any time without an age limit eligibility can be determined using its website however the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility usaa has in the past published a list of other eligible persons including special agents of the fbi and secret service agents of the various military investigative services ncis osi ci and cid us foreign service officers and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies recently usaa has been sharpening its focus on members of the military so people working for certain nonmilitary agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible historically only us military officers among certain other federally sworn officers were eligible to join usaa with descendants of usaa members able to purchase insurance from usaacic it did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer one could join at any time in  membership was opened to members of the national guard and reserves and in  eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services as the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the us armed forces is quite large usaa chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated the same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers in  usaa expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees and all veterans who separated after  in november  usaa expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the us military auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria usaa investment products as well as depositonly banking services are available to nonmembers legal structureedit one of the characteristics that allows usaa to operate differently than most other fortune  companies is that it is not a corporation the united services automobile association is an interinsurance exchange the establishment of which is provided for under the texas insurance code this insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and ncos who have taken out pc policies with usaa thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and as a group own usaas assets normally in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members however the texas insurance code added a provision section  which stipulates that an interinsurance exchange can by agreement of the subscribers limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to usaa other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries adult children of usaa members and us military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at usaa as associate members insured through a subsidiary called usaacasualty insurance company usaacic usaacic is not an insurance exchange but rather a delaware insurance corporation this is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below nonstandardrisk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like usaas county mutual insurance company or usaageneral indemnity company usaa also insures members in europe through its subsidiary usaa limited it is uncommon for a us based insurance company to provide international pc coverage but usaa does so because so many military families are stationed outofcountry returning profits to the insurededit since there are no shareholders profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members returns are accomplished through a subscribers account commonly known as a distribution each year a portion of usaas profit is retained as unassigned the rest is allocated to each members subscribers account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the members subscribers account balance the allocation of capital to a members subscribers account occurs early in the calendar year late in the calendar year a portion of the members subscribers account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer members with more than  years of membership also receive a special yearly senior bonus distribution which amounts to  of the members subscribers account balance the entirety of the subscribers account belongs to the member but is not completely distributed until approximately  months after the member no longer has a usaa pc policy in  usaa returned  billion to its members those not eligible to join usaa but who are eligible to purchase insurance from usaas

usaa was founded in  in san antonio texas by a group of  us army officers as a mechanism for mutual selfinsurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they as military officers were a highrisk group usaa has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the armed forces officers and enlisted and their immediate

association in  the name was changed to united services automobile association when commissioned officers of other us military services became eligible for membership the company opened offices in frankfurt germany and london england early in its history the company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five united states army officers on june   at the gunter hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance usaa is headquartered in northwest san antonio texas occupying  acres  ha a former horse farm in the largest singleoccupancy office building in the world exceeding the size of the pentagon usaa is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing most of its business is conducted over the internet or telephone using employees instead of agents until the s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail in the late s usaa began a transition from mail to phonebased sales and service a tollfree number was launched in  and internet sales and service were launched in  via its website the organization started offering homeowners and life insurance in the s and brokerage and investment management services in the s and banking services in the s usaa offered restricted membership to civilians between september  and august  this membership provided access to usaa’s investment products most bank deposit products and life insurance auto and property insurance policies were not included for nonmilitary members due to eligibility restrictions during this period usaa changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website this proved controversial as usaa did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as consumer affairs top  complaints and reviews about usaa usaa is not better business bureau accredited lines of businessedit property casualty and life insuranceedit usaa offers a range of personal property and casualty pc insurance including automobile insurance homeowner insurance renters insurance as well as umbrella and personal property insurance in addition to pc insurance usaa provides whole life insurance term life insurance and annuities usaas life insurance policies while not completely unique in the industry are different from most offerings since they do not include a warexclusion clause bankingedit banking services are provided by usaa federal savings bank the bank was established on december   according to usaas  annual report to members usaa held over  billion in deposits with more than  million accounts making the company the th largest bank in the world usaa federal savings banks bank lobby located in san antonio is its only fullservice banking location other cities however hold financial centers often near military bases which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by usaa in addition to opening those accounts online banking services can be accessed in person by mail by phone or through the internet usaa federal savings bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the apple iphone and ipad mobile devices with googles android operating system and microsofts windows phone usaa was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the apple iphone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world major banking competitors include bank of americamilitary bank pentagon federal credit union and navy federal credit union investing and financial planningedit usaa provides brokerage services and noload mutual funds mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by usaa investment accounts or imco target marketedit usaas mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market which consists of members of the us military and their immediate families to that end the association has always marketed directly to members of the us military usaa membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel including those on active duty those in the national guard and reserve officer candidates in commissioning programs academy rotc ocsots and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably children of usaa members are also eligible to purchase usaas pc insurance products and former members of usaa are allowed to resume membership at any time without an age limit eligibility can be determined using its website however the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility usaa has in the past published a list of other eligible persons including special agents of the fbi and secret service agents of the various military investigative services ncis osi ci and cid us foreign service officers and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies recently usaa has been sharpening its focus on members of the military so people working for certain nonmilitary agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible historically only us military officers among certain other federally sworn officers were eligible to join usaa with descendants of usaa members able to purchase insurance from usaacic it did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer one could join at any time in  membership was opened to members of the national guard and reserves and in  eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services as the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the us armed forces is quite large usaa chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated the same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers in  usaa expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees and all veterans who separated after  in november  usaa expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the us military auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria usaa investment products as well as depositonly banking services are available to nonmembers legal structureedit one of the characteristics that allows usaa to operate differently than most other fortune  companies is that it is not a corporation the united services automobile association is an interinsurance exchange the establishment of which is provided for under the texas insurance code this insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and ncos who have taken out pc policies with usaa thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and as a group own usaas assets normally in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members however the texas insurance code added a provision section  which stipulates that an interinsurance exchange can by agreement of the subscribers limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to usaa other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries adult children of usaa members and us military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at usaa as associate members insured through a subsidiary called usaacasualty insurance company usaacic usaacic is not an insurance exchange but rather a delaware insurance corporation this is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below nonstandardrisk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like usaas county mutual insurance company or usaageneral indemnity company usaa also insures members in europe through its subsidiary usaa limited it is uncommon for a us based insurance company to provide international pc coverage but usaa does so because so many military families are stationed outofcountry returning profits to the insurededit since there are no shareholders profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members returns are accomplished through a subscribers account commonly known as a distribution each year a portion of usaas profit is retained as unassigned the rest is allocated to each members subscribers account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the members subscribers account balance the allocation of capital to a members subscribers account occurs early in the calendar year late in the calendar year a portion of the members subscribers account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer members with more than  years of membership also receive a special yearly senior bonus distribution which amounts to  of the members subscribers account balance the entirety of the subscribers account belongs to the member but is not completely distributed until approximately  months after the member no longer has a usaa pc policy in  usaa returned  billion to its members those not eligible to join usaa but who are eligible to purchase insurance from usaas

had indicated to usaa employees that he intended to continue to lead usaa until  however he retired in december  the nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous as usaa ceo josue robles

mutual selfinsurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they as military officers were a highrisk group usaa has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the armed forces officers and enlisted and their immediate families the company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business

commissioned officers of other us military services became eligible for membership the company opened offices in frankfurt germany and london england early in its history the company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five united states army officers on june   at the gunter hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance usaa is headquartered in northwest san antonio texas occupying  acres  ha a former horse farm in the largest singleoccupancy office building in the world exceeding the size of the pentagon usaa is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing most of its business is conducted over the internet or telephone using employees instead of agents until the s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail in the late s usaa began a transition from mail to phonebased sales and service a tollfree number was launched in  and internet sales and service were launched in  via its website the organization started offering homeowners and life insurance in the s and brokerage and investment management services in the s and banking services in the s usaa offered restricted membership to civilians between september  and august  this membership provided access to usaa’s investment products most bank deposit products and life insurance auto and property insurance policies were not included for nonmilitary members due to eligibility restrictions during this period usaa changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website this proved controversial as usaa did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as consumer affairs top  complaints and reviews about usaa usaa is not better business bureau accredited lines of businessedit property casualty and life insuranceedit usaa offers a range of personal property and casualty pc insurance including automobile insurance homeowner insurance renters insurance as well as umbrella and personal property insurance in addition to pc insurance usaa provides whole life insurance term life insurance and annuities usaas life insurance policies while not completely unique in the industry are different from most offerings since they do not include a warexclusion clause bankingedit banking services are provided by usaa federal savings bank the bank was established on december   according to usaas  annual report to members usaa held over  billion in deposits with more than  million accounts making the company the th largest bank in the world usaa federal savings banks bank lobby located in san antonio is its only fullservice banking location other cities however hold financial centers often near military bases which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by usaa in addition to opening those accounts online banking services can be accessed in person by mail by phone or through the internet usaa federal savings bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the apple iphone and ipad mobile devices with googles android operating system and microsofts windows phone usaa was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the apple iphone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely

usaa provides brokerage services and noload mutual funds mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by usaa investment accounts or imco target marketedit usaas mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market which consists of members of the us military and their immediate families to that end the association has always marketed directly to members of the us military usaa membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel including those on active duty those in the national guard and reserve officer candidates in commissioning programs academy rotc ocsots and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably children of usaa members are also eligible to purchase usaas pc insurance products and former members of usaa are allowed to resume membership at any time without an age limit eligibility can be determined using its website however the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility usaa has in the past published a list of other eligible persons including special agents of the fbi and secret service agents of the various military investigative services ncis osi ci and cid us foreign service officers and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies recently usaa has been sharpening its focus on members of the military so people working for certain nonmilitary agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible historically only us military officers among certain other federally sworn officers were eligible to join usaa with descendants of usaa members able to purchase insurance from usaacic it did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer one could join at any time in  membership was opened to members of the national guard and reserves and in  eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services as the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the us armed forces is quite large usaa chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated the same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers in  usaa expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees and all veterans who separated after  in november  usaa expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the us military auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria usaa investment products as well as depositonly banking services are available to nonmembers legal structureedit one of the characteristics that allows usaa to operate differently than most other fortune  companies is that it is not a corporation the united services automobile association is an interinsurance exchange the establishment of which is provided for under the texas insurance code this insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and ncos who have taken out pc policies with usaa thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and as a group own usaas assets normally in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members however the texas insurance code added a provision section  which stipulates that an interinsurance exchange can by agreement of the subscribers limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to usaa other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries adult children of usaa members and us military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at usaa as associate members insured through a subsidiary called usaacasualty insurance company usaacic usaacic is not an insurance exchange but rather a delaware insurance corporation this is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below nonstandardrisk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like usaas county mutual insurance company or usaageneral indemnity company usaa also insures members in europe through its subsidiary usaa limited it is uncommon for a us based insurance company to provide international pc coverage but usaa does so because so many military families are stationed outofcountry returning profits to the insurededit since there are no shareholders profits

usaa was founded in  in san antonio texas by a group of  us army officers as a mechanism for mutual selfinsurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they as military officers were a highrisk group usaa has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the armed forces officers and enlisted and their immediate families the company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the internet or telephone using employeescitation needed instead of agents contents  history

controversial leadership  oversight  falling service ratings  employment  see also  references  external links historyedit the organization was originally called the united states army automobile association in  the name was changed to united services automobile association when commissioned officers of other us military services became eligible for membership the company opened offices in frankfurt germany and london england early in its history the company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five united states army officers on june   at the gunter hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance usaa is headquartered in northwest san antonio texas occupying  acres  ha a former horse farm in the largest singleoccupancy office building in the world exceeding the size of the pentagon usaa is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing most of its business is conducted over the internet or telephone using employees instead of agents until the s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail in the late s usaa began a transition from mail to phonebased sales and service a tollfree number was launched in  and internet sales and service were launched in  via its website the organization started offering homeowners and life insurance in the s and brokerage and investment management services in the s and banking services in the s usaa offered restricted membership to civilians between september  and august  this membership provided access to usaa’s investment products most bank deposit products and life insurance auto and property insurance policies were not included for nonmilitary members due to eligibility restrictions during this period usaa changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website this proved controversial as usaa did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as consumer affairs top  complaints and reviews about usaa usaa is not better business bureau accredited lines of businessedit property casualty and life insuranceedit usaa offers a range of personal property and casualty pc insurance including automobile insurance homeowner insurance renters insurance as well as umbrella and personal property insurance in addition to pc insurance usaa provides whole life insurance term life insurance and annuities usaas life insurance policies while not completely unique in the industry are different from most offerings since they do not include a warexclusion clause bankingedit banking services are provided by usaa federal savings bank the bank was established on december   according to usaas  annual report to members usaa held over  billion in deposits with more than  million accounts making the company the th largest bank in the world usaa federal savings banks bank lobby located in san antonio is its only fullservice banking location other cities however hold financial centers often near military bases which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by usaa in addition to opening those accounts online banking services can be accessed in person by mail by phone or through the internet usaa federal savings bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the apple iphone and ipad mobile devices with googles android operating system and microsofts windows phone usaa was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the apple iphone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world major banking competitors include bank of americamilitary bank pentagon federal credit union and navy federal credit union investing and financial planningedit usaa provides brokerage services and noload mutual funds mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by usaa investment accounts or imco target marketedit usaas mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market which consists of members of the us military and their immediate families to that end the association has always marketed directly to members of the us military usaa membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel including those on active duty those in the national guard and reserve officer candidates in commissioning programs academy rotc ocsots and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably children of usaa members are also eligible to purchase usaas pc insurance products and former members of usaa are allowed to resume membership at any time without an age limit eligibility can be determined using its website however the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility usaa has in the past published a list of other eligible persons including special agents of the fbi and secret service agents of the various military investigative services ncis osi ci and cid us foreign service officers and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies recently usaa has been sharpening its focus on members of the military so people working for certain nonmilitary agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible historically only us military officers among certain other federally sworn officers were eligible to join usaa with descendants of usaa members able to purchase insurance from usaacic it did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer one could join at any time in  membership was opened to members of the national guard and reserves and in  eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services as the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the us armed forces is quite large usaa chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated the same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers in  usaa expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees and all veterans who separated after  in november  usaa expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the us military auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria usaa investment products as well as depositonly banking services are available to nonmembers legal structureedit one of the characteristics that allows usaa to operate differently than most other fortune  companies is that it is not a corporation the united services automobile association is an interinsurance exchange the establishment of which is provided for under the texas insurance code this insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and ncos who have taken out pc policies with usaa thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and as a group own usaas assets normally in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members however the texas insurance code added a provision section  which stipulates that an interinsurance exchange can by agreement of the subscribers limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to usaa other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries adult children of usaa members and us military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at usaa as associate members insured through a subsidiary called usaacasualty insurance company usaacic usaacic is not an insurance exchange but rather a delaware insurance corporation this is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below nonstandardrisk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like usaas county mutual insurance company or usaageneral indemnity company usaa also insures members in europe through its subsidiary usaa limited it is uncommon for a us based insurance company to provide international pc coverage but usaa does so because so many military families are stationed outofcountry returning profits to the insurededit since there are no shareholders profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members returns are accomplished through a subscribers account commonly known as a distribution each year a portion of usaas profit is retained as unassigned the rest is allocated to each members subscribers account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the members subscribers account balance the allocation of capital to a members subscribers account occurs early in the calendar year late in the calendar year a portion of the members subscribers account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer members with more than  years of membership also receive a special yearly senior bonus distribution which amounts to  of the members subscribers account balance the entirety of the subscribers account belongs to the member but is not completely distributed until approximately  months after the member no longer has a usaa pc policy in  usaa returned  billion to its members those not eligible to join usaa but who are eligible to purchase insurance from usaas

as a mechanism for mutual selfinsurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they as military officers were a highrisk group usaa has since expanded to offer

commissioned officers of other us military services became eligible for membership the company opened offices in frankfurt germany and london england early in its history the company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five united states army officers on june   at the gunter hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance usaa is headquartered in northwest san antonio texas occupying  acres  ha a former horse farm in the largest singleoccupancy office building in the world exceeding the size of the pentagon usaa is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing most of its business is conducted over the internet or telephone using employees instead of agents until the s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail in the late s usaa began a transition from mail to phonebased sales and service a tollfree number was launched in  and internet sales and service were launched in  via its website the organization started offering homeowners and life insurance in the s and brokerage and investment management services in the s and banking services in the s usaa offered restricted membership to civilians between september  and august  this membership provided access to usaa’s investment products most bank deposit products and life insurance auto and property insurance policies were not included for nonmilitary members due to eligibility restrictions during this period usaa changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website this proved controversial as usaa did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as consumer affairs top  complaints and reviews about usaa usaa is not better business bureau accredited lines of businessedit property casualty and life insuranceedit usaa offers a range of personal property and casualty pc insurance including automobile insurance homeowner insurance renters insurance as well as umbrella and personal property insurance in addition to pc insurance usaa provides whole life insurance term life insurance and annuities usaas life insurance policies while not completely unique in the industry are different from most offerings since they do not include a warexclusion clause bankingedit banking services are provided by usaa federal savings bank the bank was established on december   according to usaas  annual report to members usaa held over  billion in deposits with more than  million accounts making the company the th largest bank in the world usaa federal savings banks bank lobby located in san antonio is its only fullservice banking location other cities however hold financial centers often near military bases which provide advice and

usaa provides brokerage services and noload mutual funds mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by usaa investment accounts or imco target marketedit usaas mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market which consists of members of the us military and their immediate families to that end the association has always marketed directly to members of the us military usaa membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel including those on active duty those in the national guard and reserve officer candidates in commissioning programs academy rotc ocsots and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably children of usaa members are also eligible to purchase usaas pc insurance products and former members of usaa are allowed to resume membership at any time without an age limit eligibility can be determined using its website however the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility usaa has in the past published a list of other eligible persons including special agents of the fbi and secret service agents of the various military investigative services ncis osi ci and cid us foreign service officers and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies recently usaa has been sharpening its focus on members of the military so people working for certain nonmilitary agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible historically only us military officers among certain other federally sworn officers were eligible to join usaa with descendants of usaa members able to purchase insurance from usaacic it did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer one could join at any time in  membership was opened to members of the national guard and reserves and in  eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services as the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the us armed forces is quite large usaa chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated the same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers in  usaa expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees and all veterans who separated after  in november  usaa expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the us military auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria usaa investment products as well as depositonly banking services are available to nonmembers legal structureedit one of the characteristics that allows usaa to operate differently than most other fortune  companies is that it is not a corporation the united services automobile association is an interinsurance exchange the establishment of which is provided for under the texas insurance code this insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and ncos who have taken out pc policies with usaa thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and as a group own usaas assets normally in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members however the texas insurance code added a provision section  which stipulates that an interinsurance exchange can by agreement of the subscribers limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to usaa other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries adult children of usaa members and us military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at usaa as associate members insured through a subsidiary called usaacasualty insurance company usaacic usaacic is not an insurance exchange but rather a delaware insurance corporation this is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below nonstandardrisk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like usaas county mutual insurance company or usaageneral indemnity company usaa also insures members in europe through its subsidiary usaa limited it is uncommon for a us based insurance company to provide international pc coverage but usaa does so because so many military families are stationed outofcountry returning profits to the insurededit since there are no shareholders profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members returns are accomplished through a subscribers account commonly known as a distribution each year a portion of usaas profit is retained as unassigned the rest is allocated to each members subscribers account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the members subscribers account balance the allocation of capital to a members subscribers account occurs early in the calendar year late in the calendar year a portion of the members subscribers account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer members with more than  years of membership also receive a special yearly senior bonus distribution which amounts to  of the members subscribers account balance the entirety of the subscribers account belongs to the member but is not completely distributed until approximately  months after the member no longer has a usaa pc policy in  usaa returned  billion to its members those not eligible to join usaa but who are eligible to purchase insurance from usaas subsidiaries such as usaacic may receive dividends as declared by usaa miscellaneous informationedit

primackjan  in  private insurance and financial services giant usaa dipped its toe into the waters of startup investing backing an autobuying and pricing information platform called truecar by the time truecar true went public in may  usaa would have a fullfledged venture capital program with dedicated staffers and  million of committed capitaltoday however usaas venture capital business is in restart mode after losing its top executivesthe program originally began with the truecar true investment which was led by a usaa attorney named ron digiacomo and his colleague tom ferries the pair which had some experience with corporate strategic investing from their prior jobs at ford motor co f were seeking ways to boost usaas auto loan volume and in particular aid a small business unit that helped members get good deals on new carsdigiacomo and ferries came to know truecars ceo scott painter who jumped at the chance to get his companys product in front of usaa members soon usaa was participating in its first venture capital round and would follow a similar strategic model with deals for loyalty rewards startup mall networks later renamed cartera commerce and a company that facilitated the auto titling processdigiacomo and ferries would both move on by early  with the nascent investment program handed over to another usaa attorney named vic pascucci who became the companys head of corporate development pascucci picked up the pace backing startups like babysitting marketplace carecom care and snapsheet a selfservice photo app that helps users settle auto insurance claimsby  pascucci had a growing portfolio but not nearly enough help so he began to hire from the corporate venture world his first senior recruit was alex marquez a year intel capital veteran who had invested in such companies as ancestrycom kabam and gamestop gme next came gopi rangan who had been leading venture capital and ma for silicon valley chipmaker alteratogether the trio pumped around  million in more than a dozen companies but almost as quickly as it had come together the program began to unravel due to a series of small cuts and tumultsfirst came the retirement of ceo joe robles who had originally championed the investment initiative second a usaa member suffered a family tragedy related to his use of carecom which cast a pall over the program third usaa began facing broader market challenges including lower gas prices that increased the risk profile of auto insurance in short usaa seemed to have bigger fish to fry ― which didnt sit well with the senior ventures prosmarquez resigned last july later joining nantmobile as an executive vice president pascucci left in september two months later rangan was gone plenty of portfolio companies stayed behind ― and several corporate development staffers kept their units lights on ― but more than  million of dedicated capital remained untappedusaas top priority now is defending itself from the types of startups that the venture program was working with and investing in says a source regular venture capital firms fade away very slowly but this is how it goes with corporate groupsget term sheet our daily newsletter on deals  dealmakersfollowing pascuccis departure usaa installed a longtime product manager named nathan mckinley as head of corporate development so far he has taken one of pascuccis five portfolio company board seats per his linkedin profile usaa also staffed up his department in december with a company spokesman saying that it now has  fulltime employees ―nearly double the number it had last year ― although venture investing is only one of their responsibilities there also are plans to hire at least one more senior executive alongside mckinley and another longtime usaa corporate development pro named michael smith whose prior job was as a consultant on corporate strategy and valuationsso far the mckinleyled team has made one investment a followin deal for snapsheet it also is expected to announce its first new portfolio company sometime next month a source says that the strategy is to significantly slow the investment pace from where it was during pascuccis tenure although it remains too early to know for sure how things will shake out for the record usaa says it has no prescribed deal pacethe group still is allowed to have up to  million invested at any one timeif deals make strategic sense theyll make them says a source but i think the new team has fewer interest in really blowing the thing out and marching to their own drummer they know what
