feebased cash flows we intend to generate stable and predictable cash flows over time by providing feebased logistics services as we grow our business beyond our current assets and operations we will seek to enter into similar feebased contracts with our parent and third parties that generate stable and predictable cash flows  pursue attractive organic growth opportunities we intend to enhance the profitability of our initial assets by pursuing individually or with our parent organic growth projects for example we believe certain expansion projects that may be implemented by our parent at its ethanol production plants would enable us to utilize the strategic location and capacity of our assets and would increase annual throughput at our facilities we believe our capital expenditures associated with such potential expansion projects would be minimal since our ethanol storage facilities have available capacity to accommodate growth in our parent’s throughput in addition we expect

asset base  conduct safe reliable and efficient operations we are committed to maintaining the safety reliability environmental compliance and efficiency of our operations all of our assets are staffed by experienced industry personnel we along with our parent will also continue to focus on incremental operational improvements to enhance overall production results we will seek to improve our operating performance through commitment to our preventive maintenance program along with employee training safety and development programs we believe these objectives are integral to maintaining
