solid waste and refusederive fuel is a valuable renewable energy source   with wte plants successfully operating worldwide the technology and environmental benefits are proven there are nearly  wte plants in north america more than  operating in europe and  plants in asia how wastetoenergy works  a wastetoenergy plant converts solid waste into electricity andor heat  an ecological costeffective way of energy recovery   a wastetoenergy  or energyfromwaste  plant converts municipal and industrial solid waste into electricity andor heat for industrial processing and for district heating systems – an ecologically sound costeffective means of energy recovery the energy plant works by burning waste at high temperatures and using the heat to make steam the steam then drives a turbine that creates electricity   wastetoenergy is a way to recover valuable resources   wastetoenergy isn’t just a trash disposal method it’s a way to recover valuable resources wastetoenergy is a vital part of a sustainable waste management chain and is fully complementary to recycling  today it is possible to reuse  of the metals contained in the bottom ash and the remaining clinker can be reused as road material the results and benefits are proven avoids methane emissions from landfills offsets greenhouse gas ghg emissions from fossil fuel electrical production recoversrecycles valuable resources such as metals produces clean reliable baseloaded energy and steam uses less land per megawatt than other renewable energy sources sustainable and steady renewable fuel source compared to wind and

burning of municipal solid waste uses the refuse in its asreceived unprepared state the second technique uses prepared refuse or refusederived fuel rdf where the asreceived refuse is first separated classified and reclaimed in various ways to yield salable or otherwise recyclable products the remaining material is prepared for firing in the boiler combustion technologies bw vølund dynagrate® pivoting combustion grate and precision jet® overfire air system – advanced designs provides environmental benefits during combustion destroys dioxins and furans minimizes formation of nox and co minimizes unburned carbon   combustion grates  stokers in a wastetoenergy plant the grate is where waste is converted into energy – the heart of the system as such grates are a significant focus area for us over the past  years we have supplied more than  combustion grates worldwide many of our older grates are still in operation running efficiently and living up to current environmental standards  learn more waste fuel feeder systems steady and continuous feeding of fuel in wastetoenergy plants is the key to stable operation maximum efficiency and lower operational and maintenance costs   learn more watercooled wear zones watercooled wear zones are a revolutionary efficient and economical way to improve operational accessibility and productivity for wastefired power plants experiences from the  plants where we have installed watercooled wear zones show that the total annual energy production has increased significantly –  in many cases by as much as  one plant is now handling  more waste after a conversion that includes the new wear zone technology learn more energy recovery bw vølund’s highly efficient wastetoenergy plants obtain a total recovery of  in existing

recovery by condensation of the hot flue gases learn more volumix systems proper turbulent mixing of the flue gases in the boiler furnace provides a better combustion process and burnout in the gas
