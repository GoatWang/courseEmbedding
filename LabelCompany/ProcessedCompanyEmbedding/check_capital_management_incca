program balanced program profitbased fee monthly newsletter earnings updates company reports stock charts investments seeing the big picture    stocks mean ownership    bonds mean stability    realities  expectations stocks mean ownership of the many stock investors weve met most in their own estimation have done poorly in the markets  the reason often is emotion  after all its only human to want to buy stocks when theyre going up and possibly overpriced and sell them when theyre heading down and maybe a bargain  while human these impulses are a recipe for failure how does one control ones emotions when investing in stocks  by adhering to an investment philosophy based on the fact that stock means ownership of a business another way to banish emotion is by incorporating into your philosophy the wisdom of benjamin graham and his book the intelligent investor  its truths are simple and obvious  investors must have the right temperament  common sense is more important than intelligence at check capital we focus on buying highquality companies at attractive prices  these firms have business models generating high profits nowthat we feel are likely to continue doing so in the future  being an owner of such firms ie holding their stock is a strategy for profit   check capital management inc  costa mesa  ca  company information products resources my account talk to a
