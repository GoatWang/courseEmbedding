and sale of  shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately  million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately  million we currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering as follows  approximately  million to fund our planned phase  clinical development of inopulse for pah and  the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes this expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash cash equivalents and restricted cash represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors including the progress of our development and commercialization efforts the status of and results from clinical trials as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs as a result our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering as of september   we had cash and cash equivalents of  million and restricted cash of  million based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering described above we estimate that such funds together with our cash cash equivalents and restricted cash will be sufficient to enable us to complete our ongoing clinical trial for bcm to fund the first trial in our planned phase  clinical development of inopulse for pah and to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least into mid we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect we do not expect that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash cash equivalents and restricted cash will be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of development and commercialization of any of our product candidates pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering we intend to invest the net proceeds in shortterm interestbearing investmentgrade securities the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive there are many pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our products in addition other companies are increasingly looking at cardiac and cardiopulmonary indications as a potential opportunity it is possible that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of unmet needs in our target markets will increase our competitors either alone or with their strategic partners may have substantially greater financial technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products accordingly our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining approval for therapies and achieving widespread market acceptance we anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs and advanced technologies become available currently there are  drugs approved for the treatment of pah within the following categories prostacyclin and prostacyclin analogs including flolan epoprostenol which is marketed by glaxosmithkline tyvaso treprostinil orenitram treprostinil and remodulin treprostinil which are marketed by united therapeutics corporation and ventavis iloprost and veletri epoprostenol which are marketed by actelion pharmaceuticals us inc or actelion phosphodiesterase type inhibitors including adcirca tadalafil which is marketed by united therapeutics corporation and revatio sildenafil which is marketed by pfizer inc endothelin receptor antagonists including letairis ambrisentan which is marketed by gilead sciences inc and opsumit macitentan and tracleer bosentan which are marketed by actelion and a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator adempas riociguat which is marketed by bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals inc actelion recently submitted an nda to the fda for selexipag a selective prostacyclin receptor agonist there are also other treatments in phase  and phase  clinical development including other nitric oxide generation and delivery systems including genosyl which is being developed by geno llc and a nebulized formulation of nitrite which is being developed by mast therapeutics currently there are no approved therapies for treating phcopd and the only generally accepted treatments are longterm oxygen therapy pulmonary rehabilitation and lung transplant and we are not aware of any therapies for phcopd in advanced clinical development there are no generally accepted products approved for structural support to prevent cardiac remodeling following an ami other product candidates that are currently in clinical development include stem cell therapies to restore heart muscle cells following an ami with large phase  trials expected to be completed in  or  we do not expect bcm to compete with or replace current treatments for congestive heart failure following ami but instead believe it will become part of the treatment regimen used in conjunction with other therapies in addition because bcm can be delivered by a minimally invasive percutaneous coronary intervention procedure we do not believe it will directly compete with devices that are used to treat congestive heart failure which are designed for administration during open heart surgery or by intracardiac injection involving a thoracotomy procedure these include mesh restraining devices for example heartnet injectable biopolymers for example algisyllvr and implantable electrostimulation devices for example cardiofit in addition volume reduction surgery or cardiac assist devices or pumps are sometimes used to treat patients with congestive heart failure company description we are a clinicalstage therapeutics company focused on developing innovative products at the intersection of drugs and devices that address significant unmet medical needs in the treatment of cardiopulmonary and cardiac diseases we have two programs in advanced clinical development the first program inopulse is based on our proprietary pulsatile nitric oxide delivery device we are currently developing two product candidates under our inopulse program one for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension or pah for which we intend to commence phase  clinical trials in the second half of  and the other for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or phcopd which is in phase  development our second program is bioabsorbable cardiac matrix or bcm which is currently in a placebocontrolled clinical trial designed to support ce mark registration in the european union we completed enrollment of this trial in december  with  patients having completed the treatment procedure and we expect to report top line results in mid assuming positive results we intend to conduct a pivotal premarket approval trial of bcm beginning in the first half of  which will be designed to support registration in the united states we are developing bcm for the prevention of cardiac remodeling which often leads to congestive heart failure following an stsegment elevated
