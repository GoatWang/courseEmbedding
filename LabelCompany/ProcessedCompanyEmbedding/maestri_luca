luca maestri left his chief financial officer job at xerox in  to be controller at apple inc it could have been a risky move clevel executives rarely want to move down the corporate totem pole but with tuesday’s news that mr maestri will replace longtime apple cfo peter oppenheimer the bet has paid off mr maestri’s route to cfo of the world’s most valuable company took several turns including more than seven international assignments and several stints in the cfo chair at some of the world’s biggest companies after working his way up through general motors over  years mr maestri left the carmaker as cfo of its european operations he headed straight for the csuite of technology firms with complex manufacturing operations including cfo of nokia siemens networks and then xerox “i knew they were grooming him at  apple” said nick cyprus the former controller at general motors who worked with mr maestri mr maestri’s former colleagues describe the italianborn executive as collegial and bright a supportive manager with a deep understanding of business operations mr cyprus said he first met mr maestri when he joined the company and worked on a project to overhaul the company’s accounting functions “we needed to make change fast and luca was more of an asset than a liability” mr cyprus said when mr cyprus asked mr maestri to make changes in the europe division he says “luca turned around and said if that’s what you need to be successful i’m behind you” in gm’s europe operation mr maestri oversaw some difficult issues during the financial crisis as the company hurtled toward a major restructuring there were tense union negotiations and the overhaul of a complex strategy to boost sales in europe “he was one of the guys who had been around for a while and worked his way up” mr cyprus said “he’s really good to work for he gets controls he gets infrastructure he’s a team player mr maestri was at xerox less than two years but he made an impression by helping the printer and copier company expand into business services “one of his big strengths was that he listened” said gary kabureck a former chief accounting officer at xerox “he wanted to understand and he listened and asked questions until he did understand” xerox had been looking for a cfo with extensive international experience to replace longtime cfo larry zimmerman mr maestri fit the bill having spent a number of years working outside the united states mr kabureck recalled overhearing him speak on the phone with colleagues in brazil in clear portuguese “he absolutely understood business processes from supply chain to currency and he brought a lot to the table” mr kabureck said “he was a good find for xerox and a loss when he left” write to emily chasan at emilychasanwsjcom share this

fool foolcom foolcouk foolcomau foolca foolsg foolde helping the world invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search  reasons why apples rd spending is on the rise according to cfo luca maestri will the apple toasterfridge ever see the light of day evan niu cfa tmfnewcow feb   at pm one key trend that apple nasdaqaapl investors have taken note of recently is the companys precipitous rise in research and development spending as a percentage of revenue apples rd expenditures would historically stay within a  to  range but in recent years this has climbed to  to  that translates into an awful lot of spending in dollar terms when you factor in apples growing top line  notwithstanding the most obvious explanation is that apple is investing in future products that it wont talk about yet which it certainly is doing but thats just one of four different reasons why apples rd investments have grown cfo luca maestri spoke at the goldman sachs technology and internet conference  earlier this week and he laid out why this line item on the income statement continues to grow image source apple  a growing product portfolio apple has always prioritized product depth over product breadth which has historically helped contribute to rd cost discipline even as the company still only offers a handful of devices within each product family far fewer than some of its more prolific rivals the portfolio is still expanding the first one is the fact that our product portfolio today is much larger than it used to be we now develop three iphones we used to develop one we develop multiple ipads we used to develop one we now have the watch weve got airpods we have beats so the product portfolio is larger and obviously we need more rd to develop those programs  investing in services the mac maker has grand ambitions of doubling its services business over the next four years but even now the current growth that the services business is enjoying requires a lot of investment in order to scale across apples massive user base the second element is that the services business has grown a lot and to grow the business we need to make engineering investments in services like icloud like siri like maps and so clearly the spend  rd spend that we have on services is significantly higher than we used to have   more inhouse development this is perhaps the most important apple has insourced the development of many core technologies the most meaningful of which being its aseries of processors and designing processors is incredibly expensive but doing so gives apple greater control over its product roadmaps instead of being at the mercy of suppliers roadmaps for instance the mac is still very much dependent on intels roadmap the third reason i think is a very strategic one and a very important one that allows us  to keep our differentiation from the rest of the industry and its the fact that today we do much more inhouse development of some fundamental technologies than we used to do a few years ago when we were leaving more of that to the supplier base think of the work that we do around processors or sensors right much more work than were doing today inhouse than we used to its very important  for us because we can push the envelope on innovation we have better control over timing over cost over quality and so we look at that as a great strategic investment for us right  future products and of course as mentioned above apple is investing in future products that arent contributing to the top line quite yet and then finally its the point of view were making around the fact that yes were also working on things that do not generate revenue today and those expenses are meaningful and the products being of things that are not very large but obviously they add up over time and hopefully those are good bets that were making for the future of the company whether the pipeline includes a selfdriving electric car an augmented reality headset or that mythical toasterfridge remains to be seen im still keeping my fingers crossed on the latter evan niu cfa owns shares of apple the motley fool owns shares of

by john gruber archive the talk show projects contact colophon rss feed twitter sponsorship mobelux designs builds and brands award winning digital products all under one roof luca maestri apple watch revenue ‘well over’  million the ap some analysts noted that apple reported  billion in revenue from the company’s “other products” segment which includes the watch that’s about  million more than the previous quarter when the watch had not yet gone on sale or significantly less than the  billion in watch sales that analysts surveyed by factset were expecting but chief financial officer luca maestri told the associated press that revenue from the watch amounted to “well over” that  million increase he said the watch sales were offset by declining revenue from ipods and accessories which are also lumped into that segment as dan seifert tweeted one and two this means apple watch already generates more revenue than microsoft surface — which was up  percent while the company’s stumbles in smartphones have shown the bruising downsides of the hardware business for microsoft it had success with other devices including its surface tablet the revenue from which grew  percent to  million revenue from its xbox game business rose  percent in total microsoft said it had nearly  billion in computing and gaming hardware revenue in the quarter ★ tuesday  july  display preferences copyright
