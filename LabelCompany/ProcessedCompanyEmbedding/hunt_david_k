inerrancy debate of the s because of its heatedness this collection attempts to offer several viewpoints on the basic controversies ie what did god know when did he know it and do human beings really have free will but in bringing together these four authors gregory boyd with the open view david hunt with the simpleforeknowledge view william lane craig with the middleforeknowledge view and paul helm defending the augustiniancalvinist view the collection illustrates another similarity with the inerrancy debate a mindnumbing complexity of argument the editors have sought to make this book accessible to educated laypeople and college students who have had a first course in theology or philosophy while boyds essay is very accessible the others are filled with technical terms while it seems clear that intramundane causation is transitive and a puzzling tendency to speak in algebraic variables if it is accidentally necessary before x is even born that x will do a then x never has it in his power to do other than a needing over seven pages of glossary this book is unlikely to find a wide audience but it will still prove useful for those seminarians and clergy who wish to get several different perspectives on the debate nov copyright  cahners business information product reviews▼▲  stars out of   out of   stars   stars   stars   stars   star  quality  out of   out of

the others critique it i love the contrasting opinions and it has been very helpful to my study on this topic definitely a good place to start was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate c j  stars out of  april   c j this book on divine foreknowledge cuts rightinto the heart of the debate about godsknowledge of the future since it dealswith specifics on what and how god knows the future this book is advanced and requires a lot of rigorous logical thinking to read it through since there are logical equations and syllogisms in each authors explanation of his own particular viewpoint no other book that i know will take you this deep into the questions aboutwhat and how god knows the future one person i know who read an easierversion of this topic the
