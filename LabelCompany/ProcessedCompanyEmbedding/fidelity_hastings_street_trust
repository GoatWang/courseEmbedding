pay more taxes than they have to but a recent survey of  us households conducted by fidelity and yankelovich partners showed that few people have taken steps to reduce their taxes under the new legislation many were not even aware that the new tax laws were retroactive to january  whether or not youre someone whose tax bill will increase as a result of these changes it may make sense to consider ways to keep more of what you earn first if your employer offers a k or b retirement savings plan consider enrolling these plans are set up so you can make regular contributions  before taxes  to a retirement savings plan they offer a disciplined savings strategy the ability to accumulate earnings taxdeferred and immediate tax savings for example if you earn  a year and contribute  of your salary to your k plan your annual contribution is  that reduces your taxable income to  and if youre in the  tax bracket saves you  in federal taxes in addition you pay no taxes on any earnings until withdrawal it may be a good idea to contact your benefits office as soon as possible to find out when you can enroll or increase your contribution most employers allow employees to make changes only a few times each year second consider an ira many people are eligible to make an ira contribution up to  that is fully tax deductible that includes people who are not covered by company pension plans or those within certain income brackets even if you dont qualify for a fully deductible contribution any ira earnings will grow taxdeferred until withdrawal third consider taxfree investments like municipal bonds and municipal bond funds often these can provide higher aftertax yields than comparable taxable investments for example if youre in the new  federal income tax bracket and invest  in a taxable investment yielding  youll pay  in federal taxes and receive  in income that same  invested in a taxfree bond fund yielding  would allow you to keep  in income these are three investment strategies that could help lower your tax bill in  if youre interested in learning more please call us at  or visit a fidelity investor center wishing you a prosperous new year edward c johnson d chairman performance the bottom line there are several ways to evaluate a funds historical performance you can look at the total percentage change in value the average annual percentage change or the growth of a hypothetical  investment each performance figure includes changes in a funds share price plus reinvestment of any dividends or income and capital gains the profits the fund earns when it sells stocks that have grown in value cumulative total returns period ended december   life of fund fidelity fifty  fidelity fifty including  sales charge  cumulative total returns reflect the funds actual performance over a set period  in this case since the fund began on september   for example if you had invested  in a fund that had a  return over the past year you would have  once the fund has a longer record you may want to compare it to the standard amp poors  composite stock price index  a common proxy for the us stock market you may also want to look at the performance of the average capital appreciation fund as tracked by lipper analytical services both benchmarks include reinvested dividends and capital gains if any they will appear in the funds next report six months from now average annual returns and the growth of a hypothetical  investment in the fund will also appear in the next report understanding performance how a fund did yesterday is no guarantee of how it will do tomorrow the stock market for example has a history of growth in the long run and volatility in the short run in turn the share price and return of a fund that invests in stocks will vary that means if you sell your shares during a market downturn you might lose money but if you can ride out the markets ups and downs you may have a gain checkmark fund talk the managers overview market recap low inflation falling interest rates and a gradually improving economy boosted us stocks during the  months ended december   the standard amp poors  stock index rose  in line with the markets longterm average annual return some tobacco drug and brandname consumer products stocks began to pick up by year end but had weak returns for the year overall those losses were offset by impressive gains in other sectors including technology although semiconductors gave back part of their gains in the fall other market leaders were finance notably securities brokers economicallysensitive sectors like autos and steel entertainment heavy machinery and precious metals communications stocks soared as traditional telephone utilities cellular companies and entertainment firms scrambled to form strategic alliances the nasdaq composite index  which tracks overthecounter stocks  rose  for the year but was outpaced by the dow jones industrial average  an index of  bluechip stocks  which rose  in midnovember the dow closed above  for the first time and finished the year at  most international markets easily outpaced us returns the morgan stanley eafe europe australia far east index rose  while the morgan stanley emerging markets index was up  for the year an interview with scott stewart portfolio manager of fidelity fifty q scott how has the fund performed a the fund broke out of the gate pretty quickly returning  from its start date on september   to december   for the fourth quarter  september  through year end  it returned  by comparison the average capital appreciation fund tracked by lipper analytical services returned  for the same period im encouraged by the strong start but i would caution against expecting the fund to maintain the same pace in  q what sets fidelity fifty apart from other capital appreciation funds a the biggest and most obvious difference is its limited number of stocks  generally  to  companies in that way its designed to look like the personal portfolio of an active investor the fund also differs from many of its peers because of my extensive use of quantitative techniques when choosing a stock i first use a computer program to screen more than  names followed by fidelitys research department identifying the  to  that appear most attractive at that point i do both fundamental analysis  a closeup human examination of the companys business prospects  and more quantitative research to help me narrow the list i also use computer programs to help me systematically analyze elements of a companys makeup that might make its stock risky critical information for a fund that invests in so few stocks a stocks estimated level of risk helps me determine how heavily to invest i dont play hunches and i usually avoid overriding the conclusions of the risk analysis q so what do you and the computer look for in a potential stock a i look for companies that seem to be undergoing a change for the better in their business prospects companies that for one reason or another now have a more positive outlook usually in terms of their balance sheets or earnings prospects sometimes its a company that has done poorly and whose stock has dropped in price but the research suddenly shows it has improved earnings potential other times i invest in companies that have been doing well for a while and whose earnings forecasts are now even better i build the portfolio using a bottom up approach that simply means i focus on the merits of individual companies rather than on industry sectors turnover in this fund will be high if a companys business prospects suddenly look less attractive relative to its stock price ill sell it and find a replacement with only  stocks i cant afford to stick with a laggard very long q what specific bets have paid off so far a there were several amgen was the funds second largest investment at year end the company has several successful drugs on the market including one thats increasingly used in chemotherapy to treat cancer patients amgens stock rose  from the end of september to the end of december health care was the funds largest sector investment on december  at  as a whole the group had an off year in  due mainly to uncertainty over healthcare reform but amgen is a good example of the type of healthcare company the fund sought out those that now have attractive products on the market or will soon have new products coming out at  media and leisure was the funds second biggest sector at year end some media companies have improved their cost structures and may soon see better revenues newspaper company timesmirror is an example the company has strong assets and should see increasing revenues as advertising picks up again the stock is up roughly  since the fund bought it in september q technology and retail were among the funds other large industry groups over the past few months what opportunities did you find in these sectors a i had to be careful picking technology stocks when the fund started in september by that time investors had bid up prices to levels that were quite high and tech stocks tend to be very volatile i think the funds most interesting story in this sector has been ibm we hadnt heard much about ibm since its steep plunge from its glory days on wall street but in september i felt the supply of mainframe systems like ibm produces was decreasing while demand seemed to be increasing the company was cutting costs and looked like it was becoming less bureaucratic most importantly the company appeared to be underestimating its own earnings prospects the stock was the funds top investment for a while and rose more than  from the end of september to the end of december q what about retail a most retail stocks had a tough year but some have rebounded lately as consumer confidence has picked up the funds most successful retail pick was the gap interestingly every friday my group here at fidelity has casual day when were allowed to leave our dress clothes at home many of us have talked about our need for more business casual clothes like we can find at stores like the gap i think this example is part of a larger trend that fits in well with the gaps story i bought the stock when the fund began because i felt the gap was well managed when retail stores were suffering they watched their inventory levels and were poised to benefit when sales picked up which they have the bet paid off the gaps stock went from  per share at the end of september to  per share by the end of december q what were the funds largest investments at year end a the funds biggest investment on december  was stanhome a manufacturer of consumer products and business goods improving business prospects and a stock price that showed stanhome was undervalued compared to its peer group made the company attractive stanhomes shipments of household goods are up and so is the stock about  since the fund invested in it in early november weve already discussed amgen the funds second largest investment third was cooper tire which i just bought in late december the company should benefit as its competitors reduce their production of lowerpriced tires cor therapeutics was next the company has strong management and produces successful drugs for angina and angioplasty i bought the stock in october and it was up nearly  by year end enterra corporation rounds out the top five i was drawn in by rising demand for enterras tool rentals and pipeline equipment along with the companys low stock price relative to its business prospects the fund bought enterra in november and the stock rose roughly  through the end of december q any disappointments so far a the biggest was fruitoftheloom fall sales werent as strong as i had expected i sold the stock as the price began dropping but it would have helped to get out earlier as weve already discussed poor performance from any one stock can have a significant effect on the entire fund q whats your outlook for the first six months of  a theres no doubt market valuations are high by historical measures and the market certainly could decline in the next six months if interest rates climb or corporate earnings begin to suffer lately the fund has been leaning toward investing in smaller more growthoriented companies  those with accelerating earnings as the economy picks up steam i think the business prospects of these companies may tend to improve faster than those in the standard amp poors  index my hope is as a result the fund will outperform the index fund facts goal to increase the value of the funds shares by investing in the stocks of  companies start date september   size as of december   over  million manager scott stewart since september  manager pension and institutional accounts since  checkmark scott stewart on limiting risk the fate of any one stock has a bigger effect on this fund than it would on a fund that holds hundreds of securities thats why the fund plays by certain rules that aim to help keep risk in check first i try to make sure any given stock makes up no more than  of the funds investments and ill further restrict stocks with risky prospects second the fund will not be overweighted in any industry group by more than  for example at year end the healthcare sector made up  of the stocks in the standard amp poors  index that means the fund wouldnt have more than a  stake in health care third i have liquidity requirements for stocks i buy for the fund if a stock doesnt trade often enough i wont invest in it that helps ensure that i can sell a stock quickly if i have to bullet the fund had a  stake in shortterm investments on december  that may appear high but was somewhat offset by the funds  investment in sampp  futures contracts these contracts allow the fund to participate in broad market moves while awaiting suitable opportunities to invest in individual companies this also limits transaction costs incurred from

account information are needed please call  presidents message photoofedwardcjohnsond dear shareholder although financial turmoil in pacific basin countries was a catalyst for significant volatility in us markets throughout the fourth quarter the standard  poors  index rose more than  in  about three times its historical annual average meanwhile bond markets  primarily influenced by a relatively steady flow of positive news on the inflation front  continued to post solid returns as the year drew to a close while its impossible to predict the future direction of the markets with any degree of certainty there are certain basic principles that can help investors plan for their future needs first investors are encouraged to take a longterm view of their portfolios if you can afford to leave your money invested through the inevitable up and down cycles of the financial markets you will greatly reduce your vulnerability to any single decline we know from experience for example that stock prices have gone up over longer periods of time have significantly outperformed other types of investments and have stayed ahead of inflation second you can further manage your investing risk through diversification a stock mutual fund for instance is already diversified because it invests in many different companies you can increase your diversification further by investing in a number of different stock funds or in such other investment categories as bonds if you have a short investment time horizon you might want to consider moving some of your investment into a money market fund which seeks income and a stable share price by investing in highquality shortterm investments of course its important to remember that there is no assurance that a money market fund will achieve its goal of maintaining a stable net asset value of  per share and that these types of funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by any agency of the us government finally no matter what your time horizon or portfolio diversity it makes good sense to follow a regular investment plan investing a certain amount of money in a fund at the same time each month or quarter and periodically reviewing your overall portfolio by doing so you wont get caught up in the excitement of a rapidly rising market nor will you buy all your shares at market highs while this strategy  known as dollar cost averaging  wont assure a profit or protect you from a loss in a declining market it should help you lower the average cost of your purchases if you have questions please call us at  we are available  hours a day seven days a week to provide you the information you need to make the investments that are right for you best regards edward c johnson d performance the bottom line there are several ways to evaluate a funds historical performance you can look at the total percentage change in value the average annual percentage change or the growth of a hypothetical  investment total return reflects the change in the value of an investment assuming reinvestment of the funds dividend income and capital gains the profits earned upon the sale of securities that have grown in value fidelity fifty has a  sales charge which was waived beginning january   through december   cumulative total returns periods ended december   past  past  life of months year fund fidelity fifty    fidelity fifty incl  sales charge    sp  registered trademark    capital appreciation funds average   na cumulative total returns show the funds performance in percentage terms over a set period  in this case six months one year or since the fund started on september   for example if you had invested  in a fund that had a  return over the past year the value of your investment would be  you can compare the funds returns to the performance of the standard  poors  index  a widely recognized unmanaged index of common stocks to measure how the funds performance stacked up against its peers you can compare it to the capital appreciation funds average which reflects the performance of mutual funds with similar objectives tracked by lipper analytical services inc the past six months average represents a peer group of  mutual funds these benchmarks reflect reinvestment of dividends and capital gains if any and exclude the effect of sales charges average annual total returns periods ended december   past  life of year fund fidelity fifty   fidelity fifty incl  sales charge   sp    capital appreciation funds average  na average annual total returns take the funds cumulative return and show you what would have happened if the fund had performed at a constant rate each year note lipper calculates average annual total returns by annualizing each funds total return then taking an arithmetic average this may produce a slightly different figure than that obtained by averaging the cumulative total returns and annualizing the result  over life of fund imahdr prasun shrcht    s fidelity fifty sp   sp                                                                                                                                                                imatrl prasun shrcht    r  over life of fund lets say hypothetically that  was invested in fidelity fifty on september   when the fund started and the current  sales charge was paid as the chart shows by december   the value of the investment would have grown to   a  increase on the initial investment for comparison look at how the sp  did over the same period with dividends and capital gains if any reinvested the same  investment would have grown to   a  increase understanding performance how a fund did yesterday is no guarantee of how it will do tomorrow the stock market for example has a history of longterm growth and shortterm volatility in turn the share price and return of a fund that invests in stocks will vary that means if you sell your shares during a market downturn you might lose money but if you can ride out the markets ups and downs you may have a gain checkmark fund talk the managers overview an interview with scott stewart portfolio manager of fidelity fifty q how did the fund perform scott a it was a difficult period over the past six months but the fund was ahead of its peers for the year for the six months that ended december   the fund returned  this trailed the capital appreciation funds average which returned  according to lipper analytical services the standard  poors  index returned  for the  months that ended december   the fund returned  while the lipper group and sp  returned  and  respectively q what factors affected performance a market dynamics played a key role through the end of september stocks of small and mediumsized companies  which fidelity fifty tends to emphasize to a greater extent than the sp   performed nicely relative to the largecapitalization stocks that heavily weight the sp  in fact the russell  index  which measures the performance of smallcap stocks  outgained the sp  by a healthy margin during the months of august and september beginning in october however the fortunes of smallcap stocks took a downturn as global volatility  specifically caused by currency turmoil in southeast asia  came into play when markets experience the type of turmoil we saw during that time investors tend to favor larger more steady stocks over smaller aggressivegrowth stocks since asia accounts for a significant portion of world semiconductor production most of the funds semiconductor equipment stocks  such as kla tencor which the fund no longer held at the end of the period and asm lithography  declined during this turmoil in addition some of the funds positions with considerable asian business exposure were hurt citicorp the funds largest holding at the end of the period was a prime example citicorp remained a top holding at the end of the period because i felt the impact of this asian volatility  over the longterm  would be small the company also has good risk controls in place q in terms of portfolio volatility how does a fund such as fidelity fifty  which is comprised of between  to  stocks  fare relative to a more diversified stock fund when events occur such as we had in asia a because of the concentration of this fund it will most likely experience a stronger jolt than a diversified stock fund will in times of volatility a diversified stock fund invests in hundreds of different stocks in all sorts of industries with fidelity fifty i try to maintain a good degree of diversity among those  to  stocks q when the market changes to reward stocks of different sizes do you change your investing philosophy a over the long term individual stock selection will provide the primary source of active performance however market dynamics such as the significant outperformance of largecap stocks during the past few years may dominate stock selection over shorter periods of time the bottomup process i follow  choosing stocks based more on a companys business prospects than on industry or economic trends  leads to the selection of largecap names as well as small and mediumcap stocks however i dont try to actively switch between large and smallcaps in anticipation of the outperformance of one category over the other this would be market timing and  similar to trying to predict the direction of interest rates  is usually an exercise in futility many unpredictable factors such as the economic climate and interest rates determine the performance of large stocks versus small stocks q six months ago you explained why holding futures can be an effective part of your strategy did you continue to use these instruments during the period a i did futures  which made up around  of the funds assets at the end of the period  have been a part of my strategy since the fund began in  investing in futures  either of the sp  or russell  variety  allows the fund to stay fully invested while shareholders move money into and out of it the way i think of it is that returns from futures plus the funds cash position equals the approximate return of stocks that is the profits from futures plus the funds base of cash added together can perform very much like a stock index does during the period the funds russell  futures performed well when smallcaps surged and the sp  futures contributed positively as largecap stocks regained momentum in the fourth quarter q you increased the funds mediarelated stocks during the period what was the draw a two of the funds larger media stock positions  viacom and cbs corp  performed well for different reasons viacom realized strong performance from both its movie production and blockbuster video rental businesses after a period of sluggish growth investors finally started to recognize the value of blockbuster cbs benefited after a string of acquisitions and proactive restructuring efforts began to show signs of taking hold q which stocks performed well were there any disappointments a positions that contributed positively included thrift stock dime bancorp  which benefited from improved balancesheet management loan growth and takeovers in the finance industry falcon drilling which specializes in deepwater oil exploration and retail stock tjx companies among the disappointments were businessservice stock sitel and diskdrive manufacturer quantum q whats your outlook a not to sound like a broken record but im a firm believer that earnings and interest rates are the two main factors behind stock performance with the currency and potential economic crises in asia  and the expected slowing of global growth as a result  earnings growth for multinational companies may be at risk in the short term at least deflation in some overseas markets  a scenario in which goods and products become cheaper for us consumers  appears to indicate that interest rates will remain relatively stable if interest rates rise largecap stocks could suffer that being said my goal continues to be to find attractive stocks one at a time and not try to time the markets the views expressed in this report reflect those of the portfolio manager only through the end of the period of the report as stated on the cover the managers views are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions scott stewart discusses the finance and energy service sectors as interestrate levels continued to decline during the period and banks reduced their expenses finance stocks became more attractive several large banks  including bankamerica and nationsbank  successfully integrated recent acquisitions the fund also realized positive contributions from dime bancorp a thriftrelated position that experienced increased profitability there was a slew of positive consolidation activity in the finance industry and i think theres more to come the fund also realized solid contributions from its energy service and drilling stocks including falcon drilling and bj services while oil prices have dropped recently a company like falcon drilling might continue to perform well the company is involved more in deepwater oil exploration where the oil reserves are more plentiful deepwater exploration is expensive but the rewards can be fruitful fund facts goal to increase the value of the funds shares by investing

photoofedwardcjohnsond dear shareholder although financial turmoil in pacific basin countries was a catalyst for significant volatility in us markets throughout the fourth quarter the standard  poors  index rose more than  in  about three times its historical annual average meanwhile bond markets  primarily influenced by a relatively steady flow of positive news on the inflation front  continued to post solid returns as the year drew to a close while its impossible to predict the future direction of the markets with any degree of certainty there are certain basic principles that can help investors plan for their future needs first investors are encouraged to take a longterm view of their portfolios if you can afford to leave your money invested through the inevitable up and down cycles of the financial markets you will greatly reduce your vulnerability to any single decline we know from experience for example that stock prices have gone up over longer periods of time have significantly outperformed other types of investments and have stayed ahead of inflation second you can further manage your investing risk through diversification a stock mutual fund for instance is already diversified because it invests in many different companies you can increase your diversification further by investing in a number of different stock funds or in such other investment categories as bonds if you have a short investment time horizon you might want to consider moving some of your investment into a money market fund which seeks income and a stable share price by investing in highquality shortterm investments of course its important to remember that there is no assurance that a money market fund will achieve its goal of maintaining a stable net asset value of  per share and that these types of funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by any agency of the us government finally no matter what your time horizon or portfolio diversity it makes good sense to follow a regular investment plan investing a certain amount of money in a fund at the same time each month or quarter and periodically reviewing your overall portfolio by doing so you wont get caught up in the excitement of a rapidly rising market nor will you buy all your shares at market highs while this strategy  known as dollar cost averaging  wont assure a profit or protect you from a loss in a declining market it should help you lower the average cost of your purchases if you have questions please call us at  we are available  hours a day seven days a week to provide you the information you need to make the investments that are right for you best regards edward c johnson d performance the bottom line there are several ways to evaluate a funds historical performance you can look at the total percentage change in value the average annual percentage change or the growth of a hypothetical  investment total return reflects the change in the value of an investment assuming

in this case six months one year five years or  years for example if you had invested  in a fund that had a  return over the past year the value of your investment would be  you can compare the funds returns to the performance of the standard  poors  index  a widely recognized unmanaged index of common stocks to measure how the funds performance stacked up against its peers you can compare it to the growth  income funds average which reflects the performance of mutual funds with similar objectives tracked by lipper analytical services inc the past six months average represents a peer group of  mutual funds these benchmarks reflect reinvestment of dividends and capital gains if any and exclude the effect of sales charges average annual total returns periods ended december   past  past  past

fund on december   as the chart shows by december   the value of the investment would have grown to   a  increase on the initial investment for comparison look at how the sp  did over the same period with dividends and capital gain if any reinvested the same  investment would have grown to   a  increase understanding performance how a fund did yesterday is no guarantee of how it will do tomorrow the stock market for example has a history of longterm growth and shortterm volatility in turn the share price and return of a fund that invests in stocks will vary that means if you sell your shares during a market downturn you might lose money but if you can ride out the markets ups and downs you may have a gain checkmark fund talk the managers overview an interview with beth terrana portfolio manager of fidelity fund q how did the fund perform beth a quite well for the six months that ended december   the fund returned  this topped the standard  poors  index which returned  during the same period the fund also outperformed the growth and income funds average which returned  according to lipper analytical services for the  months that ended december   the fund returned  the index and the lipper peer group returned  and  respectively during that time q what factors contributed to the funds strong showing a the main driver behind the funds solid performance  and the area where i focus most of my attention  was stock selection foremost id point to retail store investments where both stock picking and an industry overweighting  more than double that of the sp   were positive contributors during the period in fact retailing stocks were among the strongest industry groups in the sp  specifically good individual contributors included consolidated stores  which owns kaybee toy stores  and gap inc which operates several leadingedge apparel chains the fund also benefited from stock selection within the finance health care and technology sectors strong performers in these industries included bankamerica drugmaker bristolmyers squibb and personal computermaker compaq q continuing with the retail story the funds exposure to this sector climbed to around  of assets as of december  why were these stocks appealing a i detected several positive industry trends that i felt provided a favorable backdrop among these trends were a reduction in store overcapacity  or less overall floor space  that had hurt the industry for some time a keener focus on the bottom line or earnings by company managements and newfound attention to returns on invested capital while it would be a stretch to say that all retailers recently have mended their ways it was clear to me that there were a number of attractive stocks with the potential for upward revaluations of their pricetoearnings pe multiples the story behind big discounter walmart  the funds largest retail investment at the end of the period  illustrates my theory following the companys rapid growth during the s  which resulted in very strong stock appreciation  walmarts returns deteriorated and its stock dramatically underperformed the market from  through  recognizing that it had a problem walmart committed itself to a new financial discipline emphasizing returns on its capital base and earnings growth began to accelerate based on these positive developments the stock recently began to perform well q what characteristics do you look for when deciding whether to buy a stock a ive always been a bottomup investor who believes that superior investment performance emanates from owning stocks of companies with improving financial returns improvements in financial returns drive both sustainable improvements in a companys secular growth rate and its earnings power when im analyzing the pros and cons of a stock the important factors i look for include restructuring potential rising returns on invested capital good balance sheet management strong free cash flow and shareholderfriendly management more recently global franchises and strong brands have also increasingly become important factors ive generally found that companies exhibiting some or all of these attributes tend to generate improving financial returns  including expanding profit margins and accelerating earnings growth rates  through time further as a firms financial returns improve its stock is likely to be rewarded with a higher valuation once the market catches on q time warner is a relatively new top  holding what made this stock attractive during the period a fundamentally the company has a number of media franchises  including warner brothers time warner cable cnn and time magazine  with wide global reach also the company has been focusing intently on improving its financial returns for example previously high levels of capital spending  largely related to its cable television operations  were expected to peak and then decline a development that i felt could enhance the companys freecashflow dynamics the potential for this to occur  and for time warner to continue expanding and enhancing its worldwide franchises as a result  made this stock attractive q which other stocks performed well during the period which were disappointments a other strong performers included general electric diversified industrial tyco international and ibm there werent any major setbacks but several smaller positions  including columbiahca healthcare and waste management  lagged the market the fund no longer held waste management at the close of the period q whats your outlook for the coming months a given the economic difficulties we saw in southeast asia during the last quarter of  global economic growth may be sluggish if there is such a slowdown stocks with predictable sustainable earnings growth likely will outperform economically sensitive cyclical stocks and commoditiesbased stocks of course those companies with significant revenue exposure to the asian region could be particularly affected so ill continue to try to limit the funds investments to companies whose earnings are susceptible to such a slowdown the views expressed in this report reflect those of the portfolio manager only through the end of the period of the report as stated on the cover the managers views are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions beth terrana discusses corporate restructuring during the past decade weve witnessed enormous improvements in the competitiveness of us companies these improvements have been achieved mostly through productivityenhancing measures such as cutting costs and improving technology given this backdrop im often asked whether us companies can continue to derive gains from these efforts i believe the answer is yes but that we are entering a new and somewhat different phase while undoubtedly there will always be ways to reduce costs and increase productivity the majority of the basic incomerelated improvements have been accomplished instead companies are now more focused on their balance sheets under this new balancesheetdriven approach managements are zeroed in on deploying capital to maximize shareholder returns on capital in keeping with this philosophy businesses that generate robust returns on capital are grown while underperformers are either fixed or perhaps sold to other companies that may have synergies or scale economies that could lead to enhanced returns fund facts goal to increase the value of the funds shares over the long term by investing mainly in equity securities with good prospects for

supplementary information the following is a summary of the application the complete application may be obtained via the commissions web site by searching for the file number or an applicant using the

delaware as applicable each trust is registered under the act as an openend management investment company fmr co sai or another fmr entity serves as investment adviser or subadviser to each of the funds fmr co and sai are investment advisers registered under the investment advisers act of  “advisers act” any investment adviser to the funds will be registered under the advisers act  the prior order permits the funds to participate in a credit facility administered by fmr the “ifl program” the ifl program enables the funds to lend money to each other for temporary purposes such as when redemptions exceed anticipated levels the ifl program is designed both to reduce the cost of borrowing for the funds and enhance the lending funds ability to earn higher rates of interest of investment on their shortterm balances the prior order requires that the interest rate for loans made through the ifl program the “ifl rate” be based on the average of a the higher of the overnight time deposit rate the “otd rate” and the funds current overnight repurchase agreement rate the “ficash rate”  and b a benchmark rate representing the lowest bank loan rate available for borrowing by the funds “benchmark rate” the board of trustees each a “fund board” and collectively the “fund boards” of each fund including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons” as defined in section a of the act “independent trustees” establishes the benchmark rate and reviews no less frequently than annually the continuing appropriateness of the benchmark rate the benchmark rate is currently set each day based on the average actual spread between the lowest quoted bank loan rate and the federal funds rate over the previous  days  applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the otd rate in calculation of the ifl rate unnecessary therefore applicants seek to amend the prior order to eliminate the use of the otd rate in the ifl rate calculation provided in conditions  and  “rate conditions” applicants also request an exemption from section a of the act applicants legal analysis  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or affiliated person of an affiliated person from borrowing money or other property from the registered investment company section b of the act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person directly or indirectly if that person controls or is under common control with that company section ac of the act defines an “affiliated person” of another person in part to be any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with such other person section a of the act defines “control” as the “power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company” but excludes circumstances in which “such power is solely the result of an official position with such company” because the funds share a common investment adviser or have an investment adviser that is under common control with those of the other funds applicants state that each fund may be deemed to be under common control with all the other funds and therefore an affiliated person of those funds  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from selling securities or other property to the investment company section a of the act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company section d of the act prohibits a registered investment company from purchasing or otherwise acquiring any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section  section f of the act prohibits registered openend investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank if immediately after the borrowing there is asset coverage of at least  per centum for all borrowings of the company under section g of the act the term “senior security” generally includes any bond debenture note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness  section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a provided that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and with the general purposes of the act section c of the act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section d if and to the extent such exception is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors  section d of the act and rule d under the act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of an affiliated person when acting as principal from effecting any joint transaction in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the commission rule db provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule the commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which the companys participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  applicants request an order under a section c of the act granting an exemption from sections f and b of the act b section dj of the act granting an exemption from section d of the act c sections c and b of the act granting an exemption from sections a a and a of the act and d section d of the act and rule d under the act to permit certain joint arrangements the requested order would amend the rate conditions in the prior order and grant applicants an exemption from section a of the act  as noted previously applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the otd rate in calculation of the ifl rate unnecessary applicants state further that the ifl rate as amended would make it more likely that lending funds would receive a market rate of return in excess of other market alternatives and that borrowing funds would not be harmed because they would only participate in the ifl program if the ifl rate is lower than the lowest quoted bank loan rate applicants state that the rate conditions will prove to be a more efficient means for achieving savings to the funds in connection with their routine daily cash management activities and for providing funds with alternative sources of liquidity in times of substantial net redemption activity  applicants also state that the ifl program as modified by the rate conditions will not involve any potential that one fund might receive a preferential interest rate to the disadvantage of another fund applicants state that under the ifl program as modified by the rate conditions rates will be set under a preestablished formula approved by the fund boards applicants state that all funds participating in the ifl program as revised by the rate conditions on any given day will receive the same interest rate  applicants therefore submit that the modifications to the rate conditions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest consistent with the protection of investors and the policy and provisions of the act and meet the standards set forth in sections c dj b and d of the act and rule d under the act applicants represent that the transactions conducted subject to the rate conditions would be reasonable and fair would not involve overreaching and would be consistent with the investment policies of the funds and with the general purposes of the act applicants submit further that each funds participation in the ifl program would be consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and would be on a basis which is no different from or less advantageous than that of any other participant applicants conditions applicants agree that any order of the commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  the ifl rate to be charged to the funds under the ifl program will be the average of a the ficash rate and b the benchmark rate  on each business day the cash management services department “cash management department” of fidelity service company inc will compare the ifl rate calculated as provided in condition  with the ficash rate that day and all shortterm borrowing rates quoted to any of the funds by any bank with which any fund has a loan agreement at least three such quotations will be obtained each day in which any fund borrows through the ifl program prior to such borrowing the cash management department will make cash available for
