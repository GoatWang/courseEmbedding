longlasting communications sensors and other portable electronics devices police fire and other first responder personnel often operate in environments where power is unavailable for long periods of time their reliance on communications and related devices is absolute and often a matter of life or death first responder devices require a dependable lightweight compact power source to extend operational runtimes in addition the electronic equipment and power sources need to be able to perform reliably under harsh operating conditions in the field neah power’s patented siliconbased fuel cell is expected to address these fundamental issues and provide a superior power source for diverse first responder applications instant “recharge” for continuous computing importantly first responders can benefit from the ability to continuously run their electronic equipment without the need to wait for recharging fuel cells can produce power as long as a fuel source is provided when one fuel cartridge is exhausted it can simply be replaced by another one to continue the power supply instead of carrying multiple batteries first responders would only need to carry one fuel cell and several lightweight fuel cartridges for continuous power capability fully sealed system neah power’s design can be configured as an open air system for greater runtime capacity or as a fullysealed system for predictable operation under a wide variety of field conditions both configurations capture the reaction byproducts inside the fuel cartridge the openair system requires exposure to air for its oxygen source while the fullysealed system contains a liquid oxidant alongside methanol fuel in the cartridge management  neah power systems neah power management and corporate governance neah

communication forums were not as effective in our opinion so we will communicate directly to you through monthly shareholder letters as well as responding to valid queries directed to the company infoneahpowercom    status of the clear path teaming agreement we recently reported a teaming agreement with clear path technologies related to security and defense applications we are pleased with the progress in deploying the formira hod technologies for a variety of applications in the mena middle east north africa regions we have submitted quotations for potential multimillion dollar opportunities we have assembled and continue to run five w reformer units to baseline and optimize performance we are sharing the specifications with customers and partners under nondisclosure agreement these five units are helping us scale up the systems to larger  w units as well as  previously discussed we are finalizing a date with tectonica to demonstrate our product for certain defense applications in australia we are working with silent falcon to integrate the fuel cell into their fixed wing drone we will keep you updated on these exciting developments  status of the shorai acquisition we previously announced the signing of a definitive agreement to merge with shorai inc with a targeted completion date of july    while we had all expected the transaction to be completed by now and be well into the integration of the two companies both parties continue to support the business combination as evidenced by the signing of multiple extensions in order to consummate the transaction which requires a capitalization event  neah has a several term sheets from funders and expects to complete a transaction as soon as practicable  the acquisition of shorai is expected to be immediately accretive with shorai reporting  million unaudited revenue for the twelve months ended december  and positive cash flow in q   once acquired our combined operations will enjoy access to

manufactured and shipped against a traditional open purchase order and subsequently paid for  product testing qualification and acceptance by a third party a government owned entity were completed december   this is significant because this was to be final hurdle that would result in a commercial relationship with the government of india  the dismissal of the drdo chief earlier this year in february january caused a delay of advancement for various projects neahs being one of them  the recent appointments at the drdo last month should facilitate a closing of our ongoing commercial arrangement with the indian government in short order formira hodtm hydrogen on demand our formira hodtm fuel cell continues to demonstrate bestinclass performance we are in preliminary discussions with several leading manufacturers of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs remote robotic vehicles automotive rail offgrid power and medical device companies  the formira hodtm fuel cell has been proven as a safe costeffective and energy dense solution for the production of hydrogen for a variety of applications  it surpasses other sources of energy like compressed hydrogen the most commonly used method of utilizing hydrogen to generate energy  we are presently designing the formira hodtm system into uavs with silent falcon and tectonica is coordinating with an australia defense customer the timing for a demo in australia we have provided several request for quotes rfqs to potential  customers which we hope to convert to commercial business buzzbar suite gen   gen  as previously reported to date neah power has shipped all of the orders that we received through the website and our indiegogo campaign  we also have presented the product to various big box retailers and end users and have aggregated the feedback from them into buzzbar gen   our gen  buzzbar has received very good reviews  pending the completion of a satisfactory capital raise and upon completing the shorai acquisition we expect shipping of the gen  buzzbar to commence later this year  our objective is to leverage the shorai brand and marketing prowess to launch the gen  in a most significant way we look forward to announcing more exciting news and milestones very soon  as we develop the numerous opportunities at hand expand our business development efforts going forward and secure the necessary capital to fully execute our plan management will continue working hard to accomplish the mission  our success is only achieved with the tireless work of our employees the support of our shareholders the diligent

chris dcoutos company specializes in micro electric power systems backup batteries that recharge your cellphone tiny micro fuel cells and now a reformer that converts formic acid the key ingredient in ant venom into hydrogen gas for running up to  kw fuel cells   the public relations company wondered if id be interested in learning more about a company called neah power based in bothwell washington besides their micro fuel cell based buzzbar and buzzcell battery technology they are working on a fuel cell system that runs off of formic acid formic acid before i agreed i decided to first find out what formic acid is it sounded dangerous turns out it is one of the more benign chemicals made up of two hydrogen atoms that bookend a carbon atom and two oxygen atoms its chemical designation is hcooh as wikipedia noted it is a natural chemical that ants produce for their venom its also used to preserve cattle silage among its other industrial applications maybe best of all it can be produced by a renewable process that recycles co out of the atmosphere via plant biomass joan slonczewski notes on her blog that the bacterium acetobacterium woodii can be stimulated to convert dangerous carbon monoxide found in syngas into formic acid a clear liquid that can be shipped and stored like any liquid fuel using formic acid as a fuel is where neah power comes into the picture besides their battery and micro fuel cell technology the company last year acquired a firm that developed a reformer that rips apart the formic acid molecule separating the two hydrogen atoms from the carbon and oxygen atoms those hydrogen atoms can then be fed into a fuel cell including their own micro fuel cell to generate electric power while the company is mainly focused on subkilowatt energy applications it has developed some experimental units capable of outputting up to five kw according to dr chris dcouto neah powers ceo and the featured guest in the interview below a five kilowatt hour fuel cell running off a tank of liquid formic acid would be configured to trickle charge an electric vehicles battery allowing it like the gasoline engine generator in the bmw i rex to offer extended range capability unlike the i rex the only tailpipe emission would be water vapor and co part  httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvuazfoowkqg part  httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvwspktqufda   published on sep   dr chris dcoutos

car less expensive on any number of measures including upfront cost maintence costs as well as total cost of ownership  however that would be an issue that would play out with the automotive manufacturers how quickly would neah be able to provide a fuel cell for say a number one auto company like toyota neah power has functional units in a variety of configurations that would be appropriate for automotive applications  the balance of system and integration of the fuel cell into the electronics would be a joint development process with the identified automobile company   as such the successful approach is to characterize the fuel cell have a specific application development program followed by production and product sales is there an intense manufacturing process involved in scaling up production of fuel cells for automotive applications what kind of infrastructure is required and what kind of jobs would result there is not an intense manufacturing process involved in scale up production of neah power fuel cells  the scaling of production is a matter of electronics assembly and plastics injection molding similar to that of other electronic assemblies  the value proposition that neah power can offer is higher energy densities and lower costs offering a safe and effective solution and eliminating range and power issues associated with electric vehicles  neah power becomes the enabler allow electric hybrid vehicles to go mainstream where is david schmidt now david schmidt mr david schmidt is a specialty materials and healthcare expert in the

share    newsusa  sponsored news  in a world that values  connectivity consumers are quickly learning that technology and the demands we place on it do not necessarily align think about it technology requires power but energy sources that are currently available cant possibly meet our needs but what if they could imagine charging your cell phone or tablet weekly instead of daily or multiple times per day or driving an electric car for  miles instead of  before needing a recharge thats the question that set washingtonbased neah power systems inc on the path to finding a solution to power everything from your laptop to your tablet to your car and the answer says the company may be closer than you think at the heart of its products is the powerchip battery  a dynamic new energy technology that has applications for consumer commercial and automotive clients to solve specific power requirements unlike other newage battery concepts the neah battery uses only standard battery components that are found in existing batteries used today  just used differently neah has  patents and  pending patent applications for among others the use of silicon substrates for fuel cells and batteries in neahs powerchip battery the company is building a rechargeable lithium battery in a d architecture using industry standard materials that provide high density energy per unit weight or per unit volume and can address the safety concerns typically seen in lithium  ion batteries neah is already building samples for field testing for its first customer we use our patented porous silicon d architectures to maximize power this is the first truly new battery design in the past  years that is manufactureable by using oldergeneration computer chip manufacturing equipment we have seen tremendous improvements with moores law in semiconductors and this battery brings similar economies of scale to the battery landscape as well we finally have a battery capable of delivering the portable and wearable power required to maximize the x needs of our interconnected life says neahs ceo dr chris dcouto our company goal was to not only make batteries lighter smaller and more powerful but to make them more affordable than traditional batteries people are tired of having to recharge their smart phones during their daily activities because of this cuttingedge technology neah caught the attention of tritente of alexandria va a global energy and microdata center company tritente recently said it plans to deploy greater than  million of neahs powerchip batteries in their projects in africa europe and the caribbean by using neahs highcapacity energy generation and storage products tritente is able to bring the artiliumafrica microdata center technologies to thirdworld population centers without a  grid system we chose neah because its next generation energy storage system is powerful cost effective and compatible with tritentes  billion plan to deploy renewable energy in africa and to bring the artiliumafrica solution to every african country mobile operation educational institution government entities and every cell phone holder says paul delkaso chief executive officer of tritente and managing partner of artiliumafrica currently artrilliumafrica expects to have between  to  data centers throughout each country throughout africa most will be powered by renewable energy and will include neahs microchip nextgeneration energy storage system while information about other products is currently on the wwwneahpowercom website due to various pending

for defense commercial and consumer uses the unique architecture using lithium metal and porous silicon is making the battery five times more powerful than batteries in production today d’couto said theoretical modeling of the battery shows that it should be producing even more energy storage and output than it already does d’couto said with assistance of the national laboratory neah power hopes to identify the changes that need to be made so the practical application matches up with the theoretical modeling there’s long been a search to build a better battery that can store and produce more energy and “live forever and cost nothing” said ira bloom senior chemist and group leader at argonne national laboratory he pointed to the carbon zinc batteries at hardware stores noting how they come in many shapes and sizes he said changing the battery’s chemistery also changes everything “it’s a scientific discipline but how you make it can be an art form” bloom said “once you figure out how to produce it it’s very reproduceable” he said he’s unfamiliar with neah’s powerchip but looks forward to working on it “it presents an interesting challenge no question about it” bloom said “i hope

httpneahpowercomwpcontentuploadsconsiliumglobalresearchpdf we offer the following summary of the company’s ip in combination with some other value elements as a reasonable compendium to measure the company’s latent value table  this sum of the parts approach produces a present value of all of the company’s intellectual assets and tax loss carryforwards of  million in our second more practical approach we estimated the company’s likely revenue progression over the next two years and calculated a revenue achievement of  million which when a x revenue multiple is applied produces a value of approximately  million which discounted at a  annual discount rate over two years produces a base value of  million add in the tax loss carryforwards estimated value of  million and a total value of  million can be calculated currently the company is trading with an enterprise value of about  million the steep discount from our valuation calculations is almost certainly attributed to the enduring inability of the company to generate revenues and the generally disappointing history of fuel cell investments investing at this time before real commercial corroboration takes place has its obvious risks but it will not take long to respond positively if any of the pending customer discussions translate to real material engagements it is understandable however why the market is taking a “show
