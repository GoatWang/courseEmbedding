prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company uses results on constant currency as a nongaap financial measure in this press release our constant currency revenue disclosures estimate the impact of changes in foreign currency rates on the translation of the companys current period revenue as compared to the applicable comparable period in the prior year this impact is derived by taking the current local currency revenue and translating it into us dollars based upon the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the local currency revenue for the applicable comparable period in the prior year rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period it does not include any other effect of changes in foreign currency rates on the companys results or business full reconciliation of these nongaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures is set forth in the tables below our management believes the nongaap financial measures disclosed in this press release are useful to investors in assessing the operating performance of our business and provide meaningful comparisons to prior periods and thus a more complete understanding of our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure specifically we consider the change in constant currency revenue as a useful metric as it provides an alternative framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations the nongaap financial measures included in this press release may be different from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies these nongaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to gaap measures we urge investors to review the reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included in this press release and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business forwardlooking statementsexcept for historical information certain statements in this press release are forwardlooking in nature and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions about us our business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and consequently actual results may differ materially from those projected by any forwardlooking statements

introduce and market new products delays in product introductions significant competition inability to further penetrate our current customer base expand our user base and increase the frequency of use of our products by our customers inability to achieve or maintain satisfactory pricing and margins manufacturing difficulties permanent writedowns or writeoffs of our inventory product defects or failures unfavorable outcomes in clinical trials inability to maintain our culture as we grow fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and potential adverse regulatory actions these risks and uncertainties as well as others are discussed in greater detail in our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec including our annual report on form k for the year ended december   filed
