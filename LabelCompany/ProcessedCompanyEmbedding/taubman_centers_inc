in line with our expectations as we delivered strong earnings growth with adjusted ffo per share up more than  percent” said robert s taubman chairman president and chief executive officer of taubman

ffo which excludes  per diluted common share of yeartodate adjustments is expected to be in the range of  to  per diluted common share revised from the previous range of  to  the revision to the

will be in the range of  to  percent for the year the company’s previous comparable center noi growth guidance including lease cancellation income was about  ½ percent excluding lease cancellation income comparable center noi growth is expected to be in the range of flat to  percent the revised noi outlook is primarily a result of lower average occupancy for the year lower net recoveries and increased bad debt expense the company’s guidance does not reflect any future costs that may be incurred related to shareowner activism “despite the significant headwinds our industry continues to face there is good demand for space in our centers we believe our high quality portfolio is wellpositioned to weather this storm and will gain market share over time” added mr taubman supplemental

of the operating partnerships consolidated and unconsolidated businesses beneficial interest in ebitda represents the operating partnership’s share of the earnings before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization of its consolidated and unconsolidated businesses the company believes ebitda and beneficial interest in ebitda provide useful indicators of operating performance as it is customary in the real estate and shopping center business to evaluate the performance of properties on a basis unaffected by capital structure   the company uses net operating income noi as an alternative measure to evaluate the operating performance of centers both on individual and stabilized portfolio bases the company defines noi as propertylevel operating revenues includes rental income excluding straightline adjustments of minimum rent less maintenance taxes utilities promotion ground rent including straightline adjustments and other property operating expenses since noi excludes general and administrative expenses predevelopment charges interest income and expense depreciation and amortization impairment charges restructuring charges and gains from peripheral land and property dispositions it provides a performance measure that when compared period over period reflects the revenues and expenses most directly associated with owning and operating rental properties as well as the impact on their operations from trends in tenant sales occupancy and rental rates and operating costs the company also uses noi excluding lease cancellation income as an alternative measure because this income may vary significantly from period to period which can affect comparability and trend analysis the company generally provides separate projections for expected comparable center noi growth and lease cancellation income comparable centers are generally defined as centers that were owned and open for the entire current and preceding period presented excluding centers impacted by significant redevelopment activity   the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines funds from operations ffo as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of properties and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate plus real estate related depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures the company believes that ffo is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for reits historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions the company and most industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results that exclude historical cost depreciation to be useful in evaluating the operating performance of reits the company primarily uses ffo in measuring performance and in formulating corporate goals and compensation   the company may also present adjusted versions of noi beneficial interest in ebitda and ffo when used by management to evaluate operating performance when certain significant items have impacted results that affect comparability with prior or future periods due to the nature or amounts of these items the company believes the disclosure of the adjusted items is similarly useful to investors and others to understand managements view on comparability of such measures between periods for the three and six month periods ended june   ffo and ebitda were adjusted to exclude a restructuring charge and costs incurred associated with shareowner activism for the six months ended june   ffo was also adjusted for a charge recognized in connection with the partial writeoff of deferred financing costs related to an amendment of the companys primary unsecured revolving line of credit in february  for the six months ended june   ebitda was also adjusted to exclude a gain recognized in connection with the sale of the valencia place office tower at country club plaza for the three and six month periods ended june   ffo and ebitda were adjusted to exclude the lump sum payment received in may  for the termination of the companys third party leasing agreement at the shops at crystals crystals due to a change in ownership of the center   these nongaap measures as presented by the company are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other reits due to the fact that not all reits use the same definitions these measures should not be considered alternatives to net income or as an indicator of the companys operating performance additionally these measures do not represent cash flows from operating investing or financing activities as defined by gaap   the company provides its beneficial interest in certain financial information of its unconsolidated joint ventures this beneficial information is derived as the company’s ownership interest in the investee multiplied by the specific financial statement item being presented investors are cautioned that deriving the company’s beneficial interest in this manner may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of holding
