believe that many ccorporations that own real estate will be more likely to consider monetizing real estate in order to lock in lease rates most net lease reits utilize saleleaseback and buildtosuit strategies to acquire new investments and we suspect that the rising rates will serve as a catalyst for reits to source deals before rates climb higher since the irs has made it harder for ccorps to spin their real estate into a reit structure we believe that net lease reits will also have an added advantage in an article last december i explained that a congressional tax bill proposed a ban on certain taxfree reit spinoffs that put the brakes on reit spinoffs this bill now forces companies that want to spin off their real estate into a reit to be taxed  the distribution of either the real estate or operating assets would no longer be taxfree think of it like this what if there were no new banks being formed the banks that are already in existence would have a tremendous advantage due to limited competition this makes it much more difficult for new net lease reits to form or at least go public by spinning their assets however one net lease reit went public just in time… whats on the menu four corners property trust just over a year ago four corners property trust completed its spinoff from darden restaurants inc nyse dri into an independent public company trading on the nyse the company began trading as a ccorp became a reit effective january   the portfolio was originally formed through a selection of  highquality darden restaurant properties with stable cash flows and strong rent coverage under the terms of the spinoff darden distributed all of the outstanding four corners shares pro rata to darden shareholders of record as of the close of business nov  darden shareholders retained their darden shares and received  share of four corners for every  darden shares held with cash paid in lieu of fractional four corners shares as you can see below the fcpt portfolio now includes  properties in  states the portfolio has grown from just a few brands into  brands when fcpt went public the portfolio was comprised of only brands related to darden  initial darden restaurant brands olive garden longhorn steakhouse bahama breeze seasons  wildfish seafood grille however over the last year fcpt has invested in a number of other properties not affiliated with darden  additional brands acquired to date kfc burger king arbys pizza hut buffalo wild wings wendys steak n shake dairy queen dennys fazolis zaxbys yeartodate fcpt has acquired  restaurants purchased for  million with a year average lease term and going in cap rates between  and  fcpts portfolio tenants are principally investment grade  with positive operating trends fulsome public disclosure and strong rent coverage ebitdarrent of x heres a snapshot of fcpts portfolio diversification a focus on quality income fcpts portfolio is comprised of highquality restaurant properties that demonstrate strong operating performance also fcpt has limited lease rollover risk as evidenced by the snapshot below there are no lease maturities until  and the weighted average lease term for the portfolio is just under  years the balance sheet fcpts existing portfolio performed as planned during the third quarter and notably dri was upgraded by all three rating agencies and is now rated bbb flat bbb flat and ba fcpt is comprised of highquality restaurant properties that demonstrate strong operating performance the reits coverage ratios remain strong with cash interest coverage of x and net debt to cash ebitda of x fcpts current low leverage will increase as the company begins to draw on its year  million revolver to initially finance acquisitions like most net lease reits fcpt is able to harvest organic cash flow growth from its portfolio of triple net leases these individual leases allow for maximum flexibility in resetting rent levels and laddering expiration dates the dri leases with fcpt have builtin  rent escalators and fair market value adjustments that provide organic growth most importantly fcpts portfolio tenants is currently  investmentgrade rated while theres an argument that one should not have all of their eggs in one basket the one big egg in the fcpt basket is as solid as a rock the latest results in q fcpts funds from operations or ffo was  million or  per diluted common share and adjusted funds from operations or affo was  million or  per diluted common share the companys regular dividend is  per common share for the third quarter of  source sp global market intelligence fcpt is seeking to grow and diversify with an initial focus on the quick service subsector in order to move the portfolio closer to reflecting the national restaurant landscape fcpt plans to become a preferred partner and capital source for leading restaurant operators and franchisees capitalizing on the current industry trends pushing operator consolidation and an asset light business model fcpt looks to increase diversification by targeting different brands meal pricepoints cuisine types and geographies within the vast universe of properties fcpt seeks to address the following restaurant subsection the franchisee industry is highly fragmented but undergoing consolidation and growth by top players presenting new partnership opportunities for fcpt fcpt pursues properties within the median range of casual dining fast casual and quick service concepts with midlevel sales volumes provide rent support while keeping rent at replaceable levels in case of vacancy is four corners property trust in your strike zone source sp global market intelligence this means that there is small cap volatility but theres also the potential for significant growth within the highly fragmented marketplace in the fcpt investor presentation ted williams described in his book the science of hitting that the most important thing for a hitter is to wait for the right pitch…and thats exactly the philosophy i have about investingwait for the right pitch…and it will come…its the key to investing  warren buffett we like the fact that fcpt was able to enter the reit sector and provide investors with another outlet to collect predictable dividends now its time for the management team to manage risk and provide investors with steady dividend income and modest share price appreciation heres how the company has performed since going public over a year ago source sp global market intelligence as i ponder fcpt as a prospective investment in the durable income portfolio i ponder the risks as i see it high tenant concentration and lack of experience as a reit are the biggest concerns while i consider darden attractive from a revenue perspective i am still somewhat skittish on the prospects of having most of my eggs in one basket what if i owned just one reit theres a reason i own over  reits and theres also a reason that realty income is one of the reits that i own see my recent article here lets see how fcpts pffo multiple compares with the peer group source sp global market intelligence as previously referenced fcpts dividend yield is  and while some investors may find that appealing i believe there are better opportunities in the net lease reit arena for example ver is trading at a  pffo multiple while the company does have high concentration with red lobster there are other investment grade tenants in the portfolio vers dividend yield is  also we believe that there are better opportunities for income in the preferred space we discuss the public storage nysepsa preferred in our upcoming newsletter in summary we dont have fcpt in our strike zone we believe that there are too many risks to justify the rewards we would be a buyer if the yield was closer to  but even then we would like to see more of a track record authors note im a wall street writer and that means that i am not always right
