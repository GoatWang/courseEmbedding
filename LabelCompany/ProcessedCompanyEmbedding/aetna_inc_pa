continue my zip code is select your county select your county please enter a valid zip code continue please enter all of your information transcript corporations can be and should be a responsible part of society and we need to lead because of the number of individuals we have a tremendous impact on every day so our mission at aetna is to build a healthier world our commitment starts with our own employees and when we look at our own employee population it looks much like employee populations do throughout the united states and what weve failed to realize is that in the current environment our scarcest resource are our people business leaders are educated to husband scarce resources and for a long time weve been convinced through our business schools that the scarce resource is capital but with  trillion domestically and  trillion abroad theres a lot of money to be had the real scarce resource is talent – an engaged work force and so if we really are right about husbanding our scarce resources we should be husbanding our human capital my challenge to the team was how can we as the purveyors of capitalism redefine the model that no longer works in our society what should we do and what can we prove to us and other businesses that theres a different way of leading and theres a different way of managing our businesses  so what weve done is weve raised our employee base wage to sixteen dollars an hour with an average effect of eleven percent but some folks getting  percent higher wages  secondly we said to folks tell you what we’re going to make you a deal if you take care of yourselves we’ll take care of you because when we looked at wage increases we saw the elimination of benefits as a result of people having higher income and so our goal was how do we raise people’s personal disposable income high enough so that they can enjoy the recovery in our economy  if theres ever a case to be made for total shareholder return on the part of business is when you invest in your human capital you build sound business fundamentals and in building those sound business fundaments you build a consistently repeatable and valued product that your customers buy over time our business fundamentals were funded by our employees – our front line employees they were the people who delivered our product  our mission around building a healthier world is built on a premise that redefines what health is health creates productive individuals productive individuals are culturally socially spiritually and economically viable and as a result theyre happy and if we can do that employee by employee company by company community by community and nation by nation wouldn’t we have a much more civil world to live in  this javascript enables onlineopinion a method for
