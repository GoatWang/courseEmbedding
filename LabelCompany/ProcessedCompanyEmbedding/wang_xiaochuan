readed recently sogou ceo wang xiaochuan publicly said in an interview although not yet arranged related matters but sogou plans to market in the united states this year in the industry have joked sogou owe wang xiaochuan girlfriend finally on wang xiaochuan swore sogou not listed do not find a girlfriend at the same time there are still ten of the questions and the future development of sogou ipo  ipo missed the best node lost opportunity is still listed in recent years sogou in revenue and market share performance is not rosy in fact no matter what its sogou i have missed the best node ipo as early as the end of  after sogou  million investment and tencent merged with tencent soso sogou resources began to enter the stage of steady growth in revenue and market share and in  q quarter revenue exceeded  million us dollars than the shares of microblog and the cheetah revenue are good although at the rumored upcoming ipo sogou sogou but did not have action by the end of  sogou performance has been lackluster  q advertising revenue also fell single quarter revenue of around us  million it can be said that the ipo had missed the sogou good time performance  ambition although large criticized the user experience how to improve it is worth mentioning that sogou input method user experience still needs attention and improvement once the sogou input method for personalized skin cloud thesaurus memory also has been widely acclaimed but with the ambition to become larger the input tool is to become a platform a series of functions and thus launched gradually began to affect the user experience a simple example is sogou input method in the search input box automatically pull the cue word form search candidate users click on any search candidate words will automatically jump to the sogou search results page this is an indirect sogou search diversion it is at the expense of the user experience as the premise imagine when you normally chat the spelling of a word click after this should enter the chat window but jump out a rather baffling search interface but also manually switch off the web page open the chat window to spelling words input thats what about user experience in addition a variety of functions in the stack may also cause system caton xunfei compared to other competing products sogou should consider how to complete the products user experience and business model of the balance  the standard of competing products no advantage sogou  billion valuation is too high sogou listed the subject is most similar to the baidu search engine field  and the biggest rival for the business model but sogou  billion valuation is too high according to the official data released by sogou from  q sogou revenue growth continued to decline to q in  its revenue of  million was almost unchanged from the same period in  this means that sogou revenue may be close to the ceiling while on the one hand sogou parent sohu is now valued at only  billion  million on the other hand in the last quarter of  before the delisting revenue sogou benchmarking of  million net profit reached  million based on longterm revenue and earnings growth  when the us stock market value is only  billion  million then the revenue is only  of the data and the growth of the plight of the sogou want to get  billion valuation is no doubt difficult  the mobile terminal market decline the plight of the three rocket model how to break in fact trying to struggling through the three rocket mode layout of the mobile terminal market in addition to sogou  game player the decline is also evident the reason is that regardless of the input method the browser or search engine it is essentially a tool products but in the end it is very easy to move by the system alternative tools for example after the launch of squares input method in iphone and soon spread therefore sogou in the mobile terminal is in urgent need of an innovative model to help them get rid of the plight of the mobile terminal  how to balance the complexity of tencent sohu equity relations tencent sohu and sogou potential relationship between the three of the resulting benefits of the game may also have an impact on the sogou ipo at the same time sohu will let go of the independent listing is still questionable according to the sohu reported a tencent holding  is the largest shareholder of sogou but half of them are non voting common stock sohu holds a  stake and the largest vote although the voting rights in the hands of sohu but the actual manager is only sogou  owned by wang xiaochuan and the team this means that the market can be listed in the nod with sohu the biggest profit will be listed tencent and the actual completion of the ipo it is entirely dependent on the operation of the wang xiaochuan team and the final outcome will be how all depends on the interests of the game  good cards while not making full use of resources and wechat know the consequences on the point of view sogou mediocre revenue and market share and did not make full use of wechat and know almost two resources also have a certain relationship after obtaining the investment shares of the tencent sogou essentially become the only one that can call the wechat public data platform indepth search engine but every day in the wechat search page recommended but mostly is the title of the party a health piece hot wen can be said to be a good hand smashed in access to wechat as the entrance and then in november  the investment of  million users know almost quiz platform sogou search once through online search plate model for wechat and know the import a large number of external traffic but did not get sufficient reverse reverse flow in which two ports such as keywords bidding the rankings of business model is also quietly at the same time sogou market share is not substantially improve so how to make full use of these resources but also on sogou must be considered a big problem  policy changes advertising revenue can find a new growth point whether it is artificial intelligence internationalization or other business development in addition to advertising revenue has not yet found a new growth point is the biggest problem plaguing the current search in mid  chinese government issued new regulations for the field of search engine search industry advertising revenue has been affected  annual revenue sogou q main reasons of  lower than a quarter of the in fact sogou still in terms of advertising revenue invested a great deal of energy wang xiaochuan announced plans to ipo in an interview said that at the end of  sogou win over more advertisers and increase efforts in the promotion of q in  sogou marketing investment or reached  million yuan an increase of more than  times the previous quarter this means that the year  q sogou advertising revenue may be counter attack on the other hand it is still not found today sogou search a new growth point of the reality of advertising even the three rocket mode is also dependent on the advertising revenue sogou to said is absolutely not a good news  the internet opened the curtain of the sea there are opportunities for the layout of the internationalization of it in the story of sogou overseas business is still a vacuum zone which is not only an important factor affecting the valuation of listed sogou but also affect the future development of a key business areas an accepted fact is that chinas internet industry has gradually bid farewell to the era of user dividends therefore in order to seek development the vast majority of domestic internet co choose the sea whether the layout of the market potential of strong market in southeast asia india or go to europe and america market share including bat drops headlines cheetah and other enterprises in the overseas market force in contrast sogou currently in the internationalization of the road is still a blank whether it is product service or investment mergers and acquisitions there are the sea so this is one of the factors that influence the future growth of sogou decision ceiling  the lack of a moat  years beyond baidu is empty talk wang xiaochuan said the plan in the year listed more than sogou also put forward the next step in three years in the mobile search business with baidu this is a realistic goal in fact according to statcounters latest data show that in december  the domestic search engine market to  of baidus share of the overwhelming dominance of the first throne the growth process of the search engine is the accumulation of vast amounts of information based on user behavior analysis of large data so as to optimize the algorithm that provide users with more accurate search results so as to occupy the dominant position in the market competition baidu search engine in the pc end steeped in more than a decade has become the domestic search engine market oligopoly whether it is ever will be or to a search  sogou with facts and data to prove that the baidu pc end position is difficult to shake the outbreak of the mobile internet today the mobile terminal is overtaking opportunities mobile search is now divided into active and passive search recommendation which with the popularity rising wave of entrepreneurship and big data technology to bring users accurate portrait of the two subjective and objective factors can realize passive recommendation import massive content distribution flow field has become the military a hotly contested spot and baidu in the last year has launched a  force content distribution sogou without motion therefore to achieve three years tied baidu sogou rely on overpromised is impossible so sogou force point where  lack of talent lack of technology lack of data artificial intelligence can become the future strategy in wang xiaochuans view sogou baidu tied the real force perhaps in artificial intelligence from this side but to baidu also occupy the advantage in the field of baidus counter attack it is not easy it must be pointed out that the artificial intelligence of the emerging industry of great imagination sogou also have the corresponding potential but still need a long time to catch the leader can complete the overtaking of sogou too soon a summary sogou does not have an attractive story currently sogou years ipo is probably true but there are still many problems in its development process such as artificial intelligence internationalization new growth point as part of the problem is even directly determines the height of the upper limit of the future more importantly sogou does not have an attractive enough to support the high valuation of the story the future where to go and whether the dream into reality
