from two judgments entered pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b in favor of plaintiffcounterdefendantappelleecrossappellant olin corporation “olin” in the united states district court for the southern district of new york griesa j awarding olin over  million in indemnification costs onebeacon appeals the district courts denials of its motions for summary judgment and the district courts ruling adopting particular special verdict interrogatories olin crossappeals from a grant of summary judgment in favor of onebeacon on olins bad faith claim brought pursuant massachusetts general laws chapter a mass gen laws ch a § a “chapter a”olin a large chemical manufacturing company brought this coverage action against its insurers including onebeacon seeking indemnification for environmental contamination at olin manufacturing sites throughout the united states this case requires us to resolve among other issues the proper method for allocating loss at each site when damage continues across a number of years and to decide whether onebeacon may reduce the limits of its liability by those of any other prior insurance policies within the same layer of coveragefor the reasons set forth below the judgments of the district court are affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded for further proceedings i backgroundthis appeal presents yet another round in a protracted insurancecoverage dispute between the olin corporation “olin” and its insurers including onebeacon american insurance company “onebeacon” for numerous environmental insurance claims olin first filed an insurancecoverage action in  in the district court for the district of columbia seeking indemnification for environmental damage at olin manufacturing sites throughout the united states and the action was transferred to the southern district of new york because of the volume of claims and locations involved the district court chose to address coverage on a sitebysite basis this appeal arises out of the most recent of these sitespecific proceedings concerning contamination at five olin manufacturing sites  mcintosh alabama “mcintosh”  fields brookashtabula ohio “fields brook”  augusta georgia “augusta”  rochester new york “rochester” and  bridgeport rental  oil services in bridgeport new jersey “bros”a the manufacturing sitesthe mcintosh site is an alabama property that was added to the national priority list “npl” pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act  usc §  et seq “cercla” in  the npl identifies polluted or potentially polluted sites for purposes of cercla enforcement by the united states environmental protection agency “epa” the epa divided the mcintosh site into two “operable units” relevant to this appeal operable unit  “ou” and operable unit  “ou” ou contains olin manufacturing plants producing chlorine caustic soda and crop chemicals ou encompasses a acre natural basin adjacent to the plant into which wastewater from the plant was regularly discharged olins thirdamended complaint the operative complaint here relates exclusively to ou at trial the parties stipulated that olin incurred  in cleanup and remediation costs for ou through december  the fields brooks site is located in ohio and houses a plant that once produced the chemical “tdi” property damage at fields brook began in  due to the discharge of contaminated wastewater into a brook running through the property which in turn contaminated the brooks sediments  the parties stipulated that olin incurred  in costs through december  the augusta site holds a georgia chloralkali plant that produced chlorine and caustic soda the operations at this site led to the continuous mercury contamination of the surrounding groundwater and the ecosystem around the plants intake canal the parties stipulated that olin incurred  in costs for the groundwater contamination and an additional  for cleanup of the intake canal through december  the rochester site housed a plant that produced specialty organic chemicals operations resulted in the continuous and repeated exposure of groundwater to chemical contaminants the parties stipulated that olin incurred  in relevant costs at this site through december  the bros site involves a new jersey property where olin stored spent sulfuric acid between  and  olin and onebeacon stipulated that olin incurred  in costs through december  beginning in  olin sent formal notices to onebeacon and its other insurers identifying government orders requiring investigation and cleanup at various olin sites including fields brook augusta and mcintosh in  olin sent onebeacon and other insurers a supplemental notice of claims concerning additional sites including the bros and rochester sites the notices detailed olins damages at each site and described olins remediation measures the notices also invited insurers including onebeacon to investigate olins claims olin regularly supplemented these notices with updated information about damages costs and remedial measures at each site between february  and january  olin sent onebeacon fifteen claims notices that related to at least in part one or more of the five sitesaccording to olin onebeacon never responded it was not until olin amended its complaint in  adding coverage claims against onebeacon for the five sites that onebeacon acknowledged receipt of olins claims notices in its answer to this complaint onebeacon asserted various defenses denying coverage discovery later requested by olin revealed that onebeacon had neglected to conduct any investigation into olins coverage claims discovery also exposed that onebeacon lacked factual support for numerous affirmative defenses and had delegated its claims handling responsibilities to one of its reinsurers last through discovery in a related case olin learned that onebeacon imposed “dollar targets” on its claims adjusters and would seek to litigate rather than pay claims because it was “cheaper” to do sob the onebeacon policiesonebeacon issued olin three excess umbrella insurance policies for the period of  through  because the onebeacon policies are “excess” policies each policy provides coverage only where the underlying insurance policies have been “exhausted” or have had their limits per occurrence paid out the onebeacon policies “attach” at various points above an underlying “primary” commercial general liability policy issued by the insurance company of north america “ina” which covered the first  of loss attributable to property damage at the manufacturing sites the first onebeacon policy attaches at  and has a per occurrence limit of  million the next onebeacon policy attaches at  million and has a  million per occurrence limit finally the third onebeacon policy attaches at  million and provides  million in coverage in short onebeacons policies provide up to  million in coverage in excess of  per occurrence effective january   onebeacons three excess policies included a pollution exclusion accordingly for the purposes of this appeal the policy period for olins coverage under the three onebeacon excess policies is january   through december  the onebeacon policies provide coverage for “all sums which the insured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability ․ imposed upon the insured by law ․ for damages direct or consequential and expenses ․ on account of ․ property damage ․ caused by or arising out of each occurrence ․” appx at  an “occurrence” is defined as “an accident or a happening or event or a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which unexpectedly and unintentionally results in ․ property damage ․ during the policy period” see eg appx at  each onebeacon policy also contains a condition on coverage known as a “prior insurance” provision or “noncumulation” clause and a “continuing coverage” clause both clauses are found in condition c of the policiescondition c specifically providesit is agreed that if any loss covered hereunder is also covered in whole or in part under any other excess policy issued to the insured prior to the inception date hereof the limit of liability hereon ․ shall be reduced by any amounts due to the insured on account of such loss under such prior insurancesubject to the foregoing paragraph and to all other terms and conditions of this policy in the event that personal injury or property damage arising out of an occurrence covered hereunder is continuing at the time of termination of this policy onebeacon will continue to protect the insured for liability in respect of such personal injury or property damage without payment of additional premiumappx at  the first paragraph constitutes the prior insurance provision and the second is the continuing coverage clausefinally the “loss payable” provision condition j governs when the onebeacon policies are triggered “liability under this policy with respect to any occurrence shall not attach unless and until the insured or the insureds underlying insurer shall have paid the amount of the underlying limits on account of such occurrence” appx at  in other words under condition j the onebeacon excess policies will not attach until the  primary ina layer is exhaustedc the prior excess policieseach of the onebeacon policies at issue is preceded in time by prior insurance in the same layer of coverage the “prior excess policies” the prior excess policies include policies issued by certain underwriters at lloyds london the “london market insurers” the first two layers of the onebeacon policies for example are preceded in the same layer by excess policies issued by the london market insurers dating from the s through  the prior excess policies provide substantially the same coverage as that provided by the onebeacon policies for the sites at issue like the onebeacon policies the prior excess policies generally provide coverage for all sums olin becomes legally obligated to pay for property damage during the policy period caused by an occurrenced our courts prior olin decisionsthere have been a number of related appeals concerning olins environmental insurance claims stemming from other contaminated sites which implicated other insurers and policies several of those decisions set the stage for this appeal first in olin corp v insurance co of north america “olin i”  fd  d cir  we addressed olins claim for coverage from its primary insurer ina for soil and groundwater contamination that occurred over a year period at a pesticide manufacturing plant in north carolina there we determined that the appropriate method for “allocating” responsibility for “ongoing and progressive injury that spans many years” is to do so “pro rata” id at – under this pro rata method the total property damage is divided into equal annual shares for each year in which such damage took place this annual share is then treated as the total property damage attributable to that occurrence for that year and the insurer providing coverage for that year is responsible for indemnifying an insured only to the extent of its contractual liability for such deemed property damagein olin corp v certain underwriters at lloyds london “olin ii”  fd  d cir  we decided a claim seeking coverage from an excess insurer for soil and groundwater contamination resulting from operations at a chemical manufacturing plant in upstate new york the principal issue on appeal was how to identify the policies triggered as a result of the continuing environmental harm in rejecting olins proposed model we concluded that “property damage occurs as long as contamination continues to increase or spread” and includes not only “contamination ․ based on active pollution” but also “the passive migration of contamination into the soil and groundwater” id at  we further clarified that under the pro rata approach in the absence of specific evidence to the contrary the default is to allocate loss equally across the years during which “continuous” property damage was sustained id at  we explained however that “if it could be determined exactly how much property damage occurred in each year then the indemnifiable remediation costs could be allocated” to the specific years in which the damage occurred rather than equally across all years in which the progressive environmental harm was continuing idlast in olin corp v american home assurance co “olin iii”  fd  d cir  we addressed the application of a similar prior insurance provision to that implicated here olin iii concerned olins coverageclaim against american home assurance company “american home” for its morgan hill california manufacturing site which had become contaminated as a result of olins discharge of chemicals into soil and groundwater over a period of  years  fd at  at issue were two consecutive american home excess policies covering periods from  through  and  through  attaching at  million both policies included a provision identical in all material ways to the version of condition c included in the onebeacon policies implicated here id at we concluded that while our prior decisions require the pro rata allocation of damages in cases involving longtail claims the continuing coverage clause of condition c must still be given effect id at  accordingly we held that pursuant to the continuing coverage clause american home would still be liable for damage continuing after the termination of its policy id at  at the same time however we also held that the prior insurance provision reduceed the per occurrence limit on american homes laterissued policy by the amount paid out under american homes prior policy at the same level of excess coverage to the extent that both policies were triggered by the same loss id at  we explained that this approach was consistent with “condition cs apparent purpose of sweeping a continuing loss into the earliest triggered policy with that policy then fully indemnifying the insured for that loss” id however bound by our earlier decision in olin i we also held that the pro rata approach rather than the all sums or joint and several liability approach continued to govern the allocation of loss across a damage period id at  condition c obligated an insurer “to indemnify olin up to the limits of its policies for all property damage caused by the environmental contamination that occurred during and after the termination of each policy” id at – emphasis added but “condition c alone could not trigger joint and several liability in lieu of the pro rata allocation methodology employed in olin i ․” id at applying these principles we held that the language of the prior insurance provision reduced the  million limit of the american home policy covering the period from  through  by the  million limit of the prior american home policy at the same level of coverage spanning the period from  through  such that the total per occurrence coverage offered by american home remained at  million id at  because both of the policies at issue in olin iii were issued by the same insurer—american home—we did not have to resolve the question we are called upon to resolve in this appeal how a prior insurance provision applies when the prior policy was underwritten by a different insurer see id at  ne the district court proceedingson april   onebeacon moved for partial summary judgment with respect to the prior insurance provision of condition c contained in the onebeacon policies because each of the onebeacon policies is preceded in the same layer of coverage by the prior excess policies onebeacon sought a ruling that the prior insurance provision requires that the occurrence limits of the onebeacon policies be reduced by the occurrence limits of any prior policy in the same layer of coverage triggered by the same occurrence irrespective of which insurer issued the earlier policy or policiesthe district court summarily denied onebeacons motion at oral argument ruling from the benchthe motion for summary judgment by onebeacon is denied ․ the language that is critical is as follows “it is agreed that if any loss covered hereunder is also covered in whole or in part under any other excess policy issued to the insured prior to the inception date hereof” i am holding that that applies to any other excess policy issued by the same insurer not to other excess policies issued by miscellaneous possible insurersspecial appx at  emphasis added the court reasoned thatthe paragraph in my view if it is not limited as i have said ․ would be hopelessly vague and subject to numerous possible factual issues in applying it also it would relieve the insurer of possibly  percent liability on a policy for which substantial premiums were paid to obtain something other than possibly no liabilityidthe district court also denied onebeacons motion for partial summary judgment on olins mcintosh claim onebeacon argued that—because of a february   stipulation of dismissal with prejudice—the mcintosh claim must be dismissed in  prior to an earlier trial against other insurers relating to olins request for indemnification in remediating the environmental damage at the mcintosh ou site the parties entered into a stipulation dismissing certain claims as against onebeacon the stipulation which was endorsed by the district court stated “plaintiff olin corporation by its undersigned counsel hereby stipulates to the voluntary dismissal with prejudice of any claims concerning onebeacon relating to the mcintosh alabama site” appx at  the district court denied onebeacons motion concluding that this stipulation related only to the ou portion of the mcintosh site the court noted thatthe stipulation of february  is worded broadly as onebeacon points out and it is not limited in its language to ou or to what was being literally tried and it would have been a good idea if this stipulation when presented and signed had been revised and it was a mistake not to revise it the language is too broad but for me to say that olin has given up substantial insurance coverage because of that mistake i simply wont do it we have all made mistakes in our professional lives and the best thing to do in a civilized litigation court process is to help people out of those mistakesspecial appx at in october of  the parties proceeded to trial on the mcintosh ou fields brook augusta and rochester sites the trial focused on two principal issues  whether as of  olin expected or intended the property damage ultimately sustained at the various manufacturing sites and  the allocation of damages across the years during which property damage occurred at each site before giving the case to the jury the district court rejected onebeacons proposed jury interrogatory regarding expected or intended injury which asked the jury to find a specific date by which olin expected or intended the damage instead the court asked the jury with respect to each site whether “by the time of the policy period of    olin expected or intended the property damage that it was obligated to remediate” see eg appx at  the jury ultimately returned a verdict in favor of olin finding that olin did not expect or intend the damage by the time of the policy period of  as to each of the four trial sites with respect to mcintosh ou and augusta the jury found that progressive environmental harm was continuing throughout the period identified by the parties in the verdict form and allocated damage equally across all years with respect to fields brook the jury determined that progressive environmental damage ended in  and assigned various amounts of the total damage to each year in that period finally with respect to rochester the district court concluded without dispute from onebeacon that property damage began in  and continued through  and also that the damage should be allocated to each year on a pro rata basisafter trial olin sought discovery on its chapter a claim but faced resistance from onebeacon onebeacon eventually moved for summary judgment which the district court granted ruling again from the bench the court concluded that “based upon its personal knowledge and participation in this litigation onebeacon never” engaged in any unfair and deceptive practices special appx at  the court entered an order to the same effectin the year following trial the parties calculated the total damages owed by onebeacon on january   onebeacon moved for partial summary judgment regarding prejudgment interest onebeacon asserted that because olin did not make a “definite claim” for coverage as required by its policies until after the jury verdict olin was not entitled to any prejudgment interest the district court rejected onebeacons argument because it found that olin had sent numerous notice letters to onebeacon identifying its claims beginning in the s and that onebeacon failed to investigate such claims instead choosing litigation as a result the district court concluded that onebeacon was required to compensate olin with prejudgment interest running separately with respect to each indemnifiable expense from each of the several dates on which olin incurred remediation costsfinally in the spring of  the district court entered two rule b judgments in favor of olin one for the bros site and another for the remaining four sites each judgment determined the total damages owed by onebeacon based on the parties stipulations concerning the total loss incurred at each site the jurys findings and parties stipulations concerning how that loss was to be allocated across years of property damage and the continuingcoverage approach employed by this court in olin iii in particular the district court following olin iii concluded that olin could seek indemnification under onebeacons  policy not only for property damage allocated to that year but also—because of the continuing coverage clause—for property damage arising from the same occurrence allocated to subsequent years applying this approach the rule b judgments including prejudgment interest totaling  for the four trial sites and  for the bros site resulted in a total judgment entered in olins favor of onebeacon subsequently filed postjudgment motions pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure   and  with respect to both rule b judgments raising the same issues raised on appeal the district court denied the motions onebeacon appeals from both final judgments and olin crossappeals the district courts grant of summary judgment in favor of onebeacon on olins chapter a claimii discussiona viking pumpbetween when judgment was first entered in this case and oral argument the new york court of appeals issued its decision in in re viking pump inc  ned  ny  because this decision is dispositive with respect to certain issues presented on this appeal and highly instructive with respect to others we briefly summarize it herein viking pump the court of appeals began by reiterating its general approach to the interpretation of the provisions of an insurance contract as the court of appeals explained “we emphasized in consolidated edison   ned   ny  the first court of appeals decision to interpret a contract as requiring pro rata allocation and have reiterated thereafter that in determining a dispute over insurance coverage courts first look to the language of the policy” viking pump  ned at  alterations and internal quotation marks omitted thus in previking pump decisions upholding the propriety of pro rata allocation of losses spanning policy years “we did not adopt a strict rule mandating either pro rata or all sums allocation because insurance contracts like other agreements should be enforced as written and parties to an insurance arrangement may generally contract as they wish and the courts will enforce their agreements without passing on the substance of them” id internal quotation marks omitted in sum when confronted in the context of a given insurance contract with the question whether losses associated with “longtail” claims are properly distributed pro rata across all policy years during which the harm was continuing or whether an “all sums” approach is more appropriate courts are to use ordinary tools of contractual interpretation to resolve the issue see idthe court of appeals then went on to explain why in its view the insurance contracts before it—each of which included at least the prior insurance provision  —required application of the all sums approach as well as its view of what the all sums approach required first the court of appeals explained that since the prior insurance provision “plainly contemplates that multiple successive insurance policies can indemnify the insured for the same loss or occurrence” id at  indemnification obligations under insurance contracts containing such a provision should be determined under the all sums or “joint and several” approach which “permits the insured to collect its total liability under any policy in effect and indemnifies the insured for the loss during the periods that the damage occurred up to the policy limits” id at  alterations and internal quotation marks omitted as further support for its conclusion the court of appeals contrasted all sums allocation with pro rata allocation see id at – noting that the “very essence of pro rata allocation is that the insurance policy language limits indemnification to losses and occurrences during the policy period––meaning that no two insurance policies unless containing overlapping or concurrent policy periods would indemnify the same loss or occurrence” id at  the court of appeals explained that under pro rata allocation noncumulation and prior insurance provisions would be rendered surplusage––“a construction that cannot be countenanced under new york principles of contract interpretation” id at the court of appeals then turned to the related question of “whether horizontal or vertical exhaustion applies under the relevant policies” id at  under the horizontal exhaustion approach an insured is required to “exhaust all triggered primary and umbrella excess layers before tapping into any of the additional excess insurance policies” while under vertical exhaustion “the insured  can access each excess policy once the immediately underlying policies limits are depleted even if other lowerlevel policies during different policy periods remain unexhausted” id in resolving this question the court of appeals explained that the language of policies containing condition c militated in favor of vertical exhaustion because “vertical exhaustion is more consistent ․ with the language tying attachment of the excess policies specifically to identified policies that span the same policy period” and because “vertical exhaustion is conceptually consistent with an all sums allocation permitting the insured to seek coverage through the layers of insurance available for a specific year” id thus the court of appeals held that an insured could pursue insurers whose policies contained a prior insurance provision for indemnification irrespective of whether policies covering other years over the course of the loss period potentially were triggered by the same occurrencefinally it is worth noting the ways in which the approach adopted by the court of appeals requires some modification of the approach we bound by our earlier interpretations of new york law took in olin iii which guided the district courts judgment here in olin iii we held that under the contracts at issue property damage assigned to a period after the applicable policy year would be swept back into the “earliest triggered policy”  fd at  but under viking pump the insured can pursue any insurer whose policy contains condition c and whose policy covers property damage during the relevant period for all damage reaching the insurers policy layer regardless of “when” it took place in other words viking pump departs from the “legal fiction” that property damage can be cleanly allocated between policy years and instead adopts a joint and several liability theory that allows the insured to seek indemnification for the full amount of damage incurred over the continuing damage period from any insurer whose policy language dictates all sums liability with language similar to condition c  ned at b exhaustion of olins primary policiesat the outset we must determine whether olins primary policies have been exhausted so as to trigger onebeacons excess policies onebeacon encourages us to adopt a “hybrid” allocationexhaustion scheme contending that because the underlying ina policies do not contain condition c we must use pro rata allocation to determine whether the underlying primary policies have been exhausted and thus whether onebeacons policies have attached only then it argues once onebeacons policies have attached does all sums allocation apply to onebeacons excess policies in other words onebeacon submits that we should apply horizontal exhaustion to the ina primary layers and vertical exhaustion to its policies under this “hybrid” approach onebeacon asserts that the underlying ina primary policies have not been exhausted and therefore onebeacons  attachment point has not been met because onebeacons policies call for all sums allocation and the new york court of appeals decision in viking pump dictates vertical exhaustion where the all sums approach is the proper method for allocation we conclude that olins underlying policies have been exhausted and onebeacons policies have attachedas explained above viking pump identifies the proper method for determining exhaustion in cases such as this one where the excess policy at issue contains a provision like condition c the court of appeals specifically held that for policies incorporating a prior insurance provision and by extension all sums allocation vertical exhaustion is the appropriate method for determining the attachment of excess policies id at – viking pump explains that “vertical exhaustion is conceptually consistent with an all sums allocation permitting the insured to seek coverage through the layers of insurance available for a specific year” id at  the concept of vertical exhaustion “allows the insureds to access each excess policy once the immediately underlying policies limits are depleted even if other lowerlevel policies during different policy periods remain unexhausted” id horizontal exhaustion by contrast requires that lowerlevel policies throughout the continuing damage period be exhausted before excess policies are triggeredthe court of appeals reasoned that “vertical exhaustion is more consistent than horizontal exhaustion” with the particular policy language where the “attachment of the excess policies” is tied “specifically to identified primary policies that span the same policy period” id this is precisely how onebeacons policies operate here as the loss payable provision merely requires that the underlying primary polices the ina policies must be exhausted before onebeacons policies attach to somehow import horizontal exhaustion into onebeacons policies by virtue of the underlying ina policies would contradict viking pumps rule that vertical exhaustion controls when policies contain a prior insurance provisionby demanding vertical exhaustion for policies contemplating all sums allocation viking pump explicitly determined that an insured in olins position does not need to exhaust primary policies outside the policy year to reach the excess layer for its chosen policy year thus viking pump dictates that we reject onebeacons position that the pro rata approach applies to determine whether the underlying ina primary policies have been exhausted rather an insured may simply tap a particular tower of its insurance program triggered by an occurrence and proceed up the tower upon depletion of the policies within each layer of coverage just as olin seeks to do here we therefore conclude that because it is not disputed that the damages at each site far exceed onebeacons attachment point of  when apportioned to a single policy year onebeacons policies have been triggeredc the mcintosh stipulationwe now turn to the effect of the mcintosh stipulation if any on onebeacons liability for olins claims for indemnification arising from cleanup costs at the ou mcintosh site onebeacon argues that the district court erred in denying its summary judgment motion related to the mcintosh ou site because the february   stipulation unambiguously dismissed all claims related to the “mcintosh alabama site” which included both operable units although the stipulation refers broadly to the “mcintosh alabama site” because—considered within the context of the  trial—such a term could reasonably be interpreted as referring only to ou we affirm the district courts denial of summary judgmenthere while the agreement specifically provided that olin “stipulates to the voluntary dismissal with prejudice of any claims concerning onebeacon relating to the mcintosh alabama site” appx at  emphasis added circumstances clearly indicate that the stipulation was not designed to cover both ou and ou indeed the parties entered into the stipulation at the start of the  trial which concerned liability related only to ou by  the epa had determined an environmental remedy for only ou because its total costs for ou were known olin proceeded to trial on that unit first in fact cleanup at ou was still ongoing in  and since the full remedy for that site was not yet ascertainable olin held off in pursuing its indemnification claims for loss arising from that unit of the mcintosh site in olins  pretrial correspondence with the london market insurers moreover olin clarified that it sought to recover costs associated specifically with remediation for ou olins pretrial disclosures also repeatedly defined the term “mcintosh” as the “mcintosh alabama site which is the subject of the february   trial” appx at   additionally olin agreed to the stipulation with onebeacon only because it expected full indemnification from the london market insurers through its recovery at trial see id at   olins counsel notifying excess insurers including onebeacon that its “excess insurance carriers other than lmi ․ are not likely to be implicated in the upcoming mcintosh trial”the district courts conclusion that olin could not have intended to release onebeacon from liability for ou at the time of the  trial for ou was thus proper the district courts denial of summary judgment with respect to the mcintosh site on this ground is therefore affirmedd special verdict formonebeacon also argues that a new trial is warranted because the district court “committed legal error by adopting a special verdict form premised on an incorrect interpretation of the onebeacon policies” appellants br at  we review for abuse of discretion a district courts formulation of special verdict questions see vichare v ambac inc  fd   d cir  a jury interrogatory is erroneous when it “misleads or confuses the jury or if it inaccurately frames the issues to be resolved by the jury” idthe district court posed the following interrogatory to the jury “by the time of the policy period of  did olin expect or intend the property damage that it was obligated to remediate if your answer ․ is no proceed to the further questions if your answer ․ is yes proceed no further ․” see eg appx at  the jury answered in the negative as to each site onebeacon contends that this “interrogatory was clearly erroneous because the jury was not permitted to return a verdict finding that property damage after  was expected or intended by olin” appellants br at  emphasis added so the argument goes because of the faulty jury instruction onebeacon may have been required to indemnify against expected or intended property damage contrary to policy language dictating that onebeacon is responsible to indemnify olin only for unexpected or unintended property damage onebeacon claims that the district court should have instead asked the jury whether “olin expected or intended property damage that it was obligated to remediate ” and if “yes” “by what date” appellants br at onebeacons policies require indemnification where there has been “an accident or a happening or event or a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which unexpectedly and unintentionally result in ․ property damage ․ during the policy period” appx at  emphasis added the policies at issue upon consideration of the pollution exclusion effective january   cover the period from january   through december   we understand the district courts interrogatory as asking whether olin expected or intended any property damage within the policy period beginning in  this conforms to the language of onebeacons policy defining an occurrence as an unexpected or unintended event happening during the period in which the policies provide coverage under the language of the policy whether olin later expected or intended the property damage that was ongoing is irrelevant indeed the continuing coverage clause––which states that onebeacon must continue to provide coverage “in the event that ․ property damage arising out of an occurrence covered hereunder is continuing at the time of the termination” of the policy––contains no language suggesting that such continuing property damage must remain “unexpected” or “unintentional” id at  because the courts interrogatory asking the jury whether olin expected or intended property damage by  correctly framed the issue of liability under the terms of the onebeacon policies there was no error in the district courts instruction the district courts ruling as to the special verdict form is affirmede damagesin sum under viking pump olin may “collect its total liability under any policy in effect during the periods that the damage occurred up to the policy limits”  ned at  alteration and internal quotation marks omitted because the jury determined that property damage continued during the years in which olin was covered by onebeacons policies and that olin did not expect or intend this damage at least during the onebeacon policy year at issue olin may pursue onebeacon for full indemnification for its costs at these sites up to the policy limits for the  year thus onebeacons total liability to olin before calculating prejudgment or postjudgment interest after viking pump can be computed as olins total remediation costs less  at each of the manufacturing sites at issue with olins total recovery capped only by the relevant policy limits because the district court relying on our opinion in olin iii capped olins recovery at the loss attributable under the pro rata method to the  policy year and to years subsequent we vacate and remand for entry of a new damages judgment on the basis of the methodology dictated by viking pumpf prior insurance provisiononebeacon next asserts that the judgments of the district court should be vacated because the court failed to give effect to the prior insurance provision of onebeacons policies thereby reducing the limits of its policies by those of any prior policies covering the same loss we agree where an occurrence spans multiple policy years the plain language of the prior insurance provision requires the reduction of the occurrence limit of a onebeacon policy by amounts due under any prior excess insurance policy on account of a loss covered by a prior insurance policy in the same layer of coverage as the relevant onebeacon policy when that prior insurance policy is triggered by the same occurrence for which the insured presently seeks indemnification see olin iii  fd at  concluding that prior insurance provision of excess insurance policies reduced insurers liability to the extent that a prior insurance policy at the same level of coverage indemnified for a loss that was also covered by insurers excess policies this prevents an insured from stacking or cumulating coverage—that is where an insured that has suffered a longterm or continuous loss triggering coverage across more than one policy period attempts to add together the maximum limits of all successive policies that have been in place during the period of the loss see viking pump  ned at  steven plitt et al couch on insurance §  d ed west our decision in olin iii though not dispositive is instructive as we did not directly address the question before us here whether a prior insurance provision applies to any other excess policy issued within the same layer and not just a prior policy issued by the same insurer see olin iii  fd at  n moreover as we explain resolution of this inquiry is intertwined with the question of the proper mode of allocation of damages for a multiyear losswe turn first to principles of contract interpretation to inform our analysis under new york law insurance policies are interpreted according to general rules of contract interpretation see eg world trade ctr props llc v hartford fire ins co  fd  – d cir  abrogated on other grounds by wachovia bank v schmidt  us   two such rules are particularly relevant here first the “words and phrases in a contract should be given their plain meaning and the contract should be construed so as to give full meaning and effect to all of its provisions” lasalle bank natl assn v nomura asset capital corp  fd   d cir  alteration and internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted any interpretation of a contract that “has the effect of rendering at least one clause superfluous or meaningless ․ is not preferred and will be avoided if possible” id alteration and internal quotation marks omittedsecond contract terms are ambiguous if they are “capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs practices usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business” nowak v ironworkers local  pension fund  fd   d cir  when a provision in an insurance contract is ambiguous a court may consider extrinsic evidence to ascertain the parties intent at the formation of the contract ja apparel corp v abboud  fd   d cir  if the extrinsic evidence fails to establish the parties intent courts may apply other rules of contract interpretation including new yorks insurancespecific version of the rule of contra proferentem according to which ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the insured see haber v st paul guardian ins co  fd  – d cir  ambiguity is absent where the contracts language provides “a definite and precise meaning unattended by danger of misconception in the purport of the contract itself and concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion” hunt ltd v lifschultz fast freight inc  fd   d cir  alteration omitted with these principles in mind we hold that the prior insurance provision of condition c is unambiguous and that the district court erred when it concluded that the prior insurance provision did not apply to reduce the limits of onebeacons liabilityto begin with we conclude that the language of the prior insurance provision on its face applies to “any other excess policy” and is not limited to prior policies issued by the same insurer indeed there is no language in condition c that might imply that the prior insurance provision is limited in application to any other excess policy issued only by the same provider rather the general language of the prior insurance provision suggests that the clause is designed to apply whenever both earlier and later polices cover the same loss just as the focus of noncumulation clauses is whether more than one policy provides coverage for identical loss within the same layer unaffected by the identity of the insurerthis construction is consistent moreover with the design of noncumulation clauses as noted above noncumulation clauses were developed to prevent “stacking” by an insured “such clauses originated during the shift from ‘accidentbased’ to ‘occurrencebased’ liability policies in the s and s and were purportedly designed to prevent any attempt by policyholders to recover under a subsequent policy—based on the broader definition of occurrence—for a loss that had already been covered by the prior ‘accidentbased’ policy” viking pump  ned at  and the new york court of appeals has “enforced noncumulation clauses in accordance with their plain language despite the limiting impact that such clauses may have on an insureds recovery and by extension that of an injured plaintiff” id citing nesmith v allstate ins co  ned  ny  hiraldo v allstate ins co  ned  ny  therefore based on the policy language at issue and the recent decision from the court of appeals in viking pump it is irrelevant whether olins prior excess policies were issued by an insurer other than onebeaconour conclusion finds further support in our analysis of a similar prior insurance provision at issue in olin iii in which we “concludeed that the prior insurance provision reduces american homes liability only to the extent that a prior insurance policy at the same level of coverage ․ indemnifies for a loss that is also covered by an american home policy”  fd at  emphasis added we also determined that because we must interpret condition c in a way that gives effect to both the continuing coverage clause and prior insurance provision “to the extent the continuing coverage clause expands an insurers liability it does so subject to the limitations of the prior insurance provision” id at  nwhile the insurer in olin iii american home issued both the policy under which olin sought indemnification and the prior policy within the same layer of coverage after viking pump it is clear that the critical factor is whether the loss covered by a policy dictating all sums is also covered by another policy in the same coverage layer which itself has already provided indemnification to the insured for the loss although viking pump did not directly decide the issue we are required to resolve here its analysis of the interplay between prior insurance provisions and allocation leads directly to our holding under an “all sums” or a “joint and several” method for allocation an insured is permitted “to collect its total liability under any policy in effect during the periods that the damage occurred up to the policy limits” viking pump  ned at  alteration and internal quotation marks omitted it is then the insurers burden to “seek contribution from the insurers that issued the other triggered policies” id at  in contrast under the pro rata scheme for allocation “an insurers liability is limited to sums incurred by the insured during the policy period in other words each insurance policy is allocated a ‘pro rata’ share of the total loss representing the portion of the loss that occurred during the policy period” idas olin argues application of the all sums method means that it may attribute the full amount of its loss to a single policy year and demand coverage from a single insurer up to the insurers policy limits onebeacon in this case yet this same principle also limits olins ability to tap multiple insurers for the same loss just as the all sums allocation method allows olin to seek recovery from any insurer of its choosing up to the limits of the relevant policy it also by the same token requires reducing the limits of liability of any prior insurance policy providing coverage for the same loss see stonewall ins co v ei du pont de nemours  co  ad   del  examining substantially similar language in light of the all sums approach and concluding that “interpreting the noncumulation clause to limit how much an insured may seek from the selected tower of insurance by subtracting any amounts received by or payable to the insured from prior excess insurers   is the only proper interpretation” to conclude otherwise would be to strip the prior insurance provision of its bargainedfor effect as evinced by its plain language and permit olin to recover multiple times for a single loss by pursuing multiple insurers within the same layer of coverage see id concluding that reading noncumulation clause “as ambiguous and in isolation would dishonor the spirit of the clause and improperly allow the insured to obtain a double recovery by negating settlements already received from prior insurers” it would also be inconsistent with the “joint and several” principle animating the all sums approach viking pump  ned at  finally however we reject outofhand onebeacons argument that since olin could recover from prior insurers whose policies provide coverage for loss at these sites and who sit in the same layer of coverage as onebeacon olin may not recover under the onebeacon policies this argument turns on a misreading of condition c as explained earlier condition c permits an insured to pursue indemnification from any insurer whose policy was triggered under the framework described above as a result of continuing property damage the prior insurance provision works in conjunction with the overarching approach dictated by condition c to prevent the insured from stacking policies once it has already obtained indemnification for that specific loss from another policy in the relevant coverage layer see id at  explaining that the all sums approach permits an insured to recover from “any policy in effect during the periods that damage occurred” internal quotation marks omitteddetermining the meaning of the prior insurance provision does not resolve our inquiry we must now determine the effect of olins settlements with its prior insurers—the london market insurers—on onebeacons obligations this presents a difficult question since olin recovered from the london market insurers in settlement of its claims for indemnification and the record is devoid of any information about these settlementsonebeacon contends that the district court should be instructed that “amounts due include amounts due under policies issued by insurers that settled prior to the conclusion of this appeal” appellants br at  internal quotation marks omitted in response olin claims that its settlements with the london market insurers do not constitute “amounts due” under those policies because “not one of those other insurers was ever adjudged liable to olin or admitted liability ․ and even if settlement dollars could be considered amounts due ․ there is nothing in the record showing what amounts if any were due ․” appellees br at   internal quotation marks omittedwhile we agree with onebeacon that its limits of liability should be reduced by amounts paid to settle claims with respect to the five manufacturing sites at issue here there is no basis in the record from which we might calculate that amount indeed if as olin suggests olin entered into a global settlement with the london market insurers releasing claims under those policies as to all sites potentially at issue—and not just those that were the subject of adjudication at trial in this matter—there is no easy way to determine the amount of this settlement that is properly associated with claims arising from the five manufacturing sites that are the focus of this appeal in fact we have previously recognized the difficulties that arise when trying to set off an insureds recovery against prior settlements see eg er squibb  sons inc v lloyds  cos  fd   n d cir  per curiam suggesting that the amounts paid in prior settlements had not exceeded aggregate policy limits see also id at  n jacobs j dissenting questioning whether the district courts order required “the excess insurers to pay indemnity in respect of claims that have already been indemnified in full”in light of this deficiency in the record we conclude that remand is appropriate in order for the district court to be able to enhance the record and issue a decision in the first instance as to the effect of olins prior global settlement with the london market insurers however a few words as to guiding principles are appropriateas just explained condition c permits an insured to pursue full recovery from any insurer in its program whose policy covers the relevant loss and contains condition c irrespective of whether the insurers policy was issued at the beginning in the middle or towards the end of the continuing occurrence to use the terminology we adopted in olin iii condition c permits an insured to “sweep ” loss—under viking pump from both before and after the policy year—into a triggered policy and to seek full indemnification from that policy for its covered loss olin iii  fd at  viking pump  ned at – in other words like the joint and several liability that serves as a model for the all sums approach once the insured has demonstrated the scope of its insurers indemnification obligation condition c shifts the burden to the insurer “to seek contribution from the insurers that issued the other triggered policies” viking pump  ned at – thus under condition c the insurer offering coverage for the selected policy year is generally required to demonstrate the existence of valid claims against other available policies and to pursue claims under themthe prior insurance provision however also offers some contractual protection for the insurer this provision allows the insurer to offset its indemnification obligations by amounts already paid to cover the loss by another insurer in the same coverage tier see appx at  permitting the insurer to reduce the limit of liability on the policy if any covered loss was already “covered in whole or in part under any other excess policy” at the same level of coverage but it would generally be the burden of the insurer to prove its entitlement under this contractual provision see facet indus inc v wright  ned   ny  explaining that the burden of proving that a loss falls within a contractual exclusion is on the insurer lindenbaum v royco prop corp  add   st dept  “the party burdened by the duty ․ usually has the burden of proving the discharge of his duty by the occurrence of a condition subsequent” if after appropriate discovery onebeacon is able to do so then the limits of liability on the policies it issued to olin should be reduced accordingly with these principles in mind we remand to the district court for further proceedings on this issueg prejudgment interestonebeacon also challenges the district courts calculation of prejudgment interest it argues that the district courts award of prejudgment interest should be vacated because olin failed to provide a sufficient “definite claim” for loss for which onebeacon might be found liable as required by onebeacons policies in light of our conclusion that all sums allocation applies—altering the total sum of damages attributable to a given policy period—it is necessary to remand to the district court so it may recalculate the amount of prejudgment interestthe district court concluded that olin is entitled to prejudgment interest pursuant to ny cplr § b section b “permits a party that prevailed in a breach of contract action to obtain prejudgment interest” nml capital v republic of arg  ned   ny  it specifically provides in relevant part that “interest shall be computed from the earliest ascertainable date the cause of action existed ․” ny cplr § bin an insurancecoverage dispute the application of § b requires that prejudgment interest be calculated from the date the insurer becomes obligated to indemnify the insured cf nml capital  ned at  explaining that “interest on a sum awarded as a result of a breach of contract is computed from the earliest date that the claim accrued” an insurer breaches its coverage obligation where it fails to comply with its insureds demand for indemnity see aetna cas  sur co v home ins co  f supp   sdny  “the accrual of aetnas cause of action can be identified as maturing when home failed to comply with aetnas demand that it indemnify aetna for payments made in connection with its settlement with robins” courts are afforded “wide discretion in determining a reasonable date from which to award prejudgment interest” conway v icahn  co inc  fd   d cir here the parties dispute whether the fifteen notices that olin sent onebeacon regarding its claims for coverage beginning in  constitute a “definite claim” such that onebeacons refusal to comply with its coverage obligations triggered § b onebeacon contends that because its policies require that olin make a “definite claim for any loss for which onebeacon may be liable under the policy” appx at  olin was obligated to provide onebeacon with a “sum certain” for a particular loss as a condition to coverage appellants reply br at  but onebeacons interpretation both reads words into and out of the policyalthough the policy does not offer a precise definition for a “definite claim” it does make clear that any such claim needs to be certain only to the extent that it provided onebeacon with an amount of loss for which onebeacon “may be liable under the policy” appx at  emphasis added the contract does not require olin to submit a “definite claim” along with a “sum certain” of such claim but rather a definite claim along with a description of the insurers potential liability with respect to that claim because we read a contract so as to “give effect to the plain meaning of the words” we reject onebeacons contrary reading intl klafter co v contl cas co  fd   d cir thus because olin furnished numerous documents and updates to onebeacon concerning its losses and descriptions as to its expenditures at each site we agree with the district courts determination that prejudgment interest should be calculated as of the dates when olin incurred various remediation costs in any event it is worth noting that it has been onebeacons position all along that it has no obligation to indemnify olin it has denied coverage for over twenty years having been found liable for coverage to olin onebeacon cannot now benefit from its tactical decision to deny its contractual obligation to indemnify olin for covered losses by avoiding liability for interest it is not the intention of § b that an insurer could deny coverage for years in the face of reasonable demands and then once it is adjudicated liable avoid paying any prejudgment interest as a result remand on this point is necessary only for the reasons noted by olin to allow the district court an opportunity to adjust olins prejudgment interest award in light of our holding regarding all sums allocationiii olins crossappealolin crossappeals the district courts grant of summary judgment in favor of onebeacon on olins chapter a claim under massachusetts law chapter a of massachusetts general laws prohibits “unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce” mass gen laws ch a § a olin claims that onebeacon engaged in unfair and deceptive acts by refusing to pay meritorious claims without conducting a reasonable investigation and forcing olin to litigate in order to recover amounts due under onebeacons policies see mass gen laws ch d § d defining “refusing to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation based upon all available information” in the context of an insurance policy as an unfair or deceptive practice in ruling from the bench the district court granted summary judgment in favor of onebeacon and dismissed olins claim because in the courts “view there is no substance whatever to an application under a massachusetts statute which talks in terms of unfair methods of competition unfair or deceptive acts ․ and onebeacon never committed such acts” special appx at applying massachusetts discovery rule we agree with onebeacon that summary judgment in its favor on olins chapter a claim is proper because olins chapter a claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations under massachusetts discovery rule the statute of limitations governing chapter a claims begins to run only “when the cause of action is discovered or reasonably should have been discovered by the plaintiff” anawan ins agency inc v div of ins  ned   mass  “in applying the ‘reasonably should have known’ standard at issue in the discovery rule reasonable notice that a particular act of another person may have been a cause of the harm to a plaintiff creates a duty of inquiry and starts the running of the statute of limitations” ross v garabedian  ned   mass as onebeacon points out olins complaint alleged as part of the factual basis for olins chapter a claim that “commercial union onebeacons predecessor ․ wholly ignored olins repeated notifications of claims provided from and after  in respect of certain of olins claims” appx at  the complaint further alleged that “commercial union has failed and refused to affirm or deny coverage in respect of olins claims for an unreasonable period of time – and in many cases has never affirmed or denied coverage in respect of certain of olins claims” appx at  in other words according to its own allegations since olin knew that onebeacon never responded directly to its notices and never affirmed or denied the coverage responsibilities these notices sought to invoke olin actually knew or at the very least should have known of the factual predicates for its chapter a claim at some point either in the s or the early s see patsos v first albany corp  ned  – mass  explaining that under the discovery rule a cause of action accrues when a plaintiff “knew or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known of the factual basis for a cause of action”olin argues in effect that it did not understand at the time the full extent of onebeacons alleged failure to investigate olins claims and so could not have brought its chapter a claim at the time but this is precisely how massachusetts discovery rule operates it starts the statute of limitations as soon as the plaintiff had sufficient information to pursue a claim and requires a putative plaintiff to conduct a reasonable investigation to inquire whether it has sufficient grounds on which to bring a claim see cambridge plating co v napco inc  fd  – st cir  having failed to do so olin cannot now argue that the statute of limitations was in fact tolled the entire time for this reason we affirm the district courts grant of summary judgment in favor of onebeacon on olins chapter a claim cf lotes co v hon hai precision indus co  d   d cir  “it is well settled that this court may affirm on any basis for which there is sufficient support in the record including grounds not relied on by the district court” internal quotation marks omittediv conclusionfor the foregoing reasons the judgments of the district court are affirmed in part vacated in part and remandedfootnotes   more specifically we affirm the jury and summary judgment findings as to onebeacons liability to olin for costs incurred at all five of the manufacturing sites at issue here but remand for calculation of damages under the all sums approach dictated by in re viking pump inc  ned  ny  and associated prejudgment interest we further vacate and remand for the district court to apply the onebeacon insurance policies prior insurance provision and to determine the effect of olins prior settlements with its london market insurers on the recovery available under the onebeacon policies in accordance with the analysis set forth in part iie of this opinion finally we affirm the judgment of the district court with respect to olins chapter a claim   the term “onebeacon” as used in this opinion refers also to each of that companys predecessors   an “operable unit” is a “term for each of a number of separate activities undertaken as part of a superfund site cleanup” appx at    the parties stipulated that property damage at fields brook began in  and the jury found that the damage ended in  appx at    the district court granted olins motion for partial summary judgment as to the bros site and concluded as a matter of law that property damage occurred from  through  it later denied onebeacons request for a jury trial regarding allocation of damages at the bros site   we express no view on the correct interpretation of this provision   the policies define “property damage” as “loss of or direct damage to or destruction of tangible property” appx at    the district court granted summary judgment in favor of olin regarding onebeacons liability at the bros site determined the progressive damage period and allocated damages evenly across the entire period onebeacon does not appeal that ruling in addition the court granted onebeacons request to bifurcate the trial and defer discovery on olins chapter a claim under massachusetts law   section a of chapter a of massachusetts general laws prohibits “unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce” mass gen laws ch a § a in turn chapter d enumerates certain specific acts or omissions within the insurance industry that give rise to a chapter a claim including “refusing to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation based upon all available information” mass gen laws ch d §    not all of the policies in viking pump included a provision like the continuing coverage clause—some contained only the prior insurance provision—but the court of appeals explained that inclusion of a continuing coverage clause “further compels” a determination that all sums—not pro rata—allocation was intended in such policies  ned at    we assume with the parties that massachusetts fouryear statute of limitations along with its associated tolling rules applies see santalucia v sebright transp inc  fd   d cir  explaining that when the parties arguments assume that the law of a certain jurisdiction controls the dispute the parties are deemed to have given implied consent to application of that
