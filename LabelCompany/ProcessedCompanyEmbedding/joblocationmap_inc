traded company the company has already begun developing its website and has contracted with a consultant to prepare such site the company has a set business plan which does not include the merger or acquisition with any other entity   our offices are currently located at  w lake mead pkwy  henderson nevada   the address of agent for service in nevada and registered corporate office is co eastbizcom inc  vegas dr las vegas nv  usa our telephone number is  we have a website at wwwjoblocationmapningcom however the information contained on our website does not form a part of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part   we have never declared bankruptcy never been in receivership and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings since becoming incorporated we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets nor have we been involved in any mergers acquisitions or consolidations neither joblocationmap nor our officers directors promoters or affiliates has had preliminary contact or discussions with nor do we have any present plans proposals arrangements or understandings with any representatives of the owners of any business or company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger    the company is an emerging growth company under the jumpstart our business startups act   the company shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of    ‘a the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of  as such amount is indexed for inflation every  years by the commission to reflect the change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers published by the bureau of labor statistics setting the threshold to the nearest  or more   ‘b the

shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures   section b requires that the registered accounting firm shall in the same report attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting   as an emerging growth company the company is exempt from section a and b of the securities exchange act of  which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes   the company has irrevocably opted out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to section b of the act   social networking websites generally   social networking websites provide internet users with services that allow them to form join or participate in online communities and to communicate with others regarding common interests and pursuits social networking websites have experienced increasing popularity in the last decade and many sites have grown into broad networks encompassing tens of millions of users  our management believes that the popularity of general interest social networking sites such as facebook has opened the door for more specialized and exclusive services that cater to special interest groups    revenue model   we plan to generate revenue from the following    advertisement space   one of the major benefits of advertising on a social networking site is that advertisers can take advantage of the users’ demographic information and target their ads appropriately we intend to sell advertisement space to companies who are interested in targeting our subscribers   we intend to sell advertising space on our website at a rate of  to  per thousand instances of an ad appearing on the website advertisements will appear on all of our web pages in a vertically oriented sidebar   we also intend to participate in the google adsense service google adsense is a free service which displays textonly ads that correspond to the keywords of the content of the page on which the ad is shown  each time a user of a host website clicks on an adsense advertisement google provides a flat fee to the operators of that website on behalf of the applicable advertiser we were experimenting with the integration of “dummy” advertisements by google with our social network website and we have since removed these advertisements we have not yet applied to google adsense program but do intend to do so once our website has been publicly launched we did not generate any adsense related income and since google pays a different fee rate according to the niche your website occupies we do not yet know what this fee will be   competition and competitive strategy   the social networking website industry is highly competitive and at times subject to rapidly changing consumer preferences and industry trends competition is generally a function of the website’s brand strength and the success of its marketing strategies its user capacity and reliability and its ability to accommodate and integrate evolving technology and features such as smartphone or twitter compatibility for example  additionally with regard to the online retail component of our business competition is generally a function of the assortment and continuity of product selection offered reliability and the level of support for products offered             we will be required to compete with a large number of niche social networking and merchandising websites many of which have significantly greater resources than we do many of our competitors also have the ability to develop and market products and services similar to and competitive with our products and services we believe that we are currently one of the smallest in the industry as we currently have only a nominal web presence and no revenues from our business operations   management believes we can offset any such competitive disadvantages by being a price leader in the marketplace first by offering free access to our website and thereafter by offering more competitively priced premium services initially general subscriptions to our site will be free and premium subscriptions will be only approximately  per month we will also seek to differentiate ourselves by providing our subscribers with more attractive social network features such as tools for subscribers to easily communicate with each other     marketing  sales strategy   the use of internet is continuing to evolve as a global platform for doing business our major focus in the first year will be to use google adwords program in order to drive traffic to our own website we plan to take advantage of the well established google adwords marketing program which places online ads on the search result pages of internet users google uses an advertising methodology referred to as costperclick “cpc” in its adwords program using this strategy will allow us to design our own ads and to select target locations such as a city or state and use keywords in our ads a keyword is a word that is used by an internet user who is performing an online search to find out information on a specific topic    our primary target market is focused on internet users who already participate in social networking websites with cpc advertising we only pay for the number of actual clicks on our advertisement each time someone clicks on our google ad they will be redirected to our web site a cpcbased advertising strategy is cost effective because an advertiser only pays for the leads they receive the cpc marketing campaign is an integral part of our long term strategy   our marketing campaign will monitor daily statistics and track favorite topics in order to quickly get in sync with our internet audience this is a significant part of our branding strategy   online advertising   the majority of our advertising and promotional activities will be concentrated on an online advertising campaign using google adwords we have selected google because of its success and popularity for web users wishing to find something using an internet search the google adwords program will allow us to customize the text of our advertisements the frequency of each advertisements appearance and the length of the advertising contract for our purposes we believe that this will give us the maximum amount of flexibility and allow us to closely monitor the costs of the marketing campaign   email advertising campaign   we anticipate that an information style email advertising campaign may help to enhance our online advertising campaign and bring us into direct contact with people who are interested in using our services in this regard we are considering acquiring email lists which may be done on an incremental basis so as not to incur a large expense before determining whether an email campaign works and meets our expectations   we have budgeted a minimum of  and a maximum of  for advertising marketing and sales during the  months following completion of this offering mr shamir benita will be responsible to manage all of our marketing and sales activities   optimizing our website   we plan to work with the web site development contractor to develop a series of metatags for each of the pages of our web site metatags are keywords that are added to a web page to make it easier to find that specific web page through search engines web browser software and other applications the information is not intended to be seen by the casual internet user search engines like google and yahoo are designed to seek out these keywords when someone is performing an internet search for a specific topic by including metatags such we will be able to help drive more traffic to our web site            as our business begins to gain subscribers and become known in the industry we plan to conduct our own online survey questionnaires from the home page of our web site   sources and availability of products and supplies   we will be developing our own website and the distribution of our website services will be over the internet  we intend to engage the services of independent contractors in relation to web design and programming as we may require we believe there are no constraints on the sources or availability of

intellectual property which may be owned by others and which may constrain our business plan nor have we received independent opinions of counsel on such matters  beyond our trade name we do not hold any other intellectual property rights   effect of existing or probable government regulation   we do not believe that government regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business  given the content that will be available on our website we will implement appropriate safeguards and electronic warnings to ensure that visitors to our site are aware of any restrictions

a summary of significant accounting policies of joblocationmap the company is presented to assist in understanding the company’s financial statements the accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements these financial statements and notes are representations of the company’s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity the company has not realized revenues from its planned principal business purpose   organization nature of business and trade name   joblocationmap the company was incorporated in the state of nevada on june   joblocationmap’s principal business objective of developing and marketing an online map application   the company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failing to secure additional funding to operationalize the company’s online map application before another company develops a similar app   cash and cash equivalents   for purposes of the statement of cash flows the company considers all shortterm debt securities purchased with maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents property and equipment   property and equipment are carried at cost expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations renewals and betterments that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the period   depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straightline basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are       estimated     useful lives office equipment    years copier      years vehicles    years   for federal income tax purposes depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system for financial statements purposes depreciation is computed under the straightline method   the company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operations to date the company currently does not have any property and equipment the above accounting policies will be adopted upon the company maintains property and equipment   f        recent accounting pronouncements   on june   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued update asu  development stage entities topic    amongst other things the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage entity from topic  thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from us gaap  in addition the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to  present inceptiontodate information on the statements of income cash flows and shareholders equity  label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity   disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and  disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage  the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim reporting periods beginning after december   however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued    revenue recognition   the company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with fasb asc  “revenue recognition”  revenue is recognized when a formal arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable all obligations have been performed pursuant to the terms of the formal arrangement and collectability is reasonably assured  the company recognizes revenues on sales of its services based on the terms of the customer agreement  the customer agreement takes the form of either a contract or a customer purchase order and each provides information with respect to the service being sold and the sales price  if the customer agreement does not have specific delivery or customer acceptance terms revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the customer   fair value of financial instruments   the company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis the company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the marketbased risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability such as risks inherent in valuation techniques transfer restrictions and credit risk fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement   level  – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level  – observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities   level  – inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability   in accordance with the fair value accounting requirements companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments   as of december   and december  the carrying value of accounts payable and loans that are required to be measured at fair value approximated fair value due to the shortterm nature and maturity of these instruments   advertising   advertising expenses are recorded as general and administrative expenses when they are incurred   f        use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  a change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on joblocationmap’s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred actual results could differ from those estimates joblocationmap’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented   capital stock   the company has authorized one hundred million  shares of common stock with a par value of  and fifty million  shares of preferred stock with a par value of  nine million five hundred thousand  shares of common stock were issued and outstanding as of december   and december      income taxes   the company recognizes the tax effects of transactions in the year in which such transactions enter into the determination of net income regardless of when reported for tax purposes   note b – going concern   the companys financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business however the company does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern   under the going concern assumption an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation ceasing trading or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations accordingly assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the nature of business and trade name paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   during the next year the company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the securities and exchange commission and the payment of expenses associated with research and development the company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital   historically it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock to finance its operations and growth management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the company’s stock or through loans from private investors although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing the company’s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders   in the past year the company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common stock and loan from related party for the coming year the company plans to continue to fund the company through debt and securities sales and issuances until the company generates enough revenues through the operations as stated above   f        note c – common stock   on or about august   related party directors omri morchi and eden shoua each purchased  common

changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure   none   item a controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   as of the end of the period covered by this report the company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by rule e under the securities exchange act of  under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on and as of the date of such evaluation the aforementioned officers have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective   the company also maintains a system of internal accounting controls that is designed to provide assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are executed in accordance with management’s authorization and properly recorded this system is continually reviewed and is augmented by written policies and procedures the careful selection and training of qualified personnel and an internal audit program to monitor its effectiveness   managements report on internal control over financial reporting   management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules af and df under the exchange act our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that   • pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company   • provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and   • provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements   management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control  integrated framework   our management concluded that as of december   our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria in internal control  integrated framework issued by the coso   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there were no significant changes in the company’s internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls as of the end of the fiscal year and up to the filing date of this annual report on form k there were no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses and therefore there were no corrective actions taken it should be noted that any system of controls however well designed and operated can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met in addition the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions regardless of how remote            item b other information   none   part iii   item  directors executive officers and

committee and handles matters related to compensation and nominations of directors   potential conflicts of interest   since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent
