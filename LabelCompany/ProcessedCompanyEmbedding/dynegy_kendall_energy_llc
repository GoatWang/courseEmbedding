parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate

andrew cuomo sued dynegy and other utilities arguing that the companies were not properly accounting for the financial risks that pollutants from coalfired generating plants created after a year of negotiations and legal maneuvering dynegy agreed to issue statements to its current and future investors warning that government regulation of carbon emissions and lawsuits over pollution could pose financial risks to the company its move into coalfired electrical generation led the national environmental trust an environmental group to derisively call dynegy the king of coal in  takeover battlesedit on august   the blackstone group announced plans to purchase dynegy for us billion as part of the deal nrg energy would acquire four natural gas plants in california and maine for us billion seneca capital dynegys largest shareholder fought the purchase in a proxy fight dynegy investor carl icahn also promised a proxy battle arguing that blackstone groups offer was too low icahn raised his stake in dynegy to  percent in preparation for the shareholder fight seneca capital nominated former railroad executive e hunter harrison and former energy company executive jeff d hunter for the dynegy board of directors challenging bruce williamson and david biegler a williamson ally a series of maneuvers followed dynegy executives said the offer was a good one as the deal would give dynegy access to lines of credit which would enable it to refinance and restructure its debt with energy prices at cyclical lows the company said it lacked the resources to do so and that its debt burden was destabilizing blackstone group initially said it would not offer more than us per share but then revised its offer later that day to us a share worried that it did not have enough shareholder support to accept the blackstone group offer dynegy proposed postponing its shareholder meeting a few days to november  but postponement did not occur legal counsel advised that delaware law under which dynegy was incorporated considered a postponement a new meeting and that would require notifying shareholders again and giving at least  days notice furthermore dynegys proxy rules did not make it clear that a proxy remained in effect in the event of a postponement which could lead to lawsuits legal counsel also believed that dynegy management would be forced refile resolution with shareholders and resolicit votes which would delay a meeting until early  during the shareholder meeting managements fears proved accurate on november  dynegy was forced to recess its shareholder meeting in an attempt to garner more support for the blackstone bid dynegy was unable to adjourn the meeting because its bylaws did not clearly provide for adjournment to another date and because it was unclear that adjournment could occur without a shareholder vote—a vote the board felt it would lose during the fourday recess dynegy executives said the company would continue to solicit a takeover even if the blackstone group bid failed on november   dynegy management and blackstone agreed to call off the takeover after it became clear there was not enough support for the us a share bid on december   icahn offered a us a share cash bid for dynegy dynegys board asked for other bids but none emerged but icahn too found little support among shareholders he extended his offer by two weeks on january   that same day seneca capital said it would not even entertain a us a share bid dynegys board urged shareholders to accept the icahn bid or risk bankruptcy but by midfebruary even those investors willing to accept the icahn bid had rescinded these offers icahn extended his offer by few days the icahn bid too collapsed on february   bruce williamson resigned as dynegys chairman and announced he would step down as chief executive officer on march  chief financial officer holli c nichols also said she would resign as chief financial officer on march  as well board member thomas w elward was named interim chairman and robert c flexon was appointed interim president and chief executive officer harrison was elected to the board of directors also elected to the board were vincent j intrieri senior managing director of icahn capital and samuel j merksamer an investment analyst for icahn capital  bankruptcyedit the takeover bids all came after one of dynegys largest subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy on november   dynegy holdings the largest of dynegy incs four subsidiaries filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection the bankruptcy was a novel one dynegy had structured itself so that dynegy inc the holding company had little debt nearly all the debt was held by its subsidiary dynegy holdings which also guaranteed debt for the operating divisions dynegy inc created three operating divisions the natural gas group gasco the coal group coalco and a group for all other businesses known as the stub group gasco and coalco were structured so that they would be little affected by any bankruptcy filing by either dynegy inc or dynegy holdings part of the structure meant that few of the natural gascos and coalcos dividends were given to dynegy holdings to separate dynegy holdings from dynegy inc dynegy holdings was transformed from a corporation into a limited liability company llc this legal maneuver took advantage of a delaware supreme court ruling which made it difficult for creditors to sue an llcs board of directors for failing to uphold their fiduciary duty finally gasco and coalco sold themselves to dynegy inc which left dynegy holdings holding us billion in debt but without the ability to seize the assets of gasco and coalco in the event of a default under the structure adopted by dynegy inc the company could meet its debt obligations to dynegy holdings by paying cash or by forgiving debt this provided an incentive for dynegy inc to withhold payment and force dynegy holdings to declare bankruptcy thereby reducing the value of the debt and making it easier to pay off the restructuring plan put dynegys assets which had the worst financial performance into the hands of dynegy holdings the goal was to protect dynegys secured creditors at the expense of its unsecured creditors the plan had already generated one lawsuit in  us bancorp representing bondholders whose investment was secured by leases of two dynegy power plants new newburgh new york the danskammer generating station and the roseton generating station on march   dynegy submitted financial filings with government regulators warning investors that it faced bankruptcy if it could not restructure its debt the company announced a month later that it had hired the restructuring firm lazard and the law firm white  case to advise it on debt restructuring vincent intrieri was named chair of the boards finance and restructuring committee on march   the november  bankruptcy of dynegy holdings ran into difficulty an examiner appointed by the united states bankruptcy court found that the dynegy incs purchase of coalco was fraudulent the examiner found that dynegy holdings was already bankrupt at the time the sale took place and therefore constituted a breach of fiduciary duty by the dynegy holdings board of directors this allowed the dynegy holdings board of directors to sue the dynegy inc board of directors for damages which could run into the billions of dollars this threw the dynegy holdings bankrutpcy filing into doubt and put dynegy inc on the hook for billions in debt the bankruptcy court trustee said she would sue on behalf of dynegy holdings to recover these debts the bankruptcy court examiners finding quickly led to the bankruptcy of dynegy inc itself on april   dynegy inc announced that it had reached an agreement with the us bankruptcy trustee the board of directors of dynegy holdings and its other creditors the agreement which affected us billion in debt gave all creditors  percent of the stock of dynegy inc once it emerged from bankruptcy existing shareholders would get just  percent of the stock in the new company with warrants enabling them to buy up to  of common stock at a set price over the next five years accordingly dynegy inc filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection on july   the bankrutpcy plan filed by dynegy inc also called for a merger with dynegy holdings the bankruptcy filing did not however affect gasco coalco or the stub group and allowed the dynegy holdings bankruptcy to proceed dynegys stock was delisted from the new york stock exchange following the bankruptcy filing us bancorp agreed to drop its lawsuit against the company in exchange for a  million claim against the company in bankruptcy court the bondholders represented by us bancorp would also get a further us million if the danskammer and roseton plants are sold as part of its bankruptcy filing dynegy moved its corporate headquarters in november  the company signed a lease for new principal offices in an office building at  travis street in houston it occupied these quarters early july  dynegy continued to hold leases on several floors of the wells fargo plaza however as part of its bankruptcy filing the bankruptcy court approved a new lease in which dynegy would abandon  square feet  m of space at wells fargo plaza the company asked the court to cancel its lease on the remaining  square feet  m as well dynegy said it hoped to hold a vote on august  at which time its creditors would approve the bankruptcy plan a court hearing on the creditorapproved bankruptcy plan would then be held september  after which the company said it would emerge from bankruptcy protection dynegy inc posted a secondquarter  loss of  billion an increase to  per share from  cents per share a year ago the company blamed among other things markedly lower demand for its electricity much lower prices for its coal and a  million noncash loss caused by the transfer of its coal unit to dynegy holdings the company also said it now hoped to emerge from bankruptcy in september  dynegy agreed to auction off its roseton and danskammer energy plants in new york state in order to emerge from bankruptcy dynegy had signed a saleleaseback agreement in  with public services enterprise group for the roseton and danskammer facilities fifty percent of the proceeds from the auction would be used to pay bondholders up to  million while the remaining  percent would be used to pay unsecured creditors the unsecured creditors would get  million in cash unsecured creditors also would receive  percent of dynegys new stock with the company retaining the rest with warrants to purchase  percent of the stock after five years dynegy also agreed to pay holders of  million in subordinated capital income securities just  million in principal and  million in interest to settle their claims the bankruptcy agreement also settled claims between dynegy holdings and dynegy inc dynegy emerged from bankruptcy on october   and its shares began trading on october  under the dyn symbol postbankruptcyedit on november   the federal energy regulatory commission settled a decadeold lawsuit which alleged that dynegy had manipulated the california energy market while the lawsuit continued dynegy sold its california subsidiary to nrg energy inc nrg energy subsequently agreed to pay  million in refunds to consumers as well as spend more than  million to install  public fastcharging electric vehicle stations and  plugin stations throughout california twenty percent of the stations were required to be in lowincome neighborhoods on january   dynegys chief operating officer kevin howell resigned howell continued as a consultant to the company and agreed to stay on until a successor was named in order to provide an orderly transition on february   dynegys south bay power plant in san diego california was imploded the demolition of the foot  m smokestacks of the outmoded plant was watched by more than  people roseton and danskammer salesedit the sale of the roseton and danskammer plants—a condition of dynegys emergence from bankruptcy—proceeded slowly on november   members of international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew local  struck the roseton and danskammer plants after a contract extension expired and dynegy continued to seek cuts in retirement benefits dynegys bankruptcy also left  million in unpaid property taxes in dutchess county new york this created a budget crisis in the county which threatened to close local schools and create severe cutbacks in county services on december   dynegy announced it would sell the roseton plant to louis dreyfus highbridge energy for  million in cash the sale closed on april   the danskammer plant sale was far more troubled the plant was heavily damaged by hurricane sandy in october  rendering it inoperable on december  dynegy said that ics ny holdings would buy the plant for  million and demolish it but the ics sale stalled under the terms of the auction ics ny had to replace or find a substitute for its credit support agreement and pay its portion of the plants outstanding property taxes but dynegy said the company never did either ics defended itself saying it was making every economically feasible effort to replace the credit agreement on may   dynegy filed suit with the bankruptcy court to force ica to fulfill its obligations the court imposed a july  deadline for ics to close the sale but it did not meet the deadline dynegy subsequently sought another buyer helios power capital a private equity firm agreed to purchase the plant for  million in cash on august  the court approved the sale on september  ameren purchaseedit in midmarch  dynegy purchased three electric generating subsidiaries of ameren an illinois power company the deal worth  million involved amerens ameren energy generating co genco gencos controlling interest in electric energy inc amerenenergy resources generating co and ameren energy marketing co dynegy formed a subsidiary illinois power holdings iph to purchase the ameren subsidiaries no cash changed hands rather iph agreed to assume  million in debt owed by genco and the other subsidiaries ameren also transferred about  million in tax benefits the three subsidiaries would have received in  ameren retained gencos inactive hutsonville and meredosia plants and agreed to buy back from iph for  million three natural gas electrical generating plants dynegy agreed to honor the union collective bargaining agreements in force at all plants under the deal dynegy acquired five coalfired generating plants coffeen in coffeen illinois duck creek in canton illinois ed edwards in bartonville illinois joppa in joppa illinois and newton in newton illinois as the deal worked its way through state and federal regulatory approval dynegy took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced its debt the company obtained  billion in term loan b facilities and  million in revolving credit the company used this income to retire an  million sevenyear line of credit and a  million twoyear line of credit dynegy agreed that the revolving credit line would be paid off and terminate within five years two syndicated loans made up the  billion loan package the  million loan and the  million loan were both due in  this left dynegy with  billion in lines of credit and  million in outstanding bonds the ameren plantsfordebt swap also ran into trouble the federal energy regulatory commission ferc had to approve the deal and ensure that there was no negative impact on consumers from dynegys expanding market share in the midwest but on april  ferc said that the studies submitted by dynegy and ameren were inadequate and it ordered the two firms to rerun the studies and report back to ferc by july  on july  ferc again declined to approve or disapprove the dynegyameren deal the agency said that it dynegys study showed it charging market rates for energy in the midwest but ferc said it worried that transmission bottlenecks in the area would permit dynegy to charge much more furthermore federal regulators were considering an expansion in the market area iph could serve ferc asked dynegy to provide additional information on transmission limitations and market area expansion in august the sierra club formally filed opposition to the dynegyameren deal the environmental group said the transmission bottleneck issue gave dynegy too much market power it also argued that dynegy and ameren had submitted only regional market power data and had not accounted for local impacts which could be very severe another obstacle emerged on june  ameren was required to install pollutionreducing equipment on its five coalfired generating plants in  but because ameren was in financial difficulty it sought and received a waiver from the state of illinois granting it a fiveyear delay ameren sought to transfer this delay to dynegy so that dynegy would not have to immediately install the devices until  either but the illinois pollution control board denied amerens request dynegy filed its own request for a fiveyear waiver in july and warned that the ameren deal would fall apart if it did not receive the waiver but the sierra club the environmental law and policy center and other environmental groups said dynegy had the resources to install the equipment and opposed a waiver acm partners a financial firm hired by the sierra club also argued that dynegy purposefully left iph significantly underfunded and unable to tap into the parent companys resources dynegy disagreed but the firm warned that if iph went bankrupt workers would lose pensions and local communities would have to pay for any environmental remediation the illinois aflcio however supported dynegys request on september  saying that local jobs depended on the waiver the pollution board said it would make a decision by november  foresight energy a major illinois coal mining company said it would install the  million antipollution devices for free if dynegy agreed to sign a longterm contract to accept coal only from foresight energy dynegy declined the offer in part because it already has longterm coal contracts and environmental groups opposed it there was some speculation by financial analysts that the dynegyameren deal was a poor one julien dumoulinsmith executive director of ubs investment research said dynegy is far more likely to shutter all five coalpowered plants rather than add pollution control devices dumoulinsmith pointed out that the united states environmental protection agency epa issued final rules on sulfur dioxide emissions that go into effect in july  because the edwards plant is in an area of low air quality epa is likely to force dynegy to close the plant anyway the remaining four plants are borderline cases with the exception of duck creek station which spent nearly usm on sulfur dioxide removal and may also be forced to close if epa regulations tighten in the future a highly likely possibility he said  acquisitionsedit on august   dynegy announced a deal involving two interdependent transactions to be executed simultaneously dynegy acquired duke’s midwest generation assets and retail business for  billion in cash and the power generating assets of equipower resources for  billion with  billion in cash and

power agreed to buy nine electrical generating plants from dynegy for us billion in cash in order to dissolve the joint venture part of the reason for the joint ventures demise was another collapse in

class b shares so that dynegy would only have  million shares of common stock outstanding the dissolution of the joint venture left ls power with a  percent stake in dynegy dynegys move into

accounting for the financial risks that pollutants from coalfired generating plants created after a year of negotiations and legal maneuvering dynegy agreed to issue statements to its current and future investors warning that government regulation of carbon emissions and lawsuits over pollution could pose financial risks to the company its move into coalfired electrical generation led the national environmental trust an environmental group to derisively call dynegy the king of coal in  takeover battlesedit on august   the blackstone group announced plans to purchase dynegy for us billion as part of the deal nrg energy would acquire four natural gas plants in california and maine for us billion seneca capital dynegys largest shareholder fought the purchase in a proxy fight dynegy investor carl icahn also promised a proxy battle arguing that blackstone groups offer was too low icahn raised his stake in dynegy to  percent in preparation for the shareholder fight seneca capital nominated former railroad executive e hunter harrison and former energy company executive jeff d hunter for the dynegy board of directors challenging bruce williamson and david biegler a williamson ally a series of maneuvers followed dynegy executives said the offer was a good one as the deal would give dynegy access to lines of credit which would enable it to refinance and restructure its debt with energy prices at cyclical lows the company said it lacked the resources to do so and that its debt burden was destabilizing blackstone group initially said it would not offer more than us per share but then revised its offer later that day to us a share worried that it did not have enough shareholder support to accept the blackstone group offer dynegy proposed postponing its shareholder meeting a few days to november  but postponement did not occur legal counsel advised that delaware law under which dynegy was incorporated considered a postponement a new meeting and that would require notifying shareholders again and giving at least  days notice furthermore dynegys proxy rules did not make it clear that a proxy remained in effect in the event of a postponement which could lead to lawsuits legal counsel also believed that dynegy management would be forced refile resolution with shareholders and resolicit votes which would delay a meeting until early  during the shareholder meeting managements fears proved accurate on november  dynegy was forced to recess its shareholder meeting in an attempt to garner more support for the blackstone bid dynegy was unable to adjourn the meeting because its bylaws did not clearly provide for adjournment to another date and because it was unclear that adjournment could occur without a shareholder vote—a vote the board felt it would lose during the fourday recess dynegy executives said the company would continue to solicit a takeover even if the blackstone group bid failed on november   dynegy management and blackstone agreed to call off the takeover after it became clear there was not enough support for the us a share bid on december   icahn offered a us a share cash bid for dynegy dynegys board asked for other bids but none emerged but icahn too found little support among shareholders he extended his offer by two weeks on january   that same day seneca capital said it would not even entertain a us a share bid dynegys board urged shareholders to accept the icahn bid or risk bankruptcy but by midfebruary even those investors willing to accept the icahn bid had rescinded these offers icahn extended his offer by few days the icahn bid too collapsed on february   bruce williamson resigned as dynegys chairman and announced he would step down as chief executive officer on march  chief financial officer holli c nichols also said she would resign as chief financial officer on march  as well board member thomas w elward was named interim chairman and robert c flexon was appointed interim president and chief executive officer harrison was elected to the board of directors also elected to the board were vincent j intrieri senior managing director of icahn capital and samuel j merksamer an investment analyst for icahn capital  bankruptcyedit the takeover bids all came after one of dynegys largest subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy on november   dynegy holdings the largest of dynegy incs four subsidiaries filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection the bankruptcy was a novel one dynegy had structured itself so that dynegy inc the holding company had little debt nearly all the debt was held by its subsidiary dynegy holdings which also guaranteed debt for the operating divisions dynegy inc created three operating divisions the natural gas group gasco the coal group coalco and a group for all other businesses known as the stub group gasco and coalco were structured so that they would be little affected by any bankruptcy filing by either dynegy inc or dynegy holdings part of the structure meant that few of the natural gascos and coalcos dividends were given to dynegy holdings to separate dynegy holdings from dynegy inc dynegy holdings was transformed from a corporation into a limited liability company llc this legal maneuver took advantage of a delaware supreme court ruling which made it difficult for creditors to sue an llcs board of directors for failing to uphold their fiduciary duty finally gasco and coalco sold themselves to dynegy inc which left dynegy holdings holding us billion in debt but without the ability to seize the assets of gasco and coalco in the event of a default under the structure adopted by dynegy inc the company could meet its debt obligations to dynegy holdings by paying cash or by forgiving debt this provided an incentive for dynegy inc to withhold payment and force dynegy holdings to declare bankruptcy thereby reducing the value of the debt and making it easier to pay off the restructuring plan put dynegys assets which had the worst financial performance into the hands of dynegy holdings the goal was to protect dynegys secured creditors at the expense of its unsecured creditors the plan had already generated one lawsuit in  us bancorp representing bondholders whose investment was secured by leases of two dynegy power plants new newburgh new york the danskammer generating station and the roseton generating station on march   dynegy submitted financial filings with government regulators warning investors that it faced bankruptcy if it could not restructure its debt the company announced a month later that it had hired the restructuring firm lazard and the law firm white  case to advise it on debt restructuring vincent intrieri was named chair of the boards finance and restructuring committee on march   the november  bankruptcy of dynegy holdings ran into difficulty an examiner appointed by the united states bankruptcy court found that the dynegy incs purchase of coalco was fraudulent the examiner found that dynegy holdings was already bankrupt at the time the sale took place and therefore constituted a breach of fiduciary duty by the dynegy holdings board of directors this allowed the dynegy holdings board of directors to sue the dynegy inc board of directors for damages which could run into the billions of dollars this threw the dynegy holdings bankrutpcy filing into doubt and put dynegy inc on the hook for billions in debt the bankruptcy court trustee said she would sue on behalf of dynegy holdings to recover these debts the bankruptcy court examiners finding quickly led to the bankruptcy of dynegy inc itself on april   dynegy inc announced that it had reached an agreement with the us bankruptcy trustee the board of directors of dynegy holdings and its other creditors the agreement which affected us billion in debt gave all creditors  percent of the stock of dynegy inc once it emerged from bankruptcy existing shareholders would get just  percent of the stock in the new company with warrants enabling them to buy up to  of common stock at a set price over the next five years accordingly dynegy inc filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection on july   the bankrutpcy plan filed by dynegy inc also called for a merger with dynegy holdings the bankruptcy filing did not however affect gasco coalco or the stub group and allowed the dynegy holdings bankruptcy to proceed dynegys stock was delisted from the new york stock exchange following the bankruptcy filing us bancorp agreed to drop its lawsuit against the company in exchange for a  million claim against the company in bankruptcy court the bondholders represented by us bancorp would also get a further us million if the danskammer and roseton plants are sold as part of its bankruptcy filing dynegy moved its corporate headquarters in november  the company signed a lease for new principal offices in an office building at  travis street in houston it occupied these quarters early july  dynegy continued to hold leases on several floors of the wells fargo plaza however as part of its bankruptcy filing the bankruptcy court approved a new lease in which dynegy would abandon  square feet  m of space at wells fargo plaza the company asked the court to cancel its lease on the remaining  square feet  m as well dynegy said it hoped to hold a vote on august  at which time its creditors would approve the bankruptcy plan a court hearing on the creditorapproved bankruptcy plan would then be held september  after which the company said it would emerge from bankruptcy protection dynegy inc posted a secondquarter  loss of  billion an increase to  per share from  cents per share a year ago the company blamed among other things markedly lower demand for its electricity much lower prices for its coal and a  million noncash loss caused by the transfer of its coal unit to dynegy holdings the company also said it now hoped to emerge from bankruptcy in september  dynegy agreed to auction off its roseton and danskammer energy plants in new york state in order to emerge from bankruptcy dynegy had signed a saleleaseback agreement in  with public services enterprise group for the roseton and danskammer facilities fifty percent of the proceeds from the auction would be used to pay bondholders up to  million while the remaining  percent would be used to pay unsecured creditors the unsecured creditors would get  million in cash unsecured creditors also would receive  percent of dynegys new stock with the company retaining the rest with warrants to purchase  percent of the stock after five years dynegy also agreed to pay holders of  million in subordinated capital income securities just  million in principal and  million in interest to settle their claims the bankruptcy agreement also settled claims between dynegy holdings and dynegy inc dynegy emerged from bankruptcy on october   and its shares began trading on october  under the dyn symbol postbankruptcyedit on november   the federal energy regulatory commission settled a decadeold lawsuit which alleged that dynegy had manipulated the california energy market while the lawsuit continued dynegy sold its california subsidiary to nrg energy inc nrg energy subsequently agreed to pay  million in refunds to consumers as well as spend more than  million to install  public fastcharging electric vehicle stations and  plugin stations throughout california twenty percent of the stations were required to be in lowincome neighborhoods on january   dynegys chief operating officer kevin howell resigned howell continued as a consultant to the company and agreed to stay on until a successor was named in order to provide an orderly transition on february   dynegys south bay power plant in san diego california was imploded the demolition of the foot  m smokestacks of the outmoded plant was watched by more than  people roseton and danskammer salesedit the sale of the roseton and danskammer plants—a condition of dynegys emergence from bankruptcy—proceeded slowly on november   members of international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew local  struck the roseton and danskammer plants after a contract extension expired and dynegy continued to seek cuts in retirement benefits dynegys bankruptcy also left  million in unpaid property taxes in dutchess county new york this created a budget crisis in the county which threatened to close local schools and create severe cutbacks in county services on december   dynegy announced it would sell the roseton plant to louis dreyfus highbridge energy for  million in cash the sale closed on april   the danskammer plant sale was far more troubled the plant was heavily damaged by hurricane sandy in october  rendering it inoperable on december  dynegy said that ics ny holdings would buy the plant for  million and demolish it but the ics sale stalled under the terms of the auction ics ny had to replace or find a substitute for its credit support agreement and pay its portion of the plants outstanding property taxes but dynegy said the company never did either ics defended itself saying it was making every economically feasible effort to replace the credit agreement on may   dynegy filed suit with the bankruptcy court to force ica to fulfill its obligations the court imposed a july  deadline for ics to close the sale but it did not meet the deadline dynegy subsequently sought another buyer helios power capital a private equity firm agreed to purchase the plant for  million in cash on august  the court approved the sale on september  ameren purchaseedit in midmarch  dynegy purchased three electric generating subsidiaries of ameren an illinois power company the deal worth  million involved amerens ameren energy generating co genco gencos controlling interest in electric energy inc amerenenergy resources generating co and ameren energy marketing co dynegy formed a subsidiary illinois power holdings iph to purchase the ameren subsidiaries no cash changed hands rather iph agreed to assume  million in debt owed by genco and the other subsidiaries ameren also transferred about  million in tax benefits the three subsidiaries would have received in  ameren retained gencos inactive hutsonville and meredosia plants and agreed to buy back from iph for  million three natural gas electrical generating plants dynegy agreed to honor the union collective bargaining agreements in force at all plants under the deal dynegy acquired five coalfired generating plants coffeen in coffeen illinois duck creek in canton illinois ed edwards in bartonville illinois joppa in joppa illinois and newton in newton illinois as the deal worked its way through state and federal regulatory approval dynegy took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced its debt the company obtained  billion in term loan b facilities and  million in revolving credit the company used this income to retire an  million sevenyear line of credit and a  million twoyear line of credit dynegy agreed that the revolving credit line would be paid off and terminate within five years two syndicated loans made up the  billion loan package the  million loan and the  million loan were both due in  this left dynegy with  billion in lines of credit and  million in outstanding bonds the ameren plantsfordebt swap also ran into trouble the federal energy regulatory commission ferc had to approve the deal and ensure that there was no negative impact on consumers from dynegys expanding market share in the midwest but on april  ferc said that the studies submitted by dynegy and ameren were inadequate and it ordered the two firms to rerun the studies and report back to ferc by july  on july  ferc again declined to approve or disapprove the dynegyameren deal the agency said that it dynegys study showed it charging market rates for energy in the midwest but ferc said it worried that transmission bottlenecks in the area would permit dynegy to charge much more furthermore federal regulators were considering an expansion in the market area iph could serve ferc asked dynegy to provide additional information on transmission limitations and market area expansion in august the sierra club formally filed opposition to the dynegyameren deal the environmental group said the transmission bottleneck issue gave dynegy too much market power it also argued that dynegy and ameren had submitted only regional market power data and had not accounted for local impacts which could be very severe another obstacle emerged on june  ameren was required to install pollutionreducing equipment on its five coalfired generating plants in  but because ameren was in financial difficulty it sought and received a waiver from the state of illinois granting it a fiveyear delay ameren sought to transfer this delay to dynegy so that dynegy would not have to immediately install the devices until  either but the illinois pollution control board denied amerens request dynegy filed its own request for a fiveyear waiver in july and warned that the ameren deal would fall apart if it did not receive the waiver but the sierra club the environmental law and policy center and other environmental groups said dynegy had the resources to install the equipment and opposed a waiver acm partners a financial firm hired by the sierra club also argued that dynegy purposefully left iph significantly underfunded and unable to tap into the parent companys resources dynegy disagreed but the firm warned that if iph went bankrupt workers would lose pensions and local communities would have to pay for any environmental remediation the illinois aflcio however supported dynegys request on september  saying that local jobs depended on the waiver the pollution board said it would make a decision by november  foresight energy a major illinois coal mining company said it would install the  million antipollution devices for free if dynegy agreed to sign a longterm contract to accept coal only from foresight energy dynegy declined the offer in part because it already has longterm coal contracts and environmental groups opposed it there was some speculation by financial analysts that the dynegyameren deal was a poor one julien dumoulinsmith executive director of ubs investment research said dynegy is far more likely to shutter all five coalpowered plants rather than add pollution control devices dumoulinsmith pointed out that the united states environmental protection agency epa issued final rules on sulfur dioxide emissions that go into effect in july  because the edwards plant is in an area of low air quality epa is likely to force dynegy to close the plant anyway the remaining four plants are borderline cases with the exception of duck creek station which spent nearly usm on sulfur dioxide removal and may also be forced to close if epa regulations tighten in the future a highly likely possibility he said  acquisitionsedit on august   dynegy announced a deal involving two interdependent transactions to be executed simultaneously dynegy acquired duke’s midwest generation assets and retail business for  billion in cash and the power generating assets of equipower resources for  billion with  billion in cash and  million in stock this increased the companys

jamie olis former senior director of tax planning gene foster former vice president for taxation and helen sharkey a former employee in dynegys risk control and deal structure groups were indicted on numerous counts of mail and wire fraud according to court documents the three employees conceived of a plan in early  to borrow money but make it look like operational revenue a corporation known as abg gas supply was created abg secured loans from citigroup credit suisse first boston and deutsche bank to buy natural gas at market prices abg then sold this gas at a discount to dynegy which resold it at market prices and booked a  million profit abg then bought natural gas at market prices and sold it at a premium to dynegy the profits abg booked were then used to repay the loans prosecutors accused olis foster and sharkey of deceiving auditors regulators and other company executives regarding the transactions foster and sharkey plead guilty two months later olis was found guilty in march  and sentenced to  years in prison a year later after a us supreme court ruling in a different case held that mandatory sentencing guidelines violated the constitution olis sentence was reduced to just six years in prison in december  three former executives at nicor energy llc a joint venture of dynegy and nicor were indicted for illegally manipulating that firms income by us million in  to hide losses former chief financial officer robert doty agreed to pay a  fine in october  for his role in helping to conceal the abg gas supply scheme shareholders too were unhappy with dynegys actions during the financial crisis a class action lawsuit was filed against the company in  in april  dynegy agreed to settle the lawsuit shareholders would be paid a total of us million to come up with the money dynegy paid out  million in cash and issued  million in stock to the plaintiffs its insurance companies paid another  million to the plaintiffs recovery and restructuringedit on october   dynegy hired bruce williamson a former duke energy executive as its chief executive officer six weeks later dynegy hired nick j caruso a former chief financial officer at royal dutch shell as its new chief financial officer williamson began a program of cost cutting elimination of unprofitable businesses and financial restructuring as williamson later told the new york times in june  we had businesses in trading in marketing in broadband communications in europe in communications as far as china what we have done is very systematically sell those off shut down offices and concentrate on the two businesses that looked like we had a competitive advantage dynegy sold its telecommunications business in europe in january  restated its income for  and  sold a natural gas terminal in louisiana sold its telecommunications business in north america in april  engaged in a us billion refinancing and other restructuring of its debt sold its illinois power company subsidiary to ameren and nullified a number of contracts in noncore or moneylosing areas in march  wiliamson was named chairman of the company succeeding dan dienstbier who retired dynegy undertook a strategy to move into coalfired and hydroelectric electrical generation in  and out of natural gas distribution and trading in november  the company acquired four natural gasfired and four hydroelectric power generation plants in the northeast united states in march  it agreed to settle a  dispute with the environmental protection agency by spending us million to repair and upgrade coalfired generating plants in illinois to reduce pollutants in mid dynegy hired credit suisse first boston to assist it in finding a buyer for its natural gas transmission businesses the sale of this business came quickly in august  dynegy sold this business to targa resources a company owned by private equity firm warburg pincus in september  dynegy and ls power group agreed to a joint venture in a deal worth us billion under the terms of the agreemnent dynegy gave ls power a  percent stake in dynegy itself while ls power contributed  of its power plants dynegy also agreed to create a  million new class b shares which it turned over to ls power in may  chevrontexaco announced it was selling its  percent stake in dynegy to the public the sale netted chevrontexaco us million by july the joint venture did not last however in august  ls power agreed to buy nine electrical generating plants from dynegy for us billion in cash in order to dissolve the joint venture part of the reason for the joint ventures demise was another collapse in dynegys share price dynegys shares fell  percent in the two years after the deal closed and the company posted a large  million loss in the second quarter of  ls power also agreed to return all its class b shares so that dynegy would only have  million shares of common stock outstanding the dissolution of the joint venture left ls power with a  percent stake in dynegy dynegys move into coalpowered electrical generation was not without controversy in september  new york attorney general andrew cuomo sued dynegy and other utilities arguing that the companies were not properly accounting for the financial risks that pollutants from coalfired generating plants created after a year of negotiations and legal maneuvering dynegy agreed to issue statements to its current and future investors warning that government regulation of carbon emissions and lawsuits over pollution could pose financial risks to the company its move into coalfired electrical generation led the national environmental trust an environmental group to derisively call dynegy the king of coal in  takeover battlesedit on august   the blackstone group announced plans to purchase dynegy for us billion as part of the deal nrg energy would acquire four natural gas plants in california and maine for us billion seneca capital dynegys largest shareholder fought the purchase in a proxy fight dynegy investor carl icahn also promised a proxy battle arguing that blackstone groups offer was too low icahn raised his stake in dynegy to  percent in preparation for the shareholder fight seneca capital nominated former railroad executive e hunter harrison and former energy company executive jeff d hunter for the dynegy board of directors challenging bruce williamson and david biegler a williamson ally a series of maneuvers followed dynegy executives said the offer was a good one as the deal would give dynegy access to lines of credit which would enable it to refinance and restructure its debt with energy prices at cyclical lows the company said it lacked the resources to do so and that its debt burden was destabilizing blackstone group initially said it would not offer more than us per share but then revised its offer later that day to us a share worried that it did not have enough shareholder support to accept the blackstone group offer dynegy proposed postponing its shareholder meeting a few days to november  but postponement did not occur legal counsel advised that delaware law under which dynegy was incorporated considered a postponement a new meeting and that would require notifying shareholders again and giving at least  days notice furthermore dynegys proxy rules did not make it clear that a proxy remained in effect in the event of a postponement which could lead to lawsuits legal counsel also believed that dynegy management would be forced refile resolution with shareholders and resolicit votes which would delay a meeting until early  during the shareholder meeting managements fears proved accurate on november  dynegy was forced to recess its shareholder meeting in an attempt to garner more support for the blackstone bid dynegy was unable to adjourn the meeting because its bylaws did not clearly provide for adjournment to another date and because it was unclear that adjournment could occur without a shareholder vote—a vote the board felt it would lose during the fourday recess dynegy executives said the company would continue to solicit a takeover even if the blackstone group bid failed on november   dynegy management and blackstone agreed to call off the takeover after it became clear there was not enough support for the us a share bid on december   icahn offered a us a share cash bid for dynegy dynegys board asked for other bids but none emerged but icahn too found little support among shareholders he extended his offer by two weeks on january   that same day seneca capital said it would not even entertain a us a share bid dynegys board urged shareholders to accept the icahn bid or risk bankruptcy but by midfebruary even those investors willing to accept the icahn bid had rescinded these offers icahn extended his offer by few days the icahn bid too collapsed on february   bruce williamson resigned as dynegys chairman and announced he would step down as chief executive officer on march  chief financial officer holli c nichols also said she would resign as chief financial officer on march  as well board member thomas w elward was named interim chairman and robert c flexon was appointed interim president and chief executive officer harrison was elected to the board of directors also elected to the board were vincent j intrieri senior managing director of icahn capital and samuel j merksamer an investment analyst for icahn capital  bankruptcyedit the takeover bids all came after one of dynegys largest subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy on november   dynegy holdings the largest of dynegy incs four subsidiaries filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection the bankruptcy was a novel one dynegy had structured itself so that dynegy inc the holding company had little debt nearly all the debt was held by its subsidiary dynegy holdings which also guaranteed debt for the operating divisions dynegy inc created three operating divisions the natural gas group gasco the coal group coalco and a group for all other businesses known as the stub group gasco and coalco were structured so that they would be little affected by any bankruptcy filing by either dynegy inc or dynegy holdings part of the structure meant that few of the natural gascos and coalcos dividends were given to dynegy holdings to separate dynegy holdings from dynegy inc dynegy holdings was transformed from a corporation into a limited liability company llc this legal maneuver took advantage of a delaware supreme court ruling which made it difficult for creditors to sue an llcs board of directors for failing to uphold their fiduciary duty finally gasco and coalco sold themselves to dynegy inc which left dynegy holdings holding us billion in debt but without the ability to seize the assets of gasco and coalco in the event of a default under the structure adopted by dynegy inc the company could meet its debt obligations to dynegy holdings by paying cash or by forgiving debt this provided an incentive for dynegy inc to withhold payment and force dynegy holdings to declare bankruptcy thereby reducing the value of the debt and making it easier to pay off the restructuring plan put dynegys assets which had the worst financial performance into the hands of dynegy holdings the goal was to protect dynegys secured creditors at the expense of its unsecured creditors the plan had already generated one lawsuit in  us bancorp representing bondholders whose investment was secured by leases of two dynegy power plants new newburgh new york the danskammer generating station and the roseton generating station on march   dynegy submitted financial filings with government regulators warning investors that it faced bankruptcy if it could not restructure its debt the company announced a month later that it had hired the restructuring firm lazard and the law firm white  case to advise it on debt restructuring vincent intrieri was named chair of the boards finance and restructuring committee on march   the november  bankruptcy of dynegy holdings ran into difficulty an examiner appointed by the united states bankruptcy court found that the dynegy incs purchase of coalco was fraudulent the examiner found that dynegy holdings was already bankrupt at the time the sale took place and therefore constituted a breach of fiduciary duty by the dynegy holdings board of directors this allowed the dynegy holdings board of directors to sue the dynegy inc board of directors for damages which could run into the billions of dollars this threw the dynegy holdings bankrutpcy filing into doubt and put dynegy inc on the hook for billions in debt the bankruptcy court trustee said she would sue on behalf of dynegy holdings to recover these debts the bankruptcy court examiners finding quickly led to the bankruptcy of dynegy inc itself on april   dynegy inc announced that it had reached an agreement with the us bankruptcy trustee the board of directors of dynegy holdings and its other creditors the agreement which affected us billion in debt gave all creditors  percent of the stock of dynegy inc once it emerged from bankruptcy existing shareholders would get just  percent of the stock in the new company with warrants enabling them to buy up to  of common stock at a set price over the next five years accordingly dynegy inc filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection on july   the bankrutpcy plan filed by dynegy inc also called for a merger with dynegy holdings the bankruptcy filing did not however affect gasco coalco or the stub group and allowed the dynegy holdings bankruptcy to proceed dynegys stock was delisted from the new york stock exchange following the bankruptcy filing us bancorp agreed to drop its lawsuit against the company in exchange for a  million claim against the company in bankruptcy court the bondholders represented by us bancorp would also get a further us million if the danskammer and roseton plants are sold as part of its bankruptcy filing dynegy moved its corporate headquarters in november  the company signed a lease for new principal offices in an office building at  travis street in houston it occupied these quarters early july  dynegy continued to hold leases on several floors of the wells fargo plaza however as part of its bankruptcy filing the bankruptcy court approved a new lease in which dynegy would abandon  square feet  m of space at wells fargo plaza the company asked the court to cancel its lease on the remaining  square feet  m as well dynegy said it hoped to hold a vote on august  at which time its creditors would approve the bankruptcy plan a court hearing on the creditorapproved bankruptcy plan would then be held september  after which the company said it would emerge from bankruptcy protection dynegy inc posted a secondquarter  loss of  billion an increase to  per share from  cents per share a year ago the company blamed among other things markedly lower demand for its electricity much lower prices for its coal and a  million noncash loss caused by the transfer of its coal unit to dynegy holdings the company also said it now hoped to emerge from bankruptcy in september  dynegy agreed to auction off its roseton and danskammer energy plants in new york state in order to emerge from bankruptcy dynegy had signed a saleleaseback agreement in  with public services enterprise group for the roseton and danskammer facilities fifty percent of the proceeds from the auction would be used to pay bondholders up to  million while the remaining  percent would be used to pay unsecured creditors the unsecured creditors would get  million in cash unsecured creditors also would receive  percent of dynegys new stock with the company retaining the rest with warrants to purchase  percent of the stock after five years dynegy also agreed to pay holders of  million in subordinated capital income securities just  million in principal and  million in interest to settle their claims the bankruptcy agreement also settled claims between dynegy holdings and dynegy inc dynegy emerged from bankruptcy on october   and its shares began trading on october  under the dyn symbol postbankruptcyedit on november   the federal energy regulatory commission settled a decadeold lawsuit which alleged that dynegy had manipulated the california energy market while the lawsuit continued dynegy sold its california subsidiary to nrg energy inc nrg energy subsequently agreed to pay  million in refunds to consumers as well as spend more than  million to install  public fastcharging electric vehicle stations and  plugin stations throughout california twenty percent of the stations were required to be in lowincome neighborhoods on january   dynegys chief operating officer kevin howell resigned howell continued as a consultant to the company and agreed to stay on until a successor was named in order to provide an orderly transition on february   dynegys south bay power plant in san diego california was imploded the demolition of the foot  m smokestacks of the outmoded plant was watched by more than  people roseton and danskammer salesedit the sale of the roseton and danskammer plants—a condition of dynegys emergence from bankruptcy—proceeded slowly on november   members of international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew local  struck the roseton and danskammer plants after a contract extension expired and dynegy continued to seek cuts in retirement benefits dynegys bankruptcy also left  million in unpaid property taxes in dutchess county new york this created a budget crisis in the county which threatened to close local schools and create severe cutbacks in county services on december   dynegy announced it would sell the roseton plant to louis dreyfus highbridge energy for  million in cash the sale closed on april   the danskammer plant sale was far more troubled the plant was heavily damaged by hurricane sandy in october  rendering it inoperable on december  dynegy said that ics ny holdings would buy the plant for  million and demolish it but the ics sale stalled under the terms of the auction ics ny had to replace or find a substitute for its credit support agreement and pay its portion of the plants outstanding property taxes but dynegy said the company never did either ics defended itself saying it was making every economically feasible effort to replace the credit agreement on may   dynegy filed suit with the bankruptcy court to force ica to fulfill its obligations the court imposed a july  deadline for ics to close the sale but it did not meet the deadline dynegy subsequently sought another buyer helios power capital a private equity firm agreed to purchase the plant for  million in cash on august  the court approved the sale on september  ameren purchaseedit in midmarch  dynegy purchased three electric generating subsidiaries of ameren an illinois power company the deal worth  million involved amerens ameren energy generating co genco gencos controlling interest in electric energy inc amerenenergy resources generating co and ameren energy marketing co dynegy formed a subsidiary illinois power holdings iph to purchase the ameren subsidiaries no cash changed hands rather iph agreed to assume  million in debt owed by genco and the other subsidiaries ameren also transferred about  million in tax benefits the three subsidiaries would have received in  ameren retained gencos inactive hutsonville and meredosia plants and agreed to buy back from iph for  million three natural gas electrical generating plants dynegy agreed to honor the union collective bargaining agreements in force at all plants under the deal dynegy acquired five coalfired generating plants coffeen in coffeen illinois duck creek in canton illinois ed edwards in bartonville illinois joppa in joppa illinois and newton in newton illinois as the deal worked its way through state and federal regulatory approval dynegy took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced its debt the company obtained  billion in term loan b facilities and  million in revolving credit the company used this income to retire an  million sevenyear line of credit and a  million twoyear line of credit dynegy agreed that the revolving credit line would be paid off and terminate within five years two syndicated loans made up the  billion loan package the  million loan and the  million loan were both due in  this left dynegy with  billion in lines of credit and  million in outstanding bonds the ameren plantsfordebt swap also ran into trouble the federal energy regulatory commission ferc had to approve the deal and ensure that there was no negative impact on consumers from dynegys expanding market share in the midwest but on april  ferc said that the studies submitted by dynegy and ameren were inadequate and it ordered the two firms to rerun the studies and report back to ferc by july  on july  ferc again declined to approve or disapprove the dynegyameren deal the agency said that it dynegys study showed it charging market rates for energy in the midwest but ferc said it worried that transmission bottlenecks in the area would permit dynegy to charge much more furthermore federal regulators were considering an expansion in the market area iph could serve ferc asked dynegy to provide additional information on transmission limitations and market area expansion in august the sierra club formally filed opposition to the dynegyameren deal the environmental group said the transmission bottleneck issue gave dynegy too much market power it also argued that dynegy and ameren had submitted only regional market power data and had not accounted for local impacts which could be very severe another obstacle emerged on june  ameren was required to install pollutionreducing equipment on its five coalfired generating plants in  but because ameren was in financial difficulty it sought and received a waiver from the state of illinois granting it a fiveyear delay ameren sought to transfer this delay to dynegy so that dynegy would not have to immediately install the devices until  either but the illinois pollution control board denied amerens request dynegy filed its own request for a fiveyear waiver in july and warned that the ameren deal would fall apart if it did not receive the waiver but the sierra club the environmental law and policy center and other environmental groups said dynegy had the resources to install the equipment and opposed a waiver acm partners a financial firm hired by the sierra club also argued that dynegy purposefully left iph significantly underfunded and unable to tap into the parent companys resources dynegy disagreed but the firm warned that if iph went bankrupt workers would lose pensions and local communities would have to pay for any environmental remediation the illinois aflcio however supported dynegys request on september  saying that local jobs depended on the waiver the pollution board said it would make a decision by november  foresight energy a major illinois coal mining company said it would install the  million antipollution devices for free if dynegy agreed to sign a longterm contract to accept coal only from foresight energy dynegy declined the offer in part because it already has longterm coal contracts and environmental groups opposed it there was some speculation by financial analysts that the dynegyameren deal was a poor one julien dumoulinsmith executive director of ubs investment research said dynegy is far more likely to shutter all five coalpowered plants rather than add pollution control devices dumoulinsmith pointed out that the united states environmental protection agency epa issued final rules on sulfur dioxide emissions that go into effect in july  because the edwards plant is in an area of low air quality epa is likely to force dynegy to close the plant anyway the remaining four plants are borderline cases with the exception of duck creek station which spent nearly usm on sulfur dioxide removal and may also be forced to close if epa regulations tighten in the future a highly likely possibility he said  acquisitionsedit on august   dynegy announced a deal involving two interdependent transactions to be executed simultaneously dynegy acquired duke’s midwest generation assets and retail business for  billion in cash and the power generating assets of equipower resources for  billion with  billion in cash and  million in stock this increased the companys
