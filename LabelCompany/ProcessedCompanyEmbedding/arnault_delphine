her roles as talent nurturer executive and daughter of one of the most powerful men in fashion by miles socha on april   share this article reddit linkedin whatsapp email print talk view slideshow   view gallery —    photos appeared in special issue wwd collections issue  delphine arnault has been quietly working her way up at lvmh moët hennessy louis vuitton the french luxury group her family controls quietly that is until now this story first appeared in the april   issue of wwd  subscribe today that’s because the eldest child of lvmh kingpin bernard arnault has something to crow about the lvmh young fashion designer prize an initiative she spearheaded that will see one under creator pocket  euros or  “i think it’s interesting to speak when you have something to say” she reasons the contest has galvanized the industry around the challenges of upstart fashion businesses and attracted invaluable attention to the  semifinalists—now narrowed to a dozen contenders—ahead of the big reveal of the ultimate victor on may  the project has also shone a spotlight on a rising power player in the industry—a towering blonde with an infectious smile a warm demeanor and a steely determination to make her mark very much in the mold of her father delphine arnault delights in nurturing the creative sparks that fuel the industry following design ideas through the multiple steps until they reach the sales floor driven like him she can often be spotted on weekends making the rounds of paris department stores and she confesses that she occasionally takes time out of her vacations to meet with young designers “i firmly believe that success lies in the combination of both talent and business savvy and that the magic comes through partnership between both” says arnault who just turned  “it’s important to see both sides the business and the creativity” schooled at the edhec business school in lille and the london school of economics arnault began her career by spending two years at the international management consultancy mckinsey  co joining the family business in  as a development director at the john galliano fashion house presenting a collection of scarves to a reporter back then she revealed her passion for design and a knack for brand management—qualities that define top managers at the group “there’s a marriage between the stoles you find here and the readytowear so everything’s coherent” she said at the time showing off a range spanning small scarf belts to large shawls with fringe arnault moved to dior in  as a commercial director also joining the executive committee of her father’s most treasured luxury property yet her role at the fashion house was more behindthescenes as she learned the ropes of the leather goods business at the elbow of dior chief executive officer sidney toledano she ultimately rose to become dior’s deputy managing director in  and in  orchestrated a vivid accessories line in collaboration with the wellknown contemporary german artist anselm reyle “what’s interesting is to create products and commercialize them” she says last september arnault was named executive vice president at louis vuitton a commanding post that gives her purview over a broad array of businesses not only leather goods but also women’s and men’s rtw plus watches and jewelry as second in command at vuitton arnault is in pole position to help shape the next phase of the powerhouse brand under a new ceo lvmh veteran michael burke and acclaimed designer nicolas ghesquière whom she helped select for the highprofile role after marc jacobs resigned as artistic director of women’s collections to focus on building his signature brand her talent scouting goes further she was instrumental in the recent hiring of leather goods designer darren spaziani for vuitton the majority acquisition of british footwear guru nicholas kirkwood and minority investments in italian designer marco de vincenzo and in rising london fashion star jw anderson who was also handed the design reins at loewe she also has a new personal project her infant daughter elisa with french telecoms pioneer xavier nieldelphine and her brother antoine  who helms berluti and loro piana are the children of bernard arnault’s marriage to his first wife anne dewavrin he also has three sons with his second wife the canadian pianist hélène mercier in a wideranging interview arnault spoke about everything from her strong rapport with designers to her love of competition to the dynamic between her and her famous father wwd there’s been a big focus on reviving heritage brands over the past decade or so do you think it’s time to create some new names delphine arnault i think both are really important at lvmh we have amazing heritage brands and we put interesting talents in those brands sometimes very young like we did at givenchy with riccardo tisci at the time or like we just did with jw anderson at loewe but also talents that are already further along in their careers like raf simons at christian dior or nicolas at vuitton it depends on the personality of the designer there are some who have their own brand like marc jacobs who have also worked for heritage brands then you have designers who prefer not to launch their own brands so it depends how they choose to develop it’s always important to invest in young talents and the talents of tomorrow as the leader of our industry it’s important to nurture young people and to help them grow it’s our responsibility wwd is creativity an essential fuel in the business da in the group we’ve always had a passion for creativity creativity is really at the center of what we do it’s a mix of creativity innovation and savoir faire that creates magical products wwd why do you think the lvmh prize has captured the attention of the industry and what does it say about being an upstart designer da today i find it’s extremely hard to launch one’s brand and that’s also why we are helping these young talents you have to be very brave and very entrepreneurial—you have to dare to create your own brand what’s really amazing about this prize is of course beyond the amount that you receive the year of coaching by professionals that have worked at lvmh for a long time when you’re a young talent and you want to launch your brand you always have tons of questions where should i produce should i launch a second line should i do shoes accessories if you have someone who can coach you and give you advice and help you find the right supplier it’s a big help also i think the composition of the jury karl lagerfeld marc jacobs nicolas ghesquière raf simons phoebe philo riccardo tisci and kenzo’s creative duo humberto leon and carol lim is also extraordinary and completely unprecedented we have the best designers in the world at lvmh so to be able to ask them to elect the young designer of tomorrow is obviously very exciting wwd you’ve been instrumental in a lot of recent design appointments how do you make such choices da i am not the only one who decides i give my opinion but it is my father in collaboration with the brand president who decides for lv for dior we give our opinion but at the end of the day he makes the final choice when you face a creative change at the house you have to start a dialogue and talk with the designer about how he envisions the brand to make sure that you’re on the same page it’s the way the designers talk about the brand and what they see and their emotions how they perceive the house wwd so was nicolas ghesquière the favorite for vuitton da it seemed obvious that he was the right talent and the right person for the job it’s about an exchange it’s about a vision he understood extremely well that vuitton was a brand that was  years old and he had a very clear vision of what he wanted to do it was the same at dior after discussing with raf and sidney toledano and my father the choice seemed obvious also wwd there must be fierce competition to find and secure the best design talents how do you stay on top da i do this because it’s interesting for me competition of course there’s always competition and i like competition but i don’t do that because of competition i do that because new talents are the future wwd you have a big empathy for designers do you feel maternal towards them or more like a coach  da it’s more like a dialogue an exchange of point of view most of the time i learn things i didn’t know when you spend time with karl lagerfeld for example you learn  things you didn’t know his culture is vast i think that what’s interesting is the exchange and the way they see things it’s different than the way i see things because i’m more on the business side i find it very enriching wwd are you more apt to listen to the opinion of a designer or a ceo da it depends on the subject i have a lot to learn from designers i spent  years at dior and i learned a lot from sidney toledano and from my father and now i start this new chapter at vuitton with michael and nicolas and that’s what’s good about life—that you always learn if you know everything it’s the end no wwd do you prefer to avoid the limelight da in the case of the lvmh prize i’m very proud of what we’re doing i was leading that initiative but when i was at dior the people who were talking about the brand were the designers and sidney wwd what do you like to do in your spare time da i take care of my daughter because my family is very important to me i have a passion for modern and contemporary art i spend a lot of time in museums i particularly like the guggenheim moma in new york or lacma and the getty museum in los angeles for example i cannot wait for the louis vuitton foundation to open when i need to relax i love to go to the movies or watch a good tv series i also practice a lot of sport mostly tennis and swimming wwd luxury customers are getting younger and younger what’s the best way to reach them da i think you need to know your clients clients are becoming more and more savvy they know what’s happening in the brands they know the new products that are coming out i try to visit stores because it’s important to meet the teams and to hear the comments of the salespeople at louis vuitton we only sell through our shops so the client experience is really really important it’s fundamental to go in the shops it would be a mistake not to go i often go on saturday it’s a big day with a lot of traffic it’s important to feel what the customer is feeling when he enters the shop wwd what’s your view on the technology explosion da it’s exciting and it has impacted fashion a lot all the shows are immediately on the internet on instagram on twitter it’s huge everything is live now and for fashion it’s very important it’s not that it’s good or bad it’s just like that and it’s not going to change so we have to adapt to it technology gives big access and you get more people who are interested in fashion you can reach many more people now wwd you’ve spent most of your career in leather goods what do you like most about your job da actually when i started at dior i was more in footwear and then sidney taught me a lot about handbags shoes and leather goods they’re fascinating categories and i enjoy the dialogue between creative people industrial people people in the factories and the sales staff in the shops there are so many different people working on the products and this interests me a lot from the first drawing until it arrives in the shop many different people intervene to make an idea become a reality is a process that fascinates me otherwise it stays just an idea wwd what motivates you on the business side is it profits da it’s not the shortterm result it’s what vuitton is going to be in  or  years that motivates me it’s long term wwd it sounds like you share your father’s longrange view on the luxury business da i’ve learned so many things from him he’s taught us a lot my brothers and me i’ve been working in the group since  so  years he’s been an amazing mentor he clearly has a unique vision of our industry and he has shaped it over the past  years it’s really interesting to work with him it’s very reassuring to work with someone who has a vision that’s so clear and unwavering he’s really a visionary in everything that he has done and he’s taught me a lot of things to look at the details but also the big picture he’s put me in different jobs and after succeeding you can move on to the next job you have to prove your success in order to grow he’s also very generous he wants to transmit his knowledge to my brothers and me because i have four brothers as you know wwd what do you see as your next step da i started at vuitton on sept  last year  so i don’t see a next step yet youre missing something subscribe now share this article reddit linkedin whatsapp email print talk load comments blog comments powered by disqus essentialist todays must read

written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by
