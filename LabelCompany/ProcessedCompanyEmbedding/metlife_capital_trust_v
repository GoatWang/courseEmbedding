moodys investors service today confirmed metlife incs metlife nyse met longterm credit ratings senior debt at a and the aa insurance financial strength ifs ratings of metropolitan life insurance company mlic general american life insurance company and metropolitan tower life insurance company collectively called remainco in the same rating action moodys downgraded the ifs ratings of metlife insurance company usa and new england life insurance company to a from aa these two operating companies along with first metlife investors insurance company not rated will separate from metlife and reside under newly formed holding company brighthouse financial inc brighthouse unrated as disclosed in the sec form  statement brighthouse filed today the ifs rating of american life insurance company alico was unaffected by this rating action the outlook for the ratings is stable these actions conclude a review for downgrade of metlifes ratings initiated on january   following metlifes announcement that it intended to pursue the separation and potential disposition through ipo spinoff or sale of a substantial portion of its us retail segment the businesses transferred to brighthouse which totaled about  billion of assets as of december   will contain the majority of metlifes more capital intensive and volatile retail product lines such as variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits and universal life with secondary guarantees the rating agency noted as of december   the new company would represent about  of the operating earnings of metlife and  of the operating earnings of the us retail segment metlife will continue to participate in all of its other segments group voluntary and worksite benefits corporate benefit funding asia latin america and europe the middle east and africa please refer to the complete list of rating actions below ratings rationale metlifes remaining us life businesses the confirmation of the aa ifs ratings of metlifes remaining us life businesses is based on their very strong market positions in the us with excellent brand recognition significant operating scale in group insurance businesses diversified and controlled distribution as well as a substantial capital base although the separation of the majority of metlifes us retail business will reduce the companys overall market footprint the remaining operations will still rank as one of the leading us life operations with top market positions in the us life group insurance market and corporate benefit funding cbf includes gics and other institutional products prospective profitability is also expected to be less constrained than seen historically due to the expected reduced levels of volatility and lower hedging costs as a result of the transfer of the majority of the us retail business to brighthouse these strengths are mitigated to some extent by remaining risk exposures related to managing a book of runoff legacy variable annuities although this block is mostly without guarantees as well as relatively large exposure to highrisk assets including alternative investments additionally earnings and cash flow coverage ratios have historically been below rating level expectations though the metrics have trended higher recently the following factors could lead to an upgrade of the ifs ratings of the operating entities of remainco  high risk assets ratio as a percentage of shareholders equity below  on a statutory accounting basis  naic combined rbc ratio of principal us life insurance subsidiaries consistently above  company action level after adjusting for captive reinsurers  adjusted financial leverage excluding aoci less than  range and  earnings and cash flow coverage above x and x respectively conversely the following factors could lead to a downgrade of the ifs ratings of the operating entities of remainco  securities lending and institutional funding agreementbacked issuances growing disproportionately relative to the consolidated company  naic combined rbc ratio of principal us life insurance subsidiaries falling below  company action level after adjusting for captive reinsurers  adjusted financial leverage excluding aoci above  or  earnings and cash flow coverage below x and x respectively metlife inc commenting on the confirmation moodys said that in addition to its us market leading positions discussed above the company has leading positions in various international insurance markets within latin america and asia although metlife will have a weaker business profile due to a diminished market position in the us retail life and annuity markets and reduced diversity of distribution and earnings this will be more than offset by the companys reduced exposure to higher risk insurance products such as variable annuities with generous living benefit guarantees going forward moodys expects metlife to maintain an adjusted financial leverage ratio excluding aoci of less than  and holding company cash of at least x fixed charges following the separation of the brighthouse subsidiaries naic risk based capital at the operating entities is expected to be greater than  company action level after adjusting for captive reinsurers the a senior debt rating of metlife is three notches lower than the average ifs rating of its principal us and nonus operating subsidiaries which is standard for us holding companies the following factors could lead to an upgrade of metlifes ratings  upgrade of metlifes us subsidiaries or alicos standalone credit profile  adjusted financial leverage excluding aoci less than  range and  earnings and cash flow coverage above x and x times respectively conversely the following factors could lead to a downgrade of metlifes ratings  downgrade of metlifes us subsidiaries or alicos standalone credit profile  adjusted financial leverage excluding aoci above   earnings and cash flow coverage below x and x respectively or  large acquisition in emerging markets whose operations have a significantly lower credit profile brighthouse insurance subsidiaries moodys downgrade of the ratings of the operating subsidiaries that will be part of brighthouse is largely driven by their materially weaker business profile notably this business will contain the majority of metlifes more capital intensive and volatile retail product lines such as variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits and universal life with secondary guarantees the rating agency recognizes the experience and strong track record the management team brings to the new franchise however the company will not have the benefits of being part of the larger metlife organization the new company has a smaller less diversified product set and will exhibit a more volatile credit profile relative to the credit profile of the businesses to be retained by metlife commenting on the strengths moodys said that asset risk is expected to improve relative to the current level of metlife with modest amount of exposure to highrisk assets namely belowinvestment grade securities and alternative investments  of total invested assets at yearend  moodys also noted that the companys capital adequacy as measured by the naic rbc ratio at yearend  was  company action level although the company maintains such a high level of rbc ratio in part to proactively manage the volatility and tail risk associated with the variable annuity block the following factors could lead to an upgrade of the ifs ratings of brighthouse subsidiaries  runrate statutory capital generation in excess of  million  shift in the business mix towards more protectionoriented products eg life insurance and  earnings and cash flow coverage above x and x respectively conversely the following factors could lead to a downgrade of the ifs ratings of brighthouse subsidiaries  organic capital generation diminishes and gaap return on capital less than   earnings and cash flow coverage
