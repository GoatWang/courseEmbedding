financial advisor reviews and ratings average review  from  reviews key phrases annuity product types variable annuityglossary annuityvariable annuity product ratings and reviews simple interest and inflation rating  average   vote both of the reviewers who talk about simple interest have reasonable points however one thing that nationwide does mention with this rider is the potential to beat inflation to support the point of the reviewer who broughtup the whole simple interest issue inflation works on a compound basis crediting a simple level of interest in an attempt to offset the damaging impact of inflation will result in a mismatch unless the inflation level is very high many feel that this is a real possibility the positive impact of the  percent simple interest will stay ahead of any damage caused by inflation anyway the overall point is that inflation compounds while simple interest does not so using simple interest to guard against inflation may not make sense    reads they are all simple interest rating  average   vote why the rant about simple interest these things are all based on simple interest also the benefit is there to serve as a floor in the event that overall stock and bond market performance is lousy and less than  percent the guaranteed minimum is not the only option that can increase the income benefit base over the course of  years it is likely that the minimum  percent guarantee will come into play less often than a market return adjustment to the contract value who wouldnt want to invest with a floor of guaranteed return in this environment the upside is there if things are all rosy in the market but the protection is also there if things dont turnout as well as expected simple interest is sure better than no interest  reads simple interest rating  average   vote the  percent minimum guarantee that is referenced by the other reviewer is simple interest  not compound interest for someone who invests  in this variable annuity the minimum guaranteed increase in the income benefit would be  per year   if this person holds onto the va and does not take any withdrawals for  years the income base would have a guaranteed minimum of  if the benefit were based on compound interest rather than simple interest that same income base would be  a  difference is pretty meaningful now assume that the actual income withdrawal benefit is  percent    percent of the  is  per year  percent of  is   reads  percent lifetime income rider rating  average   vote the living benefit rider that comes with nationwides destination b variable annuity is pretty competitive when compared to similar options from competing companies the lifetime income rider is currently at  percent  pretty interesting return in our current low interest rate world for the person who owns the annuity this means that their income benefit base is guaranteed to increase a minimum of  percent per year for the first  years that they own the contract this would be affected if the owner chooses to start taking withdrawals prior to the end of the first  years this also means that stock markets could go completey haywire like they have been over the past couple of years and the owner would still have the minimum  percent increase to their benefit base if on the other hand markets happen to be great then the income benefit base will increase will reflect contract value and market increase      reads add new comment while efforts are made to keep information on this page accurate and updated the information shown on this page may

review of the nationwide destination b annuity with lifetime income rider  jason wenk get  free chapters of my book “smarter than wall street” click here featured in share this post independent objective review of the nationwide destination b annuity with lifetime income rider thursday april     comments i’m back at this week with another annuity review  this one again was at the request of a blog reader who has yet to purchase but is contemplating the nationwide destination b annuity with lifetime income rider one of my business partners was doing some research this week and found a really interesting fact about variable annuities  in the th quarter of  over  of variable annuities sold had some type of guaranteed income rider  wow talk about market share it comes as no surprise to me now why so many people ask me about various annuities with income guarantees  given the portion of population in our country rapidly reaching their retirement years the stock market being anything but predictable and interest rates at record lows – it’s know wonder so many companies and advisors are marketing retirement income as their goto specialty in the case of this annuity it is no different  someone concerned about the marketeconomyinterest rates who’s getting close to retirement and wants to protect their nest egg was suggested it would be wise to put almost  of their investment assets into the nationwide destination b  the reasoning makes perfect sense and i completely understand the desire to keep a good portion of the nest egg safe as well as future retirement income but now it’s time to test the product and see if the actual results are close to the marketed results here’s the quick facts about the nationwide destination b annuity with lifetime income rider – or linc as it’s referred to this is a variable annuity which means the money invested gets allocated to multiple funds called “subaccounts”  subaccounts look much like mutual funds and most are managed by mutual fund companies  because these funds can go up or down is why the annuity is variable instead of fixed where it cannot go down like most variable annuities destination b has multiple “riders” that can be added on to the base annuity  the two riders most common are for enhanced death benefit and for guaranteed income  in the case of this annuity the lifetime income guarantee was a primary driver of interest to the potential investor  note – i didn’t recommend this – i’m just the guy doing the review the lifetime income rider linc grows an “income base” by  simple interest per year for up to  years or until the account owner turns  years old – whichever happens sooner  so if you started with  after  years there would be an income base worth   it’s important to note that you can never actually take the entire income base at once  rather you can take an income from that amount based on your age when you begin income and whether or not it is on one life or two lives  that table is below linc rider by nationwide to translate this rider into plain english – if you start by investing  at age  and let the money grow for  years at age  you’ll be able to to take  of  – or  per year  that is the worst case scenario you could do better though i highly doubt it – see the video below to learn why if you have a spouse younger than you though it would be very unwise if there’s such a word to opt for single life guarantees  i say this because the cost of this annuity is very high and there is a high probability there wouldn’t be much left when you pass – maybe even nothing at all with that being the case for guaranteed joint life income you’d be looking at  if you and your spouse are the same age a word of caution regarding linc in the fine print it says that the lifetime income linc guaranteed lifetime payout percentage is based on the younger of the two people on the account  so if your spouse is say  when issued and only  when you decide to take income then the guaranteed lifetime income would only be   this is significant as it would drop the  from my example above to just  with spousal continuation fees of the nationwide destination b annuity like many other variable annuities the costs of destination b can be quite high  here’s a rundown directly from their prospectus of the potential fees   nationwide destination b expenses that’s a lot of potential expenses for simplicity sake i reviewed this annuity as it was explained to me from the blog reader who asked for the review  in their case they would have the base charges mortality and expense as well as administrative the lifetime income  option and the average of sub accounts  the average of sub accounts funds is  – though some funds cost as much as  all told this annuity is easily in the  and higher camp with the potential of being over  per year  that is not cheap and greatly impacts performance you can read about these fees and their meanings either in the prospectus or on the nationwide website here destination b with lifetime income rider video review to help illustrate the real return potential of the annuity i broke it down via video  i do this for all my reviews as it is helpful for blog readers to see how i arrive at my return conclusions and be as transparent about it as possible  you can watch that video below   in the video you’ll see me struggling a bit to find a website that helps people see what their life expectancy is  as promised here’s a link to that site so you can see where i was going with that vanguard life expectancy calculator nationwide destination b variable annuity with lifetime income rider conclusions overall i’m finding most variable annuities with income guarantees to be awfully similar  they all sound great but fail to deliver at the rates commonly referred to in their advertising in the case of destination b the guarantee is not even close to the  or  return promises  on most life expectancies it delivers closer to   in order to make a middle single digit return you’d need to live about  years beyond your life expectancy – which is only  probable as a pure long term growth investment the annuity struggles a bit too due to the impact of expenses  in the video you see that pretty clearly as the  year return of the sp  with dividends is about  and the expenses of this annuity are nearly  of that  the  year average for bonds is about  so the expenses take an even bigger portion of assets allocated to income funds all told this annuity is neither much better or much worse than other variable annuities i’ve reviewed  just meh as they say on the web so if you’re looking for guaranteed income for life there are certainly better paying alternatives and if you’re looking for long term growth the same is true what if the market crashes  wouldn’t this be a good alternative this is a common response i get from investors and professionals when i break down annuities  the answer is “yes”  having some type of guarantee is better than none at all  but there are better guarantees out there and there are also plenty of strategies for the “nonguaranteed money” investors might have too  it just takes a lot of research to find them  if you have questions in this regard i’ve got good news for you – i do this type of research all the time and am always happy to share the best in both the guaranteed and nonguaranteed worlds  just use the contact form on the site and i’ll do my best to help you out why am i spending so much time on annuity reviews many blog readers and clients have asked me this lately – so i figured i’d just put it here on the blog in case you were wondering the same  as a fiduciary who is looking out for my clients best interests it’s my resonsibility to make sure i’m constantly vetting out all potential investments to ensure we’re using the best ones  often times i’m asked to take a look at annuities because their advertisements make them sound too good to be true sales agents eager for commission often don’t do the type of analysis i do – perhaps because of their conflict of interest  after all making  to  commission on an annuity can add up pretty fast if you’re selling them hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time so i try to be the voice of reason that looks under the hood reads and understands the  page prospectuses and makes sure my clients only invest in what’s truly best for them  in an effort to help nonclients i started putting this same information on my blog and so far it’s been a huge hit  i get hundreds of emails and many words of thanks from good people all over the us just trying to do their best and letting me know this research is helping them greatly everybody wins i hope you enjoyed this review  as always if you have questions see items that need clarification or if you’re an investment professional and you noticed something i overlooked – just let me know best jason wenk share thisemailtwitterfacebookgooglelinkedin in uncategorized  comments to independent objective review of the nationwide destination b annuity with lifetime income rider ken m november   at  pm jason great review what are the drawbacks if you want to surrender this annuity before the  year simple interest rollup reply jason november   at  pm hi ken you’ll want to look at your contract for the exact terms but generally you’ll pay a surrender penalty between  and  depending on how many years you’ve had the product the longer you’ve had it the lower the penalty you may also have to pay back the “bonus” if your contract had one thanks for writing reply dan january   at  am great analysis thanks reply jason january   at  pm my pleasure dan – thanks for the positive feedback reply john august   at  am i think you forget one thing that is after you and your spouse pass away your children can take remainings that is also accountable is that right  reply jason wenk august   at  pm that’s possible but not very likely unless the annuity older dies well before their normal life expectancy in a nutshell the distributions and fees would likely be more than the earnings so once income is triggered the value would drop pretty quickly this is why for many people there won’t be anything left for children after both spouses pass away thanks for dropping by and adding your commentquestion
