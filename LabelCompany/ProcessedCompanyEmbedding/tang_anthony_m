charleston and jerusalem bibliographic sources acknowledgements index   afterward to the japanese edition by hiroshi mimura translated from japanese by yoko kawai this book is a japanese translation of preserving the world’s great cities the destruction and renewal of the historic metropolis by anthony m tung the original version which was published in  is a large volume of  pages that took me a month to read the book’s theme is highly pertinent to modern society in japan it describes how people across the world strive to preserve the culture of their cities and gives us perspective in regard to our own conservation efforts by the time id finished reading i found the book both grand and beautiful encounter with the author in the autumn of  a fax came to me at the residential environment division department of architecture kyoto university from anthony m tung with whom i was not acquainted mr tung was conducting research on the conservation of architectural culture in historic cities across the world he was coming to kyoto as part of his research and offered to give a talk about preservation in new york about a month later mr tung arrived at kyoto university with his wife janet i described the conservation problems of the city and offered some relevant materials in english he gave us a lecture on how new york protects its landmarks i learned that there were several shared principles with those we use in japan such as providing legal protection for significant individual monuments whole conservation districts and extended historic landscapes it impressed me that even as a center of marketdriven capitalism new york had enacted a strong preservation policy protecting about twenty thousand landmarks several years later in the summer of  a thick parcel was sent to me by mr tung i opened it and began to read there are many scholarly volumes on the preservation of culture and landscape in the worlds historic cities yet this book was uniquely exciting why first in depicting social conflicts between the destruction and preservation of the metropolis the narrative is scripted like a drama the more you read the more you are drawn into its stories second in an effort to serve the general reader the author translates architectural and planning jargon into common words this also helps those of us who are scholars to rediscover issues that have been buried in the complication of academic language with this book readers who have visited a particular city and those who have not can put themselves within the dynamic upheaval of urban growth i also liked the fact that the book is not blinded by a bias toward western theories of architecture and covers conditions in neighborhoods in asian as well as in developing countries deeply wishing that people in japan might have access to this work i started to create a japaneselanguage version by contacting professionals who had been in the front lines of the struggle to save our countrys heritage together we formed a group called stok sekai toshihozen kenkyukai or research group for the preservation of the cities of the world and started the translation in september  members of the research group visited the author at his loft in new york as part of a collaborative process on the books style and structure this volume is not an academic text with references and footnotes neither is it a journal of travels for mere entertainment it is a penetrating book for the thoughtful mind it reveals the ebb and flow of ideas in the changing metropolis—a presentation made possible because the author visited all the cities discussed here inspected their destruction in the field talked with professionals in planning and preservation and carefully studied the documentation gathered in these journeys what is most unique about this book is its style ie it tells the reader a “historical drama” in which destruction and preservation are set in competition important people and groups appear on stage for every period and place they insist upon the legitimacy of obliteration selective destruction or conservation of the old cityscape—are overwhelmed by the conflict or produce significant solutions they are gods emperors popes dictators investors the oppressed travelers architects citizens and mayors the variety of these characters fills the book with excitement the stage for these dramas are eighteen of the most renowned cities in the world all of the scenarios and scenes are based on the author’s meticulous research at the beginning of many chapters mr tung quotes from le citta invisibili written by italo calvino in  a renowned italian author of the twentiethcentury in le citta invisibili calvino writes of imaginary cities by adapting the story of il milione the travels of marco polo in which the italian explorer of the thirteenthcentury describes numerous colorful urban places for the emperor kublai khan to whom polo had become a favored liegeman in the afterward of the japanese version of le citta invisibili the translator ryofu yonekawa remarks “polos imaginary cities seem to us at first to be absurd comedies and mysteries then beneath their surface innocence we see a deeper meaning dark as the ocean and causing us to shudder we wander into an endless city a city without form a cursed city a machine city reminding us of the modern metropolis here fantasies become allegories this reversed utopia ie a story of nonexisting places presents many meaningful ideas in regard to the urban culture of our modern world” mienaitoshi  kawade shobo publishing le citta invisibili seems to be a favorite book of mr tung has he imagined himself as a modernday marco polo gathering stories for the people of new york perhaps for kublai khan i believe he has adopted a technique of symbolic representation from the italian author showing us the underlying allegorical meaning of the contradiction and anxiety intrinsic to our modern attitudes and thinking the cities which mr tung visited are of course not imaginary ones and he describes them realistically yet when readers reach section iii toward the end of the book they will find that the protection of historic architecture and townscapes in our quicklychanging modern world is a matter of moral significance for the author looking through his eyes we perceive the current condition of preservation as but a phase in the evolving history of urban planning ethics and ideology what constitutes destruction what constitutes preservation i realize that we are still at sea and am keenly aware that we will not attain a fruitful vision for the future without first seeking a virtuous ethic for the practice of architecture and the conservation of our cities challenges in conserving cities thanks to worldwide efforts in the midtwentieth century the value of conserving architectural culture and urban heritage has finally started to be recognized however the theories and technology of preservation are still developing how might we respond to critics that assert the usefulness of creation made possible by destruction to whom do cultural properties and urban landscape belong how may we save an urban landscape constituted of many small parts and owned by many different people—some in the private sector some in the public sector who should make such decisions on behalf of society as a technical preservation matter what is the proper approach when regulating permanent structures made of masonry as compared to less durable buildings made of wood how do we evaluate highlyrenovated structures that may be consistent with the form of original buildings but are largely made of new materials how do we reconcile the different way that cultural value is perceived from within a society with how it is admired from without is it possible to define meaningful preservation policy in the midst of wars oppressions and revolutions how do we expand the domain of preservation from individual buildings to large parts of the historic metropolis can the city be a museum of its history can it sustain social progress even in those parts largely composed of antiquated buildings with our myriad differences of opinion how might we all work together the problems are hard and numerous this journey of this book will not only shed light on such challenges to the changing historic cities of the twentyfirst century but also allows us the joy of drawing beneficial lessons from a wellspring of allegories to readers who never been to these places here is an eye with which to see them keenly
