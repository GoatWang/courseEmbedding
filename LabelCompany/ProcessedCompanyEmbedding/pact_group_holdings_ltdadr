to outperform the industry we can call it more efficient only after assessing the role of leverage in generating those returns and its sustainability based on current financial health see our latest

structure by looking at the historic debtequity trend of the company while pact group holdings’s debt to equity ratio currently stands at  investors should assess how it has changed over the past few

equity as in the case of roe roe – more than just a profitability ratio on the surface roe appears to be a simple profitability ratio indicating the return an investor should expect however for a
