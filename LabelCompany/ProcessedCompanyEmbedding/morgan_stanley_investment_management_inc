cases is delaying the purchase of their first home even grandparents have modified life goals choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now rather than leaving a larger legacy later in short paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern but with a little advance planning families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college  the growing cost of education according to the college boards latest “trends in higher education report the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing

child’s education” says marc dextraze executive director morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions it takes a village to raise a child but in 7 it may take an extended family to educate one tweet this share this on linkedin share this on facebook email this one option says dextraze is for parents to start saving early with a  college savings plan  “having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans he says for the child “having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals as opposed to the college that offers the most aid and graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom named after section  of the internal revenue code a  plan is a taxadvantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save or even pay in advance for college expenses earnings in a  plan can be tax deferred and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition fees room and board and supplies many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that making education a family affair motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education grandparents relatives and even family friends have also begun creating  accounts in a child’s name not only do  plans offer potential tax advantages they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt “today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college says jennifer tierney vice president morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions and  plans product manager “its so important to plan ahead for grandparents aunts and uncles family friends it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that  plans provide to a child and from a taxperspective to themselves” related reading wealth management the real costs of not saving for college wealth management when little geniuses have big dreams wealth management how to break the ice around family finances a flexible way to save and invest for college the appeal of  plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility there are no income restrictions no required minimum distributions no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account and high contribution limits virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child grandchild niece nephew spouse even a friend according to chris stack a managing consultant at savingforcollegecom one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the  account as opposed to a utma uniform transfers to minors act or ugma uniform gifts to minors act account or other strategy “with s grandparents or extended family give themselves an option but not an obligation to apply their funds to help pay college costs he says  another significant benefit of  plans is taxfree compounding “earning on an account’s growth rather than paying taxes on the earnings provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality stack says “having the ability to withdraw the principal and taxdeferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible while as soon as the child is born is ideal he said some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future says dextraze “at the end of the day the idea is to harmonize all of your goals taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there including ks s and others it’s using all of the available tools that’s how you reach your goals” morgan stanley offers many
