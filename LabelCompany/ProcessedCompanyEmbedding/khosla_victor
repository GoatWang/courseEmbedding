khosla sees a major opportunity in europe posted on february   by simont global distresseddebt specialist victor khosla is putting about  of his firm’s assets in northern europe why january hedge funds best worst biggest victor khosla became a successful distresseddebt investor by taking advantage of opportunities all over the world in the past four years the greenwich conn–based fund manager has been spending one week a month in europe which tells you something about where he thinks the world’s best opportunities lie “europe is experiencing its first true distresseddebt cycle in  years it is only two quarters out of a recession after having had another crisis in  and the european commercial banks are finally selling their debt” says the creator of the strategic value restructuring fund some large institutions offer their troubled loans directly to his hedge fund rather than going through brokers an advantage gained through khosla’s long experience and extensive contacts he first started investing in europe in  as cohead of the distressed products group at merrill lynch and led a team of  analysts and traders in new york london tokyo and hong kong brad trent for barron’s“we’re in the seventh inning in the us whereas in europe we are only in the third inning” of the distresseddebt cycle says khosla he thinks the opportunity in european banking will last three or four more years since european central bank president mario draghi will be conducting stress tests in  on the top  or so banks which could then be forced to unload more troubled assets us default rates in contrast already have come down sharply “we’re in the seventh inning in the us whereas in europe we are only in the third inning” he says the  billion strategic value restructuring fund’s investments are mostly in northern european countries  with the remainder in the us its european investments include companies in the united kingdom and germany rather than what the firm regards as riskier places such as france italy or the socalled peripherals strong rule of law and bankruptcy codes are prerequisites “when you are working through a restructuring they’re more commercial and receptive to rightsizing a business or closing a plant” he says but it’s more than just being in the right place at the right time khosla says adding “you have to be picky just because you can buy at  cents on the dollar doesn’t mean it’s a good deal” khosla  founded the parent firm strategic value partners in  and serves as chief investment officer for all of its funds which total about  billion in assets and include some privateequity vehicles “i’m a classic firstgeneration immigrant where else would you come on scholarship and end up running a fund” says the native of india although it has posted a roughly  average annual return over the last  years including a  gain in  the strategic value fund has had tough stretches such as in  when it lost  as both its long and short positions lost value in the financial crisis “it didn’t feel so good  was an extraordinary tsunami every time you go through a crisis you learn about your portfolio and risk management” he notes the returns are net of the strategic value fund’s  fee and  profit share in general the fund prefers to invest in senior debt wield some influence in a restructuring then exit within two or three years typically it buys the debt at roughly  cents to  cents on the dollar the strategic value fund’s most recent focus has been on sectors such as airlines packaging and housing as well as specific bankruptcyrelated deals at yearend  some of the fund’s biggest positions included american airlines group ticker aal kloeckner pentaplast and pfleiderer of germany and mccarthy  stone in the uk typically the hedge fund has  positions and its top  account for between  and  of assets last year it made  significant additions to the portfolio american airlines the subject of a positive story in barron’s last week “a new american team goes for the gold” feb  has given the fund a great return the debt of its former parent amr traded at  cents to  cents on the dollar when it filed for bankruptcy strategic value bought the debt at  cents on the dollar both before and after american merged with us airways the debt has since been converted to preferred securities and equity in the new company representing a recovery of about  although it took longer strategic value also cashed in on kloeckner pentaplast a german plastics manufacturer that had previously been owned by privateequity firm blackstone group in june  a group of creditors led by the hedge fund won control of kloeckner after a nasty fight with blackstone “we spent a long time on it and the debt deal was edgy but here was a company that had done  million euros to € million  million to  million of cash flow over five years under blackstone in our first full year we estimate it will break out to € million for  alone we are good in the emergency room it was a classic deal for us” says khosla peter rose a spokesman for blackstone confirmed the transfer of ownership but at presstime couldn’t provide additional details   strategic value restructuring fund picks companyticker business american airlines aal world’s biggest air carrier edison mission us power generator kloeckner pentaplast german plastics and packaging maker solarworldswvk germany broadbased german solar power company pfleiderer german fiberboard maker mccarthy  stone british retirementhome developer pans continental european power companies private source company reports   the hedge fund converted kloeckner’s junior debt into equity and retains  of the firm “all the senior debt we refinanced and was paid out at par we’ve gotten our investment out already” says khosla the company is for sale although he declines to comment mccarthy  stone a british retirementhome developer was taken over by lenders in  the banks ended up selling the debt and in  the strategic value fund became one of the largest holders of debt and equity together with the two other lead creditors it overhauled the board of directors and appointed a new executive chairman aided by the big rebound in housing strategic value sold its debt position purchased for  cents to  cents on the dollar for more than  cents on the dollar while retaining its equity stake khosla says adding “the current business plan seeks to reestablish historically good profit margins which we believe will allow mccarthy to recapture its premium valuation” to other british home builders the fund does have “short” positions though it mostly uses options on indexes and creditdefault swaps on companies it holds its biggest short is in power companies largely in germany where government subsidies for wind and solar projects have hurt natural gas and coalfired systems but strategic value will remain focused on debt opportunities in europe “we are at an inflection point systemic risk is off the table in the medium term and the economy is growing again” says khosla leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment

towers of yale and columbia universities to the maledominated world of wall street today as the founder and ceo of patriarch partners she focuses not only on her more than  portfolio companies but also on ”the main streets” of once thriving towns across america that struggle for survival in the new economy that has turned its back on the american worker under ms tilton’s leadership patriarch’s mission to rebuild america one company at a time and one job at a time has been made possible through tireless work ethic innovative spirit and an unwavering quest for truth and light where others see hopelessness ms tilton’s dedication to the achievement of excellence was fostered at an early age as a teen she was a nationally ranked tennis player practicing nightly to improve her game from am to am when court time was freeofcharge ms tilton later went on to play tennis at yale university where she earned a ba with honors in american studies it was during her junior year at yale that she married her high school sweetheart and lost the father who had been a great inspiration and motivational force in her life adulthood came without much warning as graduation approached ms tilton sought the advice of friends as to which career path to pursue and soon began interviewing at investment banking firms morgan stanley and goldman sachs among others she was the only candidate in her graduating class at yale to be accepted into morgan stanley’s analyst program – an event that would serve as the launching pad to her career in finance ms tilton left morgan stanley in  managing restaurants that she owned while attending columbia business school upon graduation she took a position with goldman sachs’ corporate finance group focusing on ipos and later with merrill lynch at their merchant bank with a focus on leveraged buyouts at  ms tilton was the single mother of year old carly jade working  hours each week after nine years at various investment banking firms ms tilton developed a clear understanding of how to successfully restructure leveraged buyouts gone bad and became fascinated with the investment side of the business this led her to a position at kidder peabody working on distressed debt research and sales and proprietary investments in distressed assets in  with the intent to spend more time with her daughter living in florida she began working from that state while commuting every other week to ny for amroc investments the first firm to specialize in the trading of bank loans and trade claims five years later at the urging of several of her accounts ms tilton left her partnership interests and founded her own bank loan research and broker dealer firm papillion partners which would later be the basis for what is now patriarch partners using her own funds ms tilton founded patriarch partners in  on the investment principle that making money and making the world a better place are not mutually exclusive concepts led by ms tilton’s strength and innovative vision patriarch partners rescues restructures and breathes new life into companies left for dead and piled upon the heap of creative destruction – a business practice for which few others possess the courage and dedication required to succeed over the last  years ms tilton and patriarch partners have committed to debt and equity investments and provided operational and strategic expertise to more than  companies and have saved  american jobs that would have otherwise been lost through liquidations it is ms tilton’s belief that our country’s most valuable asset is human capital – and that job creation is the essential element to a true and sustainable economic recovery and prosperity her commitment to saving and creating jobs motivates her tireless daily leadership of the more than  companies that currently comprise the patriarch portfolio copyright  credit restructuring distressed investing and turnaround group chicago booth  portal  student groups
