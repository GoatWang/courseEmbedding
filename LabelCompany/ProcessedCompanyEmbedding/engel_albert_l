your comment report abusetranscript of engel v vitaleengel v vitaleby megan matula carly sullivanmain arguments of both sidesengel the parents believed that the separation of church and state requires that government stay out of the business of prescribing religious activities of any kind therefore the regents prayer violated the st amendment and should then on organized prayer should be prohibited from schools regents of the state of new york believed they did not establish a religion by providing a prayer for those who chose to participate to say it  and new york acted constitutionally by providing an optional prayer they also thought that it would violate state occurrences if the supreme court to prohibit regents from composing prayer and encourage its recitationsupreme court rulingthe court found the new york regents prayer to be unconstitutional in a  majority opinion the ruling was based upon the wall of separation between church and state chief justice black stated “it is neither sacrilegious nor antireligious to say that each separate government in this country should stay out of the business of writing or sanctioning official prayers…” whosteven engel a concerned parentvwilliam vitale school board presidentwhatnew york state’s board of regents wrote a voluntary nondenominational prayer that could be recited by students at the beginning of each school day during – a group of parents which included steven engel objected to the prayer which read “almighty god we acknowledge our dependence upon thee and we beg thy blessings upon us our parents our teachers and our country” they then sued the school board president william vitalewherewhenthis occurred in hyde park new york in  and went through works cited oral arguments for the case did not start until april  the ruling was released on june howwhyopinion of the courtthis case was brought to the supreme court becausethe prayer which people argued was constitutional on the basis that it was voluntary and promoted the free exercise of religion also protected in the first amendment was upheld by new york’s courts prompting the petitioners to file a successful appeal to the us supreme court engel was supported by the american civil liberties union and briefs were filed on their behalf by the american ethical union and the american jewish committee while the governments of some  states called on the us supreme court to uphold the prayer the supreme courts opinion was that even though the prayer was nondenominational meaning it did not advocate to a certain religion it still is unconstitutional saying the prayer alone means that the state of new york officially approved of this religious occurrence recited the establishment clause to support their opinion means the government can not prohibit or advocate any religious doings landmark caseengel v vitale was first of many cases the supreme court used the establishment clause to eliminate any sort of religious activities relating to the public or government related to the supreme court using a broader view of using the establishment clausecould relate to issues such as providing federal funds to private religious affiliated schoolsset a precedent for future cases regarding organized prayer in government building or public placejudicial terminologyafter state court ruling petitioners parents requested a writ of certiorari about the order from the lower state courts which allowed respondents authority to use prayer in the public schools unless a students parents refused permission supreme court justices accepted the writ and put the case on the docket for a supreme court hearing prior to the preceding of the case in supreme court there was a conference discussing any prior facts of the case many amicus curiae briefs were submitted by religious groups on behalf of engel and many were sent in by attorey generals of states on behalf of vitale in order to sway justices opinions in support or opposition of engel the opinion of the court was a  ruling against engel stating that prayer preceding the school day violates the first amendment in contrast to the majority opinion the minority opinion or otherwise known as the dissenting opinion states that prayer before school does not clearly establish religion there for it does not clearly violate the first amendment engel v vitale engel
