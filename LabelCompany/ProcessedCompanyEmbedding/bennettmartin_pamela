in particular i enjoy all types of music favorite way to spend time away from work boating dancing needlepointing favorite movie or tv show too many to list type of cell phone she owns iphone what energizes hergetting a good solution to an issue great conversations with people how did you wind up working in the insurance industry graduated with a teaching degree no jobs available asked my father if i could work him until a teaching job became available that was  years ago what is the best career advice you ever received service your customers better than you would expect to be never forget to ask if there is anything else we can help you with today what do you like best about the work you do helping people get the most coverage for their risk at the best price possible what advice would you give to someone who wants to have a career similar to yours enjoy people and be comfortable multitasking you put on a different hat with every conversation that takes place problem solving is a big part of your responsibility so you have to enjoy that describe a gratifying experience with a client or a fellow staff member working with a new business owner determining their exposures and the type of coverage that best fits their needs and then advising them as they grow with their business i have many opportunities to do this and it is rewarding for me and i believe for them i have become a true partner with them what do you wish more people understood about insurance there is not an insurance policy that insures everything your agent should be a trusted adviser just
