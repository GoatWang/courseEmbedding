japan and the rest of world other than asia pursuant to the terms of the pd license agreement the celgene parties will make upfront payments to the company of  million the company may also receive up to  million in potential development regulatory and sales milestone payments and tiered royalties based on percentages of annual net sales depending on specified terms in the low double digit to midtwenties with customary reductions in specified circumstances royalties are payable on a licensed productbyproduct and countrybycountry basis until the latest of the expiration of the last valid

collaboration with beigene ltd to advance pd inhibitor program for solid tumor cancers jul   celgene corporation and beigene ltd entered into a strategic collaboration to develop and commercialize beigene’s investigational antiprogrammed cell death protein  pd inhibitor bgba for patients with solid tumor cancers in the united states europe japan and rest of world outside asia beigene will retain exclusive rights for the development and commercialization of bgba for hematological malignancies globally and for solid tumors in asia with the exception of japan beigene will acquire celgene’s commercial operations in china and gain an exclusive license to commercialize celgene’s approved therapies in china – abraxane® revlimid® and vidaza® bgba is an advanced clinicalstage investigational pd inhibitor which has been dosed in over  patients initial clinical data suggest that bgba is well tolerated and exhibits antitumor activity across a range of solid tumor types bgba has high affinity and specificity for pd and may be differentiated from the currently approved pd antibodies through an engineered fc region potentially minimizing interactions with other immune cells that may exert a negative impact on effector tcell function bgba is being developed as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of solid tumor cancers it is currently in two pivotal trials in china and global pivotal studies of bgba are planned for initiation in  celgene and beigene will collaborate in the global development of bgba in addition beigene retains the right to develop bgba in hematology and in combination with its other portfolio compounds beigene will acquire celgene’s operations in china beigene will also license and assume commercial responsibility for celgene’s approved therapies in china consisting of abraxane® paclitaxel proteinbound particles for injectable suspension albuminbound revlimid® lenalidomide and vidaza® azacitidine in addition beigene is granted licensing rights in china to cc under the same terms and conditions as the approved commercial products cc is a celmod currently in development by celgene for lymphoma

clinical trial in china of bgba an investigational antipd antibody in patients with urothelial cancer uc more commonly known as bladder cancer the trial will evaluate bgba in chinese patients with previously treated pdlpositive locally advanced or metastatic uc bgba is also being evaluated in a pivotal trial in china in patients with relapsed or refractory classical hodgkin lymphoma the phase ii singlearm multicenter trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of bgba in patients with previously treated pdlpositive locally advanced or metastatic uc the trial’s primary endpoint is the overall response rate orr according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version  recist v as assessed by independent review secondary endpoints include orr as assessed by investigators duration of response disease control rate progressionfree survival overall survival safety and tolerability professor dingwei ye of the fudan university shanghai cancer center is the lead principal investigator of the trial bgba is an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of immunooncology agents known as immune checkpoint inhibitors it is designed to bind to pd a cell surface receptor that plays an important role in downregulating the immune system by preventing the activation of tcells bgba has high affinity and specificity for pd and we believe it is differentiated from the currently approved pd antibodies as the ability to bind to fc gamma receptors has been specifically engineered out bgba is being developed as a monotherapy and in
