kelley t kelley d     abstract most people are born creative but over time a lot of us learn to stifle those impulses we become warier of judgment more cautious more analytical the world seems to divide into creatives and noncreatives and too many people resign themselves to the latter category and yet we know that creativity is essential to success in any discipline or industry the good news according to authors tom kelley and david kelley of ideo is that we all can rediscover our creative confidence the trick is to overcome the four big fears that hold most of us back fear of the messy unknown fear of judgment fear of the first step and fear of losing control the authors use an approach based on the work of psychologist albert bandura in helping patients get over their snake phobias you break challenges down into small steps and then build confidence by succeeding on one after another creativity is something you practice say the authors not just a talent you are born with view
