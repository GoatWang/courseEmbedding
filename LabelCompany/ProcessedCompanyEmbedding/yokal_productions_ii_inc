first brand from yokal productions ii inc yokal sports is a service for high school and college sports fans  our goal is to provide the most comprehensive combination of school  local sports highlights and statistics while executing in multiple designated marketing areas dmas problem local school sports are extremely difficult for traditional media companies to cover the reasons being it costs a company more money to cover a game than they can earn from their current cpm based advertising models  most local media companies have legacy assets and business models that are not transitioning to app based video platforms and  can only cover in markets where they operateby using current technologies an innovative revenue model yokal sports will cover school sports in multiple markets and become a low cost local video service for existing technology platforms and the app based television future solution we are taking advantage of the below changes to accomplish something that the existing companies can not do technology – using contemporary technology we can cover sports in an innovative way that is not based on the past low costs – will operate at lower cost per market than any current television newspaper or existing digital company scale – will eventually cover more dmas than any existing company  customers – focused on creating enterprise and consumer customers strong demand with consistent audience – parents students and school fans have a strong passion for this content large market – very large market that is ripe for disruption  verticals – company focuses exclusively on sports vertical in the beginningadditionally our company is the first one that has ever tried covering school sports with the current technology and revenue model  student reporters will send us video in addition to having a budget for paid reporters in multiple markets   by not focused on selling advertising but creating both enterprise and consumer customers    achievement  traction yokal sports significant milestones include generated revenue through one enterprise customer  have  initial enterprise customers who have signaled an interest in video highlights  produced over  different highlight packages  currently have operated in  designated marketing areas los angeles ca twin cities mn and north new jerseynext  month milestones are increase per week  per month games that we cover and produce highlights for increase the number of dmas we operate in – goal is to be at a minimum of  and hopefully more increase the enterprise customers and monthly revenues launch our direct to consumer app on apple tv and other open platforms market the number of participants in high school sports increased for the th consecutive year in  for a total of almost  million according to the annual high school athletics participation survey therefore there are roughly  million students with  million parents for a total of  million initial peoplesecondary market includes alumni of schools and general local sports fans who care about the schools in the markets where you live   competition every initial market has at least one newspaper multiple television stations regional sports networks digital offerings such as blogs and mobile applications additionally there are national sports brands like espn yahoo sports fox sports bleacher report sb nation and multiple sports blogs  business model yokal sports will take advantage of three revenue models we believe the best way to start is to create enterprise customers enterprise customers  our enterprise video solutions are for local media brands and technology platforms each of these companies need low cost local video that they will make money from our videos will help them become more local and give video packages that can provide revenue growth we currently have  enterprise customer and are in active discussions with    other companies we have a list of over  potential enterprise customers that we will eventually talk with facebook snapchat sb nation la times orange county register cbs tv stations gannet nj advanced media  consumer customers  once we are operating in  dmas yokal productions will introduce direct to consumer options that will allow for people to become yokals our goal will be to have a net net of  per month per yokal   we will offer a comprehensive and unique package for local sports fans athletes and parents marketing solutions  after reaching  dmas we will approach fortune  companies about our marketing solution packages the packages will be designed to use school sports to make these companies seem active and positive in the communities we are operating in our marketing solutions will be designed for fortune  companies who want more than just preroll video advertisement bumpers  these solutions will be designed to reach moms dads and athletes and focused on large companies who want to use the passion of sports to make a connection eventually we will also add a selfservice option for local business who will sponsor the individual school teams team christopher pappas  founder  ceoeric stormoen  cofounder  general managerhoward
