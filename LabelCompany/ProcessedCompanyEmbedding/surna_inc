certain states have legalized medical and recreational cannabis companies and individuals involved in the sector are still at risk of being prosecuted by federal authorities further the landscape in the cannabis industry changes rapidly  what was the law last week is not the law today and what is the law today may not be the law next week  this means that at any time the city county or state where cannabis is permitted can change the current laws andor the federal government can supersede those laws and take prosecutorial action given the uncertain legal nature of the cannabis industry it is imperative that investors understand that the cannabis industry is a highrisk investment a change in the current laws or enforcement policy can negatively affect the status and operation of our

services demand is based onshare onfacebooktwitterin its latest released report surna inc otcmktssrna had indicated that regulatory changes are main pointer for new facility construction the demand for its services and products is mainly dependent on the new construction of cannabis grow facilities in canada and the us recent and projected regulatory changes comprising recreational andor medicinal cannabis use in different jurisdictions like california tends to be a major indicator for getting approvals for new facility construction for  the company focus is on new facility setup in california where recreational cannabis utilization was approved in  and in canada where federal decriminalization legislation has been launched and recreational cannabis use seems to be gaining support the highlights while surna usual project sales deal is noncancellable there are many threats that the company may not realize the full deal value on time or at all closure of a sales deal is grounded upon customers’ ability to obtain license and establish their growing facility and take equipment possession in order to resolve these risks the company can have three major milestones built into contracts first the company present consumer with engineering plans for which they need an upfront deposit before they commence their services in many instances the engineering stage is done as part of the building permit procedure or license application represents on average almost  of the total deal value and takes around  to  weeks to complete previously surna needed a larger preliminary deposit that covered initial equipment and engineering items however starting in early  they started offering their consumers a lower preliminary deposit for engineering only the company’s plan is to lock in the sales deal and start the engineering part of the project earlier which is vital for many reasons they can help their consumers with their design and engineering plans as part of licensing application procedure also surna is better positioned to lock in its technology for the assignment at an earlier stage it is also able to help minimize the consumer’s time to market trendingadvertise

statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” for interim financial information and with the instructions to form q and rule  of regulation sx pursuant to these rules and regulations certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap have been condensed or omitted gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the opinion of management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring items considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included operating results for the three months ended march   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending december   the balance sheet as of december   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by gaap for complete financial statements for further information refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the annual report on form k for the year ended december   the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are presented on a continuing basis unless otherwise noted   basis of presentation   the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern the company has experienced recurring losses since its inception the company incurred a net loss of approximately  for the three months ended march   and had an accumulated deficit of approximately  as of march   since inception the company has financed its activities principally through debt and equity financing management expects to incur additional losses and cash outflows in the foreseeable future in connection with its operating activities   the company’s consolidated financial statements have been presented on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business   the company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other similar stage companies including dependence on key individuals successful development marketing and branding of products uncertainty of product development and generation of revenues dependence on outside sources of financing risks associated with research development dependence on thirdparty suppliers and collaborators protection of intellectual property and competition with larger bettercapitalized companies ultimately the attainment of profitable operations is dependent on future events including obtaining adequate financing to fund its operations

of  through the issuance of shares of its common stock see note  and raised  in a private placement of the company’s common stock and attached warrants to accredited investors see note    f          the company will need to raise debt and equity financing in the future in order to continue its operations however there can be no assurance that such financing will be available in sufficient amounts and on acceptable terms when and if needed or at all if results of operations for  do not meet management’s expectations or additional capital is not available management believes the company has the ability to reduce certain expenditures the precise amount and timing of the funding needs cannot be determined accurately at this time and will depend on a number of factors including market demand for the company’s products and services the success of product development efforts the management of working capital and the continuation of normal payment terms and conditions for purchase of goods and services the company is uncertain whether its cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund its operations for the next twelve months if the company is unable to substantially increase revenues reduce expenditures or otherwise generate cash flows from operations then the company will need to raise additional funding to continue as a going concern from investors or through other avenues   basis of consolidation and reclassifications   the condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its controlled and whollyowned subsidiary intercompany transactions profits and balances are eliminated in consolidation   certain reclassifications have been made to amounts in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation all reclassifications have been applied consistently to the periods presented the reclassifications had no impact on net loss or total assets and liabilities   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates in addition any change in these estimates or their related assumptions could have an adverse effect on the company’s operating results key estimates include valuation of derivative liabilities valuation of intangible assets and valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities   recent accounting pronouncements   in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” no  clarifying the definition of a business “asu ” the standard clarifies the definition of a business by adding guidance to assist entities in evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses asu  is effective for fiscal years beginning after

of operations   the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form q which include additional information about our accounting policies practices and the transactions underlying our financial results as well as with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   as filed with the sec in addition to our historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial information the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this form q particularly in part ii item a “risk factors”   overview   we develop design and distribute cultivation technologies for controlled environment agriculture “cea” our customers include stateregulated cannabis cultivation facilities as well as traditional indoor agricultural facilities including organic herb and vegetable producers our technologies include a comprehensive line of optimized lighting environmental control air sanitation and cultivation facilities these technologies are designed to meet the specific environmental conditions required for cea and reduce energy and water consumption in addition surna offers mechanical design services specific to hydronic cooling including mechanical equipment and piping design   our standard cea project consists of small chillers fancoils and dehumidifiers the major equipment items which we manufacture other required equipment items typically consist of large chillers pumps air separators and expansion tanks which we purchase from outside vendors we believe our core competency is to provide integration services for these equipment items delivering a fully engineered turnkey singlesource solution to our customers   this integrated singlesourced solution can create gross profit margin fluctuations depending on project design and the mix between our proprietary equipment which typically generates a higher gross profit margin and the equipment manufactured by outside vendors further quarterly fluctuations in gross profit margins can occur based on the timing of a project’s needs for our manufactured equipment versus third party manufactured equipment   the demand for our integrated solution including engineering design proprietary equipment and third party manufactured equipment is primarily based on the new construction of cannabis cultivation facilities in the us and canada   recent and anticipated regulatory changes involving medicinal andor recreational cannabis use in various jurisdictions such as california tends to be a leading indicator for the granting of licenses for new facility construction   for  we are focused on new facility construction in california where recreational cannabis use was approved in november  and in canada where federal legalization legislation has been introduced and recreational cannabis use appears to be gaining support   our marketing efforts are generally targeted to those persons who are actively seeking licenses to produce cannabis and in many cases our engineering services are needed for the completion of license applications as such the projects we quote may not advance to the contract stage due to either a failure of our prospect to receive licensure or to obtain project financing in other cases the successful licensee was either unknown to us at the time of application or elected to use a competing technology – rooftop duct system or traditional split air conditioning system – as opposed to our ductless hydronic system        while our typical project sales contract is noncancellable there are risks that we may not realize the full contract value in a timely manner or at all completion of a sales contract is dependent upon our customers’ ability to secure license and build their growing facility and take possession of the equipment in order to address these risks we have three key milestones built into our contracts   ● first we provide our customer with engineering plans for which we require an upfront deposit before we begin our services in many cases the engineering phase is done as part of the license application or building permit process represents on average approximately  of the total contract value and takes approximately four to six weeks to complete we previously required a larger initial deposit that covered engineering and initial equipment items however beginning in early we began offering our customers a lower initial deposit for engineering only our strategy is to lock in the sales contract and commence the engineering portion of the project earlier which is important for a number of reasons i we can assist our customers with their engineering and design plans as part of their licensing application process ii we are better positioned to lock in our technology for the project at an earlier stage and iii we are able to help reduce the customer’s time to market   ● second upon completion of the engineering phase it may take our customer on average five months to complete the facility buildout with possible delays due to financing or other aspects which are beyond our control customer delays in obtaining financing and completing facility buildout make the timing of completion of our sales contract unpredictable for our protection before we begin manufacturing our proprietary equipment items we require an upfront deposit   ● and third the last phase of our contract involves procurement and dropship delivery of third party manufactured equipment items which we undertake only upon payment of the third and final deposit   as of march   we have executed sales contracts with a total unearned contract value of approximately  “q  backlog” of which approximately  was attributed to sales contracts entered into in the three months ended march   and the remaining  attributed to prior quarters about  of the q  backlog is attributed to projects for which we have not received a further deposit on our proprietary equipment and as a result there are potential risks of project cancellation or delays further a substantial portion of our q  backlog is not expected to be recognized as revenue until the second half of    in an effort to continue the bookings trend we are implementing a new crm system to better manage an everincreasing number of inbound request for quotes have added new sales personnel including a sales coordinator to assist the outside sales team and have assigned sales territories to allow the sales personnel to focus on individual regional needs and to get more personally involved in their markets we also recently developed a sales quotation tool reducing the time it takes to prepare detailed system proposals from an average of four hours to about fifteen minutes we anticipate this tool will shorten the learning curve of our new sales personnel we also hope to realize the benefits of a preferred pricing program recently received from one of our major equipment suppliers who awarded the company national account status as new jurisdictions continue to ease regulation of cannabis and larger scale projects become more prevalent as the market matures and investment capital becomes more readily available we believe the company is well positioned to address the new challenges and opportunities the market presents   nonetheless the everchanging nature of our sales and the needs of our customers make it difficult for us to predict when we will recognize revenue we continue to remain focused on increasing our sales contract backlog and quoting larger projects in an effort to increase revenue   recent developments   in april we entered into a sales contract with a customer with a contract value of approximately  for which we have not completed the engineering phase accordingly this contract carries the potential risk of noncompletion due to the early stage of this project   on may   we entered into a threeyear consulting agreement with mr keen one of our principal shareholders and a former officer and director under the consulting agreement mr keen will provide certain consulting services to the company including research and development new product design and innovations existing product enhancements and improvements and other technology advancements with respect to the company’s business and products in exchange for an annual consulting fee of  per year the consulting agreement also includes certain activity restrictions which prohibit mr keen from competing with the company in connection with the execution of this consulting agreement mr keen resigned as a director of the company on may   mr keen’s employment with the company ceased as of april     on may   we entered into a threeyear equipment demonstration and product testing agreement with sterling an entity controlled by mr keen which operates a colorado regulated cannabis cultivation facility under this agreement the company has agreed to provide to sterling certain lighting environmental control and air sanitation equipment for use at the sterling facility in exchange for a quarterly fee of  also under this agreement sterling has agreed to allow the company and its existing and prospective customers to have access to the sterling facility for demonstration tours in a working environment which the company believes will assist it in the sale of

  critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates   this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states certain accounting policies are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside of our control as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty in applying these policies management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates those estimates are based on our historical operations our future business plans and projected financial results the terms of existing contracts observance of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate for information regarding our critical accounting policies as well as recent accounting pronouncements see note  to the consolidated financial statements   results of operations   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this form q   comparison of the three months ended march   and    revenues and cost of goods sold   revenue for the three months ended march   was approximately  compared to  for the three months ended march   a decline of  or  as described in “overview” above the resulting decline in revenue is primarily due to the restructuring of our policies to secure sales contracts at an earlier stage which further increases our backlog the decline in revenue was primarily due to i the restructuring of our policies to secure sales contracts at an earlier stage which was not in place in q  and ii the heightened uncertainty of the cannabis industry following the recent us presidential election   cost of revenue decreased by  from  for three months ended march   to approximately  for the three months ended march   the gross margin decreased by seventeen percentage points from  for three months ended march   to  for the three months ended march   our cost of revenue cost structure is comprised of both a fixed and variable component the fixed cost component represents engineering manufacturing and project management salaries and benefits which totaled approximately  or  of total revenue for the three months ended march   as compared to  or  of total revenue for three months ended march   the decline of approximately  is due to a decrease in our manufacturing headcount in  however the increase in fixed costs as a percentage of revenue was the result of a  decline in revenue in the three months ended march   compared to the three months ended march   the variable cost component represents our cost of equipment outside engineering costs shipping and handling travel and warranty costs which total approximately  or  or total revenue in the three months ended march   as compared to  or  of total revenue in the three months ended march   we continue to attempt to reduce our variable costs through more competitive prices from our vendors and reduced warranty expenditures   operating expenses increased by  from  for three months ended march   to approximately  for three months ended march   for the three months ended march   we incurred  in noncash compensatory expenses compared to noncash compensatory expenses of  for the three months ended march     the most significant component of our increased operating expenses in the three months ended march   were selling general and administrative expenses “sga expenses” sga expenses increased by  or  from  for the three months ended march   to  for three months ended march   the increase in sga expenses for the three months ended march   is due primarily to the following i increased personnelrelated costs of approximately  including a noncash stockbased retention bonus paid to our new chairman of our board of approximately  which was calculated using the fair market value of the common stock on the date the stockbased retention bonus was ratified by the board of directors ii increased travel cost of approximately  and iii increased investor and public relations costs of approximately  these increases were offset by decreases in the following i our sga expenses related to outside sales commissions decreased by approximately  and ii our provision for bad debt for three months ended march   was zero compared to the march   provision of approximately         other expenses decreased by  from  for three months ended march   to approximately  for three months ended march   this was the result of a decrease in interest expense and the amortization of debt discount on convertible promissory notes related to the conversion of certain convertible promissory notes converted in fourth quarter of  and the first quarter of    overall we realized a net loss of approximately  for three months ended march   as compared to a net loss of approximately  for three months ended march   an increase of  or    liquidity and capital resources   the following summarizes our cash flows       for the three months ended       march                cash used in provided by operating activities

we incurred net losses for the three months ended march   and  and have an accumulated deficit of approximately  as of march   we had working capital current assets in excess of current liabilities of approximately  as of march   as compared to a working capital deficit of approximately  as of december   this change in working capital is primarily related to the  we raised in a private placement of our common stock and attached warrants during the three months ended march   we have not been able to generate sufficient cash from operating activities to fund our ongoing operations since our inception we have raised capital through private sales of common stock and debt securities our future success is dependent upon our ability to achieve profitable operations and generate cash from operating activities there is no guarantee that we will be able to generate enough revenue andor raise sufficient capital to support our operations as of march   and december   we had a cash balance of approximately  and  respectively   we will need to raise debt andor equity financing in the second half of  in order to continue our operations unless we are able to reduce our operating expenses there can be no assurance however that we will be able to raise such financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms or at all if we determine that our revenue and operating results as we move into the second half of  are not satisfactory we intend to explore various operating cost reductions even if we are able to reduce operating costs we will still need to seek additional debt andor equity financing the precise amount and timing of the funding needs cannot be determined accurately at this time and will depend on a number of factors including the market demand for our products and services the timing of our receipt of deposits from our customers under our sales contracts our management of working capital and the continuation of normal payment terms and conditions for purchase of goods and services   cash requirements   management has determined our march   cash balance of approximately  will not be sufficient to fund our operations over the next twelve months based on management’s estimate for our operational cash requirements and without modifications to our existing payment obligations which include among other things the upcoming payments for promissory notes in the principal amount of  which were issued in february  and mature in november  we will require additional capital to be raised in the second half of    if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations make adjustments to our payment arrangements or raise sufficient additional capital through future debt and equity financings or strategic and collaborative ventures with potential partners we will likely have to reduce the size and scope of our operations our officers and shareholders have not made any written or oral agreement to provide us additional financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to raise capital on terms and conditions that are deemed acceptable to us or at all        operating activities   cash used in operations for the three months ended march   was approximately  compared to cash provided by operations of approximately  for the three months ended march   during the three months ended march   significant noncash expenses included i compensation for services paid in stock of approximately  and ii loss on extinguishment of debt of  however these noncash expenses were offset by i a reduction in our accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately  and ii a reduction in deferred revenue of    investing activities   cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended march   was approximately  compared to cash provided by investing activities of approximately  for the three months ended march   we received payments of  and  on a note receivable for the three months ended

not and will not have a material effect on our operations in the immediate future management will continue to monitor inflation and evaluate the possible future effects of inflation on our business and operations   contractual payment obligations   as of march   our contractual payment obligations consisted of promissory notes of  due in november  and an office lease for a day period ending on

of optimized lighting environmental control and air sanitation systems for stateregulated cannabis cultivation facilities as well as traditional indoor agricultural facilities “surna” or the “company” otcqb srna announced today operating and financial results for the three months ended march   the company will not be hosting a conference call following the release of its financial results   results of operations   revenue for the three months ended march   was approximately  compared to  for the three months ended march   a decline of  or  the decline in revenue was primarily due to i the restructuring of our policies to secure sales contracts at an earlier stage which was not in place in q  and ii the heightened uncertainty of the cannabis industry following the recent us presidential election   cost of revenue decreased by  from  for the three months ended march   to approximately  for the three months ended march   the gross margin decreased by seventeen percentage points from  for the three months ended march   to  for the three months ended march   the fixed cost component represents engineering manufacturing and project management salaries and benefits which totaled approximately  or  of total revenue for the three months ended march   as compared to  or  of total revenue for three months ended march   the variable cost component represents our cost of equipment outside engineering costs shipping and handling travel and warranty costs which total approximately  or  or total revenue in the three months ended march   as compared to  or  of total revenue in the three months ended march     our standard controlled environment agriculture project consists of small chillers fancoils and dehumidifiers the major equipment items which we manufacture other required equipment items typically consist of large chillers pumps air separators and expansion tanks which we purchase from outside vendors we believe our core competency is to provide integration services for these equipment items delivering a fully engineered turnkey singlesource solution to our customers   this integrated solution can create gross profit margin fluctuations depending on project design and the mix between our proprietary equipment which typically generates a higher gross profit margin and the equipment manufactured by outside vendors which has a lower gross profit margin further quarterly fluctuations in gross profit margins can occur based on the timing of a project’s needs for our manufactured equipment versus third party manufactured equipment   operating expenses increased by  from  for the three months ended march   to approximately  for the three months ended march   for the three months ended march   we incurred  in noncash compensatory expenses compared to noncash compensatory expenses of  for the three months ended march     the most significant component of our increased operating expenses in the three months ended march   were selling general and administrative expenses “sga expenses” sga expenses increased by  or  from  for the three months ended march   to  for three months ended march   the increase in sga expenses for the three months ended march   is due primarily to the following i increased personnelrelated costs of approximately  including a noncash stockbased retention bonus paid to our new chairman of our board of approximately  ii increased travel cost of approximately  and iii increased investor and public relations costs of approximately  these increases were offset by decreases in the following i our sga expenses related to outside sales commissions which decreased by approximately  and ii our provision for bad debt for the three months ended march   which was zero compared to the march   provision of approximately    overall we realized a net loss of approximately  for three months ended march   as compared to a net loss of approximately  for three months ended march   an increase  or                regulatory changes are leading indicator for new facility construction   the demand for our products and services is primarily based on the new construction of cannabis cultivation facilities in the us and canada   recent and anticipated regulatory changes involving medicinal andor recreational cannabis use in various jurisdictions such as california tends to be a leading indicator for the granting of licenses for new facility construction   for  we are focused on new facility construction in california where recreational cannabis use was approved in november  and in canada where federal legalization legislation has been introduced and recreational cannabis use appears to be gaining support   contract milestones and revenue model   while our typical project sales contract is noncancellable there are risks that we may not realize the full contract value in a timely manner or at all completion of a sales contract is dependent upon our customers’ ability to secure license and build their growing facility and take possession of the equipment   in order to address these risks we have three key milestones built into our contracts     ●   first we provide our customer with engineering plans for which we require an upfront deposit before we begin our services in many cases the engineering phase is done as part of the license application or building permit process represents on average approximately  of the total contract value and takes approximately four to six weeks to complete we previously required a larger initial deposit that covered engineering and initial equipment items however beginning in early  we began offering our customers a lower initial deposit for engineering only our strategy is to lock in the sales contract and commence the engineering portion of the project earlier which is important for a number of reasons i we can assist our customers with their engineering and design plans as part of their licensing application process ii we are better positioned to lock in our technology for the project at an earlier stage and iii we are able to help reduce the customer’s time to market         ● second upon completion of the engineering phase it may take our customer on average five months to complete the facility buildout with possible delays due to financing or other aspects which are beyond our control customer delays in obtaining financing and completing facility buildout make the timing of completion of our sales contract unpredictable for our protection before we begin manufacturing our proprietary equipment items we require an upfront deposit         ● and third the last phase of our contract involves procurement and dropship delivery of third party manufactured equipment items which we undertake only upon payment of the third and final deposit   sales contract backlog   as of march   we had executed project sales contracts with a total unearned contract value of approximately  “q  backlog” of which approximately  was attributed to sales contracts entered into in the three months ended march   and the remaining  attributed to prior quarters   about  of the q  backlog is attributed to projects for which we have not received a further deposit on our proprietary equipment and as a result there are potential risks of project cancellation or delays further a substantial portion of our q  backlog is not expected to be recognized as revenue until the second half of    in april we entered into a sales contract with a customer with a contract value of approximately  for which we have not completed the engineering phase accordingly this contract carries the potential risk of noncompletion due to the early stage of this project   we continue to remain focused on increasing our sales contract backlog and quoting larger projects in an effort to position us for incremental revenues in the second half of  but it is difficult for us to predict when we will recognize project revenue               balance sheet capital requirements   we had working capital current assets in excess of current liabilities of approximately  as of march   as compared to a working capital deficit of approximately  as of december   this change in working capital quarteroverquarter is primarily related to the  we raised in a private placement of our common stock and attached warrants during the three months ended march     during the three months ended march   we extinguished convertible promissory notes in the principal amount of  through the issuance of shares of its common stock and made payments of  to extinguish the remainder of our convertible promissory notes   management has determined our march   cash balance of approximately  will not be sufficient to fund our operations over the next twelve months based on management’s estimate for our operational cash requirements and without modifications to our existing payment obligations which include among other things the upcoming payments for promissory notes in the principal amount of  which were issued in february  and mature in november  we will require additional capital to be raised in the second half of    if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations make adjustments to our payment arrangements or raise sufficient additional capital through future debt and equity financings or strategic and collaborative ventures with potential partners we will likely have to reduce the size and scope of our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to raise capital on terms and conditions that are deemed acceptable to us or at all   other developments   on may   our board of directors approved a threeyear consulting agreement between the company
