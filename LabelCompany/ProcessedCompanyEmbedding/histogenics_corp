regenerative medicine about cartilage repair neocart neocart our phase  investigational product utilizes many aspects of our regenerative medicine platform to repair knee cartilage damage a neocart implant is produced using a patient’s own cartilage cells harvested from the nonweightbearing cartilage surface of the patient’s femur the cells are expanded embedded in our proprietary type i collagen scaffold and then incubated in our proprietary tissue engineering processor tep which is designed to simulate the variation in mechanical forces and low oxygen tension of the knee joint we believe incubation in this environment helps to ensure that the chondrocyte phenotype is maintained and the cells are producing extracellular matrix proteins crucial to cartilage function prior to implantation once biomarkers indicate early signs of chondrocyte function the neocartilage construct is shipped to the surgical facility and implanted into the patient’s knee defect using our ct bioadhesive visit the neocart study website a phase  clinical trial conducted in the united states demonstrated favorable preliminary results which supported proceeding to a phase  clinical trial the twoyear results of our phase  clinical trial are publicly available crawford et al am j sports med  a phase  clinical trial conducted in the united states comparing neocart to the standardofcare microfracture met its endpoints for safety and for improvement in pain and function these results support the continued clinical development of neocart the twoyear results of our phase  clinical trial are publicly available crawford et al j bone joint surg am  a phase  clinical trial conducted in the united states comparing neocart to the standardofcare microfracture is currently in progress information about the study is available on clinicaltrialsgov investigational treatment the investigational neocart treatment has three phases cell collection – the process begins during a short simple arthroscopic examination when an orthopedic surgeon takes a cartilage biopsy from a nonweight bearing area of the joint the tissue biopsy is sent to the histogenics manufacturing facility for culturing into the implant tissue production – the cartilage cells or chondrocytes are isolated from the cartilage and multiplied using standard tissue culture techniques the cells are harvested seeded into a unique dimensional collagen scaffold and cultured under exacting conditions of high pressure oxygen concentration and perfusion implant – after a few weeks a discrete threedimensional piece of the patient’s own neocartilage potentially having characteristics of maturing native articular cartilage is sent to the physician and implanted into the defect in a simple procedure that usually takes less than an hour we believe within months there is potential for the matrix to remodel for the cells to mature and for the cartilage to integrate with the host tissue caution new

primary superiority endpoint as compared to the standard of care  there are more than  or more knee cartilage procedures in the united states each year with many healthy active adults avoiding treatment as they seek other alternatives  left untreated even a small cartilage defect can expand in size and progress to debilitating osteoarthritis ultimately necessitating a joint replacement
