fulltime more than a yearprosthe sales are fun to make you tend to find yourself getting into very interesting and fun conversations with people the days tend to go by pretty fast the mvelopes app is fantastic  everybody should use that they are somewhat fair with the people who want to get out of their contract early on but after about  months you can forget about it because chances are youre probably stuck for the entire  month agreementlove the ping pong table popcorn machine and soda machine love the chilled attendance  break policy as long as you are a top performerconsat the end of the day its very difficult to feel like you actually did something positive for the people you have sold these people are already perilously struggling financially to the most extreme degree you can imagine i am a good enough salesperson to convince someone over the phone in  minutes regardless of their situation that i have the best method to get their family out of debt  buy a home in the near future and today is their lucky day then convince them to hand over their cc and sign a  month contract for mo however the sad truth is that for the majority of these people you are actually making their already bad situation even worseexpect a lot of your sales to cancel also if you always give every person you sale your personal contact information business phone  email expect most inquiries to be filled with hesitation to proceed  unsatisfactory results  buyers remorse people will be begging to cancel and get a refund because the cost is not worth the benefit and they will give you some creative  outlandish reasons of why they absolutely can not continue i do not know the exact  of people who succeed and find this program changed their life for the better but if i had to guess i would say its a benefit to less than   a burden to about  with the  not yet being so financially screwed that they actually still have the extra funds in their budget to afford this type of program karma if i could give my previous customers my best advice now i would tell them to take the  they are about to spend on this program and pay off all of their credit cards title loans and payday loans if those are all paid off put it towards paying down that auto loan or anything that is outstanding on your credit reporti also hate that some agents are allowed to get away with a sales pitch that is technically compliant but is geared towards a promise of work with us for  months and well help you stop paying a landlord like you have your whole life and get into a home of your own many agents even go as far as to pull up the potential clients zip code and have conversations about homes in their area to divert their focus from what this program is truly all aboutadvice to managementeither cut the mentoring program price in half so its affordable to mo or have an option for people to pay monthtomonth instead of having them sign a  month contract which they cant get out of when they hit
