portfolio manager qa january   view as pdf fund managers sonu kalra qa an interview with portfolio manager sonu kalra sonu how did the fund perform for the semiannual reporting period ending january   the funds share classes advanced about  the past six months outpacing the  return of the benchmark and also topping our peer group average looking out a bit longer term the fund gained roughly  for the trailing  months lagging the benchmark but outperforming the peer average what factors helped the fund outperform its benchmark the past six months investors continued to exhibit risk on behavior amid us job growth global economic stimulus and stabilizing oil prices however the big news was the november election of donald trump the new administrations prospective probusiness policies – including plans to cut the corporate tax rate and influence global trade – and a rising us dollar supported traditionally cyclical names which i favor while i try to cast a wide net in terms of opportunities experience has taught me certain areas of the market tend to display a greater predisposition toward innovation than others this includes information technology by far the funds largest sector allocation the past six months representing about  of fund assets on average innovation has led to growth so i find myself spending more of my time looking for ideas within this group here investors were drawn to some of the moreeconomically sensitive areas in which we invest – particularly the semiconductors  semiconductor equipment industry where positioning was by far the funds biggest contributor tell us about your strategy including your approach to tech stocks in tech and in all areas of the market i focus on owning companies that i think can sustain aboveaverage earnings over the long term i aim to achieve this by looking for firms with some combination of competitive advantage high barriers to entry pricing power and strong management i also seek firms that demonstrate aboveaverage growth versus peers and those with good return on equity and improving return on capital this period i found several software  services names that fit this description as a result the funds topthree relative contributors came from the segment nvidia nxp semiconductors and broadcom nvidia was the funds biggest individual contributor this period the company has done well in the field of visual computing – pc gaming for example – and shown leadership in machine learning including the technology supporting driverless cars shares of the graphics card designer gained  for the fund including a jump in november after the company reported impressive quarterly financial results driven by sales of chips for computer gaming and infotainment systems in autos a nonbenchmark stake in netherlandsbased nxp semiconductors was a plus shares of the firm rose sharply on lateseptember news reports that industry giant qualcomm is interested in acquiring nxp as part of its effort to expand its product lines beyond those used in mobile devices i should note that qualcomm was a fund holding and a material detractor this period the deal was formally announced in late october but not completed by period end i tend to avoid deal risks when a firm gets acquired so i closed our position in nxp meanwhile broadcom shares advanced  partly due to betterthanexpected fourthquarter and fullyear financial results reported in december the firm credited the strong results to positive synergies following its acquisition of the legacy broadcom company which avago had purchased in january  before assuming broadcoms name broadcom one of the funds largest holdings this period is a leading producer of radiofrequency rf chips used in smartphones i remained bullish on the firms potential as consumers continue to demand more bandwidth requiring more rf content in smartphones which other investments and decisions influenced performance versus the benchmark an underweighting in drugmaker bristolmyers squibb boosted relative results our holdings in the stock returned  the past six months dragged down along with the pharmaceuticals industry amid growing concern surrounding potential drugpricing regulation especially in the leadup to the november us presidential election i sold our stake here by period end as i continued to find better opportunities elsewhere what disappointed the past six months the funds largest relative detractor was underexposure to tech giant and large index constituent microsoft i added to the funds position in microsoft as the firm continued to demonstrate success in its cloud business but it remained a sizable underweighting as of january  unfortunately for the fund we missed out on the stocks gain in the second half of the period continued optimism regarding the growth of microsofts cloudcomputing business in which it rents software to customers on a subscription basis helped boost the share price  the past six months regeneron pharmaceuticals was another fund laggard as the stock returned roughly  this period in addition to industrywide drugpricing pressure regeneron was hurt in october when the us food and drug administration fda halted a clinical study of the firms potential treatment for osteoarthritis pain and chronic low back pain in addition the fda rejected regenerons submission for its rheumatoid arthritis treatment despite the stocks performance this period i remained positive about regeneron in part because it is planning to launch a new treatment for dermatitis a serious form of eczema which im optimistic will do well serving a large unmet market sonu what is your outlook at period endthe market climbed a wall of worry following the us presidential election investors seem hopeful that recent stockprice gains will be accompanied by faster earnings growth amid a decreased regulatory burden on corporate america and potential tax reform i am cautiously optimistic that we could see improvement in the us economy energy prices have recovered nicely from the trough we saw last year while interest rates have risen though are still low by historical standards ive been paying particular attention to the potential impact this may have on the us housing market as well as to early signs of increasing inflation as higher wages and energy prices filter through the economy historically valuations have remained high but i remain positive that earnings growth should follow helping to bring prices back to moreneutral levels at period end the funds largest overweightings remained information technology and consumer discretionary – two sectors i still see as ripe with growth opportunities even amid the current slowgrowth environment ■ sonu kalra on opportunities in machine learning machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that provides computers with the ability to adapt and change without being explicitly programmed this technology is in the relatively early stages of adoption but is already being used in a number of ways as societies become more digital increasing amounts of personal business and other forms of data are being collected companies have begun using computers to harness this data and are creating machine learning predictive software to help consumers make better decisions google parent alphabet is a preeminent player in the machinelearning space and the funds largest holding combining its class a and class c shares in may the firm unveiled google assistant – a computerized personal assistant that will be available on google smartphones and google now the firms smart wireless speaker the technology stands out from competition in that it can engage in twoway conversations using googles naturallanguage processing algorithm similarly amazons alexa and ibms watson offer a number of assistantlike features including the ability to provide directions request a ridesharing pickup play music or order a pizza alexa also now has the ability to unlock home doors amazon was a large fund holding and a contributor this period another popular use of machine learning is in selfdriving cars one way ive invested here is through our stake in electric carmaker tesla motors a contributor this period as of october all tesla models have selfdriving capabilities including cameras that provide degree visibility sensors that can detect objects around the car and radar able to see through various weather conditions and even the car ahead key takeaways the funds share classes advanced about  for the semiannual reporting period ending january   outpacing the  gain of the benchmark russell ® growth index investors were drawn to some of the moreeconomically sensitive areas favored by portfolio manager sonu kalra particularly the semiconductors  semiconductor equipment industry where positioning was by far the funds biggest contributor versus the benchmark the past six months the funds topthree relative contributors came from this segment nvidia nxp semiconductors and broadcom each of which outperformed the index conversely the funds largest relative detractor was an underweighting in tech giant and

opportunities tied to machine learning technology market recap the us equity bellwether sp ® index gained  for the six months ending january   rising sharply in the periods second half on renewed optimism for economic growth investors continued to exhibit risk on behavior amid us job gains global economic stimulus and stabilizing oil prices the market meandered in a narrow range from august to

under his administrations progrowth agenda for the full six months smallcap and valueoriented stocks topped their largecap and growth counterparts respectively financials  easily led the way riding an
