in connection with the acquisition of ria firms the company may invest such funds in securities that constitute �investment securities� under the act accordingly the following has been added to risk factor discussing potential application of the investment company act on the company found on page  of the amendment � �during the period of time in between the receipt of proceeds as part of this offering and the deployment of such proceeds in acquiring ria firms we may invest such proceeds in liquid securities that constitute �investment securities� under the  act such investments may exceed

the similarities between mesa�s business and the one you now propose please tell us about mr baker�s experience at mesa holdings including how many registered investment adviser firms mesa held during mr baker�s tenure and the status of the mesa business at the end of his tenure � response page  of the amendment contains the following disclosure in response to your request � �the leader of our investment team mr baker has relevant experience as the chairman chief executive officer and chief investment officer at mesa holdings inc �mesa� from  to  mr baker�s primary role at mesa was to acquire ria firms similar to those that the partnership intends to acquire mesa operated as a holding company of ria firm subsidiaries when mesa ceased operations in  it had seven ria firm subsidiaries mesa financed its ria firm acquisitions via debt secured by mesa as ria firm acquisitions were consummated in  one of mesa�s large investors became involved in legal problems and as a result mesa could no longer secure additional funding at the time mesa had not reached operating income profitability to sustain its operations so mesa ceased operations and conveyed its assets over to its creditors � the partnership intends to primarily utilize capital from equity financings to raise capital for ria firm acquisitions aside from the issuance of promissory notes in consideration of the purchase price of ria firms which we believe will represent no more than  of the total purchase price and may be converted into class b units in lieu of cash at the option of the holder we do not intend to utilize debt leverage to acquire ria firms we believe that the partnership will benefit from mr baker�s firsthand experience at mesa we believe that the proceeds from the offering will put awa in a strong capital position to avoid reliance on creditors to fund the partnership�s operations in the near future� � � � � ms suzanne hayes september   page  � � item  directors executive

indicates that it is limited to class a common units please refer to item b of form a and revise to provide a table for each class of security alternatively explain to us why it is appropriate to include these classes in a single table � response the three classes of units of the company class a common class b and class m continue to be presented as a single table in the amendment the company believes this is appropriate since all three classes vote as a single class on all matters submitted to the unitholders for approval segregating each class into a separate table may improperly create the impression to investors class a common unit holders may vote separately from the other classes of units on matters submitted to unitholders for approval also since  class m units are outstanding the company believes investors should be aware of how such outstanding units affect the voting power of the class a common units being sold in the offering � item  interests of management� page  �

ownership table requires disclosure of each nonaffiliated investor of the company with at least  of the outstanding voting power of the units no nonaffiliated investors own  or more of the voting power of the units the private placement section on page  of the amendment is contained in item  which requires disclosure of the issuance of units to the gp and its affiliates but not nonaffiliated investors with regard to potential disclosure the effect of any preoffering dilutive issuances are discussed as part of the dilution table set forth on page  of the amendment � � � � ms suzanne hayes

calendar quarter after the month in which the minimum offering requirement  million is met our distributions may exceed our earnings especially during the period before we have substantially invested the proceeds from this offering as a result a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital for tax purposes a return of capital is a return of your investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities and will be made after deduction of the fees and expenses payable in connection with the offering including any fees to be reimbursed to the gp a unitholder will not be subject to immediate taxation on the amount of any distribution treated as a return of capital to the extent of the unitholder�s basis in its units however the unitholder�s basis in its units will be reduced but not below zero by the amount of the return of capital which will result in the unitholder recognizing additional gain or a lower loss when the units are sold to the extent that the amount of the return of capital exceeds the unitholder�s basis in its units such excess amount will be treated as gain from the sale of the unitholder�s units a unitholder may recognize a gain from the sale of units even if the unitholder sells the units for less than the original purchase price� � the company has been informed by its accountants that ks will
