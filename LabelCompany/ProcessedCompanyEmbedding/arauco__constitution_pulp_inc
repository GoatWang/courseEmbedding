high density fiber board or hb based on information published by resource information systems inc an independent research company for the pulp and paper industry at december   we were one of the worlds largest producers of bleached and unbleached softwood kraft market pulp in terms of volume of pulp produced in  with an estimated  share of the total world production of bleached softwood kraft market pulp and a  share of the total world production of softwood kraft market unbleached pulp market pulp is pulp sold to manufacturers of paper products as opposed to pulp produced by an integrated paper producer for use in its paper production facilities kraft pulp is pulp produced using a chemical process based on information published by resource information systems inc we were also one of the worlds lowestcost producers of softwood kraft market pulp we believe that we are able to produce our products at a lower cost than our competitors because of the high growth rate and short harvest cycle of radiata pine compared to other commercial softwoods the advanced genetic and silviculture techniques we apply in our forest management our competitive labor costs our modern

narrow band of latitude and under certain climatic conditions one of chiles principal advantages in the forestry products industry lies in the short growing cycle of its radiata pine plantations the faster rate of growth of radiata pine trees in chile allows harvesting of pulplogs and sawlogs  to  years after planting and of high quality sawlogs  years after planting for most temperate softwood forests in the northern hemisphere this range is  to  years for pulplogs and  to  years for high quality sawn timber consequently the chilean forestry industry is a relatively low cost producer since a chilean producer generally requires less time and a smaller area to produce the same volume of pine as its north american or european competitors who face lower forest growth rates and higher transportation and investment costs as a result of the larger tracts of forests necessary to produce equivalent yields of softwood accordingly since the mids we have focused our forest management toward the application of advanced genetic and silviculture techniques to increase productivity and the quality of our plantations eucalyptus which we started planting in  grows well in the forest regions of chile once planted eucalyptus trees require no further forest management other than fire control and reduction of weeds until harvest the average harvest cycle of eucalyptus plantations is approximately  years once cut eucalyptus regrows and it is only after two additional harvest rotations of approximately  years each that it becomes necessary to replant we have adopted environmentally sensitive policies towards our holdings of native forests in selected areas we thin native forests in compliance with applicable laws and regulations but we do not permit clear cutting of native forests in areas surrounding rivers and streams areas of notable environmental interest or areas with particularly fragile soil conditions see government regulation the international standards organization or iso has certified our forestry activities in chile and argentina pursuant to iso  through the year  additionally during  we obtained certification in chile from the national standard for sustainable forest management  estándar nacional de certificación forestal sustentable  or certfor since  certfor has been a member of the pan european forest certification which is the worlds largest forest certification organization certfor has performed audits of our operations in  and  and has confirmed each time that we are in compliance with the applicable certfor requirements we received occupational health and safety assessment series ohsas certification in november  with respect to our forestry activities in argentina forest plantations at december   our planted forests consisted of  radiata and taeda pine and the balance primarily consisted of eucalyptus radiata and taeda pine have a rapid growth rate and a short harvest cycle compared to other commercial softwoods radiata and taeda pine are sufficiently versatile for both the production of forestry and wood products and the production of long fiber pulp for sale to manufacturers of paper and packaging we seek to manage our forestry resources in a way that ensures that the annual growth of our forest is equal to or greater than the volume of resources harvested each year in  we planted  hectares and harvested  hectares in chile argentina brazil and uruguay we believe that we will reach a longterm sustainable equilibrium within the next five years with annual harvests and plantations of approximately  hectares    table of contents the majority of our radiata pine is less than  years old our planted radiata pine forests are located in central and southern chile and most are located in close proximity to our major production facilities and to port facilities at december   our aggregate radiata pine holdings comprised approximately  of all chilean radiata pine plantations making us the countrys largest radiata pine plantation owner according to the chilean forestry institute  at december   we owned approximately  hectares of land in chile of which  hectares are forest plantations at december   we owned  hectares of forest and other land in argentina  hectares of forest and other land in brazil and  hectares of forest and other land in uruguay of the total land we

fewer than  hectares in  to  hectares at december   that number does not include  hectares owned by third parties or the assets owned by forestal río grande sa as to which we have harvesting rights in the five years ending december   we purchased  hectares of land of which  hectares were purchased in chile  in argentina  in brazil and  in uruguay we expect to acquire additional land in argentina uruguay and brazil and to a lesser extent in chile if we are presented with the opportunity to do so at a desired price or location there can be no assurance that we would be able to acquire land at the desired price or location we plan to continue our policy of supplementing our pulplog production with purchases from domestic third parties we believe that this policy is economically efficient

second half of     table of contents forest management for our pine plantations our forestry management activities seek to increase sawlogs through advanced genetic techniques planting and site preparation procedures thinning and pruning managed forests can produce trees of larger diameter and if pruned a higher proportion of clear wood which generally commands a higher price than knotted wood although some land is not suitable for the production of pruned logs at december   over  of our pine forests in chile were designed for clear wood production for our eucalyptus plantations our forestry management activities seek to increase the amount of fiber production per hectare through advanced genetic techniques and planting and site preparation procedures eucalyptus is more expensive to plant than pine however after planting eucalyptus requires minimal forest management yields more fiber per hectare and has a shorter growth cycle and greater wood density than pine resulting in a greater amount of pulp production per hectare as of december   we had eight nurseries in chile argentina and brazil in which we grow seedlings using seeds and using cuttings from genetically selected trees to achieve higher quality trees and an increased growth rate we apply strict selection criteria to the trees from which seedlings are produced we then plant the seedlings manually depending upon the species of tree to be planted and the nutrient and physical characteristics of the soil we may also undertake a certain amount of ground preparation before planting our other principal forest activities are thinning pruning and harvesting thinning or culling inferior trees from the plantation occurs in the following two stages        thinning to waste  some thinned trees are chipped and used in pulp production thinning to waste occurs after four to six years and results in an average reduction of the number of trees per hectare from  to approximately         commercial thinning  thinned trees are used in pulp production or depending on the quality of the particular land as sawlogs commercial thinning occurs at  to  years and results in an average reduction of the number of trees per hectare from  to approximately  this high level of thinning is economical for the following reasons        the cost of planting is relatively low        the higher number of young trees provide each other with natural protection from the elements and        the high degree of selection that thinning makes possible leaves only the highest quality trees to be harvested pruning involves removing branches the source of knots which are the main defect in sawn timber pruning results in a highquality clearwood sawlog of  meters from each tree and is conducted three times        at the time of the first thinning        two years later when trees are six to eight years old and        one year later when trees are seven to nine years old our eucalyptus plantations are neither thinned nor pruned harvesting timber involves felling trees removing branches from the logs cutting the logs into appropriate sections and loading the logs onto trucks for transport to sawmills panel mills pulp mills or ports for direct export we use the lower section of the radiata pine comprising the first seven to  meters in sawmills and plywood mills    table of contents or it is exported as sawlogs we use the midsection of the radiata pine comprising on average the next eight to  meters in either sawmills or pulp mills depending on the diameter and quality of the pine we use the top section of the tree for pulp and mdf production we monitor product demand and our current inventory levels and we match harvests from sections of our plantations that will provide the optimal yield given our product requirements this process involves the use of sophisticated operations research models and close communication between our different operating areas to ensure that the correct amounts of timber of the required characteristics are supplied we replant as soon as practicable after harvesting with an average period between harvesting and replanting of one year the following table illustrates on a hectare basis the extent of our thinning pruning and harvesting activities during the periods indicated        year ended december                     in hectares thinning             pruning             harvesting             we manage our forest activities but we hire independent contractors to perform the bulk of our operations including planting maintenance thinning pruning harvesting transportation and access road construction as of december   we had arrangements with more than  independent contractors that employed over  workers many of these contractors have longstanding relationships with us but we award many contracts based on competitive bids we believe that our arrangements with independent contractors provide greater flexibility and efficiency than performing these activities directly since areas of farmland and native forests geographically separate our forest holdings our plantations are naturally protected against the spread of certain diseases in addition our subsidiary bioforest has developed techniques to protect our forests from pests and diseases the most prevalent pest is the european pine shoot moth which may damage the tips of the radiata pine resulting in deformations to the tree we control this moth with biological methods specifically we introduced the orgilus obscurator a parasitic wasp that attacks only the european pine shoot moth other methods we use to control pests include the mechanical removal of affected tips and the use of low toxicity chemical products other potential diseases and pests include a fungus called dothistroma a fungus that reduces a trees growth rate and the sirex insect which attacks decaying trees and results in a thinned forest we operate an extensive fire control organization that interacts with the fire control organizations of other forestry companies to ensure that any fire damage to our forests is minimal the operation primarily consists of a system of spotter towers manned  hours a day during the summer months from which spotters report the direction of any fire observed to a central command post where the fires exact location is determined and an appropriate ground andor aerial response is formulated over the last five years this system has limited fire damage to our forests to an average of  of the plantations per year forest production we harvested  million cubic meters of logs during the year ended december   consisting of  million cubic meters of sawlogs  million cubic meters of radiata pine pulplogs and  million cubic meters of eucalyptus pulplogs and other logs we did not export any pulplogs during  because substantially all of the pulplogs from our forests were used in our pulp mills during  our sawmills and panel mills used  million cubic meters of sawlogs and no sawlogs were exported we also sold  million cubic meters of sawlogs to unaffiliated domestic sawmills during  a log merchandising facility located at the same site as our horcones i and horcones ii sawmills optimizes cuts and classifies wood destined for our plywood facility sawmills or pulp mills with an annual processing capacity of  million cubic meters of logs per year the nueva aldea complex also includes a log merchandising facility with an annual processing capacity of  million cubic meters of logs per year    table of contents pulp we believe that we were chiles largest producer of bleached and unbleached softwood market pulp in terms of production in  for the year ended december   pulp sales were us million representing  of our total sales revenue for the period pulp obtained from wood fibers is used in the manufacture of printing and writing paper hygienic and sanitary paper board and packaging whether a specific kind of pulp is suitable for a particular end use depends not only on the type of wood but also on the process used to transform the wood into pulp pulp made from softwoods such as radiata pine has long fibers and is used to provide durability and strength to paper products bleached pulp is used primarily for printing and writing papers and for tissue unbleached pulp is used primarily for linerboard a packaging material pulp made from hardwoods such as eucalyptus has short fibers and is used in combination with long fiber in manufacturing paper products we use a chemical process known as the kraft process in our pulp mills in chile and argentina the raw wood is in the form of pulplogs and chips which are combined in the production process to produce pulp the pulplogs are first debarked and chipped the chips are then screened mixed and cooked with chemicals to separate the bulk of the lignin from the wood fibers after the material is screened and washed it is then passed to highdensity tanks for bleached pulp the next step is a fivestage bleaching process using chemicals primarily chlorine dioxide at all of our pulp mills the bleaching process is preceded by an oxygen delignification stage then the fibers are subjected to a final stage where the sheets are formed and subsequently dried and baled for transport to customers the lignin and bark produced during this process is used to fuel the boilers that produce steam providing heat and generating electricity for the mill our bleached pulp is bleached to a  brightness level as measured by the iso test procedure which is one of the industrys measurement methods pulp mills at december   we owned and operated five pulp mills in chile and one in argentina with an aggregate installed annual production capacity of approximately  metric tons our six pulp mills produced  metric tons of bleached pulp and  metric tons of unbleached pulp in   all of our pulp mills in chile except for the nueva aldea mill and the licancel mill are iso  and iso certified we expect that the nueva aldea mill and the licancel mill will be certified iso  and iso  by the end of  the alto paraná mill in argentina is certified under iso  and iso no seasonal factors

operations at the licancel mill have been subject to environmental scrutiny by chilean environmental regulators and the public in june  in connection with the death of fish in the mataquito river approximately  kilometers downstream of the mill we decided to voluntarily suspend our operations in the licancel mill as a preventive measure in addition chilean authorities including the health authorities and the superintendencia de servicios sanitarios sanitary services superintendency required that we suspend activities at the licancel mill and that we suspend any further discharges into

contributed to the migration and death of blackneck swans in an area downstream from the mill on the cruces river in connection with an environmental administrative proceeding environmental regulators required us to temporarily suspend operations at the valdivia mill for approximately one month in january  we resumed operations at the mill on february   on june   we voluntarily suspended operations at the valdivia mill which we estimate resulted in a loss of sales of approximately us million per day and a loss of profits of approximately us per day pursuant to the decision of our board of directors based on certain clarifications provided by the corema of the tenth region of chile the mill resumed operations on august   at a reduced annual production of  metric tons or  of its authorized production capacity after  days of suspended operations in order to achieve the full production capacity authorized by applicable permits equal to  metric tons of wood pulp per year the pulp mill had to comply with certain new requirements established by the corema of the tenth region of chile including modifications to the effluents parameters including among others aluminum sulfate nitrogen and chlorate in march  knight piesold an independent environmental auditing firm appointed by the corema of the tenth region of chile officially determined that the valdivia mill had

environmental impact study to april  and prior to the expiration of the april  deadline extended it again to march   on february   we submitted to the corema of the fourteenth region of chile an environmental impact study for the construction of a pipeline to discharge the valdivia mills wastewater in the pacific ocean near punta maiquillahue that is in a body of water other than the cruces river the carlos anwandter nature sanctuary or their sources additionally in april  when the corema approved the march   deadline it also required us to present an additional environmental impact study for the implementation of substantial technological improvements on the quality of the effluents generated by the valdivia mill we submitted this study on june   on june   the corema approved that environmental impact study however the approval was subject to certain conditions that in the opinion of arauco affected the feasibility of the project for such reason arauco filed an appeal  recurso de reclamación  before the directive council  consejo directivo  of the conama challenging the conditions as of the date of this annual report we have not been notified of the resolution of that appeal the corema of the tenth region of chile appointed a canadian consulting company ecometrix to analyze and prepare a report on different feasible alternatives for discharge of the valdivia mill effluents in august  the consulting firm identified certain locations as suitable alternatives for discharging the effluents one of which is the alternative we proposed in our environmental impact study approvals by the corema of our environmental impact studies regarding the pipeline and the improvement of the quality of the effluents and the construction and operation of the pipeline are each subject to many environmental regulatory engineering and political uncertainties as a result we cannot provide any assurances that the projects will ever be approved or completed if either our environmental study about the pipeline is rejected or the installation of the pipeline is delayed for reasons attributable to us we may face sanctions that include warnings fines or the revocation of the valdivia mills environmental permit of operation alternatively if any rejection or delays are attributable to reasons beyond our control we believe that corema should extend the applicable deadlines however we cannot provide assurances that any deadline extensions would be granted even if we comply with all the requirements that may be set forth by corema as a result we offer no assurance that the valdivia mill will be able to operate without further interruption any future suspension of operations at the valdivia mill or at any other of our significant operating plants would

corema of the tenth region of chile asked the national forestry corporation or conaf to elaborate an integral environmental management plan for the wetland which was completed in  the plan concluded that there was a need to develop a conceptual ecosystem model for the wetland conaf selected the science faculty of the university of chile to conduct this study    table of contents the study indicated in its second progress report that the disappearance of the luchecillo a water weed that was an important food source of blacknecked swans was likely related to natural causes specifically the study proposed that the disappearance of the luchecillo was caused by the convergence of three factors in may  i low levels of precipitation ii low levels of water flow in the rivers and the wetland and iii three instances in which temperatures reached zero degrees celsius or lower according to the study the simultaneous occurrence of these factors was likely responsible for the disappearance of the luchecillo which in turn lead to the death and migration of the swans this second progress report was followed by a final report issued by the science faculty of the university of chile which was not approved by conaf on june   we submitted to the corema a request to increase our production by  in the valdivia mill if the request is approved the valdivia mill would increase its production from  metric tons per year to  metric tons per year fully complying with current environmental regulations the increase would be achieved through the optimization of our current production process and does not require investments in additional equipment nueva aldea mill during  we commenced construction of the second phase of the nueva aldea project which includes the development of a new pulp mill with authorized annual production capacity of  tons of bleached pulp consisting of softwood pulp and eucalyptus pulp in august  we commenced the startup process of the

unbleached market pulp plywood and fiberboard panels araucos principal competitors in the plywood markets are located in the united states finland and russia in some regions arauco also competes with hardwood plywood produced in china africa and other regions of the world araucos main competitors in the fiberboard mdf market are masisa a panel producer in latin america and other large producers of south america new zealand australia and north america in our exports to asia and middle east arauco also competes with producers in malaysia korea and china wood and forestry products araucos main competitors in the forestry and wood products markets are the major european north american new zealand and chilean forestry companies arauco believes that its operating efficiencies its competitive logistics costs its ability to produce multiple specifications per its customers request its presence in over forty countries and the versatility of radiate and taeda pine allows it to compete effectively in the world market for forestry and wood products transportation storage and distribution to remain competitive with pulp suppliers elsewhere in the world we ship our products to various distribution centers around the world from which final delivery to the customer is made historically we and other chilean forestry products producers have coordinated our transportation requirements to achieve larger lots to fill specially designed forestry products ships and thus obtain competitive freight rates the following are the principal chilean ports that we use        coronel a private port located between concepción and the arauco mill which we constructed as a member of a consortium with five other companies and in which we have an equity interest of  we shipped approximately  of our aggregate export volume through this port in         lirquén a private port in concepción in which we have an equity interest of  and through which we shipped approximately  of our aggregate export volume during  and    table of contents      san vicente and talcahuano stateowned ports near the city of concepción through which we shipped approximately  of our aggregate export volume during  the ports we use in chile are approximately  kilometers from the arauco mill  kilometers from the constitución mill  kilometers from the licancel mill  kilometers from the nueva aldea mill and  kilometers from the valdivia mill we do not own pulp storage warehouses in any of these ports we ship pulp to various ports in europe north and south america and asia and as is customary in the pulp industry we store some stock in those ports we use  foreign ports that have warehouse facilities available and standard storage terms provide that we are entitled to a certain period of storage free of charge we seek to ensure that it does not exceed the free storage period for each shipment at december   we had approximately  metric tons in storage in warehouses at foreign ports we believe that our shipping costs are comparable to those of our international competitors notwithstanding chiles greater distance from europe because of the proximity of our plantations and mills to the pacific coast and the economies of scale we achieve through the volume of our exports in argentina timely and economical delivery of finished products to our customers is an important factor in our ability to compete effectively and we ship most orders either by truck or railway almost immediately after they are produced description of property our principal properties consist of land and production plants and facilities the majority of which are located in chile at december   we owned approximately  hectares of land in chile over  hectares of which consist of forest plantations and  hectares of land in argentina brazil and uruguay of which  consist of forest plantations in addition at december   we owned various plants and facilities including five pulp mills four panel mills nine sawmills and five remanufacturing facilities in chile one pulp mill two sawmills one mdf mill one pbo mill and one remanufacturing facility in argentina and one mdf mill one pbo mill and one sawmill in brazil in brazil the arapoti sawmill was closed on march   in chile the lomas coloradas sawmill the coronel sawmill and the coelemu sawmill were closed in  insurance consistent with industry practice we maintain fire insurance coverage for all our chilean forest holdings and nurseries but do not insure against pests or disease depending on the age of the trees affected our insurance covers timber loss either at replacement cost or commercial value in argentina we maintain fire insurance for  hectares of timber assets located in the campana region near buenos aires for the rest of our argentine operations we do not maintain fire insurance for our timber assets because we believe that the risk of damage from fire is low because argentina receives significant amounts of rainfall particularly during the summer months we do not carry fire insurance for our forests in brazil because the risk of damage from fire does not justify the costs of carrying insurance we also carry insurance consistent with industry practice covering our production plants facilities and equipment this insurance provides coverage in the event of fire explosion machinery breakdown or natural disaster for  months of business interruptions  months in the case of a boiler explosion in our pulp mills all of our insurance policies covering our forest holdings and production plants facilities and equipment in chile are carried by the rsa group la chilena consolidada part of zürich financial services group and la interamericana part of american international group inc the forestry insurance is carried by the rsa and penta security compañía de seguros sa our insurance policies for facilities and equipment in argentina are carried by rsa la meridional part of american international group inc and the zürich financial services group and these policies cover damage resulting from fire our mdf and particleboard mills in brazil are insured by itaú xl seguros corporativos and these policies cover fire explosions electrical damage equipment damage and loss of profit    table of contents capital expenditures to utilize our increasing volume of forest production we have added to expanded and modernized our processing facilities in  aggregate capital expenditures were us million consisting primarily of us million in acquisitions of plantations us million in internal projects within our existing mills us million in the construction of a new biomass cogeneration plant in the horcones complex us million in the construction of the nueva aldea pipeline and us million in the installation of a new biomass cogeneration power plant in the viñales sawmill these capital expenditures represent amounts accrued for purposes of our audited consolidated financial statements and do not necessarily represent the cash cost of capital expenditures in  for the year ending december   we have planned capital expenditures of approximately us million which principally include us million in acquisitions of plantations us million in internal projects within our existing mills and an additional us million for the biomass cogeneration power plant in the viñales sawmill we also plan to invest us million in the joint acquisition with stora enso in uruguay during the second half of  government regulation environment in each country where we have operations we are subject to numerous national and local environmental laws regulations decrees and municipal ordinances concerning among other things health the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste discharges into the air soil and water and other environmental impacts some of these laws require us to conduct environmental impact studies of future projects or activities or major modifications thereto under these laws our operations may be subject to specific approvals consents and regulatory requirements and emissions and discharges may be required to meet specific standards and limitations we have made and will continue to make substantial expenditures to comply with such environmental laws regulations decrees and ordinances chile the chilean legislation to which we are subject includes the chilean environmental law  ley sobre bases generales del medio ambiente  and related regulations the chilean environmental law created the national environmental commission  comisión nacional del medio ambiente  or conama which includes under its organization the various regional environmental commissions the coremas conama is a public agency under the supervision of the president of chile through the environmental ministry  ministro presidente de la comisión nacional del medio ambiente  these commissions are responsible for among other things coordinating existing environmental regulations and evaluating environmental impact studies or declarations of environmental impact under the chilean environmental law we are required to conduct environmental impact studies or declarations of environmental impact of any future projects or activities or their significant modifications that may affect the environment these and other regulations also establish procedures for private citizens to object to the plans or studies submitted by project owners conama the corema and other governmental agencies may also participate in the oversight of the implementation of projects in accordance with their environmental impact studies or declarations of environmental impact under the chilean environmental law and other regulations affected private citizens public agencies and local authorities can sue to enforce environmental compliance enforcement remedies include temporary or permanent closure of facilities and fines the application of these environmental laws and remedies may adversely affect the manner in which we seek to implement our business strategy and our ability to realize our strategy we recently faced and continue to face certain environmental administrative proceedings in connection with certain of our pulp mills in connection with these proceedings and based on administrative proceedings law    table of contents no  the corema for the tenth region of chile ordered the suspension of production at the valdivia mill as an interim preventive measure in january  the mill reopened in february  after the corema for the tenth region of chile determined that the mill could continue operations subject to a number of conditions on june   the corema for the tenth region of chile modified our permit for the valdivia mill by among other requirements reducing the annual production capacity of the mill to  metric tons until we complied with certain conditions which included additional monitoring of some aspects of our emissions in addition the modifications set new emission limits for several pollutants and require us to conduct a new environmental impact study for an alternative system for the discharge of wastewater which we were directed to submit to the corema for the tenth region of chile for approval no later than march   on february   the corema for the tenth region of chile extended this deadline to march   we must construct and implement the alternative system which cannot involve the discharge of effluents into the cruces river the carlos anwandter sanctuary or their sources within  months of approval of the environmental impact study in final form the corema initially extended the deadline for the presentation of this environmental impact study to april  and prior to the expiration of the april  deadline extended it again to march   on february   we submitted to the corema of the fourteenth region of chile an environmental impact study for the construction of a pipeline to discharge the valdivia mills wastewater in the pacific ocean near punta maiquillahue that is in a body of water other than the cruces river the carlos anwandter nature sanctuary or their sources in april  when it approved the march   deadline the corema required us to present an additional environmental impact study for the implementation of substantial technological improvements on the quality of the effluents generated by the valdivia mill we submitted this environmental impact study on june   on june    the corema approved that environmental impact study however the approval was subject to certain conditions that in the opinion of arauco affected the feasibility of the project for such reason arauco filed an appeal  recurso de reclamación  before the directive council  consejo directivo  of the conama challenging the conditions as of the date of this annual report we have not been notified of the resolution of that appeal on june   we voluntarily suspended operations at the valdivia mill which we estimate resulted in a loss of sales of approximately us million per day and a loss of profits of approximately us per day pursuant to the decision of our board of directors based on certain clarifications provided by the corema for the tenth region of chile the mill resumed operations on august   at a reduced annual production of  metric tons or  of its authorized production capacity after  days of suspended operations in order to achieve the full production capacity authorized by applicable permits equal to  metric tons of wood pulp per year the pulp mill had to comply with certain new requirements established by the corema for the tenth region of chile including modifications to the effluents parameters including among others aluminum sulfate nitrogen and chlorate in march  knight piesold an independent environmental auditing firm appointed by the corema for the tenth region of chile officially determined that the valdivia mill had complied with the applicable requirements on january   the corema of the fourteenth region of chile authorized the valdivia mill to return to its annual authorized production capacity of  metric tons the mill gradually increased its production over a fourmonth period starting in march  and reached full capacity in june  the suspension of operations at the valdivia mill adversely affected our business financial condition and results of operations any future suspension of operations at the valdivia mill or at any other of our significant operating plants can be expected to have similar adverse effects we offer no assurance that the valdivia mill will be able to operate without further interruption see item  key informationrisk factorsrisks relating to arauco and the forestry industryenvironmental concerns led us to temporarily suspend our operations at the valdivia mill which adversely affected and in the future may continue to adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and item  information on the companydescription of businesspulppulp millschilevaldivia mill as part of the environmental resolution that modified the valdivia mill environmental permit the corema of the tenth region asked conaf to elaborate an integral environmental management plan for the wetland which was completed in  the plan concluded that there was a need to develop a conceptual ecosystem model for the wetland conaf selected the science faculty of the university of chile to conduct this study    table of contents the study indicated in its second progress report that the disappearance of the luchecillo a water weed that was an important food source of the blacknecked swans was likely related to natural causes specifically the study proposed that the disappearance of the luchecillo was caused by the convergence of three factors in may  i low levels of precipitation ii low levels of water flow in the rivers and the wetland and iii three instances in which temperatures reached zero degrees celsius or lower according to the study the simultaneous occurrence of these factors was likely responsible for the disappearance of the luchecillo which in turn lead to the death and migration of the swans this second progress report was followed by a final report issued by the science faculty of the university of chile which was not approved by conaf the corema for the tenth region of chile appointed a canadian consulting company ecometrix to analyze and prepare a report on different feasible alternatives for discharge of the valdivia mill effluents in august  the consulting firm identified certain locations as suitable alternatives for discharging the effluents one of which is the alternative we proposed in our environmental impact study approval by the corema of our environmental impact study regarding a pipeline the construction and operation of such a pipeline and also the approval of the environmental impact study regarding the improvement of the quality of the effluents are each subject to many environmental regulatory engineering and political uncertainties at this time as a result we cannot give you any assurance that such projects will ever be approved or completed if either our environmental study about the pipeline is rejected or the installation of the pipeline is delayed for reasons attributable to us we may face sanctions that include warnings fines or the revocation of the valdivia mills environmental permit of operation alternatively if any rejection or delays are attributable to reasons beyond our control we believe that corema should extend the applicable deadlines however we cannot provide assurances that any deadline extensions would be granted even if we comply with all the requirements that may be set forth by corema any future suspension of operations at the valdivia mill or at any other of our significant operating plants can be expected to have similar adverse effects we offer no assurance that the valdivia mill will be able to operate without further interruption the national defense council has instituted an action seeking reparations damages and indemnification from us for environmental harm allegedly caused by the valdivia mill and the licancel mill in addition since the end of  various criminal proceedings relating to alleged violations of several environmental laws have been instituted in chile in which some of our mills may be involved see item  key informationrisk factorsrisks relating to arauco and the forestry industrywe are subject to legal proceedings related to our mills which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and item  financial informationlegal proceedings we also faced environmental proceedings in connection with the pulp mill at the nueva aldea project while it was under construction as a result the corema for the eighth region of chile required us to suspend construction at the nueva aldea project for approximately two months in january  we resumed the construction of the pulp mill in march  after complying with the conditions set by the corema for the eighth region of chile on august   the nueva aldea pulp mill initiated its production and production capacity reached designed capacity in may  there can be no assurance that the pulp mills will continue to operate without further interruption see item  financial informationlegal proceedings on june   we submitted to the corema a request to increase our production by  in the valdivia mill if the request is approved the valdivia mill would increase its production from  metric tons per year to  metric tons per year fully complying with current environmental regulations the increase would be achieved through the optimization of our current production process and does not require investments in additional equipment argentina our operations in argentina are subject to argentine environmental legislation including regulation by municipal provincial and federal governmental authorities argentine environmental legislation includes the requirement that water used or recovered in the production process be treated and purified

internationally protected ramsar site and national reserve carlos anwandter in chile died or migrated the valdivia pulp mill located upriver was widely blamed the mill is located near the city of mariquina and discharges directly into the cruces river which feeds the wetlands the company had been dumping more dioxins and heavy metals than had been approved by the regulating agencies into the river from a waste tube that had been approved by the authorities it had also been producing far above levels approved in its environmental impact assessment and was cited for multiple violations of environmental and health laws the scandal prompted celcos chief executive to resign in june  and the company to pledge to adopt cleaner technologies the plant was temporarily closed by authorities but then allowed to reopen two months later at limited production capacity several legal actions were finally settled in the companys favor at the chilean supreme court however it later was revealed that this decision was based on a report that celco had itself produced and falsely claimed was authored by the university of concepcion this caused chiles president ricardo lagos to declare that the company had gone too far and was harming the countrys image a report contracted by the chilean government to the regional university universidad austral de chile found that the companys pollution was responsible for rapid ecological change in the wetlands leading to the decline of populations of swans and other water birds this finding was reviewed and validated by other independent entities including an international commission organized by the world wildlife fund wwf however scientists at the pontifical catholic university funded by celco have disputed the causality between the plants pollution and the swan population decline in july  celco agreed to pay clp millions to valdivian tourism companies to avoid legal actions for supposed losses of the tourism sector of valdivia due to
