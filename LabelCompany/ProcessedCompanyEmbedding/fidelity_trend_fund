approach fidelity® trend fund portfolio manager qa december   view as pdf fund managers daniel kelley qa an interview with portfolio manager daniel kelley dan how did the fund perform for the fiscal year ending december   the fund returned  which lagged the  gain of the benchmark russell ® growth index but beat the peer group average our underperformance of the benchmark came in the first half of the year as worries over a possible recession pushed investors toward less volatile but more expensive stocks with little or no earnings growth this backdrop wasnt a good fit with my longterm strategy of investing in mispriced earnings growth – stocks that seem attractively priced relative to their earnings growth prospects while a lot of growth fund managers focus on finding the fastest earnings growth without much concern for valuation i tend to look at earnings growth on a priceperpound basis i prefer stocks that give us the opportunity to benefit twice once when earnings beat estimates and then again as more investors become willing to pay up for a business showing signs of improvement in the second half of the year sticking with my strategy paid off i found mispriced earnings growth in more economically sensitive sectors which had cheaper pricetoearnings pe multiples than the benchmark average i thought these stocks could see price gains if a couple things went right energy stocks for example seemed ripe to rally if oil prices started to rise financial services stocks seemed likely to gain if interest rates began to climb these factors played out helping relative performance but not enough to eliminate our earlier performance gap   which sectors and stocks hurt performance versus the benchmark we lost the most ground from security selection in the information technology and health care sectors together roughly  of the benchmark our biggest stock disappointments came from the pharmaceuticals biotechnology  life sciences segment an overweight and  included teva pharmaceutical industries a nonbenchmark holding and allergan in july  israelbased teva offered to buy allergans genericdrug business i thought this acquisition and new products in the pipeline would boost tevas earningsgrowth outlook but the firm was hurt by regulatory delays that prolonged the deals closure until august  and by general concern over potential caps on drug prices tevas stock returned  for the fund and i eliminated the position by period end however i kept a reduced stake in irelandbased allergan which i thought would benefit from becoming a brandedonly company allergan has a strong medical aesthetics franchise that includes the antiwrinkle treatment botox® a buyout offer that fell through and concern about drug price caps pressured the stock in health care equipment  services our sizable underweighting in unitedhealth group the no  us health insurer hurt i viewed the stock as expensive but strong earnings reports drove its  return in the index outside of health care which stocks were notable detractors from relative performance our overweighting in electric car company tesla motors weighed on performance tesla is gearing up for a sizable increase in production with its new model  car the stock was pressured by uncertainty about how long the ramp up will take and how profitable the car will be coupled with teslas already high pe i recently toured teslas new lithium battery factory outside of reno i came away encouraged that the company is on track to reduce battery costs – a major cost component of its cars – and hence will be able to generate attractive profit margins on the model  the future earnings potential made the stock price seem more attractive to me in tech our underweighting in software giant microsoft detracted as restructuring efforts paid off and the stock rallied i thought the stock was a bit expensive which is why it was not fully weighted in the fund  all these stocks are pretty different… they are i think of growth stocks in three buckets unitedhealth allergan and microsoft fit into my quality growth bucket these tend to be large wellknown companies with proven management teams high returns on capital strong balance sheets and what i consider to be attractive stock prices relative to stable or accelerating earnings growth i cut our quality growth exposure from  to  of fund assets by yearend using the proceeds for moreattractive opportunities elsewhere tesla is a good example of secular growth – companies with high and sustainable earnings growth rates often driven by a unique technology a product thats in high demand or a growing trend secular growth stocks tend to be more expensive versus current earnings than quality growers so theres more risk attached the third – and most exciting – bucket is opportunistic growth these are stocks – such as teva – that i think are cheap but near an upward inflection point when they go up you can really get paid but when they dont work out the declines can be substantial our opportunistic growth exposure rose from roughly  to  of assets this year the highest in the five years ive run the fund lets shift gears and talk about what helped relative performance sure stock picks in energy financials and industrials – each an overweighting at period end – gave the biggest boost i added to energy early in  expecting improving supplydemand dynamics to spur higher oil and gas prices one of my purchases was pipeline operator williams companies a stock that was depressed by low commodity prices and in my opinion misplaced concern over significant risk to its cash flow if any of its customers went out of business higher commodity prices coupled with a dividend cut that helped cash flow and eased credit concerns resulted in a  gain in the funds shares in financials our nonbenchmark sizable stake in bank of america returned  i had established this position because i thought the share price looked cheap relative to the banks future earnings power especially in light of recent cost cuts and the potential for higher interest rates then the election of donald trump as president fueled expectations of deregulation and lower corporate tax rates which helped bank stocks take off in industrials chemicals distribution company univar stood out i viewed this nonbenchmark stock as depressed because the company had been undermanaged in may univar appointed a new ceo with a track record of transformation at a previous company i initiated a position over the summer plans to improve profit margins and a higher earnings outlook spurred a  gain in the funds shares all three stocks were opportunistic growers whats your outlook from here dan im encouraged expectations are that economically sensitive sectors which had been left for dead in  will gain going forward from progrowth initiatives under the new administration in addition i think we could see some market volatility which often can create opportunities to buy mispriced earnings growth ■ dan kelley on the funds sizable exposure to financials one of the biggest changes i made this past year was to increase exposure to the financials sector which rose from roughly  of assets to about  by yearend financials which are not known for fast earnings growth represented only about  of the russell  growth index this shift is a classic example of my mispriced earnings growth approach improving economic data in the back half of  prompted me to look more closely at banks and diversified financials their earnings had not been growing for a couple years as continued low interest rates kept a lid on net interest margins – the difference between what lenders earn on loans and pay on deposits plus modest economic growth had kept loan growth in check while much stricter compliance regulations since the  financial crisis had boosted costs   i thought financials stocks looked cheap relative to their earnings growth potential if interest rates were to rise most notably i established a sizable stake in bank of america and increased exposure to northern trust making these nonbenchmark positions top holdings by yearend both stocks posted strong gains benefiting from a rise in the year treasury yield in the second half of  and prospects of higher net interest margins but the real game changer was the election which spurred hope that reduced government regulations and lower corporate tax rates would lead to higher returns and more capital going back to shareholders despite the sectors recent run yearend prices on many financials in my view still seemed attractive relative to their earnings growth outlooks key takeaways the fund returned  for the year ended december   lagging the  return of the benchmark russell ® growth index nearly all the underperformance came in the first half of  when portfolio manager dan kelleys focus on mispriced earnings growth was out of favor in the second half of  dans strategy worked well as some of the more economically sensitive stocks in the fund saw sizable rebounds however outperformance in the second half was not enough to offset the earlier underperformance  for the year stock picks in the information technology and health care sectors hurt most outweighing gains from selection in energy financials and industrials dan expects more economically sensitive sectors to benefit from president trumps plans to spur growth in addition market volatility will likely create more buying opportunities for mispriced earnings growth market recap the sp ® index returned  in  rising sharply on postelection optimism for economic growth the year began during a fairly volatile stretch with stocks hampered by persistent oilprice weakness and usdollar strength markets regained momentum in february amid us job gains a rally in energy and other stimuli that helped keep the roughly sevenyear uptrend intact markets tumbled briefly following the uks june  vote to exit the european union – dubbed brexit – then recovered quickly and settled into a flattish stretch until the november  us presidential election stocks reacted to the outcome by reaching a series of alltime highs for the year energy  led the way amid two strong rallies in commodity prices one in the spring and another in november telecommunication services  was close behind as demand for dividendpaying equities was high early in the period cyclical sectors including financials  industrials  and materials  also posted strong gains conversely consumer staples  and consumer discretionary  lagged the index the latter hurt as online competition continued to pressure brickandmortar retailers real estate  struggled due to expectations for rising interest rates while health care  was hampered by an uncertain political

few leading stocks in fidelity trend fund ftrnx but its taken more than just owning the likes of apple alphabet amazon and facebook for fund manager dan kelley to keep his fund apace or ahead of peers and the stock market much of the funds success can be traced to what goes on behind closed doors depth of research fund manager experience investment philosophy and the timing of buys and sells and kelleys views about several of his top holdings appearing below reveal a good deal about his plan of attack for beating the market the  billion largecap growth fund was up  year to date through wednesday well ahead of its peers  and a bit behind the sp s  but its longterm track record is also looking good average returns over the past three five and  years amount to   and  respectively the sp  turned in   and  for those periods ibds take stock holdings of topperforming mutual funds are a great place to look for investment ideas but before buying any you should thoroughly analyze them using such tools as ibd stock checkup fidelity trend is also an ibd best mutual funds  awardwinner having beaten the sp  in the past one three five and  years ended dec  kelley the funds manager since  and with fidelity since  says trends main differentiating factor is it selects stocks with mispriced growth i dont really care as much about how fast the growth is i care about what im paying for the rate of growth as a result he likes being paid twice with both positive earnings revisions and a valuation rerating if im right on those positive earnings revisions estimated pes of stocks are adjusted lower when expected earnings are revised upward this improves the attractiveness of such stocks kelley segments growth stocks into three buckets quality secular and opportunistic growers quality growth companies have proven management teams stable earningsgrowth profiles and strong balance sheets examples include googleowner alphabet googl and visa v secular growers are companies where i get a little discomfort in the valuation on nearterm numbers but they have the ability to grow at a very high organic growth rate for quite some time and usually for longer than the market expects salesforcecom crm and facebook fb fall in this category asked for his view on top holding apple aapl which just reported fiscal q earnings and its first decline in annual profit in  years kelley said he could only comment on the situation as of the funds last filing aug  in general apple needs to continue to innovate further on the smartphone for customer demand to remain high and earnings to grow he said the smartphone has become the most important device in most peoples lives as the average person checks in  times a day hence apple needs to continue to provide customers with the best user experience leading operating performance and exciting new features to drive growth on amazon amzn he said the company as of the funds latest filing still looked cheap vs its longterm growth potential what has changed from prior years is the market has come to further appreciate the amazon web services business and the longterm opportunity for that business both from a revenue growth and earnings potential he said in addition with respect to the core retail business more retailers have embraced amazon as a powerful distribution platform which has allowed the company to operate more as a marketplace and enhanced the companys margin profile the third bucket includes opportunistic growth companies such as williams cos wmb those are companies that tend to trade at cheap valuations due to some concern — whether it be a cyclical company and the market gets worried about excess capacity whether it be some sort of companyspecific issue — and those names usually have the highest probability of being rerated once we see some positive change he explained in the case of american naturalgas producer williams kelley says that once they didnt get acquired they started to make some corporate governance moves — changing the board and reducing their risk profile — which led to a rerating of their stock williams stock increased  in price from the end of july through sept  kelley noted it was the secondbiggest contributor to fund performance during q before owning wmb the fund had a preference to hold wpz williams partners wpz a williams affiliate which also benefited from some of the same derisking and commitment to balancesheet improvement that williams did as a general rule kelley tries not to take huge sector bets however earlier in the year he did allocate about a  basis point overweight vs the funds russell  growth index benchmark in the energy sector which significantly contributed to the funds performance as to the three buckets he usually lets the market dictate where the most compelling value is that said the quality bucket has probably been the largest one over time comprising about  of the fund metalpackaging maker ball bll and waterpump and valve producer xylem xyl both strongly contributed to last quarters fund performance xylem has pulled back  from its early october peak and has fallen below its day moving average kelleys take while i cant comment on specific market moves that have happened since our latest public holdings disclosure i think its important to note that i take a longterm perspective when making investments on behalf of fund shareholders and look to take advantage of possible shortterm market dislocations global foodandketchup manufacturer kraft heinz khc is a company that may have low organic growth and a high multiple but it has a management team that are great capital allocators points out kelley when they combined kraft and heinz they took out a lot of cost  the management are really known to be really good operators of companies and they can go in and run them much leaner than they were run before and so whats happened historically is that the synergies from these largescale acquisitions had been much greater than initially expected related amazon facebook alibaba drive usaa growth fund why a top columbia fund likes these stock leaders     related news even starbucks is seeing the amazon
