solutions llc dba isc solutions founded in february  is a small conglomerate of business divisions which include office products print management services and courier transportation       iscs new strategy was solely focused on the premise that the integration of various supply chain functions was the key to cost reduction and operational improvements    shortly after the launch of isc solutions a campaign was initiated to document the work completed by the various functions in each business unit seventy eight process maps were completed identifying areas of improvements and used for training new employees this campaign further pointed out the need to engage in a simplified and structured approach to operational management which was based on the principles of lean earlier in  isc received a training grant which was used to provide lean training to employees at all levels in the company this training culminated in the redesign of the replenishment process in the henry ford hospital emergency room a  sq ft facility with  beds and  stocking locations that treats  patients annually the efforts resulted in expense reductions an integrated supply replenishment team and an increase in nursing and patient satisfaction office products was added as a service line in  and was a good fit when combined with print management services which included desktop delivery office depot was selected as a strategic partner as a result of their well defined mbe tier program and the fact that  their delivery system was outsourced to a third party the outsourcing of the delivery system was important because it provided an outsourcing opportunity for isc solutions two office products customers were acquired in  la z boy shipping to locations in  states and cambridge casualty a local company the couriertransportation business unit continued to streamline their operation through the use of the routing software and took on additional routes at henry ford health system with a combination of new employees and redirecting existing employees during the year the ground work was laid to move into lab courier and home health deliveries activity in the office products business started to increase as we solidified our mbe relationship with office depot in august  later in the year we were awarded a contract by beaumont hospitals this was isc’s first significant office products deal in december that same year we submitted an office products proposal to henry ford health system in response to their rfp the strategy implemented in  was to focus on the office products and pull print management services along once an opportunity was identified with a prospective customer deliveries for the henry ford health system home health division began in february  with deliveries of patient specific products to clinics within  hours of the order research into lab courier revealed the need for integrated software to track specimens and the prospective customer focus changed from hospitals to independent reference labs isc solutions actively participates in a number of community activities with its primary philanthropic efforts focused towards seniors youth and
