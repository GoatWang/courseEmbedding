fourth quarter of  the company recorded a reserve strengthening for this closed block of policies as it determined the present value of future premiums together with its existing reserves were not adequate to provide for future policy benefits this adjustment was primarily driven by emerging experience indicating longer claims duration a prolonged lower interest rate environment and an increase in policyholder life expectancies f the company’s reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of its ultimate benefits expense actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development related to the prior year in fy the company experienced prior period reserve development that exceeded what it would expect in a typical year primarily due to higher than normal claim recoveries cautionary statement this news release includes forward‐looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  when used in investor presentations press releases securities and exchange commission sec filings and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of humana’s executive officers the words or phrases like “expects” “believes” “anticipates” “intends” “likely will result” “estimates” “projects” or variations of such words and

merger agreement and other uncertainties that have impaired humana’s ability to retain recruit and motivate key personnel if humana does not design and price its products properly and competitively if the premiums humana receives are insufficient to cover the cost of healthcare services delivered to its members if the company is unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better healthcare experience for its members lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of its members or if its estimates of benefits expense are inadequate humana’s profitability could be materially adversely affected humana estimates the costs of its benefit expense payments and designs and prices its products accordingly using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon among other relevant factors claim payment patterns medical cost inflation and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit expenses for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate these estimates however involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends so any reserves we may establish including premium deficiency reserves may be insufficient in addition there can be no guarantees that the reconsideration that humana filed with respect to certain of the company’s star rating measures for the  bonus year will be successful that operational measures humana may take will successfully mitigate any negative effects of star quality ratings for the  bonus year or that humana will not experience a decline in membership growth for  or  as a result of the company’s  bonus year star ratings if humana fails to effectively implement its operational and strategic initiatives particularly its medicare initiatives statebased contract strategy and its participation in the new health insurance exchanges the company’s business may be materially adversely

determined payment rates potential restrictions on profitability including by comparison of profitability of the company’s medicare advantage business to nonmedicare advantage business or other changes in the governmental programs in which humana participates the healthcare reform law including the patient protection and affordable care act and the healthcare and education reconciliation act
