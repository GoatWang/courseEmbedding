dividends currently series e have historically been declared on or about the th of february may august and november and typically paid on or about the th of march june september and december how can i reinvest my dividends there are two ways to enroll in the dividend reinvestment plan  registered holders may join the plan by completing and signing an authorization form and returning it to the plan administrator or by following the enrollment procedures specified on the administrator’s website at wwwamstockcombeneficial holders who wish to join the plan must instruct their broker bank or other nominee to arrange participation in the plan on the beneficial holder’s behalf  the broker bank or other nominee should then make arrangements with its securities depository and the securities depository will provide the plan administrator with the information necessary to allow the beneficial holder to participate in the plan to facilitate participation by beneficial holders we have made arrangements with the plan administrator to reinvest dividends and accept optional cash payments under the stock purchase program by record holders such as brokers banks and other nominees on behalf of beneficial holders  if you are an interested beneficial holder be sure that your broker bank or other nominee passes along the proceeds of any applicable discount to your account alternatively a beneficial holder may simply request that number of shares the beneficial holder wishes to be enrolled in the plan be reregistered by the broker bank or other nominee in the beneficial holder’s own name as a record holder in order to participate directly in the plan here is a link to the full prospectus in a pdf format that has a detailed qa section dedicated solely to the plan the enrollment form if you choose to set up a registered record holder account is on pages  of the pdf what is a net lease and why is that your preferred method of leasing properties to tenants a net lease requires the tenant of a property to bear many of the costs associated with the property  such costs would typically include real estate taxes maintenance insurance and utilities many times our properties are leased on a triple net lease basis  our new york stock exchange ticker symbol is “nnn” because this is the real estate industry moniker for triple net lease  we strongly believe that using net leases provide increased stability to our rental revenue over the long term because we’re insulated against increases in these property operating costs what happens when a tenant goes bankrupt and closes a store bankruptcy by a tenant does not necessarily mean loss of rent or vacancy  tenants in bankruptcy must reject a lease before they can stop making rent payments  we have had a few cases of retailers filing for bankruptcy and never missing a rent payment to us during their reorganization process  if they do reject the lease they must vacate the property and we can then seek to release the property to another user   national retail properties inc s orange ave ste  orlando fl nnnreit  contact us terms of use site map national retail properties inc  orlando  fl  company information
