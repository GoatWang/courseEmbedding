of the seven nominated directors are independent nonemployee directors flanigan shepard wilson fiegel wimsett and kelly qualify as “independent” in accordance with the published listing requirements of nasdaq mr prim does not qualify as independent because he is an employee of the company the nasdaq rules have both objective and subjective tests for determining who is an “independent director” the objective tests state for example that a director is not considered independent if he or she is an employee of the company has been an employee within the prior three years or is a partner in or executive officer of an entity to which the company made or from which the company received payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed  of the recipient’s consolidated gross revenue for that year the subjective  test states that an independent director must be a person who lacks a relationship that in the opinion of the board would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director the board of directors relies upon evaluation of director independence by the board’s governance committee in assessing independence under the subjective test the governance committee took into account the standards in the objective tests and reviewed additional information provided by the directors with regard to each director’s business and personal activities as they may relate to the company and its management based on all of the foregoing as required by nasdaq rules the governance committee made a subjective determination as to each of mses shepard fiegel and kelly and messrs flanigan wilson and wimsett that no relationship exists which in the opinion of the committee would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director the governance committee has not established categorical standards or guidelines to make these subjective determinations but considers all relevant facts and circumstances in making its independence determinations the governance committee considered transactions occurring since the beginning of its  fiscal year between the company and entities associated with the independent directors or members of their immediate family while a customer relationship does exist between the company and the credit union associated with ms shepard the governance committee has determined that because of the amounts involved in relation to the total revenues of the company and such institution the relationship does not impair the independence of this director the governance committee has also determined that the transactions with the credit union were on terms no less favorable to the company than arrangements with other unaffiliated customers in all cases and in all years reviewed the amount received by the company from this institution was far less than  of the company’s total revenue for the year see “certain relationships and related transactions” below in addition to the boardlevel standards for director independence the directors who serve on the audit committee each satisfy standards established by the securities and exchange commission the “sec” providing that to qualify as “independent” for the purposes of membership members of audit committees may not accept directly or indirectly any consulting advisory or other compensatory fee from the company other than their director compensation the board of directors recommends that you vote for the election of each of the nominees for election to the board of directors  proxies received by the board of directors will be voted for the election of each nominee unless stockholders specify in their proxy a vote of withhold with respect to a nominee corporate governance the company and its businesses are managed under the direction of the board of directors the board generally meets a minimum of four times during the year but has complete access to management throughout the year      corporate governance guidelines the board of directors has adopted corporate governance guidelines which address the following subjects • the majority of the

implemented this pay for performance principle with the following elements of compensation      base pay fixed and recurring cash compensation  base pay is set at market competitive levels to attract and retain highly qualified and effective executives  fiscal  base pay was increased from  to  in response to competitive market data annual incentive cash bonus variable cash compensation tied to annual operating income versus budget and individual performance  fiscal  operating income was  of budget representing a  increase from prior year  fiscal  bonus payments were  to  above targets resulting from strong operating income and individual performances longterm incentive compensation performance shares that vest based on jack henry relative total shareholder return “tsr”

   tsrchange in stock price  dividends ÷ beginning stock price assumes reinvestment of dividends in the aggregate the relative portions of these three primary elements that made up the pay mix for the four named executives in fiscal year  are represented graphically in the following chart the fiscal  pay mix established by the compensation committee clearly focused on performancebased pay and particularly emphasized longterm performance by the company the pay mix was intended to ensure that the named executives remained highly focused on the longterm success of the company  compensation philosophy and objectives jack henry’s compensation philosophy is to offer compensation programs to our executives that • focus executives on achieving consistent earnings growth • encourage continuation of the company’s entrepreneurial spirit • attract and retain highly qualified and motivated executives • reward the creation of stockholder value and • encourage esprit de corps and reward outstanding performance in meeting these objectives the compensation committee strives for the interests of management and stockholders to be the same  the maximization of stockholder value to this end the financial performance measures are operating income and total shareholder return both measures emphasize a focus on revenue growth operating efficiencies to yield strong margins and returns to shareholders in excess of our peers the compensation programs specific to our named executives are administered by the company’s compensation committee the current members of the compensation committee are all nonemployee directors who are independent under the nasdaq rules the compensation committee operates under a written charter and has the specific charter responsibility to approve the compensation of the named executives and the company’s chief operating officer controller senior vice presidents and other officers who perform policymaking functions for the company at this time the company does not have any officer with the title of chief operating officer or senior vice president the compensation committee designs and maintains compensation programs consistent with our executive compensation philosophy to achieve the following objectives • to attract retain and motivate highly qualified executives by offering compensation programs that are competitive with programs offered by companies in our compensation peer group • to link performance and executive pay by tying bonus amounts to achievement of key objectives under the company’s annual business plans as well as specific individual performance goals • to reward competitive performance in comparison with peers in our industry • to reward the creation of longterm stockholder value through longterm incentive compensation awards and encourage significant stock ownership by top management to further align executive interests to those of our stockholders in pursuit of these objectives the compensation committee believes that the compensation packages provided to the named executives should include both cash and equitybased compensation with an emphasis on performancebased pay compensation element purpose base salary  represent competitive practices at approximately the  th  percentile  attract and retain highly qualified executives annual cash incentive  support payforperformance orientation  focus executives on executing the annual operating plan and key financial and nonfinancial measures of success longterm incentive  align interests of executives and stockholders  support a stock ownership culture  drive longterm value creation broadbased benefits  attract and retain highly qualified executives  reflect the broad practices at jack henry termination provisions  align management and shareholders to review all possible business alternatives  process for establishing compensation the compensation committee has overall responsibility for making decisions regarding the compensation of the named executives in conducting an annual performance review and determining appropriate compensation levels for the named executives the compensation committee meets and deliberates outside the presence of the named executives and other members of the executive management team with respect to the compensation levels for other named executives the compensation committee considers input and recommendations from the chief executive officer performance reviews of our chief executive officer and each other named executive are based on objective and subjective evaluations of individual performance as well as their performance in the preceding fiscal year in achieving company performance objectives while our chief executive officer makes recommendations concerning salary adjustments cash bonus programs and award amounts for the other named executives the compensation committee exercises its discretion and sole authority to set the compensation of the named executives in designing compensation programs and determining compensation levels for the named executives for fiscal year  ending june   as well as for fiscal year  the compensation committee was assisted by an independent compensation consultant firm the compensation committee engaged towers watson a global human resources consulting firm to serve as its independent advisor and compensation consultant with respect to fiscal  the chairman of the compensation committee worked directly with towers watson to determine the scope of the work needed to assist the committee in its decisionmaking processes the engagement of the consulting firm included provision of benchmark comparative data for the named executives with respect to base salaries annual cash bonuses long term incentives and comparative data regarding severance towers watson does not provide any other consultation or services to the company or management the compensation committee has assessed the independence of towers and determined that no conflict of interest exists under the rules established by the sec the compensation committee reviews the independence of its advisors annually in making compensation decisions the compensation committee compared each element of total direct compensation against a peer group of publicly traded companies in the software payments and data processing industries against which the compensation committee believes we compete in the market for executive talent we collectively refer to this group as the “compensation peer group” in selecting companies for the compensation peer group the compensation committee has considered multiple criteria including industry annual revenue and market capitalization the current compensation peer group is comprised of the following  companies aci worldwide inc bottomline technologies inc broadridge financial solutions cardtronics convergys corelogic dst systems inc euronet worldwide inc fair isaac corporation fidelity national information services inc fiserv inc global payments inc heartland payment systems inc micros systems inc moneygram international ssc technologies holdings total systems services inc tyler technologies inc verifone systems wex   the compensation peer group is reviewed annually and as appropriate is updated by the compensation committee the compensation peer group was fully reevaluated and revised by the compensation committee with towers watson in  again in june  the compensation committee reviewed the compensation peer group to make sure that members of the group are consistent with the company’s industry and financial scope and comparable in terms of size and labor pool in addition the committee’s decisions regarding peer group members were mindful of investor advisory group considerations such as the peers used by institutional shareholder services to review the company’s executive compensation for comparison purposes jack henry’s annual revenues are near the median revenues of the members of the compensation peer group the committee decided to make no changes to the company’s compensation peer group in  to benchmark each element of total compensation for our named executives towers watson provided data from two key sources  an executive compensation survey reflective of our industry and the general industry and proxy statements and  other public filings for the companies in our compensation peer group in reviewing compensation survey data the compensation committee considered data for software companies with annual revenues similar to the company sources of data for compensation surveys and analysis include surveys for our compensation peer group and the software industry in addition to proxy statements and other public filings by companies in our compensation peer group                   in setting fiscal  compensation the compensation committee considered benchmarks for total cash compensation ie base salary and annual cash incentives and approved target bonus levels for the named executives which combined with the salaries approach the  th percentile of the compensation peer group in targeting total cash compensation and longterm incentive compensation at or near the  th percentile the compensation committee recognized that there are certain limitations in the market data available for the compensation peer group thus in addition to considering levels of compensation suggested by market data the compensation committee also considered other relevant factors including performance against preidentified objectives under business plans for the preceding fiscal year individual performance reviews and internal equity for compensation levels among our executives the allocation between cash noncash shortterm and longterm incentive compensation is measured against the practices of our compensation peer group and reflects the compensation committee’s determination of the appropriate compensation mix among base pay annual cash incentives and longterm equity incentives to encourage retention and performance actual cash and equity incentive awards are determined by the performance of the company and the individual depending on the type of award compared to established goals for the fiscal year ending june   the elements of the compensation mix included • base salary designed to attract and retain executives • annual cash incentive bonus compensation designed to focus on business financial and individual objectives established by the board for the year • longterm incentive compensation consisting of performance shares which are earned by achieving levels of total shareholder return compared to our compensation peer group designed to focus executives on the longterm success of the company as reflected in the market price of the company’s stock and • broadbased employee benefits programs base salary in fiscal  the compensation committee considered competitive data provided by towers watson based on this data as well as individual and corporate performance the committee increased the base salary of the chief executive officer by  the chief financial officer by  and the chief technology officer by  the president’s base salary was not increased the entire base salary structure for our executives remained relatively flat in fiscal  with the ceo salary less than  times the second highest paid executive officer president and less than  times the third highest cfo although the compensation committee believes that competitive base salaries are necessary to attract and retain a highly qualified and effective executive team it also believes that a significant portion of executive compensation should be based on payforperformance annual incentive cash bonuses it is our practice to provide named executives with the opportunity to earn annual incentive cash bonus compensation under programs that reward attainment of key objectives under corporate annual business plans the objectives that underlie our annual incentive compensation programs may vary between fiscal years and between the named executives but generally include objectives that reward attainment of targeted earnings as well as individual performance goals in setting the bonus amounts a named executive is eligible to earn for achieving specified objectives in fiscal  the compensation committee targeted bonus and total cash compensation levels at or near the  th percentile of the compensation peer group and published survey data bonus opportunities for achieving objectives are generally established as a percentage of an executive’s base salary and the percentages increase with job scope and complexity executives have the opportunity to earn reduced bonus amounts if a minimum level threshold of performance against an objective is achieved and can also earn increased bonus amounts for performance in excess of the level of targeted performance the decision as to whether to offer an annual incentive cash bonus program to named executives for any fiscal year the type and funding of any program offered and the objectives that underlie any program are subject to the discretion of the compensation committee and its assessment of general and industry specific conditions existing during the applicable period in determining the amount of bonus that a named executive is eligible to earn under a bonus program the compensation committee may also exercise negative discretion to reduce an award based on its assessment of the executive’s contribution  and accountability for the objectives that are the subject of the bonus the internal equity of the executive’s bonus opportunity as compared to bonus opportunities for our other executives and any other factors the compensation committee considers relevant to provide an appropriate structure for cash bonus incentives the compensation committee previously proposed the  annual incentive plan which was approved by the board of directors and was ratified by vote of the stockholders at the  annual meeting cash bonus incentives for fiscal year  were structured under the  annual incentive plan the fiscal  incentive cash bonus plan established for the named executives was similar to the  plan in that it was based  upon achievement of the company’s annual budget operating income target the fiscal  annual incentive plan provided that no bonus was payable unless the company’s performance on the operating income measurement was at or above the threshold for achievement the operating income target was established from the annual budget of the company as approved by the board and excludes from consideration operating income contributions from operating units that might be acquired during the year the annual budget is developed by management with input from the board of directors in a thorough process that builds upon departmental forecasts and considers historical performance industry dynamics and macroeconomic trends the other  of each named executive’s incentive cash bonus in fiscal  was determined by achievement of individual performance goals set for the officers by the compensation committee these goals varied from individual to individual and included both objective and subjective measures of performance the individual performance goals were intended to align the individual officers with the company’s business strategies and objectives in each officer’s sphere of duties and control examples include achievement of specified customer and employee satisfaction ratings implementation of systems completion of development projects meeting specified financial goals and achievement of sales goals these individual goals are keys to financial and business success for jack henry and thus contribute to producing income and shareholder returns over the longterm grading of performance on the individual performance goals was in some cases “achieved” or “not achieved” and in other cases on a sliding scale from fail to below target at target and above target and thus some individual performance bonus amounts varied from zero to target and above target the  plan called for bonuses of  of base compensation for the chief executive officer  of base compensation for the president  of base compensation for the chief financial officer and  of base compensation for the chief technology officer at predetermined performance targets the operating income component of the annual bonus for the named executives ranged from a threshold of  of budgeted operating income to a target at  and to a maximum at  bonus payouts for operating income achievement ranged from  of target at threshold performance to as much as  of targeted bonus at maximum performance bonus payouts for achieving individual performance goals varied from  to  and in a few instances could range to a maximum of  as to specific scalable goals the overall bonus percentages and ranges were determined primarily by reference to comparative compensation data provided to the compensation committee by its independent advisor the maximum bonus was intended to be payable only upon truly superior performance the compensation committee intended for this bonus plan to provide a strong incentive for management to meet and exceed budgetary income and individual performance goals in fiscal  the company performed well in fiscal  producing operating income of  million or approximately  of budgeted operating income of  million the resulting payout was  of target of the portion of the named executives’ bonus determined by operating income the full fiscal  incentive bonus granted including amounts granted for achievement of individual performance goals was as follows named executive target annual incentive as  of base performance on incentive measures annual incentive payout  fy operating income performance  of bonus individual performance goals performance  of bonus  of target amount  jack prim ceo      tony wormington president      kevin williams cfo      mark forbis cto       although bonuses have been earned in each of the last five fiscal years the compensation committee notes that the plan is not structured to require the payment of bonus in every year and performance targets are not set at levels which are easy to achieve the compensation committee continues to believe that annual cash bonus opportunities are highly effective motivators for management employees and are instrumental in obtaining excellent performance in comparison with the company’s competitors in a difficult market and economy the committee believes that the costs to the company of potentially large incentive bonuses are fully justified by the potential benefits and return to our stockholders the compensation committee will in future years continue to thoroughly review the effects of the bonus plan on results achieved and will make any changes to the bonus plan deemed necessary    in addition to the cash bonus opportunities under our formal payforperformance cash bonus programs the compensation committee may choose to reward extraordinary performance and achievements by awarding discretionary bonuses to the named executives and other employees from time to time that are not part of the annual incentive plan or any other plan with respect to the named executives no discretionary bonuses were awarded based on company performance or the executives’ performance during fiscal  longterm incentive compensation we believe that equity awards have been instrumental in building jack henry  associates in retaining talent and in encouraging management to take the longterm view with regard to strategic decisions they face equity awards also help focus executive and employee attention on managing the company from the perspective of an owner with an equity stake in the business since the adoption of the current restricted stock plan in  the compensation committee has had the authority to grant restricted stock awards of various types and to determine the terms of the restrictions on granted shares with respect to fiscal years    the company granted longterm incentive compensation in the form of shares of restricted stock to our named executives in fiscal years  and  longterm incentive compensation granted to these officers was primarily in the form of restricted stock units with performancebased vesting and in fiscal years  and  longterm incentive compensation was granted in the form of performance shares grants may be made annually in the future but future grants will continue to be discretionary and amounts may fluctuate based upon the compensation committee’s evaluation of performance from year to year in determining the level of award for a named executive the compensation committee considers relevant factors such as achievement of previously identified objectives the executive’s performance comparative data from the compensation peer group and other sources the current equity ownership and stock options held by the individual executive and the internal equity of the level of award granted to the executive compared to awards granted to other executives in reviewing the award levels for our named executives the compensation committee believes it is appropriate to consider the company’s performance against key objectives under its corporate business plan for the preceding fiscal year including objectives related to revenue and earnings targets and whether the company’s performance during the preceding fiscal year benefited stockholders through appreciation in the market price of the company’s common stock in administering the equity compensation programs the compensation committee monitors the level of dilution that can result from equity awards to executives and other employees and considers the dilutive effect of the company’s aggregate equity awards during any fiscal year the specific grants to the named executives for fiscal  were structured as performance shares that vest only on achievement of performance goals and thus strongly reflect the principle of payforperformance a grant of performance shares is a contractual right to receive stock andor cash in the future when vesting conditions are met the specific grants of performance shares in fiscal  to the named executives vest at the end of three years based on total shareholder return in comparison to the compensation peer group over the three year period for this purpose total shareholder return “tsr” was defined as ending stock price minus beginning stock price adjusted for splits and similar changes plus dividends per share paid over the performance period all divided by the beginning stock price a target amount of stock was set for each named executive that may be earned if tsr at the end of the threeyear period is at the rd percentile in comparison to the compensation peer group vesting ranges from  of the performance shares at the  th percentile to the maximum amount of the grant  of target at or above the  th percentile relative to the compensation peer group no shares will vest if performance is below the  th percentile threshold by setting the target amount at the  rd percentile the committee continued to convey that longterm superior performance is expected and remains the goal of this incentive program the  performance share grants to the named executives were approved in target dollar amounts with grant date accounting values roughly set at  times base salary for mr prim  times base salary of mr wormington  times base salary of mr williams and  times base salary of mr forbis the fiscal  grant amounts were determined with reference to  comparable grants of longterm incentive compensation by other members of the compensation peer group and published survey data and were roughly targeted at the  th percentile of the compensation peer group the fiscal  grant amounts were generally consistent with fy target levels the  awards were structured to provide incentives for longterm performance and retention and to meet goals for specific accounting treatment retention is encouraged by grant terms which immediately forfeit all awards that have not vested or are still restricted in the event that the grantee’s employment with the company is terminated for any reason other than in the event of death incapacity retirement or in connection with any change in control the use of performance shares allows for flexibility in addressing the orderly retirement of grantees the performance shares contain terms which allow for the prorata vesting of awards upon retirement based on full months of service following the date grant for this purpose retirement is defined as termination with the stated purpose of retirement after  years of service to the company after the age of  and  years of service or after the age of  and  years of service with respect to a retirement during the term at the end of the three year term of the grant the award will be calculated and a prorata portion will be settled to the grantee based on completed full months of service for example if an eligible grantee retires  months after the grant date he would be credited with  months of service and would be entitled to onehalf of any amount that vests on performance measured at the end of the threeyear grant death or incapacity of a grantee is addressed in the same manner with prorata vesting based on completed months of service upon a change in control of the company the target number of performance shares vest and will be settled regardless of the performance measures achieved president tony wormington did retire at the end of fiscal year  following a  year career with the company his outstanding restricted stock units and performance shares from grants in fiscal years   and  will be eligible for prorata vesting of these awards upon completion of the successive performance periods the committee notes that as to restricted stock units issued to the named executives in fiscal  that vested based on three year tsr performance the company performed at the superior level of the  th percentile resulting in issuance of  of the restricted stock units granted in fiscal  the committee also notes that as to the fiscal  awards of restricted stock to messrs prim wormington and williams that contained provisions for accelerated vesting based on fiveyear tsr performance the fiveyear measurement of tsr performance as of june   showed that the company was at the th percentile and thus did not meet the contractual requirement of superior  th percentile performance as a result this twoninths portion of the fiscal  award did not vest in  and will instead time vest in  termination benefits agreements each of the named executives has entered into a termination benefits agreement with the company that is discussed in this proxy statement under the caption “agreements with executive officers” these agreements reflect the concern of the board of directors that any future threatened or actual change in control such as an acquisition or merger could cause disruption and harm to the company in the event of the resulting loss of any of its key executives the termination benefits agreements are intended to provide a measure of incentive and security to the executives through the resolution of the threat or through a change in control the compensation committee believes that such agreements should not include provisions that would obligate an acquirer of the company to make large cash payouts to our named executives simply because a change of control has occurred because of this concern the occurrence of a change of control event alone will not trigger any cash payment obligations to our named executives under their respective agreements payment obligations only arise in the event the named executive’s employment is terminated or is deemed to be terminated without “cause” as defined in the agreements within the period commencing  days prior to and for two years following a change in control for the named executives the company does not provide nor has it ever provided excise tax grossup payments to any employee in the event of a change in control and termination payment obligations under the termination benefits agreements with the named executives are two times the current annual base salary plus target bonus payable  in twelve equal monthly installments and  in a lump sum at the end of the monthly installments health and other benefits are also continued for  months for the named executives and all stock options and restricted stock awards become fully vested the benefits provided were determined primarily by reference to comparative data provided to the compensation committee by its independent advisor and at least in relation to base salary are consistent with the prior agreements which they replaced the benefits are believed by the compensation committee to be sufficient to provide the desired incentive and security to retain crucial personnel in a time of disruption  the termination benefits agreements have no set term and will continue until terminated by agreement of both the parties the agreements specify that they do not confer on the executives any right to continued employment and shall not interfere with the right of the company to terminate the executives at any time the awards of longterm incentive compensation to the named executives in fiscal  in the form of performance shares vest by their terms solely on a change in control and do not also require the actual or deemed termination of the executive for vesting   broadbased benefits programs the company offers certain broadbased benefits programs including benefits such as health dental disability and life insurance health care savings accounts employee stock purchase plan paid vacation time and company contributions to a k employee savings plan benefits are provided to all employees in accordance with practices within the marketplace and are a necessary element of compensation in attracting and retaining employees there are no additional benefits programs for our named executives stock ownership guidelines the board of directors has established stock ownership guidelines for the named executives other members of management and the nonemployee directors of the company these guidelines provide for each covered individual to hold a number of shares of the company’s common stock with an aggregate market value that equates to a specified multiple of the employee’s base salary or in the case of directors of their annual cash retainer the guidelines are four times base salary for the chief executive officer three times base salary for president and chief financial officer one time base salary for the vice presidents and general managers and four times the annual base retainer for directors the value of each person’s share holdings for purposes of the guidelines includes all unrestricted and restricted shares held all company shares held in the person’s retirement accounts all shares held in trust for the person’s immediate family members and the inthemoney value of all company stock options held unvested restricted stock units and performance shares are not counted for purposes of measuring compliance with the stock ownership guidelines even though all members of management now hold a number of shares at or above the number of shares specified under the guidelines the compensation committee recognizes that executive officers or employees who were recently promoted to executive officer positions and newly elected directors may require some period of time to achieve the guideline amounts the guidelines therefore contemplate a fiveyear transition period for acquiring a number of shares with the specified market value the guidelines also require that until the applicable ownership level is achieved the individual should retain and hold  of all shares received from vesting of shares or exercise of options net of shares sold to pay taxes the compensation committee will continue to monitor each executive’s and director’s progress towards and continuing compliance with the guidelines executive compensation recoupment policy in  the board of directors adopted a formal policy for the recoupment of incentive compensation paid to executive officers in the event the company is required to restate its financial statements due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements the recoupment policy is administered by the compensation committee tax deductibility and executive compensation section m of the internal revenue code generally limits the corporate deduction for compensation paid to the chief executive officer and other named executives to  million per individual unless certain requirements are met which establish that compensation as performancebased the compensation committee has considered the impact of this tax code provision and attempts to the extent practical to implement compensation policies and practices that maximize the potential income tax deductions available to the company by qualifying such policies and practices as performancebased compensation exempt from the deduction limits of section m the compensation committee will continue to review and modify our compensation practices and programs as necessary to ensure our ability to attract and retain key executives while taking into account the deductibility of compensation payments  compensation and risk under its charter the compensation committee is charged with review of risks related to the company’s compensation policies and practices in  the compensation committee directed the human resources general manager of the company to conduct a compensation risk assessment and to report to the committee the assessment reviewed design features characteristics and performance metrics used in compensating all employees of the company including salaries sales incentives incentive bonus plans and longterm equity incentive compensation awards the compensation committee reviewed and discussed the report and concluded that the company’s compensation programs policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company this conclusion was based on a number of factors including • the compensation levels and practices are generally judged to be uncomplicated and fair • benefits are offered to all eligible employees on nondiscriminatory bases and no material perquisites are offered solely to executives or management • incentive bonuses are determined either wholly or largely on total company financial performance and are capped at reasonable levels • compensation of executive and senior managers is balanced between salary benefits annual cash incentive bonuses and longterm equity incentive awards resulting in appropriate balancing of short and longterm interests and goals • executives and senior managers are subject to stock ownership guidelines which align their interests with those of the stockholders • the company has adopted a recoupment policy providing for the clawback of executive compensation in the event of financial restatements  executive compensation s ummary compensation table the following table sets forth certain information with regard to
