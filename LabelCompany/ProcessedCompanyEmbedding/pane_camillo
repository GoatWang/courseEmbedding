classfield fieldnamebody fieldtypetextwithsummary fieldlabelhiddendiv classfielditemsdiv classfielditem even propertycontentencodedpthe first question people often ask is lsquowho is reckitt benckiserrsquo our company name may not be familiar but our brands ndash finish dettol nurofen vanish durex strepsils veet air wick ndash are very well known most of them are literally household names found in kitchens bathrooms medicine cabinets and bedrooms nationwidep pbut the company itself is in fact only ten years old ndash the result of a merger between the german company benckiser and the english company reckitt amp colman we are a truly global company with  employees operating in more than  countries across the world and selling in  at the time of the merger we were a poundbn company wersquore now an poundbn company having outperformed all of our global peer group year on year we have seen net revenue sales growth in high single digits and doubledigit growth in net income profit every year since  in  growth was  and  respectivelyp preckitt benckiser rb market capitalisation has also quadrupled in the past ten years and is now around poundbn as evidence of this success we have moved from being in the bottom  of the ftse  to being in the top p pnbspp pstrongnbsprbrsquos brandsstrongp prbrsquos business is driven by  global powerbrands see diagram which are all in categories that have good growth potential and global reachp pthese are supported by a portfolio of strong local brands also leaders in their own markets for example in the uk this includes the brands lemsip e and optrexp pnbspp pnbspstrongthe rb visionstrongp prbrsquos vision is very clear improving peoplersquos lives through delivering better solutions which make a real difference this means an ongoing commitment to constant and continuous innovation typically onethird of rbrsquos global net revenue comes from products launched in the previous three years but there are other features of the rb culture that i believe lie behind our success and make the rb business different from many other companiesp pnbspp pnbspstrongspeed of executionstrongp prb may be smaller than many of its major competitors but it has a culture which is based on speed of thought decisionmaking and execution and it is this that has made it more successful this is achieved partly because of a very flat management structure but also because of rbrsquos lsquocan dorsquo culture ndash and the entrepreneurial spirit found at every level a very good example of how quickly we are able to move is the case of the air wick air freshener product called freshmaticp pin  while we were already the leader in aircare in the uk we realised that a great deal of innovation was going on in this market and to stay ahead of our competitors we needed to make a real step change the biggest segment in this category then was the standard aerosol the one that you spray all the time but the drawback was that after a few minutes the fragrance dissipates and you canrsquot smell it any more so we saw the opportunity to develop a product that would deliver fragrance in a continuous wayp pwe looked at the sort of air fresheners that you find in public bathrooms which need to do this and decided to bring this concept to the consumer marketp pthe important point here however is how quickly the whole freshmatic project was accomplished it took only eight months from the moment that we tested the concept with consumers to the moment that we launched into the market in the uk this not only included the need to build a factory in china but also added a whole new technical dimension to the products we were having to deal with wires and cables and batteries ndash a production process that was new and complexp pwe launched the first freshmatic product in the uk in  and within  months it had been rolled out to  countries but being rb it didnrsquot stop there subsequently there have been regular innovations to the product including the introduction of the first ever motion sensor air freshener the most important thing is that once the consumer insight need had been identified and the product idea generated we did this quickly rb created a whole new market segment this segment now represents approximately  of the global sales of all air freshenersp pnbsprbrsquos business has many global powerbrands in categories that have good growth potential and global reachp pnbspp pstrongan obsession with brandsstrongp pmarketing is at the core of rb everyone working in the business loves and is excited by our brands in fact i would go as far as to say we are obsessed with them so much so that rb believes in maintaining very high levels of marketing investment even in a downturnp pwe believe that we must continue to communicate with our consumers itrsquos like a friendship when you stop talking to your friends the friendship becomes a bit weaker and allows room for new relationships and naturally we never want that to happenp prbrsquos objective is to strengthen our friendship with our customers and consumers every dayp pto this end in  the company invested  of net revenue in media spending alone and when you add in the rest of the marketing mix the spend is significantly higher unlike many other companies this figure has gone up year on year despite the economy the  increase in media spend was a  increase on p pthis is also demonstrated by the fact that in the uk rb is in the top ten overall advertisers and is the third biggest tv advertiser few people would expect a company of our size to be such a large tv advertiser in the uk but it underlines the fact that our obsession for the brands is matched by a consistent investment in media and marketingp pwe are also swiftly becoming a major investor in digital spending where rb is pushing marketing boundaries for example at the end of  in the uk we launched an iphone application for nurofen ndash the first for any healthcare brand we also recently launched an interactive facebook page for lemsip so even in otc remedies which is perceived to be a more traditional sector wersquore trying to innovate all the time we try to communicate with our consumers in those areas where they get their information and this changes with their needs and demandsp pthe company has even created two groundbreaking global business games on facebook the first powerbrands launched last year and is focused around our brands in the first three months after it was launched it had three million hits on the site  active users of the game and already ranked in the top  games out of  games in facebookp pearly in  a second game urban thrill centred on the popular freerunning sport and also based on the companyrsquos powerbrands was launched in ten rb markets ndash including the uk usa brazil and russia ndash across facebook portals and our websitep pdesigned to create awareness of rb among graduates and people early in their business careers we want them to know how entrepreneurial the culture here is and it makes our job so much easier if people already understand something about us and are selfselecting it is one more innovative way of bringing our brands and in this case our culture to consumers using the digital space ndash the importance of which is growingp pstronga truly global companystrongp pa global company can be defined in different ways in rb we see our employees as lsquoglobal citizensrsquo ndash working for the global company not individual markets alone for instance among the senior operating management team there is an american running germany a belgian running brazil and i am an italian running the uk business and irsquove worked and lived in the states and in brazilp pwe encourage our employees to move around a lot because we believe that sharing learning about what works and what doesnrsquot work in different countries and challenging the local status quo is a key element in rbrsquos recipe for successp pbut being truly global doesnrsquot mean that everything is decided at a global level with each country just implementing central plans on the contrary at rb our strategy is to optimise all the benefits of being a global player while maintaining a very high level of involvement from the local countriesp pfor example in the uk as a lead market in many categories my team is involved in the development of most innovations most advertising campaigns in fact in every decision that is about strategy for our brandsp pi think this is a key differentiating point for rb compared with our competitors it allows all the benefits of global brand development while maintaining a closeness to the consumers in the different countries which we believe is criticalp pstronga very entrepreneurial culturestrongp pthe rb philosophy is that good ideas come from anywhere ndash and that once they are accepted we should give full support responsibility and credit where it is deserved a recent example of our entrepreneurial approach is brasso ndash a little can of metal polish that is over  years oldp pthis is clearly a brand that hasnrsquot received much innovation in its long life but in february of last year a firstyear graduate came to me with an idea he wanted to produce a variant of brasso for cleaning ipods tv screens computer screens phones and other similar usesp pso i told him to prepare a business case come back in a month and if the management team liked it and saw its potential we would develop it this product ndash brasso gadgetcare ndash was launched a few months later by the graduate who was involved in everything including pitching to all the major retailers even those outside our normal customer base such as comet amazon and pc world indeed in this case we delivered not just what we believe is going to be a successful product in a new area but also one that enhances the brasso brand equityp pthe point is that success needs an environment where people at every level are encouraged to speak up to express and defend their views we should allow ideas to flourish and above all we need to listen my colleagues and i really believe in ownership at an early stagep pnbspstrongconstructive conflictstrongp pthis means not always looking for consensus itrsquos about being fast agile spotting opportunities and doing what it takes to get to market first sometimes that means not waiting to gain consensus but encouraging everybody to contribute early on really listening to their suggestions but then someone having the courage and support to make a quick decisionp pthat is rb leadership most importantly once you take a decision you must have  commitment of everybody involved despite the fact you didnrsquot look for consensus and this means having good debates heated debates being direct being straight but ultimately a deal has to be put on the table and together the team will agree the plan to best support itp pstrongapproptiate rewardsstrongp prb offers the freedom and the responsibility to develop new ideas from an early stage and we also provide the opportunity for very fast career developmentp pthis means disproportionate pay for disproportionate performance ndash but in the end it is the total rb culture that attracts and keeps people here and which is incredibly motivatingp pstrongsocial responsibilitystrongp pundoubtedly rb is a driven environment but that doesnrsquot apply just to our commercial dealings that passion is also evident in the way we look at our environmental and social responsibilities recently for example rb took the top spot in the ftse  for carbon disclosure and carbon performance alongside the royal bank of scotlandp pthis is a very important achievement for us because a few years ago we launched our very ambitious carbon  initiative which promised a programme reducing our total global carbon emissions by  by  we have clear kpis linked to this in everyonersquos objectives but milestones like this prove it is a target we can and will reachp pwe are also one of the key commercial supporters of save the children we have already raised poundm for the charity since  and we have now set a target to raise another poundm but we donrsquot just give money ndash that is not the rb wayp pwe are also encouraging all our teams to lsquodo something bigrsquo and this includes hundreds of our employees from around the world at every level visiting the projects we are involved in to provide positive physical support or raising cash as part of our own rb global challenge this year for example includes  people from around the rb world making a challenging journey and rebuilding childrenrsquos infrastructure in brazilp pat rb everyone at every level is responsible for and enters wholeheartedly into everything we do most of all it is the responsibility of all of us to always be looking for new effective ways of doing it ndash ways that make a real differencep pbeing truly global doesnrsquot mean that everything is decided at a global level on the contrary at rb our strategy is to optimise all the benefits of being a global player while maintaining a very high level of involvement from the local countriesp pstrongemthis article is an edited version of a presentation given at the marketing society conference november  by camillo pane
