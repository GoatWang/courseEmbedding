flextronics  sell the newsjun  about enphase energy enph henrik alex momentum eventdriven shortterm horizon techsummarycompany most likely transfers marketing and selling rights for some older and noncore product lines to its long standing manufacturing partnerthe move will help the cashstrapped company to bring down operating expenses and working capital requirementstodays analyst day presentation also alludes to these aspectsgiven the character of the agreement i do not expect flextronics to pay a material license fee to enphasethe substantial move in the stock price provides investors with a decent opportunity to dispose of existing positions or outright short the sharescashstrapped microinverter producer enphase energy nasdaqenph shares have been soaring in tuesdays premarket session and are currently up by roughly  as of the time of this writing thanks to news of the company having signed a license agreement with electronics manufacturing services giant flextronics nasdaqflex on june   enphase energy inc enphase entered into a master license agreement agreement with flextronics industrial ltd flextronics under which enphase licenses its intellectual property to flextronics in order to allow flextronics to market manufacture and sell certain enphase products such rights may be used to assure continuity of supply to enphase customers the above description of the agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement a copy of which will be filed as an exhibit to enphases quarterly report on form q for the period ending june   picture enphase s and iq microinverters moreover deutsche bank is out with an upgrade on the stock from sell to hold this morning as yesterdays analyst day obviously went quite well that said investors chasing the stock here are most likely getting the news wrong while the company has not filed the complete agreement with the sec yet i do not expect this transaction to result in material cash inflows for enphase readers should note that flextronics has already been enphases microinverter manufacturing partner for eight years now so this is not a new relationship judging by the statement that such rights may be used to assure continuity of supply to enphase customers actually points to enphase further streamlining its selfmarketed product portfolio by transferring the marketing and selling rights of some older or noncore product lines to flextronics which has already manufactured these products for years for enphase the transaction will most likely help enphase to bring down operating expenses and working capital requirements in fact the company alluded to all of these aspects in todays analyst day presentation given the assumed character of the agreement i would actually be surprised to see a cash payment from flextronics to enphase here theres more evidence for my take on the transaction as the company does not disclose any numbers and has not even issued a press release so far in short enphase is suffering from fierce competition and has been severely pressured by liquidity issues as of late despite raising tens of millions in new capital during q and ongoing efforts to bring down its expense structure the company is still expected to burn meaningful amounts of cash going forward which might very well require just another capital raise in the second half of this year theres plenty of uptodate coverage on enphase available on seeking alpha investors looking for more color on the company should start with the articles from fellow contributors morningsidepark and enertuition while the stock price has already decreased more than  from  peak levels there might be more downside ahead particularly if the company once again fails to meet financial targets going forward like it has already been the case several times in the recent past bottom line sell the news enphase is most likely disposing of some older and noncore product lines in a move to bring down operating expenses and working capital requirements as also stated in todays analyst day presentation accordingly i do not expect flextronics to pay a meaningful license fee the violent premarket move provides investors with a decent opportunity to finally dispose of the companys shares or even outright short the stock while momentum traders will undoubtedly try to get behind the stock this morning i fully expect their attempts to ultimately fail and the share price to come back meaningfully over the course of the session despite the deutsche bank upgrade most likely providing some additional tailwinds personally i am looking forward to the momentum crowd trying to move the stock big time this morning and initiate a short position once price action and trading volume are starting to weaken as always dont bet the farm on short positions and adequately manage your risk disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a short position in enph over the next  hours i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other than from seeking alpha i have no

equity tech smallcap long onlysolarkings llc  sunshine state  floridasummaryenphases new technology could be a game changer like the apple iphone wasenphases thgeneration microinverter promises a lower cost while still maintaining superiority to the older central string inverter  power optimizer solutionworld leaders are pushing renewable energy — the market is hugeenphase now has a new invention a new home energy solution to sellenphases storage solution gives the company a whole new revenue stream and complements their existing product portfoliowell cupertino is not that far from petaluma so maybe there is some synergy there it hasnt even been a month since my last article on enphase energy nasdaqenph and the simplicity and ease of installation of enphases microinverterbased solar pv systems is going viral like the first iphones that hit the streets almost a decade ago the residential solar pv system which offers almost  guaranteed uptime for the systems lifetime is selling globally  and now enphase has a simplistic new storage system to accompany it  a whole new market and the best part is that what enphase energy has done for residential solar pv systems by empowering customers with the ability to easily manage and monitor their own solar systems they are now doing for battery storage and selling a complete package  the enphase home energy management system do new and existing solar pv customers need to think about storage with their solar photovoltaic solution yes they should are net metering and fits contracts going to last forever most likely not and in places like australia new zealand and hawaii to name a few existing and new solar customers are turning to storage to address the policy changes so that they can store the energy their solar systems create instead of supplying the utility grid for free there is an old saying victory favors the prepared and enphases longrange vision has prepared them for these changes in policy and they are ready to take the advantage  enphase energy chose energy over solar in their company name because their longrange vision always has been to be a home energy system provider  the new enphase home energy management system is their masterpiece the beauty of enphases ac battery storage unit compared to most of the competitors is that theirs doesnt push the mortgage the farm slogan upon you to buy their solution  instead they work with your budget allowing you to buy some storage now then more later on when your budget permits because of their storage products modularity they can give the customer the lowest costofentry into this new market their new storage solution can be retrofitted into any existing solar pv solution out there and that gives them a much bigger audience why should a customer have to make a time huge investment in a single vendors storage technology when this safer purchasing option is available the same way enphase sells their microinverters is the way they are proceeding with their storage solution each of their ac battery storage units includes its own microinverter  giving each ac battery complete autonomy from the others  a complete extremely elegant lightweight safe and certifiedmodular scalable allinone unit older battery storage solutions required complete cooperation between each battery device and if any one battery had an issue it compromised the whole battery farm that is all the interconnected batteries with enphases ac battery storage solution there is  fault tolerance so that even if an ac battery unit fails the other ac battery units will continue working independent of the failed device giving the customer true reliability this faulttolerance is a powerful attribute and this is enphase not only do most of the competitions products not have enphases product modularity they do not have their storage device designed with its own internal stateoftheart microinverter most storage solutions require multiple devices to install multiple points of failure multiple vendors to deal with  with enphase its a single vendor single product sku  enphase is simplicity remember when you had to buy the pc buy the keyboard buy the mouse buy the monitor et cetera now you have your single ipad or macbook pro or single whatever solartedges storedge the tesla battery the ac transformer device  they all come from different vendors you need to purchase all of them in order to set up your homes storage solution if any of them fail then your whole storage solution is down and for who knows for how long the ac battery is a single modular independent device which when configured with multiple ac batteries gives the customer  fault tolerance with the lowest costofentry using the computing analogy from above which storage product do you think people will desire more as we embrace the internet of things its easy to see why enphase is growing market share and globally too people want cool products and people want it to be simple to install and maintain there are over half a million enphase customers out there with more coming onboard daily an enphase problem is a problem not a crisis a solaredge nasdaqsedg sma otcpksmtgf abb nyseabb or fronius central string inverter failure is a crisis  why because when you realize your central string inverter is no longer working for your solar pv system you really dont know how long your entire solar system will be down for and you are at the mercy of the installer the string inverter vendor and your friendly utility company as a solar customer and installer i dont want a crisis  a single failed microinverter problem sure i will accept that for example if i were to experience a microinverter failure today i could take care of it some time next week after labor day during normal business hours knowing from the monitoring of my homes solar system using my browser that the other  microinverters of my system were still running fine  that is the power of microinverters over a single central string inverter since installation of my solar system in  i have yet to experience a problem and i have  enphase microinverters enphase is proving their new storage system is cuttingedge in the australia  new zealand market right now an article in the australian financial review on august  claims enphase is more than doubling their initial sales projections with  battery systems projected for the year alone a comparison of the ac battery product to competing products gives excellent marks to enphases ac battery enphases success in the storage battleground regions of australia and new zealand mean only that they will also do well in even bigger markets like hawaii europe and the usa a new market means new revenue streams new customers  new customers do not have to be existing enphase customers they could be a solaredge convert or some other central string inverterbased solar system enphases cofounder raghu belur stated that dumb box solar systems with no internet intelligence would eventually be replaced by decentralized smart electronics like enphases much like the mainframe computers gave way to decentralized servers and pcs so too will central string inverterbased residential solar pv systems be superseded by decentralized microinverterbased residential solar pv solutions it is only a matter of time and the superior technology is gaining marketshare more and more installers are realizing the ease of installation simplicity and reliability of an enphase microinverterbased solar pv solution theyre super quick to install easy to manage and they are  faulttolerant offering the customer continuous uptime has the solar market been beat up lately yes it has the doom and gloom of sunedison has appeared to give the solar industry a black eye but enphase energy is in a different niche the itc expiration fears were a potential nail in the coffin for the solar industry but thanks to our congress that fear evaporated overnight this past year and this just wasnt some blind act by congress no it was a realization by the politicians that solar is the fastest growing industry in the country and that equates to future tax revenue solar is coming on strong because it is getting affordable  it is not just for the wealthy any longer the gtm article on september  titled global solar demand monitor q  states that this year is set to be another record breaker for solar globally with the market set to grow by  remember when apple macintoshes cost  to  and only a select few could afford them now everyone has some form of one the same progression is happening with solar pv and storage today and enphase is in the catbird seat  they have their own solar home energy management system ready to go if climate change is real if big coal is being shuttered if peak oil has been reached if europe and other countries are coming to the realization that they dont want to be oil importers  then we are on the verge of a mass renewable energy transformation minimizing the need for hydrocarbons oil gas coal as much as humanly possible in a bestseller entitled the true story of the bilderberg group the author daniel estulin writes that at secretive annual meetings heads of state leaders of corporations us presidents and other leaders are the real decision makers and these leaders have decided that renewable energy is the way to go and renewable energy can free us from a potential catastrophe when hydrocarbons run out like oil for they are not infinite resources whether or not you believe in that happening whether or not you believe in climate change things are abuzz with renewables  you could say enphase energy is at the right place and the right time kind of like apple computer was with the iphone at these secretive annual bilderberg meetings one of the prevailing subjects of discussion continues to be energy according to jan lundberg an oil energy expert the usa lost between  and  of its energy supply during hurricane katrina in   yet the saudis did not increase production noting that the question was raised has peak oil been reached and is the world on par for diminishing returns on oil were the saudis pumping as much as they could without being able to increase production due to physical limitations in  then british foreign secretary jack straw stated the depletion of gas reserves in the north sea and the irish sea…it is expected that britain will have to import  percent of its gas by  within years it is expected that europe will have to import more than  of its oil and  of its gas in  french prime minister and bilderberg member dominique de villepin was quoted by reuters saying we have entered the postoil era i want to draw all the consequences of this and give real impulse to energy savings and to the use of renewable energies former cia director james woolsey in an interview with the washington post in june  stated the energy crisis should have a severe impact global in scope and be difficult to solve in a januaryfebruary  article titled the new petroleum for the journal foreign affairs he stated the underlying goal of the un force in gulf war i which included  american troops was to ensure continued and unfettered access to petroleum if world leaders at these secretive bilderberg group meetings constantly focus on the issue of energy and they are calling for massive transition to renewables on a global scale then clearly a gold nugget like enphase energy has some serious potential to play a part in the big picture for enphases concept of true faulttolerance modularity and reliability is the superior solution for solar systems on the residential rooftops  it is the best system for the customer my monthly utility bill was outrageous before i started adding solar to my home in  i found that  of the energy my utility purchased was from big coal if climate change is real then is big coal going to flourish or will it slowly be retired my utility companys ceo has posted letters in the companys monthly periodical warning customers what big coals demise truly means in terms of supply and demand and billing if he thinks coal is being retired then surely renewable energy is something to embrace and pursue as one of the most intelligent species on the planet we must try to address global problems and save our planet right overpopulation is a problem right in  there were  billion people in  there were  billion people now in  there are  billion people on our planet earth ok so humans are a problem but feeding the livestock the humans consume is the real crux  there is just not enough earth available to grow all the feed needed for those animals ever work on a farm with a lot of pigs or cattle whats that one thing that is everywhere that one smell methane is worse than carbon dioxide ten times over in terms of causing the greenhouse effect but changing peoples eating habits affecting even bigger industries than coal is going to be an even greater monumental task to address is everyone ready to be a herbivore once again so solar energy is at least a more attainable goal by humans to try to lessen their carbon footprint on the earth with elon musks rocket exploding on  on the launch pad in cape canaveral destroying facebooks satellite and their attempt at giving africans wireless we had better save this planet first before we consider mars i am a fan of elon musk but it is clear that colonizing the red planet is still a ways off and in reality how many of us could pull a matt damon and be a martian it just does not look that desirable a life this is the planet to save this is the only planet we really have so solar is here to stay regardless of the political rhetoric you might hear from politicians who appear to not favor renewable energy  these politicians take orders or advice from the bilderberg members more or less in reading bilderberg and cfr member zbigniew brezinskis  book the grand chessboard it shows the true blueprint for americas energy policy aka world energy policy coming straight from the minds of the true leaders  the same leaders who are advisers to the potus and to other leaders around the world renewable energy is here to stay and the transformation is just beginning enphase is preparing to debut their thgeneration microinverter at solar power international  in las vegas september    this is a big event for enphase for it follows the analyst day projections made last november of major cost reductions in their microinverter product now juxtapose this with enphases global market growth and their new market revenue stream and you have a serious revolution underway just like their web site states the numbers below represent about weeks of data  through  these statistics show growth not only in the united states but all over the world the beauty of social media is that people are learning better ways to do things more quickly than ever before in such a brave new world enphases product superiority is becoming wellknown maybe in the preinternet days monopolies could trounce a superior product to protect their inferior one but with facebook twitter youtube and so on it is hard to keep a superior product down  information is flowing too freely these days in multiple directions and multiple channels and that can be a good thing especially for enphase which can take advantage of the marketing muscle of the global media outlets microinverters are winning the mlpe module level power electronics war and the venerable central string inverter even with its bandaidlike power optimizers must fade into history as enlightened customers choose reliability and faulttolerance for their home energy system customers will not want a home energy solution which can be completely disabled due to a single component failure enphase microinverters are the future of solar on the residential rooftops public enphase systems coming online from  through  western usa  over  systems  almost  growth midusa  almost  growth easternusa  over  systems  solid  growth southeastern usa  almost  growth mexico  central america  almost  growth south america  almost  growth united kingdom   growth europe  almost  growth india  sri lanka regions  almost  growth hawaii   growth northern australia  almost  growth southwestern australia  almost  growth eastern australia  solid  growth new zealand  almost  growth and this is just a little more than  weeks of data and it does not include all enphase systems or products either enphase is on fire and they are not burning up their rocket ship is taking off the upcoming november st conference call should be positive if anything it should show a trend towards profitability the goal is still an iphonesized microinverter and enphase is on track to reach that goal the upcoming conference call will demonstrate marketshare gains with new market revenue streams the threat of the older inferior solar technology gaining more marketshare due to cheap pricing will be shown to be subsiding yes central string inverters were a great invention by sma otcpksmtgf in  and the  power optimizer gave the older technology some more life but the fact remains that the microinverter with its  faulttolerant topology is the superior technology the lower price wins regardless of superiority just as long as it can do the job  the very existence and profitability of solaredge has proven that but it is only a won battle not the war when the superior system the enphase microinverterbased one is at or near the same cost of the inferior one the central string inverter with power optimizers then customers will choose the better system enphase energys debut of their thgeneration microinverter this month in las vegas is going to bring that reality closer to fruition furthermore if you consider the  competing solutions with the microinverterbased system there is one less device to purchase and install as compared to the central string inverter  power optimizers system affordability and cost are of utmost importance to the customer and cost must be measured against roi to verify the purchases reasonability a presidential hopeful recently reiterated some real old solar news stating solar had a year roi well factual proof is everything and i am sure the hopefuls advisers will enlighten him sooner or later if you are an installer a string of  talesun watt  efficient polycrystalline panels at watt with some  enphase m micronverters is an incredible deal put  solar strings of these panels on a roof and you have a watt system for under  material cost incredible and  of it is deductible just one panel string with enphase microinverters is just under  cost giving you watts at about  hours of daily solar insolation for example your roi is under years not including labor  is a lot less than  right i am sure people will challenge my numbers but all i am trying to convey is that solar is getting cheap affordable and that means it is not for the wealthy any longer and a huge market is opening up if we are going to save the planet then we are going to want as many rooves as possible to take part in this green energy revolution while you are having a peaceful labor day remember that the solar industry has had our nations fastest growth employing young american laborers  jobs and energy freedom can make the world great again and our leaders have made the decision to move in that direction as we approach the countrys most important election besides making america great again lets try to make our planet great again by reducing our carbon footprint globally as thomas edison once said id put my money on solar energy i hope we dont have to wait till oil and coal run out before we tackle that i am long on enphase i install solar for friends and neighbors i have attended the solar energy institute in paonia colorado i have assisted grid alternatives in colorado installing enphase microinverterbased solar systems i have consulted with a local florida solar company which prefers enphase and have seen firsthand what failed central inverters can cause in terms of both power loss down time and customer frustration since  i have designed and added onto my own homes solar system which now consists of  separate solar panel strings with  enphase microinverters producing upwards of almost watthours on a sunny day in the sunshine state my utility bill is history and i am fortunate enough to enjoy net metering with the utility company i generate solar energy credits which are reconciled at the end of the utilitys fiscal year in terms of roi alone my enphasebased solar system will be paid for in less than  years and it is money well spent  money which is clearly earning more than  interest in a bank account disclosure i amwe are long enph i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not

ac batterywhy have they given up on iti seriously doubt iti just think they wanted to hold something back because clearly they are in the process of not only adding the iq to it but also working to get the cost down dramaticallyhere is a short excerpt from the last ccand the reason for that is that those relationships take a very long time to develop and right now our capital is best used in the development of the iq  storageso we know the iq will be in the acb and with it the wattage will increase to around  wattsbut what elsehere is another excerptbut now that we have it now that its out there now that we have that experience were looking at every aspect of it from the chemistry to the mechanical engineering to the inverter itself to a lot of the internal workings of the acb and we are going to come out with  and we are going to continue to reduce price throughout the end of this year and i think by the end of the year we will have yet again a far more costeffective solutionenph has already stated they believe every solar system sold within  years will include a batterywhich is why they are not giving up on the acbim thinking the end game is to bring rodgers two investments

website enphasecom footnotes  references financials from enphase energy  enphase energy is a nasdaqlisted energy technology company headquartered in petaluma california enphase designs and manufactures softwaredriven home energy solutions that span solar generation home energy storage and webbased monitoring and control enphase has shipped about ten million solar microinverters primarily into the residential and commercial markets in north america europe and australia microinverters convert the direct current power from the solar panel dc directly into gridcompatible alternating current ac for use or export enphase was the first company to successfully commercialise the microinverter on a wide scale and remains the market leader contents  history  products  legacy products  current products  references  external links historyedit a number of companies and institutes had promoted the solar microinverter concept through the s the basic idea is to reduce the power handling of a conventional inverter design so that it matches the output of a single panel this so reduces the size of the inverter that it can be placed on the back of the panel producing an ac panel such a system can be connected directly to the grid or to each other to produce larger arrays this contrasts with the traditional solar inverter approach where many panels are connected together in series on the dcside and then run enmasse to a single larger inverter several products based on the microinverter concept were introduced in the s and especially the early s but none were widely successful due to a number of factors in the aftermath of the  telecoms crash martin fornage of cerent corporation was looking for new projects when he saw the low performance of the string inverter for the solar array on his ranch he formed enphase energy with another cerent engineer raghu belur in  backed by  million in private equity in  they released their first product the m to moderate success their nd generation product s m was far more successful with sales of about  units in  and early  enphase quickly grew to  marketshare for residential systems by mid aiming for  by yearend they shipped their th inverter in early  and their th in september of the same year the rd generation m was released in the summer of  and had sold over a million of all models in  bringing their installed base to  million inverters and  market share a th generation the m was released in  as of update their inverters captured  market share for residential installations in the us which represents  of the entire world microinverter market this makes them the sixth largest inverter manufacturer of any kind worldwide enphase has experimented with the european market starting in france and offering sales in france belgium the netherlands luxembourg and italy however they had considerably more success in the uk and later australia as of update approximately  of their sales is outside north america enphase continues to see increasing pricing pressure due to rapidly falling prices in the inverter market in spite of several effects that should cause stability prices for inverters are predicted to fall  during  market leaders especially face continued market share erosion in the face of newer companies most of them from the far east productsedit an enphase m mounted and grounded all enphase microinverters are basically the same internally with differences in the maximum amount of power they can handle and the cabling system being the major differences between models legacy productsedit the m was their first product released in  it was designed to output  watts of ac power but is capable of up to  over that the m was packaged in a relatively large cast aluminum box similar to the boxes used on cable tv amplifiers seen on telephone poles wiring was passed through the case using compression fittings and the inverters connected to each other using a twistlock connection a limited number of m models based on the same generation system were also available for a limited time due to a high level of failures the m was recalled and replaced by the m in  the m offers a slightly higher power rating of  watts peaking to  the system was packaged in a much smaller case this time filled with epoxy potting material to handle heat dissipation and builtin cable connections replacing the earlier compression fittings the system was otherwise similar using the same connectors and cabling as the m and the two designs could be mixed in a string like its predecessor the m the m has also been plagued by a high failure rate around the same time the company also released the d which was essentially two ms in a single larger case for small inverters like the m the case and its assembly represents a significant portion of the total cost of production so by placing two in a single box that cost is spread out the d also introduced a new interinverter cabling system based on a drop cable system this placed a single connector on a short cable on the inverter and used a separate cable with either one or three connectors on it arrays were constructed by linking together up to three ds with a single drop cable and then connecting them to other drop cables using larger twistfit connectors current productsedit in  the entire lineup was replaced with the rd generation m combining the features of the m and d like the m the m was a single inverter now in a much smaller box like the d the m used a trunk cabling system with short connector cables on the inverters however instead of one or threedrop cable the ms engage system used a long roll of cables with connectors spliced into it the installer cuts the engage cable to the required length and then caps the open ends that result in  the m was released offering a new grounding system that eliminates the otherwise nec  required external grounding conductor increased reliability and increased efficiency  along with a rating bump to w whereas previous models were all named after the maximum power rating the m actually refers to its peak power using the same convention the m would be called the m the m is otherwise identical to the earlier m and compatible with the same engage cabling system all enphase models use power line communications to pass monitoring data between the inverters and the envoy communications gateway the envoy stores daily performance data for up to a year and when available allows enphases enlighten web service to download data approximately every  minutes customers and installers can review the data on the enlighten web site in  the company launched its fifth generation of products the s and s microinverters have the highest efficiency for modulelevel power electronics at  offer advanced grid functionality like reactive power control and comply with regulatory requirements like electric rule  in california and rule h in hawaii the nextgen envoys

renewable energy solar energy high tech founded  founder raghu belur and martin fornage headquarters petaluma california united states key people paul nahi ceo products microinverters home energy storage revenue us million  operating income us million  net income us million  number of employees  website enphasecom footnotes  references financials from enphase energy  enphase energy is a nasdaqlisted energy technology company headquartered in petaluma california enphase designs and manufactures softwaredriven home energy solutions that span solar generation home energy storage and webbased monitoring and control enphase has shipped about ten million solar microinverters primarily into the residential and commercial markets in north america europe and australia microinverters convert the direct current power from the solar panel dc directly into gridcompatible alternating current ac for use or export enphase was the first company to successfully commercialise the microinverter on a wide scale and remains the market leader contents  history  products  legacy products  current products  references  external links historyedit a number of companies and institutes had promoted the solar microinverter concept through the s the basic idea is to reduce the power handling of a conventional inverter design so that it matches the output of a single panel this so reduces the size of the inverter that it can be placed on the back of the panel producing an ac panel such a system can be connected directly to the grid or to each other to produce larger arrays this contrasts with the traditional solar inverter approach where many panels are connected together in series on the dcside and then run enmasse to a single larger inverter several products based on the microinverter concept were introduced in the s and especially the early s but none were widely successful due to a number of factors in the aftermath of the  telecoms crash martin fornage of cerent corporation was looking for new projects when he saw the low performance of the string inverter for the solar array on his ranch he formed enphase energy with another cerent engineer raghu belur in  backed by  million in private equity in  they released their first product the m to moderate success their nd generation product s m was far more successful with sales of about  units in  and early  enphase quickly grew to  marketshare for residential systems by mid aiming for  by yearend they shipped their th inverter in early  and their th in september of the same year the rd generation m was released in the summer of  and had sold over a million of all models in  bringing their installed base to  million inverters and  market share a th generation the m was released in  as of update their inverters captured  market share for residential installations in the us which represents  of the entire world microinverter market this makes them the sixth largest inverter manufacturer of any kind worldwide enphase has experimented with the european market starting in france and offering sales in france belgium the netherlands luxembourg and italy however they had considerably more success in the uk and later australia as of update approximately  of their sales is outside north america enphase continues to see increasing pricing pressure due to rapidly falling prices in the inverter market in spite of several effects that should cause stability prices for inverters are predicted to fall  during  market leaders especially face continued market share erosion in the face of newer companies most of them from the far east productsedit an enphase m mounted and grounded all enphase microinverters are basically the same internally with differences in the maximum amount of power they can handle and the cabling system being the major differences between models legacy productsedit the m was their first product released in  it was designed to output  watts of ac power but is capable of up to  over that the m was packaged in a relatively large cast aluminum box similar to the boxes used on cable tv amplifiers seen on telephone poles wiring was passed through the case using compression fittings and the inverters connected to each other using a twistlock connection a limited number of m models based on the same generation system were also available for a limited time due to a high level of failures the m was recalled and replaced by the m in  the m offers a slightly higher power rating of  watts peaking to  the system was packaged in a much smaller case this time filled with epoxy potting material to handle heat dissipation and builtin cable connections replacing the earlier compression fittings the system was otherwise similar using the same connectors and cabling as the m and the two designs could be mixed in a string like its predecessor the m the m has also been plagued by a high failure rate around the same time the company also released the d which was essentially two ms in a single larger case for small inverters like the m the case and its assembly represents a significant portion of the total cost of production so by placing two in a single box that cost is spread out the d also introduced a new interinverter cabling system based on a drop cable system this placed a single connector on a short cable on the inverter and used a separate cable with either one or three connectors on it arrays were constructed by linking together up to three ds with a single drop cable and then connecting them to other drop cables using larger twistfit connectors current productsedit in  the entire lineup was replaced with the rd generation m combining the features of the m and d like the m the m was a single inverter now in a much smaller box like the d the m used a trunk cabling system with short connector cables on the inverters however instead of one or threedrop cable the ms engage system used a long roll of cables with connectors spliced into it the installer cuts the engage cable to the required length and then caps the open ends that result in  the m was released offering a new grounding system that eliminates the otherwise nec  required external grounding conductor increased reliability and increased efficiency  along with a rating bump to w whereas previous models were all named after the maximum power rating the m actually refers to its peak power using the same convention the m would be called the m the m is otherwise identical to the earlier m and compatible with the same engage cabling system all enphase models use power line communications to pass monitoring data between the inverters and the envoy communications gateway the envoy stores daily performance data for up to a year and when available allows enphases enlighten web service to download data approximately every  minutes customers and installers can review the data on the enlighten web site in  the company launched its fifth generation of products the s and s microinverters have the highest efficiency for modulelevel power electronics at  offer advanced grid functionality like reactive power control and comply with regulatory requirements like electric rule  in california and rule h in hawaii the nextgen envoys offers revenuegrade metering of solar production consumption monitoring and integrated wifi the company also moved into home energy storage with its storage system featuring an ac battery a modular kwh lithiumiron phosphate offering aimed at residential users that is part of a home energy solution the home energy solution will
