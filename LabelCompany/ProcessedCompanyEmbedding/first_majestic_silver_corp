florian grummesflorian grummes contrarian momentum newsletter provider gold  precious metalsmidas touch consultingsummarymarket update on precious metals and cryptocurrenciesthe midas touch gold model is neutral since th of april gold  the summer lows are very likely insilver  flash crash capitulation and a huge opportunitybuy first majestic silver  endeavour silver corp market update it´s been a couple of tough days when silver experienced a flash crash and gold moved below its ma at  usd but the incredible pessimism among basically all precious metals investors and analysts was a great contrarian signal now gold and silver already do look better and i believe we might be right at the beginning of a multimonth bull run that could take gold towards  usd and silver towards  usd while the precious metals sector gets me excited these days the cryptocurrencies are to be handled with great care and skepticism obviously the wash out over the last couple of weeks is not over yet although some interesting opportunities do appear already this recent bull run has been so massive that we have to expect a long and frustrating consolidation for the rest of  but the crypto bull market is not over  it´s just taking a breather and some rest  the midas touch gold model neutral since th of april  the midas touch gold model™ remains in neutral mode since th of april  there have been a couple of days in july when it was very close to issue a bearish conclusion but it never happened now we have new buy signals on the daily chart for gold in usdollar in indian rupee and in chinese yuan as well the goldminers gdx flashed a buy signal five days ago the only real concern comes from the cotreport for the usdollar here the commercials have once again reduced their short position which brings this signal close to a sell signal for gold overall the model still calls for patience although it certainly has improved over the last couple of days be aware that it currently takes a move above  usd to flip the weekly gold chart to a buy signal  gold  the summer lows are very likely in rarely we can experience such a high level of pessimism like last week basically everybody was bearish  even the analysts that i like to follow everybody was calling for gold to move below  usd and even to crash towards  usd and lower although this extrem sentiment has not been reflected by the daily optix data from wwwsentimentradercom it was very obvious if you skipped through most of the precious metals sites and forums i think this is really great news as it is exactly what i was waiting for in this summer yes i thought gold could hold around  usd and the lows came in at  usd but now we have this very oversold set up on the daily and weekly chart in combination with a bullish cotreport and a strong seasonal cycle on top gold is sitting just  usd below its six year downtrend line at around  usd it did not loose eye contact and could now finally clear this level in just one or two trading sessions especially the weekly oversoldness gives a lot of room for a multimonth rally once gold can break out above the  usd resistance it should quickly run towards the next resistance around  usd after that the next target is  usd and as i have been writing for many months if gold breaks through this depressing six year downtrend line a multimonth bullish liberation rally towards around  usd until next spring is very likely of course i am just cooking with water like everyone else and of course i can not see into the future therefore we have to prepare a worst case scenario as well i think if gold now moves below  usd it is clear that the correction is not yet over and i´d advise to use  usd as the ultimate stop loss for any speculative trading positions physical investor should relax and not worry too much about any possible downside action gold will always make a comeback and is currently pretty cheap  especially in euro so this is a clear buy recommendation for physical gold and silver at current levels  silver  flash crash capitulation and a huge opportunity silver has been correcting since last july yes that´s  months in total it did not confirm the recent higher highs in gold but remained weak yet on friday th of july the tight silvermarket experienced a flash crash seeing the september contract dropping  within a couple of seconds from  usd down to  usd certainly another case of high frequency trading technical glitches blind algorithmic robots and a very questionable form of manipulation fortunately prices quickly recovered and are now back above  usd but as worrisome as it may have seem on this friday i think the silvermarket now is cleared from all the weak hands and any stops below the technical important levels around and below  usd you would need extremely deep pockets to sit through such a drawdown so i guess any speculative money has been shaken out and that´s very positive of course technically the chart is currently broken but i believe the  months correction has ended with a final capitulation that now opens up the door for a new multimonths rally we are just at the beginning with the recent flash crash experience in mind it is very clear again that trading silver doesnt make too much sense at all instead you should focus on the physical metal and on the silver mining stocks if gold can indeed move towards  usd by next spring silver should run towards  usd some of the top silver mining stocks can easily triple or even quintuple during such a move therefore i will come up with two new buy recommendations   buy first majestic silver up to  usd nyse ag it´s been the right thing to wait with any recommendation in the mining sector but now i feel the time is right as explained i believe silver has a great potential over the next  months the most promising way to play a multimonth rally in silver are some of the best but currently beaten down silver mining stocks first majestic silver without a doubt is one of the best companies in this sector focused on silver production in mexico the company is run by mining legend keith neumeyer here is a very interesting interview with him although first majestic has been consolidating sideways since october last year i think the stock is at a very interesting juncture we might be a bit early to the party but the riskreward is just phenomenal with a stop loss at  usd and a st profit target at  usd the idea has an initial  riskrewardratio but first majestic could easily take out  usd and we might scale in a couple more times once the stock has cleared the downtrendline at  usd buy first majestic silver up to  usd nyse ag place a stopp loss at  usd first profit target  usd timeframe  months riskreward   buy endeavour silver corp up to  usd nyse exk another silver stock that i really like and that i have already recommended in the past is endeavour silver corp although endeavour had some issues in the last couple of months i continue to believe in bradford cooke and his team endeavour was one of the best performing silver stocks in the first half  and should offer massive leverage in a new silver bull market technically the stock as corrected back to the retracement around  usd and is running into a bullish wedge with a stop loss at  usd and a st profit target at  usd this idea has an initial riskreward ratio of  buy endeavour silver corp up to  usd nsye exk place a stop loss at  usd first profit target  usd timeframe  months riskreward   cryptocurrencies have entered a multimonth correction the cryptocurrencies had a spectacular run in the last couple of months but since mid of june they all moved into a rather nasty correction bitcoin went below  usd already while ethereum lost more than  in six weeks yet they are oversold and getting interesting again i have been buying iota over the last couple of days it´s up  today   as well i continue to like dash and steem and i have been buying into recent weakness however it is rather difficult to come up with a decent riskrewardratio at the moment there is no need to rush overall the cryptocurrencies have very likely moved into a multimonth correction so you will need to have a lot of patience and must be very careful with your buying orders i dont think that the bubble has burst instead this is just another healthy and necessary correction within this great crypto bull market but it will take time most of the weekly charts are not yet oversold so there is more downside or at least sideways action to expect buy bitcoin below  usd stop loss  usd buy dash below  usd no stop buy steem below  usd no stop timeframe  months don´t put more than a maximum of  of your networth into cryptocurrencies and only use money

good newsjul  about first majestic ag gold mining bull long only gold  precious metals oil  gas contrarianmarketplacethe gold bull portfoliosummaryfirst majestic silver announced its q production resultsthe company produced  million silver equivalent ounces from its six operating mines in mexicoproduction was impacted by major stoppages at several of its minesi discuss its production results and where the stock could be headed nextfirst majestic weak production results first majestic silver ag was previously listed as my top overall silver stock to own in  after taking the no  spot the previous year and it was given the selection after hours of research and consideration to other companies i predicted the stock would outperform the silver miners index sil as well as peers such as endeavor silver exk i argued that there were numerous catalysts ahead for the growthfocused silver miner with its  year goal to produce more than  million silver equivalent ounces well first majestics growth plans hit a small speed bump this past quarter the company has released its production results for q and it says total production from its six operating silver mines was  million seos that consists of  million ounces of silver  ounces of gold  million pounds of lead and  million pounds of zinc credit first majestic silver website unfortunately silver production in q was impacted by unusual efforts by unionized workers to illegally disrupt mining activities which caused minor stoppages at la parrilla santa elena and a more serious stoppage at our la encantada operation according to the companys ceo the illegal blockage lasted a total of four days at la parrilla two days at santa elena and  days at la encantada he also added that worker dissatisfaction levels among union mining employees in mexico is at the highest levels witnessed in the company’s fifteen year history” this is worrisome as first majestic only operates in mexico its silver production fell by  quarteroverquarter gold production rose by  while lead production rose by  overall seo production fell by  in q thankfully the companys actions to clear the three blockades and resume mining activities were successful and it now expects production to get back on track in q while its construction of the new roaster at la encantada was unaffected by the work stoppage with completion still scheduled for early  still i do think this news leaves some question marks and uncertainty around the companys operations after all the company has no country diversification as first majestic only operates in mexico and has no plans to diversify the issues at santa elena and la parilla were quickly resolved but the issues la encantada took  days to resolve which is too long this mine will account for up to  million seos of production in  or approximately  of its forecasted production shares are up wednesday due to higher goldsilver prices and not due to the production results i’m still bullish on the company and the stock and think prices under  a share are attractive but i think the risks have increased with this latest news and i’m a little more cautious with recommending shares here there are a few other silver miners id prefer buying here over first majestic earnings will be released on thursday august  and i will be analyzing the results and providing early release access to my subscribers as longtime readers and subscribers of the gold bull portfolio may know my main focus has mainly been on gold mining stocks juniors and explorers with little exposure to silver this
