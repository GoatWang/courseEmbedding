liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases or decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates  notes to financial statements continued  significant accounting policies continued portfolio valuation the net asset value of the fund is determined as of the close of business at the end of any fiscal period generally monthly in accordance with the valuation principles set forth below or as may be determined from time to time pursuant to policies established by the board as of december   all of the fund s portfolio was comprised of investments in investment funds the board has approved procedures pursuant to which the fund values its investments in investment funds at fair value which ordinarily will be the amount equal to the fund s pro rata interest in the net asset value of each such investment fund  nav  as such value is supplied by or on behalf of the investment fund s investment manager from time to time usually monthly values received from or on behalf of the investment funds respective investment managers are typically estimates only subject to subsequent revision by such investment managers such values are generally net of management fees and performance incentive fees or allocations payable to the investment funds managers or general partners pursuant to the investment funds operating agreements the investment funds value their underlying investments in accordance with policies established by each investment fund as described in each of their financial statements or offering memoranda the fund s investments in investment funds are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective operating agreements and offering memoranda as appropriate while the fund does not currently intend to invest in investment funds which maintain side pockets as defined below as of the time of the fund s investment by a manner which would expose the fund to such side pockets one or more investment funds subsequently may establish such side pockets and therefore expose the fund and thus its shareholders to such side pockets side pockets are subfunds within the investment funds that have restricted liquidity potentially extending over a much longer period than the typical liquidity an investment in the investment funds may provide should the fund seek to liquidate its investment in an investment fund that maintains these side pockets the fund might not be able to fully liquidate its investment without delay which could be considerable in such cases until the fund is permitted to fully liquidate its interest in the investment fund the fair value of its investment could fluctuate based on adjustments to the value of the side pocket as determined by the investment fund s investment manager as of december   none of the fund s net assets were invested in side pockets maintained by the investment funds the adviser has designed ongoing due diligence processes with respect to investment funds and their investment managers which assist the adviser in assessing the quality of information provided by or on behalf of each investment fund and in determining whether such information continues to be reliable or whether further investigation is necessary such investigation as applicable may or may not require the adviser to forego its normal reliance on the value supplied by or on behalf of such investment fund and to determine independently the fair value of the fund s interest in such investment fund consistent with the fund s fair valuation procedures  notes to financial statements continued  significant accounting policies continued portfolio valuation continued where no value is readily available from an investment fund or where a value supplied by an investment fund is deemed by the adviser not to be indicative of its fair value the adviser will determine the fair value of the investment fund in order to determine the fair value of these investment funds the adviser has established the fund of hedge funds valuation committee the valuation committee  the valuation committee is responsible for determining and implementing the fund s valuation policies and procedures which have been adopted by the board and are subject to board supervision the valuation committee consists of voting members from morgan stanley s accounting financial reporting and risk management groups and nonvoting members from portfolio management legal and compliance groups a member of the portfolio management team may attend each valuation committee meeting to provide knowledge insight and recommendations on valuation issues the portfolio management team will recommend to the valuation committee a fair value for an investment using valuation techniques such as a market approach or income approach in applying these valuation techniques the portfolio management team uses their knowledge of the investment fund industry expertise information obtained through communication with the investment fund s investment manager and available relevant information as it considers material after consideration of the portfolio management team s recommendation the valuation committee will determine in good faith the fair value of the investment fund the valuation committee shall meet at least annually to analyze changes in fair value measurements because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation the fair values of the fund s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for these investment funds held by the fund been available income recognition and expenses the fund recognizes income and records expenses on an accrual basis income expenses and realized and unrealized gains and losses are recorded monthly the changes in investment funds fair values are included in net change in

identification income taxes the fund intends to comply with the requirements of subchapter m of the code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders therefore no provision for federal income taxes is required the fund files tax returns with the us internal revenue service and various states the fund may be subject to taxes imposed by countries in which it invests such taxes are generally based on income earned or gains realized or repatriated taxes are accrued and applied to net investment income net realized

annually distributions from net realized gains for book purposes may include shortterm capital gains which are included as ordinary income for tax purposes in order to satisfy the diversification requirements under subchapter m of the code the fund generally invests its assets in investment funds organized outside the united states that are treated as corporations for us tax purposes and are expected to be classified as passive foreign investment companies  pfics  as such the fund expects that distributions generally will be taxable as ordinary income to the shareholders pursuant to the dividend reinvestment plan established by the fund the drip  each shareholder whose shares are registered in its own name will automatically be a participant under the drip and have all income dividends and capital gains distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares unless such shareholder specifically elects to receive all income dividends and capital gain distributions in cash  notes to financial statements continued  significant accounting policies continued distribution of income and gains continued the tax character of distributions paid may differ from the character of distributions shown in the statements of changes in net assets due to shortterm capital gains being treated as ordinary income for tax purposes the tax character of distributions paid during fiscal  and  was as follows december   december   distributions paid from ordinary income     the amount and character of income and gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from us gaap these booktax differences are considered either temporary or permanent in nature temporary differences are primarily due to differing book and tax treatments in the timing of the recognition of gains losses on certain investment transactions and the timing of the deductibility of certain expenses permanent differences primarily due to tax adjustments on pfics sold by the fund resulted in the following reclassifications among the fund s components of net assets at december   accumulated undistributed net investment income loss

instruments with offbalance sheet risk in the normal course of business the investment funds in which the fund invests may trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities with offbalance sheet risk these include but are not limited to short selling activities written option contracts and swaps the fund s risk of loss in each investment fund is limited to the value of the fund s interest in each investment fund as reported by the fund  notes to financial statements continued  fair value of financial instruments the fair value of the fund s assets and liabilities that qualify as financial instruments approximates the carrying amounts presented in the statement of assets and liabilities fair value is defined as the price that the fund would receive to sell an investment or pay to transfer a liability in a timely transaction with an independent buyer in the principal market or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market for the investment or liability the fund uses a threetier hierarchy to distinguish between a inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and b inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes various inputs are used in determining the fair value of the fund s investments the inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below level  quoted prices in active markets for identical investments level  other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar investments or shortterm investments that are valued at amortized cost level  significant unobservable inputs including the fund s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments the inputs or methodology used for valuing investments are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those investments the units of account that are valued by the fund are its interests in the investment funds or other financial instruments and not the underlying holdings of such investment funds or other financial instruments thus the inputs used by the fund to value its investments in each of the investment funds or other financial instruments may differ from the inputs used to value the underlying holdings of such investment funds or other financial instruments the fund s policy is to recognize transfers between levels   or  and transfers due to strategy reclassification if any as if they occurred as of the beginning of the reporting period for the year ended december   the fund did not have any transfers between levels   or  in may
