when we generate revenues to pay the obligation the detection device industry is highly competitive we compete with a variety of companies many of which have greater financial and other resources than us or are subsidiaries or divisions of larger organizations in particular the industry is characterized by a small number of large dominant organizations that perform this service such as united technologies corporation radiation alert osun technologies lutron general tools mazur instruments first alert incbrk brands inc which is wholly owned by sunbeam corporation as well as many companies that have greater financial and other resources than us the major competitive factors in our business are the timeliness and quality of customer service the quality of finished products and price our ability to compete effectively in providing customer service and quality finished products depends primarily on our manufacturers’ standards and the level of training of our future staff the utilization of computer software and equipment and the ability to deliver the products we sell we believe we will compete effectively in all of these areas many of our competitors have substantially greater financial technical managerial marketing and other resources than we do and they may compete more effectively than we can if our competitors offer detection devices at lower prices than we do we may have to lower the prices we charge which will adversely affect our results of operations furthermore many of our competitors are able to obtain more experienced employees than we can company description we commenced operations in may  by selling products on consignment from a company owned by our majority shareholder in  we purchased products from a company owned by our minority shareholder and sold them to a company owned by our majority shareholder and to third party resellers we believe the terms of those sales were armslength in  we began use of the internet as well as the services of an independent sales representative to market the products to homeowners and interested customers in north america and the majority of our sales were from unrelated third parties we market the products to homebuilders and home renovation contractors we have had limited operations and have limited financial resources in  our operations were devoted primarily to startup development and operational activities as well as related party and third party sales which included  formation of the company  development of our business plan  evaluating various detection devices  research on marketing channelsstrategies for our detection devices and the industry  secured our website domain wwwquartaradcom and beginning the development of our initial online website and  research on future products to distribute  consignment sales on behalf of a related party  sales to third party resellers in may  we commenced our business operations by selling products on consignment from a related party company and developing our distribution network in june  we began to utilize our website to market the products we sell on consignment to our potential customers we also began implementing our business plan by promoting these products for sale on various websites we also engaged independent third party distributors to sell the products in  increased our internet presence and increased our sales whereby the majority of our sales were from unrelated third parties from  to the present we have continued to sell the products through the internet to unrelated third parties we believe that our principal source of revenue will continue to come from internet sales and sales to resellers of the following products radiation detection equipment radex rd – basic model of a handheld radiation

home radexlight software allows pc connection and data transfer spectral sensitivity is identical to a human eye which separates this model from the competition although we have commenced our marketing sales campaign with our own resources and are selling products through online retailers and through resellers we believe that we need additional capital to increase our sales and expand our marketing program our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to cost effectively purchase and sell the products and market them through the internet and through distributors we intend to rely on our chairman and president’s relationships in the industry to supply us with products and introduce us to resellers we also intend to market our website to the home renovation industry to solicit orders for the sale of products there can be no guarantee or assurance that our chairman or president andor our website will enable us to purchase products on attractive terms that will allow us to resale them to independent third party distributors no assurance can be given that the products we purchase will be sold to resellers and if sold to them will return an investment or make a profit to achieve the goal of purchasing products on favorable terms we plan to be selective in our choice of suppliers and work with our shareholders’
