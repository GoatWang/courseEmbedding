results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements are described in greater detail in the companys press release and the companys filings with the sec now i would like to turn the call over to dr todd brady president and chief executive officer of aldeyra dr brady todd c brady thank you steve today we are providing an important corporate update particularly as it relates to the progress of our clinical programs and most of which are now in late stage development accordingly i encourage you to carefully review the press release we issued this morning which summarizes the status of our specifications ph regarding these clinical programs as well as our first quarter  financial results that steve will review shortly to begin im pleased to announce that during the first quarter of this year the progress of our phase b clinical trial in allergic conjunctivitis and our phase a clinical trial in dry eye syndrome exceeded expectations in april of this year we announced that our allergic conjunctivitis trial completed enrollment in dosing relative to previous guidance we are accelerating the timing of expected results from the trial and we now expect data to be announced in june of this year the results of the trial will determine the feasibility size and number of trials for a phase  program and contingent on the results it is possible that the current phase b trial may qualify as one of two pivotal trials required for marketing approval in the united states it is important to note that allergic conjunctivitis represents a substantial market between  and  of the population worldwide is affected with the disease and while possible antihistamines are effective for the majority of the population an estimated  million or more patients in the united states require adjunctive therapy with corticosteroids which may be toxic and many more patients respond suboptimally to antihistamines were also refining prior guidance regarding the announcement of the results of our phase a clinical trial in dry eye syndrome which is proceeding ahead of schedule results from this trial are expected in the third quarter of this year dry eye syndrome also represents a large and relatively underserved market an estimated  to  of the united states population is affected with the disease and available therapy is often considered to be suboptimal by physicians and patients with regard to noninfectious anterior uveitis a rare inflammatory condition we announced in april of this year that our phase  clinical trial has been initiated consistent with prior guidance we expect results from the trial to be announced in the second half of next year because anterior uveitis is almost exclusively treated with corticosteroids which in many patients lead to serious ocular toxicities including glaucoma a lifelong and potentially blinding disease a medical need for a novel therapy is considerable finally initial top line data from our phase  clinical trial in sjögren larsson syndrome or sls are expected to be announced sooner than planned the phase  trial will be run in two parts the first part is a blinded vehicle control body surface area escalation read in that will be used to confirm statistical power for part two which is a vehicle controlled crossover design treatment for each part will be six months and depending on the results of part one the entire phase  is expected to enroll in estimated  subjects approximately one third of which will be enrolled in part one data from part one of the trial are now expected in the second half of next year sls is an orphan disease with no fda approved therapy there is considerable unmet need in sls highlighted by a severe skin condition known as ichthyosis which covers nearly the entire body surface and results in considerable physical and emotional burden the disease is caused by genetic mutations that lead to high levels of toxic aldehydes and given that our lead product candidate adx traps aldehydes our platform represents a mechanistically directed approach to the disease to coordinate the patient and physician community with our late phase clinical program we have recently established the aldeyra sls registry and in addition aldeyra and the sls community achieved a major milestone last month with the receipt of us fda orphan designation for adx in congenital ichthyosis last year we were pleased to announce positive data from a controlled phrase  clinical trial on sls as well controlled phase ii clinical trials in allergic conjunctivitis and noninfectious anterior uveitis our novel drug platform now in late stage clinical developments invalidated in phase  testing across three diseases is the first concerted pharmaceutical effort that targets proinflammatory and toxic aldehyde mediators and we believe represents a major clinical stage advance for the treatment of inflammation certain inborn errors of metabolism and other serious medical conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases that are thought to be related to aldehyde mediators and as always we look forward to updating you again shortly on the progress of our novel pipeline now id like to turn the call back over to steve to discuss the first quarter  financial results stephen tulipano thank you todd for the first quarter of  we reported a net loss of  million compared to  million from our  million loss for the same period in  basic and diluted net loss per share was  for the quarter compared to  per share in q  losses that resulted from the costs of our clinical trials and research and development programs as well as from general and administrative expenses research and development expenses were at  million for the quarter compared to  million for the prior year the decrease of  is related to reduction in expenses related to manufacturing and preclinical costs offset by a decrease in clinical development costs general and administrative expenses were  million for the quarter compared to  million for the same period in  the increase of  is related to an increase in personnel costs legal costs and other expense in q total operating expense is  million compared to total operating expenses of  million for the prior year period we ended q  with  million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and that concludes our remarks today thank you for your participation operator we would like to now open it up to questions hello operator can we begin to poll for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions i will go to adam walsh with stifel adam walsh hi guys good morning can you hear me todd c brady yes good morning adam how are you adam walsh i am well thanks hey congrats on all the progress it seems like the business is moving forward i had a couple of questions the first one on the orphan drug designations for adx in congenital ichthyosis i am just curious about the application or process for that when you apply for that do you actually  does the agency actually see the data that you have in house or is this something that they look at granting orphan drug in terms of the patient population addressed in terms of the size of that thats the first question thanks todd c brady yeah that is a great question adam yes the agency does consider and in some cases insist on clinical data because i dont think they want to waste time granting orphan designations to programs that are in a way invalidated i think its possible to receive orphan designation on preclinical data but i think it is rare and certainly in this case before the designation was granted the fda did review our phase ii data and we consider that certainly a positive sign that they moved ahead with the designation adam walsh thats great and on the allergic conjunctivitis data coming in june the phase b you mentioned todd may qualify as one of two pivotal can you give us a little bit more color on what the agency is thinking or you’re thinking around what it would take for the phase b to actually qualify as a pivotal thanks todd c brady yeah the fda’s criteria for a pivotal study in allergic conjunctivitis using the model that we’re using which is an allergen challenge model is a fairly well worn path as you know adam itching is the primary endpoint for most of these programs as it is in ours and its rated by the patient so the actual protocol as the drug is administered or vehicle or saline in our case is administered followed by allergen challenge which is a direct installation of allergen into the eye and then the patient rates itching on a scale of zero to three over a period of time yes they generally want to see approximately a point or so difference across two of three prespecified time points after allergen installation or challenge as it were and yes those criteria are hit in the current phase b study this study would qualify as one of two pivotal trials required for approval and thus we would expect phase  to look very similar to phase b except that the dose ranging component of course would be absent it would be a single dose versus control there are other studies required for registration such as safety studies but the mean to the application would be the two pivotal studies that ive described adam walsh thats great thank you so much have a good day todd c brady thanks adam operator and we will go next to ritu baral with cowen ritu baral good morning sorry i was muted i wanted to dig in a little further on the sls phase  that you discussed this morning you mentioned its two parts part a is about  patients with body area as the end point to confirm the statistics on the second part and that they were both six months does that mean the second part is three months three months plus three months or is the second part six months plus six months crossover or am i thinking about this wrong todd c brady no your last assumption is correct the latter statement is correct its six months crossover with six months with one segment of the population starting with drugs and crossing to vehicle and the other segment of the population starting with vehicle and crossing to drug is correct ritu baral and with part a just given that you think you can set powering with  patients what sort of delta or change in body area affected are you assuming at this point based off of your phase  and  results todd c brady the powering is augmented by our current results in phase  the difference between phase  and part one of phase  is that more body surface area will be treated and together those two trials will be used to estimate the power of the population size for part two of phase  as you know sls is not a common disease and in our discussions with the agency we made it clear that our one shot approach is reasonable for our final trial and we want to make sure that its powered appropriately so thats why we have the part one and part two designed in this case ritu baral are the baseline characteristics any different between the first data at phase  and the planned phase  todd c brady no they are essentially identical in fact every patient we’re aware of has moderate to severe disease we’re not going to change those criteria we may be enrolling slightly younger patients we will be adding international sites but the baseline characteristics of the disease in the patients we enroll will be identical ritu baral great thanks for taking all the questions guys todd c brady yeah thank you ritu operator the next question is from yale jen with laidlaw and company yale jen hi good morning and also my congrats for the speedy progress first question i have is with the dry eyes that you will have the data ahead of schedule in the third quarter of  what are the thoughts about having the second formulation study also started shortly after that or is it something to be decided when you have the data todd c brady right yes so we have as weve described previously two product candidates applicable to dry eye adx and then separately adx each has its advantages in dry eye syndrome as we have described previously i think youre correct yale that the timing of the adx trial which will be subsequent adx will depend on the data and the results of the first trial we have three formulations in the adx trial for dry eye syndrome two concentrations at  and  in our current formulation weve developed a novel formulation specifically for dry eye syndrome which is more of a lipid base formulation for the  strength were absolutely thrilled to see the results dry eyes as i mentioned is a tremendous unmet medical need were fairly convinced i think the medical community is fairly convinced that dry eye is substantially an inflammatory condition if you look at the two drugs approved for dry eye in united states they are both antiinflammatory medications we have proven with adx certainly recent phase  trials that the drug is a potent antiinflammatory therapeutic and thus were optimistic about the results in dry eye syndrome for  and we look forward to filing that with  at some point next year yale jen so if i read it at least from a commercial perspective that given that the patients sort of  is very different of driving the other few ocular indications that the maybe  is more of essential than simply just exploratory todd c brady yes i mean i think that true the patient populations are different across allergic conjunctivitis and uveitis and dry eye syndrome but the commonality amongst all the pieces is inflammation and i think what weve proven is that aldehydes are broad upstream inflammatory mediators that lead to all kinds of inflammation not just one kind or another i think the other thing thats interesting in dry eye syndrome not only should  and  block inflammation but these drugs also have the potential to preserve lipid function in the eye aldehyde degrade fats which are needed for ocular surface lubrication they also inhibit proteins that are responsible for moving fats around in the anterior surface of the eye so i think theres at least a couple of ways that  and  could work  as we disclosed last quarter is a little bit more suited to preserve the fat layer in tears the drug itself is a little more lipid full ph and well were sort of looking forward to compare the efficacy of  and  we do not expect  to move forward in allergic conjunctivitis or uveitis but we are eager to compare the two drugs in dry eye syndrome to your point yale the dry eye syndrome market is quite different from allergic conjunctivitis and uveitis and that is possible that that market deserves a separate product yale jen okay great thanks and last sort of question here to just followup the earlier one which is for the potential phase  or even  something with conjunctivitis study that we are sort of heading to sort of finish  hopefully finish what sort of safety database in terms of size you anticipate with the another phase  study will be sufficient or you need to have a larger exposure todd c brady that’s a very good question the fda is clear about the size of safety databases in ophthalmology generally those are in the couple of thousand patients range so another phase  clinical trial would not be sufficient but safety databases are relatively easy to acquire and a simple matter i think of blocking and tackling in terms of enrolling those additional patients for the safety database yale jen okay great thanks a lot again congrats on the speedy progress todd c brady thank you yale operator operator instructions and well go next to corey davis with wainwright corey davis thanks very much good morning first of all with respect to conjunctivitis lets assume that this study comes out positive at that point would you choose to take it forward on your own into another phase  or think about partnering at that point in time and then secondarily how good do you think this has to be not only to be statistically significant but to be commercially successful compared to all the other options out there right now todd c brady yes corey thats our favorite question at the moment because the more we learn about allergic conjunctivitis the more excited we become in terms of the market potential we’ve adjusted our vault last week and had numerous convocations with a variety of key opinion leaders in other companies in the ocular space i can tell you that interest in allergic conjunctivitis is growing and the answer to both of your questions is really the same there are two major underserved population in allergic conjunctivitis the first and the most obvious ones are those patients and as i mentioned in the comments on this call that are dependent on steroids there is about a million or so in united states that are estimated to be steroid dependent and that would require something other than antihistamines to treat their disease because of the toxicity of steroids adx is a logical choice as we’ve shown last year in the uveitis data adx does not manifest the toxicities that corticosteroids do at least that’s one option i think that option is something that a small company can commercialize we estimate theres about  anterior segment information centers in the us for the eye which could be covered with a very reasonable msl or sales force and i mean probably fewer than  representatives on the other hand the much larger market in allergic conjunctivitis are what we call antihistamine suboptimal responders that is patients that take antihistamines but don’t achieve an optimal response and are thus unsatisfied many of those dont take steroids just given the toxicity of steroids but simply remain unfulfilled in terms of the efficacy of antihistamines that could be up to a third of the allergic conjunctivitis population in the us if you assume that somewhere between  and  of the us population has a disease were talking tens of millions of patients and in terms of pricing weve discussed where branded steroids are in the  to  range if you multiply all those numbers out this is a tremendous multibillion dollar market so im glad you asked the question this is something that weve become more and more excited about the latter market probably would require a partner i dont think that is a small sales force given the size of the population but the upside is tremendous corey davis and how about in terms of percent of reduction what do you need in terms of numbers to be statistically significant and commercially relevant todd c brady well the fda requires clinically relevant rates which they define as weve discussed a few minutes ago is around a point difference in itching score between your control and your drug our argument is that if patients are required to take steroids to control their disease is that any change for an approved drug that is around the point of difference in itching should be market acceptable i think for antihistamine suboptimal responders it will depend on the magnitude of response that these patients are having to antihistamines but again i think with an approved drug on the market that doesnt work by blocking histamines and isn’t a steroid i think patients and physicians are like or likely to try the drug and clinical practice benefits in any way useful would stay off steroids and improve the response to antihistamines corey davis great thank you todd todd c brady thanks corey operator the next question is from john newman with canaccord john newman hey guys good morning congrats on the ahead of time progress just had a question on the dry eye study i apologize if you discussed this a little bit earlier on the call but could you describe some of the ways that you’ll be looking at the composition of lipid ph if youll be able to do that in this study or if you’ll look more at that aspect in the phase  thanks todd c brady great question john thank you so the dry eye study is as we mentioned its a three arm study it’s a treatment over one month or  days the endpoints of the study will be the standard signs and symptoms used to assess dry eye as you mentioned john we are particularly interested in tier film break up time which is an indicator of lipid function in the tears there are other measures that we intend to analyze in tears exvivo including aldehyde load so we’re obviously looking at a variety of different factors because there is a potential that the mechanism of our drug is multifactorial were looking at inflammatory and lipid measures alike but these are the kinds of things that i think will be fascinating to review when the data come in not only because they hint at the potential mechanisms of the drug but also because we could attempt to identify some of the market angles where the drug may fit in clinical practices as ritu asked about on the last release john newman okay great thank you operator operator instructions and we’ll go next to robert kang with
