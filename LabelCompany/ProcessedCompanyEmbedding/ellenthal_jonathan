except to the extent required by applicable law i would now like to introduce jay walker executive chairman of patent properties inc jay walker thank you kara and good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter  earnings conference call i am here with our ceo jon ellenthal and our cfo kara jenny both of whom will participate in the call and be available for qa jon and i will provide an update on the launch of the united states patent utility kara will then take us briefly through the first quarter financials as well as our recent patent enforcement efforts after these presentations we’ll leave plenty of time for qa we mentioned on our last call that we publicly launched the united states patent utility in late january after a brief beta period after more than a year of product and technical development it was great to release the service to the marketplace and begin to get feedback from live customers in january we were very excited today four short months later we’ve been more excited and more importantly four months smarter about the scale market opportunity and what it will take to build a very valuable business we’re paying careful attention to the feedback of our early users in particular we’re interested in those aspects of our service the market finds most useful that way we can feature these benefits in our ongoing sales efforts and prioritize product enhancements we are guided by the experience of having created several businesses that relied on fresh thinking to bring a brandnew capability to market and scale those businesses to positions of industry leadership those experiences have thought us the value of soaking up early learning’s that can be used to put the company on a trajectory for largescale market adoption for those of you who are new to our business let me give you a brief overview of the problem we are solving and how we plan to solve it there is unprecedented pressure on companies to improve product and service performance improve product quality differentiate products from competitive offerings take costs out of products bring new products to market faster track competitors and manage technology risk in todays environment of global competition in an economy dominated by lightning fast technology cycles its a struggle for companies to quickly figure out what new materials new technologies new approaches and even new competitors need to be considered it’s no longer feasible for companies to rely solely on their internal resources and employees to stay ahead of competitors instead companies need to connect to people and organizations that can do things they can’t we believe the companys private network of external resources needs to grow exponentially to stay on top of whats new who is new and what matters that’s why we’ve created a service that makes it simple and affordable for any company to efficiently access the external capabilities and insights of experts and the organizations they work for when you consider that for every dollar a company spends trying to solve an internal problem the world spends thousands of dollars on the same or similar problem it makes sense to figure out how to tap into the worlds rd budget for internal use we also use our advanced software to help our customers keep track of competitive activities and better understand the potential threats of thirdparty technologies our service combines the power of big data software engines and a novel view of the problemsolving capacity of the us patent database to help companies compete grow and manage risk the us patent database is the largest collection of technical knowledge and technology experts in the world by far and we view each patent as an advertisement for the deeper capabilities and expertise of the inventor and the inventor’s organization only a fraction of what an investor knows about a particular subject is found in any given patent the rest resides inside their head and inside the inventor’s organization our job is to match problems to people and organizations using advanced software and to unlock the massively underutilized commercial problemsolving capacity of the us patent database that’s what we believe we have developed the service is available to companies for a monthly subscription fee we believe even a modest penetration of the target market would create a significant recurring revenue stream and a very valuable business with that introduction i would like to turn the call over to our ceo jon ellenthal jon jonathan ellenthal thanks jay as you just heard to work on a problem that is experienced by virtually every company in our economy and we have seen strong evidence of that fact by the tremendous range of growth driver we are working with and others that have expressed interest in trialing the service we are now serving companies and industries as diverse the software consumer product industrial supplies marketing analytics insurance gaming consumer electronics and healthcare and the market is not only broad but also deep although originally developed with a small and midsized business in mind we have been pleasantly surprised by the interest shown by very large companies in addition to microsoft and harman international we recently added reinsurance group of america inc a multibillion dollar global reinsurance company to our client roster discussions and trials are underway with a number of other high profile fortune  companies as well as dozens of smaller and midsize firms our ability to serve giant companies adds to what was already a large total addressable market in general giant companies tend to have a more sophisticated understanding of their needs to have expertise and insights from people outside the company and somehow formally organized around this effort we see the interest from giant companies as further validation of the market size as well as the uniqueness of our approach the us patent database is often misunderstood as purely a source of legal rights and risk rather than the greater information sharing and knowledge transfer mechanism ever created leading a giant property rights the metadata is a valuable source of business intelligence that can help the company to solve product problems faster and key tabs on competitors investments at this base we are focused on building the sales infrastructure will need for scale our initial inhouse telesales operation is in play to handle outbound and inbound leads and we plan to build on that base we are also investing in a variety of media messages and targets to determine the best marketing mix the sales pipeline is filling up nicely we are learning more everyday about lead conversion rates the length of the sale cycle and acquisition costs we have been active on the speaker circuit and with telesales conference sponsorships online media content marketing webinars and media appearances in the quarter editorial pieces have appeared in the harvard business review fortune magazine industry week the new york times the washington post and wired magazine jenny has appeared on cnbc fox news and bloomberg tv as you can see we’re hard at work getting the message out and we’re using businesstobusiness selling strategies used by other saas companies in combination with jay’s ability to command the media attention the good news is there a lot of companies to reach and we are committed to building a worldclass sales and marketing operation theres a lot more to come on this front and although we’re only in the first inning of this game we like how things are setting up for us now i’ll turn things over to kara who will provide an update on our first quarter results kara jenny thanks jon we had negligible revenue this quarter as we historically stated revenue is expected to fluctuate from quartertoquarter based on revolutions to our legal action and as we built customers in the patent utility once the patent utility scales we expect to start building more predictable recurring revenue total operating expenses for the first quarter  were  million versus  million in the prior year period primarily due to a  million decrease in professional fees from prior year period and partially offset by  increase in other legal and consulting expenses and  increase related to marketing for the utility net loss for the first quarter of  was approximately  million and net loss per share was  an improvement compared to last years firstquarter net loss of approximately  million or net loss per share of  per share from a liquidity standpoint as of march   we had  million in cash and working capital of  million and no outstanding debt on our balance sheet on the litigation enforcement side of our business the landscape for patent litigation changes constantly and remains a long cycle business these factors provide us with very limited visibility the practice of attempting to invalidate patents as an early defense tactics has been a common one and serves to further flow the court process we continue to believe that our patent portfolio has strong economic value and can create longterm shareholder value we have a strong history of creating ip value and we will remain flexible in terms of how we ultimately monetize our portfolio we have the capital and willingness to take any case to its ultimate outcome in court so we remain open and regularly talk to third parties regarding settlements licensing arrangements in individual and bulk asset sales just as we’ve done in the past in addition we are willing to consider ways to convert existing defendants into supporters of the patent utility if we determine doing so creates more longterm shareholder value now i’ll turn the call back over to jon jonathan ellenthal great thanks kara to conclude our prepared remarks we are pleased with the first few months of the united states patent utility we live in a world that is innovating faster than any one company can keep up with and every company is under constant pressure to improve its products and services faster and cheaper than competitors more and more solutions will come from outside the firm and those companies that can efficiently and consistently tap into external innovation will be in the strongest position to maintain and build market share the us patent database is a massively underutilized competitive resource with the united states patent utility and our proprietary software we are determined to change that and to help american companies compete and grow and with that i thank you for your time and would like to open the call for qa operator questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you the first question is from don hickman of ladenburg please go ahead jon hickman good afternoon i have few questions thanks for taking my call could you give us some idea of how many patents are in the database right now jonathan ellenthal well we’re going to call you jon hickman if thats okay jon jon hickman okay that’s fine jonathan ellenthal it makes sense anyway yes i think what we said publicly is that there are several thousand patents currently listed in the utilities catalog at this point jon hickman several thousand okay and could you give us some idea of the size of subscriber base and the size of the people that are contributing to the patent database jonathan ellenthal are you looking for the types of institutions that are contributing jon hickman no i was looking for a number like is a dozen or a couple dozen subscribers i know its early days but i was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit jonathan ellenthal sure i mean it’s definitely early days we havent actually characterized the number of different organizations that are listing patents at this point jon i expect we’ll in the future but since its so early we have not at this point chosen to reveal that information there are multiple contributors and ultimately the size and diversity that the overall patent count and the range of patents in there will matter a most so the arrangement we had announced earlier with intellectual ventures is a particularly interesting one because i dont think there is anybody out there that owns a more diverse number and more diverse range of patents given how their portfolio was assembled jon hickman okay so and then could you elaborate just a little bit more on you said you have inhouse like the telesales team is up and running and then your next move is to do more of a direct sales organization do you have anybody in the direct sales organization at this point or is that in the future jonathan ellenthal yes so let me just clarify our statement we have an inhouse telesales operation their job primarily is to work on outbound leads as well as inbound leads that are created by our marketing organization the marketing organization goes out there and does a whole wide range of promotions in various media online media events to generate inbound leads which are also followedup on by our inhouse telesales organization we do have a head of business development that we added to the team a few months back and a big part of that persons role is to explore channel partnerships with other organizations that may give us expedited access to large groups of customers so what’s in place today is the group that works on acquiring subscribers one at a time through telesales operation and hopefully as time goes by and our business development resources grow will be able to figure out ways to acquire customers in bulk we also as you know do quite a bit of media outreach to supplement our sales and marketing efforts which is why jay has printing on tv so much jon hickman so could you give us an idea of how this latest large company insurance the reinsurance came to that how did you get a hold of that jonathan ellenthal well i think we have a bit of a relationship that you are referring to reinsurance group of america jon hickman yes the one… jay walker walker digital hazard has a relationship jonathan ellenthal yes what jay just mentioned jon walker digital has a relationship with rga and we are introduced to them through that relationship jon hickman okay i think thats it from me jon i appreciate you’re taking my questions jonathan ellenthal our pleasures jon end of qa operator i would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks jonathan ellenthal now we appreciate your time this afternoon and we look forward to speaking with you again in a few months to share with you our
