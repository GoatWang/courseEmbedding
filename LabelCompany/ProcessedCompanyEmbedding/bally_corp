greathouse felt that machines could be made more fun more interactive and therefore more profitable in contrast with igt whose executives believed that slot gamblers were not playing to be entertained starting from scratch against such a dominant competitor was daunting though so alliance looked for an acquisition the natural choice was bally gaming international the number two player with a  to

casino three new directors were added in november to the companys board as part of a settlement under discussion with the sec but by march  regulators still had questions about the companys public disclosure and trading in the stock was suspended for  days the sec investigation ended in  with no further action against the company while solomon personally agreed to an injunction against any further securities violations rather than fighting charges that he illegally sold stock in the company between  and  to raise money for its gaming ventures a management shakeup in the wake of the sec

million investment in exchange for  percent of the company wilms owned  percent of the company but agreed to give up control to kirkland allowing them to name  of the  directors in exchange for the investment concurrently the company sold  million in convertible debentures rainwater outlined a plan to become a really large factor in the gaming industry looking for bargainprice casinos in every jurisdiction rainwaters level of involvement in united became a matter of some dispute after george w bushs ties to rainwater a fellow member of the group that owned the texas rangers baseball team became a campaign issue in the  race for governor because of rainwaters involvement in gambling kirkland head joel kirschbaum described rainwaters interest in the company as passive but a later lawsuit by bally gaming alleged that united admitted downplaying rainwaters level of control because major league baseball frowned on team owners being involved in the gaming industry within months of the kirkland investment united partnered in a bid for a gaming license in evansville indiana to build the river city casino was in discussions to acquire a stake in the underdevelopment diamond jo casino in dubuque iowa agreed to buy a  percent stake in the underconstruction rainbow casino in vicksburg mississippi and agreed to invest  million for a  percent stake in capital gaming

saacks assistant superintendent of the new orleans police department who had worked as a consultant for uniteds video poker operation in louisiana saacks was suspended and later fired for violating a department policy against officers working for video poker companies and for his connection to frank caracci a nightclub owner tied to the new orleans crime family a week after the scandal broke the

down some of its smaller operations closing the trolley stop in december  ending the mizpah hotel lease in april  and selling the taverns it had acquired in the course of slot route operations in december the company decided after performing due diligence not to make an offer for the diamond jo with kirklands backing in place analysts expected the company to execute a major merger united was cited as a possible suitor to buy casino magic caesars world or circus circus in december  united changed its name to alliance gaming corporation to reflect the companys revitalization and redefinition bally gaming acquisitionedit alliance began seeking ways to apply its marketing strength in the equipment business company executives felt there was a market opportunity in new riverboat and indian casinos where a slot maker could compete for shelf space without having to convince casino managers to switch from machines built by igt the market leader with a  percent share ceo steve greathouse felt that machines could be made more fun more interactive and therefore more profitable in contrast with igt whose executives believed that slot gamblers were not playing to be entertained starting from scratch against such a dominant competitor was daunting though so alliance looked for an acquisition the natural choice was bally gaming international the number two player with a  to  percent share kirschbaum had contacted bally entertainment about a merger as early as  but ballys ceo rebuffed him because of alliances heavy debt load and lack of earnings suggesting they develop their company a bit talks began again in october  until alliance broke them off in february  bally reached out to alliance the next month through rainwater who discussed possibilities including a threeway merger with autotote a maker of lottery and parimutuel wagering technology in june  with bally already considering a buyout offer from wms industries alliance made an unsolicited offer of  million in cash stock and assumed debt days later ballys board of directors accepted wmss offer of  million in stock conditioned on bally selling its german subsidiary bally wulff for at least  million bally called alliances offer illusory and highly conditional on financing and said that wms stock would give shareholders more longterm value than alliance stock and that a combination of alliance and bally would be so undercapitalized as to raise licensing concerns among gaming regulators alliance undertook a hostile takeover effort suing to block the wms merger announcing a tender offer of up to  million for  million shares of bally enough to give it a controlling interest and seeking consent from ballys shareholders to replace a majority of the board bally and wms fired back with separate lawsuits seeking to block alliances tender offer alliance raised its offer to  million for  million shares and wms in turn raised its total bid to  million in october alliance announced that it had been tendered  million shares and alleged that bally and wms had reached an impasse over ballys failure to find a buyer for bally wulff the next day ballys board capitulated canceling the deal with wms and approving a merger with alliance on terms similar to those of the tender offer with a total value of  million after the two companies agreed to revise the deal down to  million to ensure the combined company would have enough cash to grow and alliance raised  million in financing the acquisition was completed on june   bally was organized as three divisions within alliance

revenues to sustain our business we will have to find other sources of financing we estimate that we would be able to operate our business for the next  months even if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain our business if only  of the offering is sold we would still incur expected professional legal and accounting fees of  which will have to be paid to maintain reporting status during the next  months we will also pay minimal office and miscellaneous expenses and then any leftover funds will be applied to the design and development of our website as well as on advertising and marketing and minimal inventory based on raising only  or  we will allocate only  to finalize development of our website and only  for advertising and marketing we would also only allocate  to inventory this would seriously hinder the development of our business and our ability to generate revenues we would not be able to develop the business andor generate any revenues in the first year without additional financing if we do not raise sufficient funds to cover professional fees estimated to be  for the first  months we would not be able to remain reporting with the sec and
