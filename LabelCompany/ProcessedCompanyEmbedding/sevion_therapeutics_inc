developing a portfolio of therapeutics from both internal discovery and acquisition for the treatment of cancer and immunological diseases the company is engaged in the development and licensing of technology to discover and engineer monoclonal antibodies the companys product candidates are derived from multiple technology platforms such as cellbased arrayed antibody discovery ultralong antibody scaffolds and chimerasome nanocagesthe company has various antibodies in its preclinical pipeline the companys antibody therapeutic candidates target the potassium channel voltage dependent kv ion channel which is essential in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune and inflammatory disorders other antibodies in its pipeline target cell surface molecules involved in cancer progression the company has developed the spatially addressed antibody library with an expansive combinatorial collection of recombinant antibodies in which each well contains a single species of antibody of known concentration composition and sequence the companys spatially addressed library allows it to evaluate the therapeutic potential of each antibody individually in a noncompetitive way and allows direct discovery on the cell surface the discovery system unlocks epitopes targets and functions that are only identifiable in the context of a living cellthe company has discovered and humanized a class of therapeutic antibodies derived from cows the ultralong complementary determining region  cdr structural domain found in cow antibodies consists of a knob on a stalk that protrudes far from the antibody surface using both the humanized spatially addressed antibody library and direct engineering of the knob the company is exploring the ability of utilizing the knob and stalk structure to functionally interact with therapeutic targets including g proteincoupled receptor gpcrs ion channels and other multispanning membrane therapeutic targets on the cell surfacethe companys lead antibody svn is an ion channelblocking antibody svn targets an ion channel kv which is implicated in a number of different autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis and multiple sclerosis the companys product candidate svn is an antibody against an oncology target that affects metastatic tumors that are resistant to the class of drugs that target vascular endothelial growth factor vegf the target is expressed in clear cell renal carcinoma where it is associated with poor prognosis the company has discovered fully human antibodies against additional oncology targets including receptor tyrosineprotein kinase erbb receptor tyrosineprotein kinase erbb chemokine cxc motif receptor  cxcr and glucagonlike peptide  receptor glpr which are engineered to have activity in invitro systems these cell surface proteins are validated in the disease fields of oncology and diabetes the company is advancing svn and svn through preclinical developmentthe company competes with genentech
