net income increased  million for the first quarter of  compared with the first quarter of  the increase was driven primarily by a  million increase in idaho powers net income at idaho power an increase in sales volumes on a percustomer basis contributed  million to operating income in the first quarter of  compared with the first quarter of  but was largely offset by a  million decrease in revenues from the application of the fca mechanism temperatures in idaho powers service area were colder than normal in the first quarter of  and were significantly colder than first quarter  temperatures the cold weather resulted in increased residential sales volumes on a percustomer basis and caused an increase in the proportion of residential sales in higher rate categories under idaho powers tiered rate structure these higher tiered rates drove a  million increase to operating income customer growth further drove higher sales volumes lifting operating income by  million as the number of idaho power customers grew by  percent over the prior twelve months in addition to these changes in general business revenues idaho power benefited from a  million increase in thirdparty use of electric property wheeling and other revenue due to a new longterm wheeling agreement as well as an increase in idaho powers open access transmission tariff rates which was effective in october  partly offsetting these increases other operating and maintenance expenses were  million higher compared with the same period in the prior year weather affected the timing and amount of certain operating and maintenance expenses during the quarter the increase in income tax expense was principally the result of higher income before income taxes partially offset by an increase in additional
