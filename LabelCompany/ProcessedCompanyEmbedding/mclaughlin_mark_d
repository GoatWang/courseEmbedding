with that ill turn the call over to mark mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc thank you kelsey and thank you everyone for joining us today on the call to discuss our fiscal second quarter results in the second quarter revenue grew  year over year to  million and billings grew  year over year to  million we generated free cash flow of  million up  year over year and reported nongaap earnings per share of  up  year over year there are a lot of very positive things to discuss from the second quarter which i will do later in my remarks but i wanted to start off by noting that we are disappointed in our q revenue results and guidance for the balance of the year upfront i want to discuss what is happening what we are doing about it and then steffan will discuss the impact to us for the second half of our fiscal year as far as what is happening we believe that our weaker performance is primarily caused by gotomarket execution issues that are becoming more evident as we progress through the year the impact from these issues is lower productivity than we planned for in the year with a broader base of slower pipeline conversion than what we started to experience in the first quarter why would this be for several years now we have been running a playbook that has resulted in high growth rates the basic components of that playbook are that each year we split territories continually segment the market both vertically and by customer size and forward invest in sales and marketing resources these actions are of course designed to drive productivity we have had very good results with this playbook for some time and continued with it in our fiscal  planning we were not seeing the expected return on investment in drilling into why our initial analysis is that we over complicated our gotomarket motion with a lot more territory splits and segmentation than we have done in the past this appears to have been too much too fast as we changed the coverage model for many customer relationships resulting in lower productivity and less accuracy in forecasting so what are we doing about it we are working diligently and quickly to identify the actions to adapt at the midpoint of the year and are focused on the following things right now first we are reorganizing our account coverage model to drive more accountability and clarity second we are recalibrating investments in our sales and marketing resources to better support this revised coverage model and third we are updating our second half plan to better reflect our midyear forecast assuming nearterm disruption as we make the moves necessary to get back to the productivity levels we expect of our investments while we continue to grow very quickly i have stated many times both in the company and externally that quality execution at rapid scale is very important for the success of the company we are accountable for the issues and we believe we can fix them because we want to ensure that we do that in a thoughtful fashion and so that we can answer all the questions i am sure you will have as we progress through that work we are going to postpone our investor day currently scheduled for march  until september   this will allow us to be as thorough and definitive as possible when we gather in new york despite these execution issues we continue to capture market share at high rates in q we added approximately  new customers and are now privileged to be serving more than  customers worldwide customer wins and competitive displacements in the quarter included a cisco and mcafee replacement to standardize all security at a large multinational business services company that included all attached and nonattached subscriptions including a significant traps investment a competitive win against cisco to secure the datacenter and perimeter at one of the worlds largest physical security companies that included all attached subscriptions a cisco replacement and competitive win against check point for a datacenter project at a major north american healthcare provider that included a significant investment in both hardware and subscriptions a check point replacement to secure the retail network at a large north american retailer including our vmseries and autofocus and a competitive win against cisco and check point to secure the private cloud of a bank based in europe adoption across our platform also continues to drive lifetime value growth all of our top  lifetime customers again made purchases in the second quarter and to make this list a customer had to have spent a minimum of  million in lifetime value a  increase over the  million in q of fiscal  customers are choosing palo alto networks because our platform provides high degrees of automation ever increasing leverage from our large and growing ecosystem of customers consistency of security regardless of where data resides from network to endpoints and the cloud and the power that comes from the increasing analytic capabilities we are applying to the petabytes of data we now process these are the hallmarks of a true platform and customers are seeing the results in better security less complexity and a better total cost of ownership and in looking at the offerings in the platform we continued to see momentum across the balance of our attached subscriptions including wildfire where we added approximately  new customers bringing our total wildfire customer account base to approximately  our nonattached services which include traps vmseries aperture and autofocus are also growing very well and in the second quarter were on a combined annualized run rate of over  million in sales growing greater than  year over year traps our advanced endpoint protection provides customers with prevention capabilities at endpoints seamless understanding of threats across the network at endpoints and the leverage inherent in our very large and growing customer ecosystem across their entire environment in the second quarter we grew the traps customer base more than  sequentially to  customers and saw significant increases in deal sizes a recent survey of our traps customer base indicated that over  of those surveyed chose to replace legacy antivirus with traps due to its superior protection from malware and exploits combined with the integration with our nextgeneration security platform our vmseries cloud security offerings are growing very quickly as well due to our unique ability to provide superior and consistent security across all cloud and onpremise environments and deep integration with cloud automation and orchestration this is evident with the success of our vmseries where we now have well over  customers with increasing deal sizes to continue accelerating success in cloud security we now have all technical sales engineers trained on cloud with a growing number of cloud specialists dedicated to these opportunities and with our expanded lineup of vmseries offerings and continued deep integration with leading private and public cloud platform providers we are well positioned in cloud security for aperture our saas security offering we increased our customer count sequentially by over  and are quickly expanding the number of applications we can protect the latest aperture release now supports complete automation for data leakage and threat risk remediation with the ability to instantly quarantine malware and remove sensitive data sharing in violation of policy to protect the network and enforce compliance on saas applications and on the machine learning front we continue to make good progress with autofocus with over  customers including some of the worlds largest organizations autofocus was our first subscription developed to leverage the massive amount of data we are now ingesting and take advantage of our analytics and machine learning capabilities to make high quality predictive and proactive security decisions that can be automatically enforced across our entire nextgeneration security platform along those lines we are very pleased to be announcing today the acquisition of lightcyber the leading company in the behavior analytics space we have spent quite some time evaluating the players in this fastgrowing space and are very impressed with the capabilities and team at lightcyber the lightcyber offering will continue to be sold as it is for now and will be integrated into the platform and offered as a subscription service by the end of this calendar year and we are accelerating the platform advantage we are very excited about the new product launch we held on february  where we had more than  participants attend both live and through our webcast at the event we introduced panos  our newest operating system with more than  new features and many new products and unique capabilities including six new hardware appliances designed to enable customers to deploy nextgeneration security from large data centers to small branches all managed centrally by a new and faster version of panorama these appliances provide faster performance for deep visibility into and control over all traffic including encrypted traffic which is becoming an increasingly strategic need for effective security three new vmseries models to add to the existing four we currently offer creating the broadest range of cloud security offerings in the market this enables a wider range of deployment types and even greater integration with amazon web services microsoft azure and vmware nsx to deliver scale redundancy and automation that allows customers to easily build cloudcentric architectures the industrys first multimethod scalable and automated approach designed to prevent credentialbased theft and abuse by attackers credential theft has become an increasingly popular tool for attackers as it often allows them to bypass a number of other difficult steps in the attack lifecycle our new capabilities include the unique ability to prevent sending passwordbased corporate credentials to unauthorized sites and an innovative approach to policybased multifactor authentication enforced at the network level to prevent the reuse of stolen credentials and several new threat prevention capabilities including automatic command and control signature generation a new custom built from the ground up advanced hypervisor and bare metal analysis capabilities in wildfire and minemeld integration with autofocus allowing for thirdparty feeds to be easily correlated with our data for deeper analysis and automated protection using groundbreaking machine learning in summary we continue to see positive reaction to our approach in our platform and strong market traction and we believe in our ability to address the execution issues i noted earlier allowing us to continue to drive outsized market share gains with that i will turn the call over to steffan steffan c tomlinson  palo alto networks inc thank you mark before i start id like to note that except for revenue and billings figures all financial figures are nongaap and growth rates are compared to the prioryear periods unless stated otherwise let me start by saying we are disappointed that we fell below our revenue guidance range for q in the quarter we reported revenue of  million an increase of  looking at the geographic mix of revenue the americas grew  and accounted for  share emea grew  and accounted for  share and apac grew  and accounted for  share product revenue of  million was essentially flat compared to the prior year we anticipated that q product growth would be weak due to a difficult yearoveryear comparable but product revenue fell below our expectations due to the execution issues mark discussed as well as some customers more than we anticipated delaying purchasing decisions based on the significant product release in early february subscription and support revenue is now on an annual runrate north of a  billion and continues to grow at very high rates q saasbased subscription revenue of  million increased  attach rates grew to  subscriptions per device shipped up from  in the prior year period and subscription renewal rates are greater than  support revenue of  million increased  and we enjoy approximately  renewal rates on support in total subscription and support revenue of  million increased  and accounted for a  share of total revenue turning to billings q billings of  million increased  the dollar weighted contract duration for new subscriptions and support billings in the quarter was  years compared to  years in the prioryear period as customers increasingly commit to our platform as their longterm security architecture for the first half of fiscal  billings of  billion increased  yearoveryear product billings were  million up  and accounted for  of total billings subscription billings were  million up  and support billings were  million up  subscription and support billings accounted for  of total billings in the first half of fiscal  compared to  in the first half of fiscal  in q total deferred revenue of  billion increased  moving on to margins q gross margin was  an increase of  basis points compared to last year the increase was driven by improvements in recurring subscription and support gross margins offset by a product gross margin decline of  basis points yearoveryear looking forward we expect there will be fluctuations in product gross margin particularly with the recent introduction of our new products when we typically see a decline in product gross margin for a few quarters q operating expenses were  million or  of revenue operating margin was  in q representing  basis points of improvement yearoveryear net income for the quarter grew  yearoveryear to  million nongaap eps grew  to  per diluted share on a gaap basis for the second quarter net loss was  million or  per basic and diluted share turning to cash flows and balance sheet items q cash flow from operations of  million increased  yearoveryear capital expenditures in the quarter were  million including  million of capex related to our new headquarters free cash flow for q was  million up  at a margin of  excluding capex related to our new headquarters free cash flow was  million up  yearoveryear at a margin of  we finished january with cash cash equivalents and investments of  billion and i am pleased to announce that the board of directors has authorized a  million increase to our existing share repurchase program and extended the end date of the program to december   this brings the total amount authorized under the current program to  billion during the second quarter we purchased approximately  shares of common stock at an average price of  a share leaving a balance of approximately  million available for ongoing repurchases dsos were  days within the previously provided range of  days to  days as we look toward the future we remain committed to our longterm strategy to capture market share within our financial framework of growth and profitability we are not satisfied with our productivity and know we have work ahead of us to maximize our potential turning to guidance and modeling points this afternoon we announced that we have acquired privately held lightcyber for  million in cash lightcyber expands our nextgeneration security platform with its highly automated and accurate behavioral analytics technology and while we will continue to offer the lightcyber products and to support existing customer implementations we expect to make lightcyber available as a nonattached subscription by the end of the calendar year for fiscal  lightcybers contribution to revenue will be immaterial and we expect to invest approximately  million per quarter in both q and q primarily in rd and platform integration for the third quarter of fiscal  our guidance anticipates that there will be some disruption as we implement changes to our gotomarket playbook and as a result sales productivity will remain below our originally planned productivity levels in the second half we expect revenue to be in the range of  million to  million an increase of  to  incorporating the approximately  earnings per share impact from lightcyber we expect nongaap eps to be in the range of  to  an increase of  to  yearoveryear excluding the lightcyber impact nongaap eps is expected to be in the range of  to  an increase of  to  using  million to  million shares we expect q product revenue to be in the range of  million to  million based on our current pipeline analysis we anticipate billings growth to trail revenue growth in each of q and q by approximately  percentage points to  percentage points our current view for the full fiscal  is an annual revenue growth of approximately  and essentially flat product revenue growth for the year we anticipate annual nongaap operating margin to increase approximately  basis points to  basis points relative to fiscal year  nongaap operating margin of  as reported included in the basispoint to basispoint improvement is at least  basis points of organic operating margin expansion and  basis points to  basis points positive impact from the deferred commissions change offset by approximately basispoint headwind from lightcyber we expect fullyear nongaap eps to be in the range of  to  which includes a  impact from lightcyber and a share count of  million to  million shares and we expect capex and free cash flow margin to be the range of  million to  million and  to  respectively which includes approximately  million related to our new headquarters of which we expect approximately  million to fall into q excluding capex from the new headquarters free cash flow margin is expected to be at least  structurally our hybridsaas model combined with operational discipline continues to drive strong deferred revenue revenue and free cash flow generation with that i will turn the call back over to mark mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc we appreciate you being on the call today in summary while we are excited and confident about the future we know we have work to do to improve our execution and operational discipline we will navigate the nearterm challenges while executing on our strategy of being the leading global enterprise security provider and with that we will open the call up for questions operator please go ahead questionandanswer session operator thank you well go to matt hedberg with rbc capital markets matthew george hedberg  rbc capital markets llc hey guys thanks for taking my questions mark in your prepared remarks you talk about reorging your gotomarket model i wonder if you could talk a little bit more specifically about changes you plan to make and how long should we expect some of these to start producing the desired results mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc sure matt thanks great question so we need to do three basic things here from a gotomarket perspective on the items i talked about the first is we have to go back and do account mapping or remap the accounts from a coverage perspective because we have the account coverage blurred right now in a way thats not helping us second thing were going to have to do is reallocate the resources to properly align with that account coverage and then the third thing is to make sure weve got the right people with the right skills in the right seat so its a pretty big effort we have to undertake here we started it already we expect to be working through that in the second half and hopefully well see the benefits of that as we come out of the back half of the year into fiscal  matthew george hedberg  rbc capital markets llc and thats great im sure well hear more it as we move and i guess maybe drilling down specifically on the sales and marketing line item im just kind of curious what you think in terms of capacity adds here i know productivitys lower than you expect here but did you still expect to add capacity maybe at a lower rate to sort of map to the billings growth or just trying to get a sense for capacity adds mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc yeah its a good question matt so what were very focused on is productivity at this point right so weve brought a lot of people in in the tail half of fiscal  twice as many as weve done before so were going to continue to add some heads into this from a gotomarket perspective well slow that rate down in the back half of the year but were primarily interested in increasing the productivity and the conversion in the pipeline so thats our main effort operator our next question comes from michael turits with raymond james michael turits  raymond james  associates inc hey guys its michael turits im trying to understand exactly how you think the sales strategy was wrong because it seems like its made sense to the extent that you were increasing the breadth of the product portfolio and you were going through a very staged process of first adding vertical overlays and then getting rid of them and then integrating those new product sales capabilities into the existing sales force which seems like a very deliberate process strategy for what youve been doing so what really was the disconnect and how are you planning to do things differently mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc yeah michael its mark so we have been running our playbook very successfully for quite some time as i said and we continue to run that in fiscal  what we did incorrectly as we look back on this and its biting us now is just the magnitude of what we did coming out of  into  in the rate of territory splits and ill give you some other examples as well in the hopes of driving higher productivity on investments we moved broad swaths of customer base into inside sales and resourced that accordingly that turned out to not be the boost to productivity we thought so as an example we had to bring big swaths of customer accounts from a mapping perspective back into territories have the right people in the chairs in order to execute on those so we know the playbook has worked for us in the past and we think we realize what weve done incorrectly with that playbook and were going to go fix it michael turits  raymond james  associates inc and i guess just to continue on the same bent any change in the channel strategy relative to this mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc no we like our channel a lot channels been very good to us and weve got great relationships with the channel so were not going be changing that strategy operator our next question comes from pierre ferragu with bernstein pierre c ferragu  sanford c bernstein  co llc hi thank you for taking my question mark whats giving you confidence and whats your level of confidence that like your disappointing productivity and disappointing sales performance is an issue that really comes from internal problems and that it is not also simply related to the fact that maybe your competitive environment has been evolving and youre facing competitors there who are like catching up and putting their game together and then on the productivity front so if you had like product sales this quarter that were about in line with where they were last year you have like a significantly higher number of salespeople in the organization today could you give us a sense of how much bigger you are today in terms of sales organization compared to one year ago and then if you could maybe give us a sense of how did the sales force basically waste this productivity so where did their time go where did their efforts go and then which led them to see lower productivity mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc yeah sure pierre let me see if i can track all that let me start in with the first one on the competitor front we watch that very closely we believe and have believed for some time that we have the best technical leadership in the market today we vastly increased that with the new product launch we did on february  which is very well attended and the addition of the lightcyber is an example into the family as well the issues that were dealing with we think are primarily execution oriented and that we can go address those things weve seen continued progress in the market we just did another quarter of  net new customers increasing the lifetime value as well very very high customer sat scores and net promoter scores as well so the feedback from the market seems very positive this is something it appears that weve done to ourself and something that we can fix on the size of the sales force to give you some example we brought in more than twice as many folks into the sales organization as we progressed through fiscal  than we did in  and added some more in q of  as well so the rate and pace was a lot higher and in hindsight realizing that that is something that has created challenges for us and were going to go fix that and on your last question as far as what are people working everybody is working very hard and very diligently but the amount of relationship changes that occurred these various account coverage moves that we made is very high so when youre moving the relationships around and trying to build on those relationships its hard and at a minimum we would see something like were seeing now we should have seen this earlier but inaccuracies in forecasting about where things are in the pipeline as people are getting closer and closer to that customer over time pierre c ferragu  sanford c bernstein  co llc thanks mark mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc thank you pierre operator well go to andrew nowinski with piper jaffray andrew james nowinski  piper jaffray  co all right thanks i wanted to ask about a comment you made about the delayed purchase decisions that customers made with regard to the new products that you launched in the quarter given the performance improvements in the new products you would think that it would compel those customers to move forward with palo alto but your guidance suggests the opposite so i guess can you help us understand why the deals that were delayed due to the new product launch would not come through in the april quarter mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc hey andrew its a good question its possible they may the new products have been received very well from customers feedback so far weve had a fantastic launch and they are really good as steffan mentioned we did see some customers delaying purchases we got to the end of the second quarter in january were always trying to walk a very fine line on bringing new products to market and when you do that we certainly wouldnt want to bring to market at the end of the quarter so we brought them out right in the beginning you may have noticed we did a lot of advertising not specifically about the products but that something big was coming so thats always hard to get that right towards the beginning of a launch as far as folks coming into the third quarter we expect the products to sell very well and we think theyre fantastic unfortunately what we have is the execution issues are going to overweight any goodness in that for some time and we have to work through those execution issues andrew james nowinski  piper jaffray  co okay and then given all the new products in virtual solutions you launched a few weeks ago can you just give us your thoughts on the pending refresh cycle this year and how we should think about that with regard to your expectations for the remainder of the year mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc yes as weve said in the past we think we have a very significant refresh opportunity in front of us and that of course hasnt changed i think the new products is going help on that its going to be up against the headwind of the execution stuff we just mentioned but kind of putting that in perspective so if you look at all the cohorts or classes of customers as far as from  to  its about a little over  total the  class in and of itself is  and it grows from there so i think weve got a lot of refresh opportunity in front of us that hasnt changed were confident about that but we got to work through these other issues to really get the benefit of that operator well now hear from philip winslow with wells fargo securities philip winslow  wells fargo securities llc thanks guys just to build on that two questions i guess on the refresh side how do you think the changes to the gotomarket strategy may be effective the timing of that refresh at all obviously it averages about call it five years but things can slip did any of the changes impact call it existing customers in your thinking of sort of your cadence of refreshing those and then also one of the things you talked about in the past too was service provider wins wonder if you can just double click on that space a little bit sort of whats happened yeartodate how youre thinking about the second half mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc yeah sure phil on the first question on the refresh well having execution headwinds doesnt help at all of course but were very confident that people are going to – want to going to refresh on the new product line the new product line is really good and it provides three or four different opportunities from a refresh perspective and its clearly designed to do it that way but again its going to be up against this just getting our act together from a gotomarket perspective and implementing the changes we need to implement ill let mark anderson answer the service provider question mark anderson  palo alto networks inc yeah hey phil as you know we started focusing on service provider about a year and a half ago and its going very well especially given the new product map that we have for virtualized products going much smaller and much bigger is really going to help us quite substantially in our managed services business with those customers so we feel very good about where we are and the team is ramping very nicely philip winslow  wells fargo securities llc got it thanks guys mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc thanks phil operator and jayson noland with baird has our next question jayson a noland  robert w baird  co inc okay great mark i wanted to ask your thoughts on the industry backdrop coming out of rsa does it seem like how  budgets are getting better yearonyear and then clarity theres a lot of new players in the industry it seems crowded and combative at some points maybe if you could talk about budgeting and then how people are going to spend their money thanks mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc yeah sure a very good question jayson lots and lots of vendors up there and lots of people showed up at rsa which is i think a good thing in the sense of there needs to be a lot of innovation in the security industry but ill answer your question in two different ways first from a backdrop perspective it seems like securities still remains a priority and spending is good on security so what were facing here is things that weve created ourselves here not so much a spending issue in security i think on the second front its becoming more apparent and i can see it  at rsa about what the consumption model of all that innovation is going to look like over time and what i mean by that is very clear that the age of the platform for security we invented that in the first place and were doing very well against that and i think people are going to increasingly consume all that innovation through platforms theres going to be less and less platform companies out there and a lot of the smaller companies who are highly innovative will become parts of those platforms evidenced by the lightcyber acquisition this afternoon whether its through acquisition or partnerships i think more and more is going to happen over time jayson a noland  robert w baird  co inc thank you mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc thank you operator our next question will come from ken talanian with evercore isi ken talanian  evercore group llc hi guys thanks for taking my question first off just wondering could you give us a sense if there are any changes that youve noticed in the go to market approaches by your competitors and really im thinking about cisco here in particular mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc no the competition has been fierce for a long time ken and i think it will continue to be that way people buy usually on three angles security reduction in complexity and cost and different players in the market have gone after different levels there ours is kind of topdown which is security reduction in complexity and at a very good cost other people approach from a different angle but havent noticed anything different from the competitive landscape in that regard ken talanian  evercore group llc okay and then also based on your guidance for next quarter it looks like product growth might actually decline both sequentially and yearoveryear so one just curious if thats directionally correct and then if you could give us a sense for what product growth will do in fiscal  overall mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc yeah sure ken yeah we of course we anticipated and we said this before that we thought that q would be the low point from a product growth perspective yearoveryear and unfortunately we were inaccurate in that regard because of the things were facing here but we also believe those things are within our control and we can fix them and that we will be able to get back on track from a product growth perspective ken talanian  evercore group llc okay operator now well go to sterling auty with jpmorgan sterling auty  jpmorgan securities llc yeah thanks hi guys would you say that the execution issues were evident throughout the quarter or did they manifest later in the quarter and the reason im asking just given the good results we saw out of off quarter companies like barracuda and the december quarter earnings from everybody else did this manifest late in the quarter mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc yeah great question sterling i think we could actually back it up a little further from a q perspective and what we saw in q which we talked to you guys about as well which was the first two months being on track and then seeing some slowdown in month three in our case is specific to some large deals in hindsight looking back on that and looking for a pattern in that thats what we saw play out in q as well we had a good november right on track we had good december right on track and then we saw a slowdown but on a much broader base in january so thats what it looked like as far as the q playing out from a linearity perspective sterling auty  jpmorgan securities llc and even though you said the sales execution changes would outweigh any pickup from stuff that was frozen waiting for the new products is there a way to at least quantify how much business you felt rose and waited for the new appliances in pan  launch mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc yeah i dont think it was that much i mean if you look at – were not happy that we came in under the guide right in q on that but we werent that far away from it so its not that much and its also very hard to tease through like whats related to the execution and then what people are saying specifically on product delays so its a little bit difficult to say sterling auty  jpmorgan securities llc got it thank you mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc thanks sterling operator and gregg moskowitz with cowen  company gregg moskowitz  cowen and company llc okay thank you i had a question for steffan if i recall correctly at your last analyst day you talked about palo alto being in high growth mode and put out expectations to continue to grow  or more for the foreseeable future obviously youve guided to  growth for fiscal  and the question really is did these results change your view looking forward of where palo alto sits on the growth and maturity curve steffan c tomlinson  palo alto networks inc yeah so we just came off a quarter where we posted  yearoveryear growth and clearly were not satisfied with that weve identified execution issues that were in the process of working through and we have a high level of confidence theyre within our control and we can fix them we need to get through that work before we call the ball on future levels of growth but i can tell you that we feel very confident in returning to growth and we get these execution issues fixed and well be in a much better position going forward gregg moskowitz  cowen and company llc okay thank you operator and well go to john difucci with jefferies john difucci  jefferies llc thank you from our calculations anyway new business growth was very modest for the second consecutive quarter and i know youre talking a lot about your missed execution but youre really not the only ones to have some challenging quarters over the last year or so i mean even check point has had a couple of quarters – had some challenging periods before that i guess mark if theres anything else other than missed execution what else might be happening out there that could be affecting your results mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc thats a great question john so i think – well a couple things on this one on the new business side we have to acquire new customers and we have to expand in our existing customer base as well and so we always watch both of those and the bulk of the business obviously as we get bigger will come from expansion we just acquired  new customers in the quarter so it seems like from a customer acquisition and winrate perspective and the environment its been healthy it continues to be healthy and what were seeing now is the slowdown from a conversion perspective on the expansion downstream which makes sense to us as we look back onto the gotomarket motions we made about changing these relationships around so existing relationships got changed around a lot within two three different times in a short period of time is going create some anxiety from the customer account coverage perspective and thats where we see the slowdown and the conversion is down through the expansion business john difucci  jefferies llc okay okay and then one area in particular that weve been hearing more about is just trying to protect eastwest traffic which as you know its not something that everybody does and its not something everybody does broadly but i think its generally thought of palo alto networks actually does it very well compared to others at the same time its an area where we do hear people questioning how much theyre going to need to do that especially if they start to move workloads to the cloud are you seeing anything around that today mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc were actually seeing an increase in eastwest traffic interest and protection and the reason its actually is related to the cloud as well because at the same time people are on a journey to the cloud theyre also doing lots of data center work to virtualize and optimize data centers when they do that they use a lot of virtualization inside those data center environments which means that theyre going to microsegment all those environments inside of the data center which is great but then you have to also be able to protect the information and it traverses eastwest through those micro segments not just northsouth so were actually seeing a continually building use case for that or ever since we started off with that with vmware nsx which has been pretty successful for us operator our next question will come from gabriela borges with goldman sachs gabriela borges  goldman sachs  co great thanks for taking the question maybe just a little more on the assumptions that are going into guidance for the back half if i could steffan you mentioned that you are accounting for sales productivity being below the originally planned productivity levels but how does that compare to the productivity levels youre seeing today and similar question for the timing of deal cycles and how long youre assuming deal cycles take to close thank you steffan c tomlinson  palo alto networks inc yeah good question gabriela when were looking at sales productivity relative to our plan we are looking at high singledigit delta between what the planned productivity was and what its actually forecasted to be and were factoring that into our guidance for the second half and were purposefully being prudent and cautious around the guide because we understand that the execution issues will take a while to get through were actively working on those remediations right now and we factor that into the guide and when you look at timing of sales cycle elongation weve seen elongating sales cycles we called that out in q we saw an extension of that in q but on a much broader base so were clearly not satisfied with the yearoveryear growth that were posting and we feel like after we make the execution fixes sales elongation should contract a little bit and sales productivity should increase operator thank you and walter pritchard with citi has our next question walter h pritchard  citigroup global markets inc thanks mark i guess a question for you i look at the metric on new customer adds  looks pretty good im wondering as we look at the results in the context of the new customer adds and the sales changes or the sales disruption it would seem like the sales disruption might impact your ability to bring in new customers and yet that metric was good could you give us some color on how you saw the impact here ripple across the existing customer base the new customer base maybe theres a deal size issue that was a part of it as well just trying to round that all together mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc sure thing walter so we just put up another  net acquisition quarter which is good we have to make some assumptions as we play out the second half of the year with the execution issues as to how that would impact things we will see how that plays out its a little too early to call that right now but as i was telling john a little earlier on his question as well we have to get two things right we have to get the net new customer acquisition right and then even more importantly we have to get the expansion right in the existing customer bases and if you move the relationships around inside of there it can create longer timeframes that you know whats happening from a deal perspective and accurately forecast when you are going to get the ball over the line and i think thats the area where we broke things and were going to go fix them walter h pritchard  citigroup global markets inc and then just a followup for steffan on the duration you talked about three years which it sounds like is an average did you open up a program or anything that drove – because if three years is the average it sounds like there could be a substantial number of customers who are actually finding duration thats longer than three years was there something that was done programmatically either this year or in the quarter to drive that higher steffan c tomlinson  palo alto networks inc there was nothing done programmatically to drive it higher this is a dollar weighted calculation mot a simple average or just number of customers so we always see that customers – weve been seeing this trend over time customers are asking us to standardize for multiyear periods on our architecture we view that as a positive indicator of our technology lead and so theres nothing new from an incentive standpoint to encourage that behavior its more customer driven operator well go to karl keirstead with deutsche bank karl e keirstead  deutsche bank securities inc thank you ive got two questions both on the guidance first your guidance suggests the second half of fiscal  should see about  growth and maybe ill throw this one to mark do you think thats a realistic target for fiscal  do you think you can hit  growth next fiscal year and then the second one is for steffan steffan you mentioned that – if i heard you correctly the billings growth should be less than revenue growth by  to  percentage points in the back half so if the back half revenue growth is  percentage points youre suggesting that the billings growth should be  to  and given that your subscription and maintenance billings are tracking close to  its almost hard to get the billings growth all the way down to  to  and maybe im missing something you could help me with thank you mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc yeah ill take the first one karl so were not happy with the guidance weve put out there were working to fix that of course and we have a number of issues we got to go work on were going to progress through that through the back half of the year and expect that will get us back on track we need to go sort that out and well come back to you as fast as we can with much better answers on a longterm basis for fiscal  we dont think that would be prudent right now to set that out there steffan c tomlinson  palo alto networks inc yeah and from a billings growth standpoint and you look at how that translates to revenue let me start by saying it all really begins with sales productivity and with sales productivity tracking high singledigits below our plan that translates into much lower billings growth if you remember if you look at the composition of our billings we get in the first half of  about  was subscription support and renewal when you look at revenue were effectively indicating that product revenue is going be flat for the full year fiscal  versus  were still anticipating high levels of subscription and support growth from a revenue standpoint but because sales productivity is tracking so far below where we had originally planned and were intentionally taking corrective steps to fix that problem were anticipating much lower billings growth during this transition period as were trying to correct the problems and after we correct the problems we should see a return to much healthier billings growth than what were seeing today and what were forecasting for the balance of the fiscal year karl e keirstead  deutsche bank securities inc got it okay thank you both thats helpful mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc thanks karl operator well continue on to catharine trebnick with dougherty catharine a trebnick  dougherty  co llc oh hi thank you so much for taking my question you had said that the product revenue growth was expected to be now flat yearoveryear outside the execution issues you discussed how much of that flat growth would be attributed to your vmseries and the rapid adoption of migration of the cloud by your enterprise customers and then the second piece of that did i hear you correctly that you said the channel was okay so am i to assume that your competing overlay sales teams perhaps caused some of the execution issues and inaccuracy in your reporting thank you mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc yeah hey catharine its always good to hear from you on the cloud side i dont think the product growth for the second half has anything to do with the cloud thats actually been a good opportunity for us in a lot of ways a lead generator its always when there is something new whether its virtualization or cloud in this case for mobility weve been able to exploit that opportunity is another reason to talk to palo alto networks where somebody may not otherwise and start doing business with them in the first place and do more business over time and thats what weve been seeing so were not happy about the product guide for the second half of the year we dont believe thats due to the cloud im going let mark anderson take the channel question mark anderson  palo alto networks inc yeah so let me just add on a little bit to what mark said firstly the overlay team theres no confusion catharine in what our overlay teams are doing its primarily technical sales overlaying our core sales teams to help them sell traps sell into the cloud environment sell aperture and autofocus were very happy with the way thats going i think as far as the channel goes the channel is a very good channel as we said before theyre executing very well were onboarding new channel partners like aws and microsoft azure our service provider channels continues to get better all of this execution rests on me it rests on the sales team and definitely know what were doing to fix it and were going to be fixing it as we go on through the fiscal year operator well now hear from jonathan ho with william blair jonathan f ho  william blair  co llc hey guys just wanted to understand with a little bit more granularity were there any particular geographies or market segments that we should be on the watch for where the sales execution challenges were more pronounced mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc hey jonathan no this is across the board but it may be obvious but ill state it anyway that with the americas being such a large contributor to the business today thats where we would see the most impact jonathan f ho  william blair  co llc got it and then just in terms of the account coverage shift how long do you expect that to take to really reestablish the results and do you see the potential to sort of get back to growth once these issues have been corrected mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc so from a timing perspective were underway with the activities that i talked about a little earlier well be prosecuting those through the back half of the year and we would hope to have them all finished by the back half of the year and wed be able to come out of the year and into fiscal  in a better position than we are i was saying a little earlier weve got a lot of stuff to sort out here we know we can do better than we are today and what were guiding but it would be too early for us and really not prudent to try to call out what it may be into next year jonathan f ho  william blair  co llc got it thank you mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc thanks jon operator and well go to fatima boolani with ubs fatima aslam boolani  ubs securities llc hi thanks for taking the question question for you mark just with respect to the new product lineup it was obviously one of the bigger launches youve had in the last several years and you did talk about some purchasing positives with respect to the customer base im wondering if you can help us drill down on how you are managing the forecasts for any potential tradedown effects or just generally how you were thinking about that mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc sure thats a very good question so whenever we introduce new hardware were expecting movement from existing hardware products to new ones so in all these cases some customers are going to move up some will move across some are going to move down its just inevitable that its going to occur so we have to try to take all that into account when were forecasting so with the introduction of the pa the  and the  series as the main things we just brought to market we expect were going to see a lot of movement with the new hardware platforms and were going to see two incremental opportunities one is going to be the refresh as we were talking about a little earlier and they also give us a chance to just get new competitive wins with these hardware capabilities and just i think something we also have to think about we have here is that when you are thinking through trade down the impacts you want to make sure thats minimal so its our job to make sure were offering customers a really compelling reason to want a higher capacity and performance for us we see our very high attach rates and use of subscriptions were seeing increasingly growing need for ssl decryptions so customers are looking for a lot more powerful systems like the ones that we just introduced so thats art and science there we hopefully get both of them right fatima aslam boolani  ubs securities llc and a quick follow up if i may you still demonstrated a fair bit of confidence around the installed base to refresh dynamics could you parse out qualitatively for us to what extent that confidence is tied to the base doing sort of upsizing on the hardware refresh versus incremental subscription attach rates and this just in the context of the  percentage point attach rate which didnt really change much versus the past six months mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc sure so theyre related very much so we have – the attach rates have been up yearoveryear from  percentage point to  percentage point and of course theyre attaching the hardware device itself so when we think about refresh opportunities were giving customers a lot to progress towards from a refresh perspective and were also hoping that as happened in the past that people would attach subscriptions at very high rates when they do that and then we also have a great opportunity just to win new business as well with the new hardware along with the growing capabilities with platform as well operator our next question comes from saket kalia with barclays saket kalia  barclays capital inc hey guys thanks for fitting me in here hey first mark maybe just for you obviously you talked about execution challenges a bunch kind of impacting pipeline close rates but can you just qualitatively talk about overall pipeline growth in the second quarter mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc yeah thats a really good question saket so from a pipeline perspective we have done in the past were continuing to do a very nice job in demand generation so we have a very good pipeline in terms of the size of the pipeline we think the quality of the pipeline is very good as well what were seeing though is the conversion of the pipeline so its not really a demand generation issue its really just making sure that we get it converted in the timeframe its going to get converted but the pipelines good saket kalia  barclays capital inc got it and then for my follow up it sounds like maybe one of the execution challenges besides increasing segmentation was maybe moving some accounts to inside sales which might have created some noise im sure that there were a multitude of things with as complex of a sales organizations you have but would you say that that was maybe one tangible item that contributed to some of the challenges this quarter mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc yeah there are multiple things there i cant remember who asked that question before but as an example of something that weve always done in the running of this playbook was increasingly segment the market in this case in trying to drive increasingly higher levels of productivity and better return on investment weve moved a broad swath of customers into the inside sales organization and resourced that accordingly the folks who used to be in what we call  so just think of it simply along those ways and thats really not working out so as just one example of things we need to do is we need to map those accounts back from where they were back into those territories make sure we got the right people focused on them and make sure we realign the resources appropriately saket kalia  barclays capital inc got it very helpful thanks guys mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc thank you saket operator thank you and at this time id like to turn the conference back over to mr mark mclaughlin for any additional or closing remarks mark d mclaughlin  palo alto networks inc great thanks operator i appreciate that before i close id like to thank the palo alto networks team for their
