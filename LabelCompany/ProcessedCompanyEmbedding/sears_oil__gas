to make sure the unit you select is the right size for your home the sears hvac expert does an electronic load calculation estimate to determine the exact type of heat and air conditioning system that’s just right for your home–we don’t just replace it with the same size unit you currently have these calculations take into consideration things such as the size of your home its exposure to the sun and wind the number and size of windows how well insulated it is and more this step is essential so the unit isn’t too small or too large–both waste energy we use current air conditioner refrigerant technology we only install air conditioners with ra refrigerant unlike r refrigerant–which is being phased out–ra refrigerant doesn’t deplete the ozone layer and ra refrigerant makes air conditioners more efficient increasing the seasonal energy efficiency rating seer statistics show that this refrigerant has lower warranty service rates and lower compressor failure rates we discuss
