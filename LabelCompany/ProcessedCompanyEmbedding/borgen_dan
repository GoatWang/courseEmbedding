industry activity so recent events in western canada some announcements of consolidation youve seen the announcements by suncor cnrl cenovus and others up there so what does that mean is that good for the partnership not good for the partnership what does that look like our view is and in talking with  many of these are our customers so we have a good opportunity to talk with them we now have a situation where some of these were partnerships joint ventures we now have owned in strong hands single ownership and investment grade hands were increasing their ownership in the oil sands in western canada we think that this is very positive because now this is their primary focus they dont have permian they dont have other areas that theyre looking at outside of canada for the most part they are strictly focused on developing this significant resource that they have and significant asset base so we think that thats very positive we think that there will be more production than has been contemplated to date theyre not carrying along a partner that was distracted with other capital projects they now have a very renewed focus and quite frankly a fresh spend that they need to return on theyre going to return on that obviously by synergistic benefits lowering their cost in the field as theyve been able to prove and do and also to be able to grow and add additional reserves by production so i think thats exciting for us and i think it just further proves the point that folks are doubling down up there in strong strong hands the additional thing is syncrude fire whats happened up there relative to inplant fires and different things like that so obviously its a supply inventory production type of model so you get production production goes into inventory you sell out of inventory into the market if youre down on the production side youve got whats going to happen youre going to continue to sell produce out of inventory so then when you start coming back online youre going to fill inventory back so that has a potential delay in an oversupplied market in that localized area not it doesnt disappear its simply a short delay as youve seen announcements in the press recently that has restarted and looks to be running in excess of  barrels a day today and they look to ramp up to full production sometime early june to midjune so were still very confident in the upcoming demand cycle that weve been talking about and thats been more commonly reported now across the board both in canada and here in the us by distinguished sources so we continue to feel very bullish i know weve been a bit alone on that coming out of the gate  years ago talking about the demand story in canada but its real its happening were seeing it and its being confirmed in the market brad do you have any other thoughts on that brad sanders yes thank you dan so what the upgrader fire represents are all the things that dan shared with you it was unplanned was temporary in nature so its basically a blip on a macro story that weve been sharing with you all and so thats i think the key point is that the macro storys intact there are unplanned events that will in most cases potentially delay when that materializes for example the  mac fires of last summer materially impacted supply available in the market therefore that supply impact and the eventual impact on the supply versus take away balances up in western canada were impacted this winter its wellknown welldocumented that production was impacted by the extreme cold we have new pipelines being built we have new tanks being built those are onetime demand events that take oil off the market so the point of even talking about the upgraders is to remind folks that the path to the likelihood of moving to rail parity for a significant period of time can be impacted temporarily by events that we cannot predict or influence by any means so we feel very very strongly about the macro and that is being validated by the quality of our discussions on recontracting both at ccr and at hardisty were in detailed discussions with both producers and refiners and they are validating the macro story were talking about and very much validating the value story that weve shared with you in previous discussions about the role of rail and their portfolio and specifically the role in rail when youre in an imbalance of supply versus demand dan borgen great i like it great summary all right let me move to recontracting weve addressed that point i know its probably towards the top of the list for you all in terms of as it is with any midstream company is the recontracting risk and around that and youve heard me say before the ideal situation is to have those recontracting periods come up during high demand so that theres proper leverage in the market to get the same price to higher price or extended term because of demand on cycle were fortunate that our contracts that are coming up are  will be in that cycle they  all market trends point to that so how do we confirm that how do we see that well we have customers at the table now talking about renewals extensions offers counteroffers we also have industry knowledge from folks like the railcar providers those kinds of folks that some of our customers and new customers that are connected in and around our assets are seeking to expand and  their need for additional railcars to support the growing demand story so its not just us saying it its  were seeing it in the market youre hearing from leadership at the  a lot of our customers and potential new customers that are saying we didnt think we were going to need rail use rail but were going to be using rail and one ceo as recent as yesterday made a public statement around dont fear rail is here were going to use that i should have used that term quite frankly that sounds pretty good to me but anyway the rail is here and we  rails been around a long time its a proven delivery source weve got competitive rates out there from railroads weve got  its a good position to be in as it relates to being able to move product ratably dependably safely through the system and so customers existing are looking to fully utilize spots and grow that we have new customers at the table that are looking to sign up for multiyear agreements that we look forward to announcing and talking about in the near future and remember the underlying value of rail is that if you want to talk about it in a ill say a worse case is a peaking facility to be able to handle the overload to be able to handle pipeline disruptions and its a lowcost alternative for that weve seen that for  years and so this is nothing new that im talking about we  youve heard me to say that we are not an opposer of pipelines we think that pipelines do a wonderful program they do  if you want to go from point a to point b its great if you have highquality product and you put in a pipeline unless its really batched and moved in batches you lose some of that value so if youre a spec quality guy coming out which a lot of the customers in canada are they want to preserve that quality they feel like that they can best preserve that quality running it through rail alongside pipeline so there are different means we think this is a strong portfolio contributor to the overall transportation message coming out of canada brad thoughts brad sanders yes one thing i would like to encourage people on the phone to do is to reference our investor deck and on the investor deck youll see a lot of this information youll see the producer deck that shows the oil the various producers the locations of their production when it comes on the quality of their production and equally important youll see that most of that oil is headed towards hardisty and youll also see that a lot of this new production is being produced by customers who are current and are comfortable with rail commitments and have seen the benefits of it thats whats really important here were in the canadian market is unique were talking about a year investment orlonger year investment cycles from a production side and from a takeaway standpoint that creates an enormous amount of uncertainty and an enormous amount of consequences potential consequences if the production cycle and the takeaway cycle arent aligned rail bridges that uncertainty it has a sustainable demand for that single purpose as an example when we were at  under  to  years ago and it drove incremental commitments and build outs of rail takeaway capacity that was a tailwind a benefit for prices going from  under to  to  under as they are today so even though during that period we had utilization rates lower than what was planned the price benefit was enjoyed by the industry primarily the producers who quite frankly are the ones who worry most if not the singular people who worry most about takeaway so the role of rail bridging this uncertainty whether its  utilized or low utilization the benefits are real so thats a key story for rail sustainability why it fits in a portfolio and the ultimate benefits of value dan borgen well said the other thing we talk about theres always a pipeline when is excel going to come on is it going to come on there are different views of that from folks in canada were a believer that it probably will come on but when that continues to be probably a debate there continue to be barriers placed in front of some of those programs so again these production new production volumes are completed being brought on you cant turn them off these are production facilities i guess you could turn them off but at the risk of billions of dollars sitting idle which is not the intent of the customer so theyre going to bring them on turn them on and run them and produce them so we dont know when the pipelines are going to be built people ask us what do you think some say  some say  some say not at all some say theyll be tied up in court thats not ours to pine were not going to pine on it and give a view but all we know is weve got customers at the table that need what we have to offer plan on using it and we look forward to fulfilling that lets talk about  shifting gears talk about our ma process last call we talked about purchasing a new destination terminal and what i can update you on and i was hopeful that we would be able to have an announcement of its closure we are closer we are  its a multiagreementtype transaction and so its a bit more as everyone is complicated but were nearing the conclusion of that we are highly confident of that and what that will do is i think it will continue to show the market the capability of rail the customer commitment to rail the ongoing use of it as a solution and the flexibility of rail and ill talk a little bit more about that hopefully in the near future as we can make additional announcements around that sometimes we get asked about what is the division of the partnership in terms of diversity are you always going to solidly rail look we think rail  as weve said rail for us for  years  over  years has been a core component of the business we think we know it as well as anyone we think it drives the solutions that  provide solutions that weve talked about previously but do we have plans to diversify into more conventional ill call it midstreamtype assets and yes we do we have  weve been purchasing as youve seen more conventional tank  shore pipeline positions were looking to diversify into that space even more were looking to  as we develop out our texasdeepwater facility were  thats more of a conventional docks tanks pipeline connectivity traditional solutions but we do look for that and remember that our rail terminals today and our products terminals today are both inbound and outbound weve got  we just  we made a recent announcement on an ngl at the parent its a new product its underpinned by a five year deal its small today were growing it but totally inbound into the terminal and so as we have said before we will continue to grow that and once the commercial risk is out of it then well look to drop it into the mlp as appropriate i think it also shows that were working well and being creative with our customers and fitting the needs that they have of both outbound and inbound whether thats hardisty casper any of the terminals that we have and looking to grow were looking for that  continue to look to meet customer demand and create flexibility and optionality around that that were uniquely positioned to be able to provide we also announced that we had increased our capacity at  for a lact unit at casper again driven by customer activity again smallscale growing weve commercialized it its working its producing revenue and wed look forward to talking more about its growth in the near term i mentioned texasdeepwater and let me just remind you of how that strategically fits us so whether youre a heavy crude barrel coming out of canada it needs if you talk to our producing customers what they will tell you that they need is they need access to deepwater they need access to a strong refining market they need access to blend components they want to be able to barge it ship it blend it pipeline it and so were not sitting here saying weve got the solutions to everybody but with texasdeepwater we can we are developing that exact facility with the traditional way that weve done it with commercial agreements that are multiyear primarily investment gradebacked that we will get that program developed to meet the need of that heavy barrel coming out of canada where does that barrel primarily want to go if you ask our customers it primarily wants to go to a heavy demand center heavy pun intended both a large demand as well as a heavy crude oil demand and thats what we have in the houston gulf coast with over  of refineries burning intermediates to heavies our refining customers on the other hand thats why they made commitments at casper which will be able to take lowcost feed coming out of canada and creating a reaching further up the supply chain to be able to deliver barrels into by rail into the houston gulf coast again they have the need for inbound rail destination rail facilities and thats what were developing at texasdeepwater in addition to that pipeline barrels coming out of the permian what do they want what are they going to need as we all know weve got light sweet abundance here in the us as the marginal producer arguably here in the globally we have an overabundance and a growing potential overabundance of light sweet that is going to need to find export alternatives now if you know you want to go export therere markets that you can go corpus other places that you can pipe into load out and run ships but if you want optimum flexibility youd like to come to the houston ship channel come to the channel be able to blend off with a heavy barrel be able to make a refiner spec have a barge capability have a deepwater capability again thats what were trying to do whether it be pipeline from west texas whether it be rail or pipeline coming out of canada they all need the same thing thats what were providing at texasdeepwater thats how it fits us strategically in terms of a large destination catchers mitt in the houston gulf coast so with that let me turn it over to josh and he can talk a little bit more about the specifics around that and what youll be hearing more about us talking about with that project joshua ruple thanks dan i think first just a quick description of the asset size and scale matters in regards to these types of development activities and texasdeepwater is  acres in size its located right in the middle of all of the activity in regards to the movement of energy products within the houston ship channel pace also matters weve worked really hard over the last year to position that asset to be able to develop that asset quickly as the commercial opportunities materialize were in a position now at texasdeepwater where our permitting activities are nearing completion in the next few months we literally will be in position to start development very near term thats a good thing for us from a competitive perspective its also a good thing for us as it relates to meeting our customers needs because those needs are now and were able to deliver a now solution another thing thats important i think for us to know in regards to texasdeepwater is that its an asset today thats producing revenue we have railcar activities both storage and working on some transloading revenue plays we have a soontobe waterborne activity related to some barge movements on the houston ship channel we have revenues generated by our dredge site that is the largest and most competitive dredge spoil facility on the houston ship channel something were extremely excited about and also we control a large number of pipeline easements that are critical not only to our own development activities but also to all the whos who in the houston ship channel that are looking to connect to each other to serve customers moving barrels to water so ultimately texasdeepwater is a really important part of our diversification strategy it allows us to move into new areas of business to build new types of assets and those assets are longterm in nature come with them really strong customers and also come with them the type of contracts that fit very well into the mlp story dan borgen okay thanks josh appreciate the update there all right lets  i think weve tried to cover most of the hot topics but would love to  anything we didnt answer wed love to handle now so if theres anybody whos got questions well move to those and try to answer those questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from derek walker with bank of america derek walker appreciate the new format guys and a lot of good color there just some small questions for me i guess just around the anticipated cbr terminal that you talked about dan i guess is there any kind of nuances there to the extent that you can talk about it as far as kind of what you need to get that kind of where to go on dan borgen you know me derek id love to tell you everything i know but i cant so im looking across at keith our general counsel and compliance officer and hes shaking his head so i can  i guess what i can brad sanders i would say  this is brad derek i would say time and not much indiscernible if thats encouraging at all dan borgen we feel very bullish about that i dont know what more  how much more confidence i can lean in on that but were close were close i think once we announce it youll be able to see maybe the moving parts and why it took a little bit longer in terms of just the parts on it but like i said before its going to be a good thing for the partnership its going to be a strategically important asset its going create some additional destination connectivity anyway youve heard me say before that anything that we look at whether we build it or we buy it it has to have its own independent terminal value plus a good network contribution to the overall network and this asset will do exactly that derek walker and then dan i think in your remarks you mentioned the  kind of the ngl service at hardisty is rather small right now but could eventually be a drop down to usdp i guess how do you see that kind growing over time and is that something youd like to see over the nearterm or its just more of a kind of a medium to longterm kind of thought process joshua ruple derek this is josh i can just give you a quick comment on that were already working on plans to scale that facility up we have work going on right now both technically and from an operating perspective to scale it up as far as our vision in drop down adam youre probably best to answer that adam altsuler sure i mean as you saw in the press release it was a takeorpay contract as we said its relatively small its less than  million of ebitda so were as we scale it up and continue to grow it and derisk it and make it more of a mature asset we would love to drop it down dan borgen but derek on a followup to that i think what that shows is the optionality that rail has both outbound inbound right so inbound truck out inbound pipeline out those types of things and so as we have rail capacity that is evolving were always looking for valleys potential valleys in the operation that we can fill weve done that for years to be able to look at the seasonality fit the seasonality with new inbound or outbound opportunities that are multiproduct multimodel that again fit the needs of the customers thats the business were in and rail is truly flexible to be able to do that derek walker got it and then just switching over to casper i know youre trying to capture some spot volumes there i guess do you have a i know that theres some variability but do you have a sense on how the spot volumes may kind of evolve and how that may compare to the prior contract expiration in august brad sanders derek brad well given the disruptions weve talked about earlier starting with the mac fires last summer you can see that the differentials have continued to tighten and given that they have the incentives to do spot volumes or utilize the assets have been reduced as a function of just incentives so thats where we are today thats not where were going to be in the future and so when we return to where there is an incentive as a function of price to leverage rail facilities we think well be this is our opinion we think well be very active either commercializing on a term basis or on a spot basis specifically at ccr as a function of  critical drivers one is the refiners have spent the money there they are now in business to capture value so if we return to levels that incents activity from producer to refiners the most advantaged asset in that regard could be ccr and so we feel really comfortable that the refiners will seek activity there first given the history and the assets that theyve built there i would remind folks as weve gone through a cycle thats been tough that has been a very active facility for us i would remind people that is a refinerbased facility not a producerbased facility so that starts to differentiate why were excited about whats going to happen from a spot basis the final thing i would say is were working with enbridge and want to make sure that we optimize completely their needs and our needs as it relates to hardisty or gen express and all the things that matter so we feel really good about it adam altsuler and one minor point derek this is adam just wanted to mention that the customer we mentioned last quarter continues to be the most active shipper at the terminal operator our next question comes from mike gyure with janney mike gyure probably the one topic that you might not have touched on and ill ask about it is i guess the crude  im sorry the two ethanol terminals in san antonio and west colton how does that kind of fit into the grand scheme of things and maybe what youre seeing in the markets kind of at those facilities i realize theyre small but kind of just understanding kind of what youre thinking longerterm with those terminals adam altsuler sure with  its adam so with regard to the whole portfolio of cash flow its relatively small its less than i think  of the cash flows of the partnership but we do have particular expertise in that with the senior management team so its something that were always looking at expanding we do see opportunity there both at the parent and the mlp and weve got a good relationship with this customer so to the extent that we could grow it and grow it in the same way that we think about our crude business and refined product business and things like that whether it be takeorpay contracts supported by high credit customers i think it could be a growing part of the portfolio but its just going to be kind of opportunitybased brad sanders mike this is brad so i would actually be more positive about the space we think that its a great space we think the underlying macros supports growth we think the existing assetbase out there is probably through time and spontaneous order or probably the right assets at the right location so growth can happen two ways when you go beyond e to  and im just using e as an example then youre going to get more volume through that space but youre  or the existing assets but youre also going to drive new development we think the opportunity to move beyond e is real as a function of just environmental demand and drivers but we also think just to remind folks that  and we talk about ethanol specifically but its truly just a gasoline blending component and as a blending component its got some really good things like octane value its got some notsogreat things like rvp but when you combine the two it is the cheapest octane available in the market so were very bullish we think the underpinning macro even without regulation is very strong because of its component value in a gasoline world so wed like  were very purposed about identifying opportunities and trying to grow that space dan borgen well said i really dont have anything to add but when i think of ethanol and when anyone else thinks about ethanol you really just need to think of it as an octane and it really is a  thats its primary function it  and so within demand in every gallon of gasoline from an octane enhancer so in markets certainly in the markets were in brad sanders and globally so its texasdeepwater as well dan borgen thats right thats exactly right so as we think about that at texasdeepwater  and remember texasdeepwater is crude refined products and blend components so as a blend component for a gasoline blend stock ethanol is the most efficient for that and so you will see that at a texasdeepwater development as a component to that so both for local and for export does that help answer that mike gyure that absolutely helps answer that and then maybe completely unrelated followup on kind of the rail car i guess supplydemand equation that you see out there maybe compared to where you were kind of a quarter ago  months ago versus i guess maybe expectations for the back half of year if you believe that sort of the demand is picking up and kin of what you see in there dan borgen yes sure matter of fact i had senior folks in the office yesterday talking about just the shortage they have no cars available today they will have to manufacture all new cars which is a change and a positive again additional demand on story and you know it runs in cycles and then theres a transition in the railcar space to move to a heavier picker line car which fortunately the cars that we have we saw that coming and got ahead of that curve and have as part of our portfolio the availability of those cars but we continue to see tightness in the market for the heavy demand cars for cars needed to come out of canada those are the ones that are preferred to for transportation by the railroads and theres price incentive to do that so we theres a tightening in that market as i said earlier and were getting it first hand from the railcar providers operator operator instructions with no further questions coming into queue i will hand the program back over to dan borgen for any additional remarks dan borgen all right so thanks again and we appreciate the patience on this new format hopefully its been helpful and more interactive thats our intent we want it to be not a scripted message i know some of this stuff has to be but we want to be able to share openly with you what weve got and what how we feel about the market and the demand thats coming were ill say comforted people ask me a lot of times what keeps you up at night what doesnt keep me up at night is the demand the demand is coming weve verified it with the customers by customer and again refer you to the investor deck you can see the list of that we dont give the customer but for proprietary reasons but you can see the demand on that it is coming so i dont i sleep well at night about that timing of that obviously buyers disrupt that different things but we feel very very bullish about that that is going to be the event you cant buy a spot at hardisty today there are no sellers of spots therefore further evidencing that the customers are going to be utilizing the full extent of their spots the operational planning in terms of ramping up that volume crew availability locomotive availability all of those kinds of things are discussions on the way to ramp up to full value and full volume so we feel good about that theres all were trying to do is keep our head down get this transaction closed that weve been talking about get that done continue to look for good opportunities that fit us from a corporate development standpoint both organically as well as acquisitions and weve got additional parties that were talking to about additional opportunities in that and we look forward to talking more about those opportunities in the future so with that said thanks again for being on the call please give your feedback if there is something we could tweak a little differently to provide additional information ashley is the perfect person to feedback on that and well close with that thanks

go ahead ashley means good morning and thank you for joining us welcome to our fourth quarter  earnings call with me today are dan borgen our chief executive officer adam altsuler our chief financial officer brad sanders our chief commercial officer as well as several other members of our senior management team yesterday evening we issued a press release announcing results for the three and months ended december   if you would like a copy of the press release you can find one on our web site at usdpartnerscom before dan and adam proceed with the prepared remarks please note that the safe harbor disclosure statements regarding forwardlooking statements in last nights press release applies to the statements of management on this call also please note that information presented on todays call speaks only as of today march   any timesensitive information provided may no longer be accurate at the time of any webcast replay or reading of the transcript finally todays call will include discussion of nongaap financial measures please see last nights press release for reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures and with that ill turn the call over to dan dan borgen thank you ashley good morning and thank you everyone for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results adam will cover more of the financial details in a minute but overall the partnership had another great quarter as a result of our highly contracted cash flows with our quality of customers as well as the successful performance of the casper acquisition this enables us to announce seventh consecutive distribution increase with more than  times to distribution coverage for the quarter in recent months our thesis about the western canada crude oil market has began to play out longhaul export pipelines are running near or full utilization a portion meant has continued to trend higher and producers have announced several new projects to increase capacity at the oil sands facilities some of which have been previously deferred we expect that this new production will require new takeaway capacity and our terminals are very well positioned at the right locations to meet customer needs in a timely and capital efficient way both our hardisty and casper terminals have scalable designs which should provide us with a competitive advantage relative to any newly propose projects for a variety of reasons the catalyst for recontracting with our customers will ultimately be the spread of discount that western canada crude receives relative to competing grades or crude oil such as maya in the gulf coast as production begins to exceed pipeline capacity producers of western canada crude will begin to offer lower prices in order to incentivize refiners to utilize alternative modes of transportation to access those barrels already canada reported  month high for crude by rail exports during the month of december remember the partnership owns the only unit train capable terminal serving the hardisty hub and the only unit train capable terminal directly connected to the express pipeline so we firmly believe that our terminals represent two of the best alternatives for the industry and that the demand for our services will continue and increase that being said we do have renewal risk as online stream businesses do including a nearterm contracting opportunity resulting from the scheduled expiration of a customer contract for our casper terminal at the end of august while that customer did not exercise this option to extend for another three year term they invested in real takeaway infrastructure and originally committed at the terminal to create advantaged access to discounted feedstock for their refineries theyve stated they continue  will continue to use the facility and are actively involved in negotiations with us to do so as a reminder casper has been one of our most active terminals and we believe we expect strong utilization over the next cycle as such were in active dialogue with that customer as well as potential new customers to utilize the space going forward and remain confident in the timing and quality of our discussions with both producers and refiners in addition to term contracts we have the capacity to serve spot volumes to casper which could result in throughput rates above what would receive for committed volumes lastly we are in discussions with partners and customers create new and unique ways to utilize both our rail and storage assets at casper based on customer demand we recently invested in the asset to add additional flexibility to source and deliver crude oil which we look forward to talking about more on future calls on the destination side our sponsors texas deepwater development in the houston ship channel stands to benefit not only from the growing volumes in western canada which should displace other imports into the gulf coast but also from the tremendous growth expected out of the permian basin in west texas we estimate that recent announcements of additional permian pipeline capacity with delivery into the houston area will translate into demand for over  million barrels of crude storage plus potentially more for the associated refined products as such were busy at work with multiple potential partners and customers to assess how best to leverage our large deepwater position to serve crude refined products and blending components as well as build our connectivity within the houston market which offers the most optionality while more likely a late  early  event dropping these assets in through the mlp would substantially grow and diversify the partnership’s cash flows and add more high quality integrated energy companies to our customer list on the ma front we have capital to spend and look forward to executing on attractive opportunities including assets and venture opportunities outside of those broadly marketed by the street we are currently in the final negotiations of purchase and sell agreement to do exactly that within an off market asset that fits our strategy well and we look forward to giving more update on that in closing im confident about the strategic positioning of our assets about the positive macro signals emerging in the market and with continued market demand our ability to deliver another year of  to  distribution growth to our unit holders with that ill turn the call over to adam adam altsuler thank you dan and thank you for joining us on the call this morning please note that we issued our fourth quarter earnings release yesterday afternoon in addition we intend to file our full year  k after market close today to be accessible on the secs web site at wwwsecgov for the fourth quarter we reported net cash provided by operating activities of  million adjusted ebitda of  million and distributable cash flow of  million our results reflect the stable and predictable nature of our cash flows from primarily investment grade customers with approximately  of our adjusted ebitda before corporate expenses generated from takeorpay contract the partnership achieved significant growth during the fourth quarter of  relative to the fourth quarter of  net cash provided by operating activities increased by  while adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow increased by  and  respectively this growth is primarily attributable to the partnership’s acquisition of the casper terminal in november  and was partially offset by higher interest expense on additional borrowings used to fund the acquisition as well as additional operating costs associated with managing and operating the terminal distributable cash flow for the fourth quarter of  also benefited from a partial tax refund with respect to  of approximately  million related to the activities of its foreign subsidiaries additionally the partnership received the remaining outstanding tax refund of approximately cad in february of  which will show up in our q  numbers and we do not expect to receive any additional refunds with respect to our  canadian income taxes the partnership expects to pay approximately cad million in canadian income taxes with respect to  these estimates for income taxes are based on the partnerships current operations and are subject to fluctuations in the operating results of our foreign subsidiaries and the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar among other factors net income for the fourth quarter decreased by  as compared to the fourth quarter of  primarily as a result of a noncash impairment charge of  million associated with our san antonio ethanol terminal we are currently in discussions with an investment grade customer about providing an alternative industry solution using a new advantage location servicing the san antonio ethanol market we look forward to communicating more details about this opportunity as things continue to develop on february st the partnership declared a quarterly cash distribution of  per unit or  per unit on an annualized basis which represents growth of  relative to the third quarter of  and  relative to the fourth quarter of  the distribution was paid on february th to unitholders of record as of february th as of december st the partnership had total available liquidity of approximately  million including  million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and undrawn borrowing capacity of  million on its  million senior secured credit facility subject to continued compliance with financial covenants the partnership is in compliance with its financial covenants and has no maturities under our senior secured credit facility until july  in summary we are pleased with our strong liquidity position and strong distribution coverage for the quarter and as dan mentioned we believe that our highquality customer base and strategically located assets will continue to provide a solid foundation for future growth will now will enable us to generate distribution growth of  to  in  and with that i would like now to open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from gabe moreen with bank of america derek walker this is derek on for gabe just a couple quick ones you mentioned the ethanol opportunity at san antonio is that something that would be taken on at the usd level or the usdp level adam altsuler that would be taken out to the usdp level derek walker then as far as the recontracting risk you mentioned around casper i just want to get a little more color there so the customer there did not renew and are they expected to use spot volumes around that is that how i heard that dan borgen the best way to answer that is that contractually the customer had an extended period of time to renew discussions around the renewal and so weve not  its in the affirmative so we have to get a renewal declaration from them to do so and so we just wanted to advise the market that we have not received that at this time however a customer said they want to continue to use the facility and obviously for competitive and negotiation leverage i’d probably do the same thing if i were them but were at the table with them to discuss what they do plan on using the facility and it could  were negotiating an additional term agreement or as we have other demand for the team loan as well and other customers at the table new customers we may choose to shift that to more of a spot volume deal with them perhaps depending upon the negotiated rates derek walker and just as far as with the existing contract do you have a sense on how much that contributes in annual ebitda adam altsuler so the customer we referenced for approximately  million of adjusted ebitda in  but when you think about the impact going forward its hard to say the exact impact based on what dan said and in our view that we think they’ll be material and significant spot volume relative to terminal going forward dan borgen derek additional color on that this customer has converted several other refineries to handle the product that comes through this facility and continues to be one of our strongest users of the facility today and as i said their plan is to continue to use facility especially as we see a cheaper feedstock for them that was their whole intent to spend the capital that they did at the refineries as well as investing with us in this terminal so we feel pretty bullish about where we are there but obviously were in a negotiation period with them as was intended by the contract and so we look forward to been able to get something done with them on  that’s favorable to the partnership and well continue to utilize the terminal derek walker i guess the last one from me is just and i think previously mentioned some preliminary groundwork around hardisty and how do you see that evolving throughout  dan borgen so we have completed a phase through the winter months that we wanted to try to complete and we brought that on just last week so we feel very good about where we are there in terms of keeping up with our customer demand for future expansions we have cut our timeframe down from one year to nine month completion by doing the work that we did we look for a full third train loading capability  sole loading capability at that facility so we feel very good about that and that came in on budget on time so were very proud of our project team for doing that operator our next question comes from poe fratt with da davidson poe fratt just to drill down a little bit more on the contract renewal when you will get the  million of ebitda relative to what actual volumes versus the contracted volumes how well you utilized can you give us a flavor of how closely were to fully utilizing that contracted volume adam altsuler theyre one of the more active shippers at the terminal but as you probably known we don’t give customer volumes or really out of respect for our shippers but i would say they are more and more active customers at the terminal poe fratt then if you look at your contracts in ’ and ’ can you give us an appreciation for either on an ebitda basis or percentage of ebitda basis what the contracts expirations represent adam altsuler so all of our hardisty contracts expire in  and at the casper terminal theyve been staggered so we have one obviously in ‘ one in ’ and one in ‘ but again we don’t give specific ebitda breakouts for the customer contracts poe fratt yes i get that and what i was trying to do is look at  you have  of  ebitda expiring over the next two years and just trying to get an appreciation for how thats weighted in ‘ and ’ and if i am hearing correctly it sounds like its more weighted towards ’ than it is ’ adam altsuler thats right the hardisty terminal is i think its about  of our adjusted ebitda so more heavily weighted towards ‘ dan borgen let me just add some color maybe to that were in a renewable business right and it happens all the time what we like is that the renewal of these contracts both in ’ and ’ are coming up in a highdemand period or highdemand cycle we like that thats the best time to have renewals come up we have no signals from ’ or ’ customers obviously that they would change their tone or tune remember the build of the casper asset was to take advantage of cheaper feedstocks coming out of canada thats why all of the customers at the terminal are refiners and integrated so they like that opportunity thats the full intent of what the casper facility was built for and so we look forward to this negotiation period quite frankly because we have an opportunity to perhaps increase weve seen that before in demand cycles at other terminals where weve had contracts renew and we’ve been able to increase our unit price i would call it for the throughput so we look at it like the portfolio but we look at do we take a shorter term higher price should we take a longerterm obviously the longer the term generally the better the price but do like the period that we’re entering into there’s highdemand and like the market leverage that that provides all terminal operators poe fratt yes understood its a little higher than i anticipated as far as the percentage that was expiring in  so i was just trying to calibrate ‘ dan borgen sure poe fratt when you look at the distribution growth range that youve given for ’ of  to  can you talk about the parameters that would make you look at the high end versus low end adam altsuler i think we feel good about where we are with regard to distribution growth if you look at  we feel like we can end  with the fullyear  average of distribution coverage of  or greater just given our existing business and obviously our assets are well positioned to benefit from the western canada production story so as that continues to play out well continue to give more color on that as we meet with our board on a quarterly basis and report dan borgen we continue to remain bullish about where we’re going from a distribution growth standpoint but the  to  based on what were seeing today is very reasonable for us and so we feel confident on that but obviously thats subject to market conditions and the way the wind flow poe fratt and i know its difficult to give any color on the asset that youre talking about you’re in final negotiations but can you  would you be willing to offer size and multiple at this point in time or is it just too early and then also when you think this might get over the finish line as far as whether its first half of  event or whether its potentially a second half any color would be helpful dan borgen so let me say this we are close we will be spending some additional dollars on the asset to retro it to handle to fit our specific need our perspective revenue start would come towards later in the year versus shorter in the year but it is asset that fits us well that will  that fits our strategy from ill call it more of a destination versus an origination and we look forward to trying to been able to talk more about that in the near term this is again not a ill say publicly competed but a discussion between ourselves and both a prior customer and a corporate entity that is sizeable and so we have exchanged documents back and forth and were getting closer on that thats probably as much color as i can give at it this time poe fratt as far as sizing dan any color on just how large this transaction might be dan borgen really now levered to say exact sizing but i would say itd be meaningful for the partnership poe fratt and then adam do you just capex numbers for  either total or maintenance and growth adam altsuler weve got a small amount of maintenance capex budgeted for the full year and itd be in line with last year i would say growth weve got one identified project that dan mentioned at casper and that’s just investing in the asset to be more flexible with regard to sourcing and delivering the crude multiple speakers thatd be growth capital its a relatively small deal but its been  were doing that really in response to customer demand and the market opportunity we see so id call it less than  but we feel like itd get adequate returns given the market opportunity were seeing poe fratt so total capex shouldnt be  should be under  million ex this acquisition opportunity adam altsuler it would be much lower than that the maintenance capex call it around  to  and the growth capex less than  and that’s just for the identified projects of course something else should up it would change that number but just for what we referenced on the call today operator operator instructions our next question comes from mike gyure with janney mike gyure talk a little bit about the rail rate environment and whats going on there now that youre seeing more drilling and more activity and more id say demand on the rail system from users like frac sand and places like that dan borgen so we work very well with our rail road partners and the railroads have been i would say aggressive to replace lost revenues from coal and so its a great time for us to be at the table growing rail revenues i think that we are working with our customers and railroads to get some term volume and pricing on freight rates we think the railroads have told us that they can handle both the increased frac sand demand as well as growing demand for crude and related products on rail without a problem there is some ramp up from  several of them have reduced crew counts there is plenty of locomotive power and its approximately three to sixmonths sevenmonths leadup in terms of training crudes and that kind of thing to bring that back to work to handle growing volume the volumes that we’re seeing and forecasting now are easily served by both of the servicing railroads that we currently use at several of our facilities so long answer to say weve got bullish partners that want more revenue they want to be aggressive and they want to grow the revenue theyve all pushed their operating ratios very well and continue to drive cost out of their business and so its important for them to create additional revenue opportunities across the top mike gyure and then maybe a followup on your hardisty asset up there expansion plans i think originally you were thinking later  it sounds like maybe  might be more of the time when the capex would start working on the expansion can you maybe kind of update… dan borgen we would like to drive through the summer months as hard as we could in terms of expansion there and as i said earlier weve reduced our build time from one year to approximately nine months maybe even little less than that and so we would like to see those dollars those capex dollars spent wherein sooner than  obviously we have the months nine months from today if we started today that would put us pretty much revenue start into ’ but in terms of building and constructing and bringing that to the table were seeing some of our producing customers in canada accelerating their production faster than they thought they could bring in the more production online and these are existing customers that we have as well as new customers so our existing customers have asked us to remain vigilant with the growth that we have and were in good contact with them about our timing of that obviously we would have like to  they are coming out of a tough winner where they had to throttle back some of their production to be able to just because of the cold conditions and so there i think theyre trying to ramp back up and catch up with some of that we’re continuing to see inventory builds up there and obviously pipeline allocations are in the high ss so its all the drivers and all the signals with there that additional train capacity is going to be needed were already permitted were already ready to go from that standpoint and weve  as i said we had a lot of work through this period of time and completed that so that we could get be in place to meet the demand at the request of the customers operator our next question comes from robert balsamo with fbr robert balsamo you addressed the supply growth out of canada refiners’ preference for some of these crudes the goal i think thats something that we’ve heard from other operators in the midstream space with greater demand for heavier quality and coming as great imports and exports of the lighter volumes could you address maybe just  as growth comes out of canada like what volumes might be displaced dan borgen i think im going to ask brad sanders who is on the call as well to  our chief marketing officer to speak about that and then i can followup brad brad sanders you did state correctly that us continues to be an importer of heavy crude heavy sour crude and an exporter of the lighter grades the production from the shale formations as an example as we get new production there on the margin that production will have to find access to water but from a heavy standpoint the canadian barrel headed towards the gulf coast primarily the houston region which is importing i would say the gulf coast region generally somewhere between  million and  million a day of heavy oil will displace production from the middle east heavy production from the middle east but primarily venezuelan grades and grades from mexico maya in particular so its what i would call regional grades and then on the margin grades from the middle east operator and we have a followup from the line of poe fratt with da davidson poe fratt on hardisty it sounds like youve done a lot of work in getting shortening the lead time there can you give us some idea of just cost of that potential project dan borgen no we dont disclose our capital costs poe and on that were being efficient in our spend there but we do not disclose our capital costs on project poe fratt dan just to clarify would that be done at usdp  at the partnership or the gp dan borgen itll be upstairs we do it up there to take the construction risk out and get all that out and then drop it in as a performing asset operator weve a question from the line of elliot miller a private investor unidentified analyst i was curious about the impact of the border adjustment tax if it passes and how that would be affected by the displacements by canadian crude or other foreign crudes dan borgen i think thats a great question elliot i think that we continue to monitor that and i think that there  i was at a senior level gettogether recently that folks more and they now plugged in on that gave it a less than  chance of passing in terms of a broader tax i think obviously with the new administration there is some stable rambling about those types of things from a beer tax to a variety of things but remember that canada is one of  lets just talk about canada for a minute canada is one of the is the largest importer of us produced crude primarily in the eastern canada so to complete that game if they wanted to they also are big importer of automobiles and other things so i think its a  i think it certainly something we need to keep our eye on were not overly concerned or worried about that we think that the demand of the us refiners and the heavier us intermediate to heavy refiners will continue to demand the product that they need we think that the light suite of bakken permian clearly as others have stated much better than i can are looking to go export the demand the incountry demand us demand for a intermediate to heavy crude is something that i think will continue to drive crude being put into the us refiners and whether a broader tax is implemented it will be absorbed through this system but we think based on what were seeing thats a lesser likelihood than  ill say also remember that competing barrels are also imports so if the heavy multiple speakers thats right so if its venezuelan barrel or if its a mexico barrel its an imported and i think would be subject to more of broader tax than from a friendly country of adjacent neighbor to us in terms of coming from canada a good trading partner of ours versus venezuela who arguably is not as friendly a trading partner with us unidentified analyst the other question i want to raise is about competition from the keystone what are your thoughts on that dan borgen its great question pipelines are additional takeaway opportunities and so anytime a pipeline is being built of nine points whatever billion i think latest number from transcanada on the xl program it could have an impact on crude takeaway it fills the need now our view is it still has some hurdles to get through not just the matter of getting over the border but on statebystate countybycounty fight getting through i think there are still some challenges i think the other side is we have had a production  when all of those pipelines were originally contemplated whether the energy east tmx xl any of those production in canada was estimated to be  million barrels its south of  million barrels today so the driver demand for long term high cost pipelines are something that could be debatable so one its a high price alternative two it takes some time to get in place and the need and demand is now and we are uniquely situated with   approximately  barrels a day of permitted capacity that can come out of and help deliver canadian production to refining centers uniquely situated in the gulf coast united states so it is an alternative dont misunderstand me clearly its an alternative but its out there a few years and its expensive and its got some headwinds weve had some producers that say regardless we are still rail is still part of our portfolio and will continue to be regardless of that and because rail gives us things that a pipeline doesn’t give us flexibility remember rail does a few different things it does not only a physical takeaway but it gives the opportunity to take the best markets you put in a pipeline you basically go from point a to point b at point b might be where you want to go but the quality of the product also thats put into rail can be segregated and maintained and kept delivered to the market multiple speakers unidentified analyst no ive seen all of that presentation im familiar with it believe me honestly im familiar with that is it safe to say that when keystone xl does happen and i understand that there are barriers that have to be met and crossed but its  when that happens it will still not be priced competitive with usds rail business dan borgen i would say that we dont know what the pricing on a delivered keystone xl program would be but if you were running east coast barrel today it currently is not in the money to do that it could be a physical takeaway but its not in the money today and youd prefer to run rail to the gulf coast because itd be more competitive so i can answer it that way we and the railroads will continue to remain competitive whether itd be a pipeline barrel for all the reasons weve previously discussed so we compete with pipelines every day and as they do with us but we also think that theyre just part of the takeaway portfolio like i said our customers have  continued to remain committed to rail as a part of it they own railcars theyre in place with those they like that optionality so like any portfolio they like that whether itd be peaking for them whether itd be peaking asset or whether itd be something thats moving every day they like the optionality that rail provides to them and i think theyre looking at multiyear commitments on freights on railroads should be able to maintain a competitive cost component because remember the freight rate is from the railroads is the significant portion of the overall move were veryvery small so from a insurance standpoint they can continue to hold place that our terminal had a relatively small cost and as one side to me its cheaper than the insurance that i pay on the pipeline so its a good alternative to have that capability when its needed operator and that does conclude our qa session for today i will now hand over program back over to dan borgen for any additional or closing remarks dan borgen very good thank you just i think weve covered a lot of ground today and some great questions and great concerns but with all of that said we remain very bullish about our business and we remain confident in the drivers the macro and micro drivers that we’re seeing weve been talking about this for a while and certainly we’ve come out of a valley that has been impactful to the entire industry there is renewed momentum both in canada and in obviously at select areas here in united states and so we remain bullish we see the drivers are supporting what weve been saying i know youve read the stories in the announcements from a lot of our customers in canada who continue to reduce their costs on a produced barrel to remain very competitive south of  a barrel in some case south of  a barrel and other cases so they have gotten very efficient through this downturn as we all have and so we continue to have customers demanding rail takeaway solution and weve reduced our construction now to our next phase of expansion up there down to nine months and end to be able to meet that demand i think that all signals are lining up that we should have some positive announcements around that in the future the renewal options are coming at strong demand periods and ill just say this frankly if you’re not comfortable with renewal risk in the midstream business you probably shouldn’t be in it because the renewal risk is just part of the business that we have but we were very much like the opportunity to have those renewals come in at strong demand periods and we’re entering those cycles weve seen it before weve been doing this for a longtime cycles come and go but strategic assets are important and needed and we like the opportunity to be able to renegotiate pricing again previous cycles that weve been through weve seen i will say doubling and tripling of unit pricing to meet demand when demand is strongly on and there is more supply than takeaway thats the market that we’re headed towards and my committing that we’re going to see double and triple certainly not but weve seen those markets before and we like the opportunity to have revive at the apple and renew and weve got new customers at the table now talking to us new potential customers at the table so we like that marketing and leverage that that gives us as well and rail as you see the numbers and these are all fact points you can verify independently but the rail  crude on rail is growing and in canada and so its proving the point that there is not enough pipeline takeaway that any new pipeline are few to several years away if at all and so demand is going to be on in the period that we are uniquely capable of solving for them so with that ill say thank you and appreciate the time today and we look forward to talk about other positive things concerning our partnership thanks so much operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude
