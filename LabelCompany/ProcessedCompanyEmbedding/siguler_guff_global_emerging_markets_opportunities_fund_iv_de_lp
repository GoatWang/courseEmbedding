enormous pressure to take greater risk in order to achieve higher returns and meet actuarial return targets a fiduciary can most responsibly achieve target returns through active asset management and investing with strong experienced partners — george siguler managing director  founding partner a high rate of disposable income increasing g and broadband penetration and an educational system that produces over  graduates with technical degrees each year make russia strongly positioned to become one of the largest and most dynamic consumer internet markets in the world — drew guff managing director  founding partner historically the high returns in the buyout business have come from investments that were made during a recession or in the early stages of economic recovery — george siguler managing director  founding partner in the coming years emerging markets will continue to play a major role in global economic power and private consumption shifts the private equity asset class in emerging markets continues to show strong returns and better downside protection compared to public markets the recent discorrelation presents an interesting entry point for experienced investors looking to increase their emerging markets exposure in an attractive pricing and currency environment — ralph jaeger managing director in both the us and europe the hangover effects from overindulgence in the prior economic cycle – risk aversion and low conviction – are leaving pockets of inefficiency and opportunity in todays market this circumstance is particularly pronounced in europe where the euro crisis of  is still fresh and the disposition of nonperforming loans and bad assets from the boom era is in full swing in both markets a value investor in commercial real estate has to be selective but the opportunity remains to uncover good quality assets at a low basis by taking advantage of financially distressed situations — james corl managing director siguler guff takes a highly opportunistic approach to distressed investing and tactically allocates capital across assets and strategies in a market of waning and waxing conviction we continue to believe in a strategy of high selectivity and patience for investors with longerterm outlooks — james gereghty managing director small buyout funds target a portion of the us economy that is similar in aggregate size to the middle market generating approximately  trillion of total annual revenue and employing  million people however only  billion of capital was raised by small buyout funds in  to target a universe of  small companies when compared to the middle market this represents nearly ten times as many target companies but only a small fraction of the capital raised we believe these compelling supplydemand characteristics make the small buyout market significantly more attractive than any other segment of the buyout space sources the market that moves america by ge capital and the ohio state university  pitchbook h  pe and vc fundraising and capital overhang report — kevin kester managing director we chose siguler guff as our partner due to their unparalleled experience investing in the region and long history of venture investing in the us — arkadiy dobkin cofounder ceo  president of epam systems in our experience small buyouts have remained inefficient and difficult for large investors to access providing capital to facilitate the transition of familyowned and owneroperated companies is private equity investing at its best — kevin kester managing director history  siguler guff is
