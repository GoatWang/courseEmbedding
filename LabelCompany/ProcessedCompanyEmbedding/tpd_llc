labs embraces tpd with compliance nicopure labs embraces tpd with compliance jwylandtin  the european union enacted its tobacco products directive tpd to regulate conventional tobacco products across the continent thirteen years later the eu amended the tpd to incorporate vaping products regardless of their lack of tobacco content the vaping industry had been put on noticemay   was chosen as the deadline for each of the eu member states to enact the new rules of the tpd directive into national law with the discretion to exceed those minimum requirements in  and  most though not all eu countries have implemented national tpdrelated legislation  now here we are in  and tpd compliance is a reality for nicopure labswith a sizeable business in the eu especially in france the uk and the netherlands we at nicopure consider it both our duty and our mission to support and service retailers distributors and vape consumers throughout europe compliance with the tpd provides nicopure with the opportunity to connect with our overseas business partners and consumers to build a stronger relationship of trustto that end we have sent compliance certification statements to all our valued business partners in the eu assuring them thatthe nicopure labs llc products are compliant with tpd specifications notably bottle size and labeling andthe products we currently manufacture and export to the european union were notified through the online eu notification portal before the november   deadline and are therefore compliantmeeting the requirements of the revised tpd was not a simple task it took many months and the efforts of multiple teams worldwide to achieve but nicopure is proud to say we’ve registered in the following eu member states product offerings and nicotine strengths may vary by country successfully navigating the applicable individual often complex compliance requirements of these countries austria belgium bulgaria cyprus the czech republic estonia finland france germany greece ireland italy lithuania the netherlands poland portugal romania slovakia slovenia spain sweden and the ukat the end of the day tpd compliance is beneficial for both consumers and vape product manufacturers especially major ones like our company indeed we’re touting many of the benefits that will result from its implementationit’s hard to argue with the tpd’s requirement to disclose eliquid ingredients to the various member states hard that is unless you have something in your eliquids that you’d rather not be known providing ingredients information instills greater consumer confidence that you’re offering a good quality productfor nicopure quality ingredients are what distinguishes our products from other manufacturers tpd enables us to validate for the european market what we’ve said about our products since day oneanother tpd requirement is that each product must include a leaflet with instructions on how to use it safely and correctly again it’s hard to argue with what seems like a commonsense guideline that keeps consumers informedeu countries also require manufacturers to include health warnings that generally cover  percent of each product’s packaging though this requirement has some disputable elements health warnings certainly provide valuable information as nicopure sees it they are an important means of communicating with consumerswhile tpd could be viewed as restrictive and requiring a significant amount of investment from vape manufacturers it is far less onerous than the deeming rule the fda has implemented in our own country the united states of america we remain eager to work with the various governments and regulatory bodies of the eu to make tpd’s implementation as smooth and beneficial to our customers as possibleclick
