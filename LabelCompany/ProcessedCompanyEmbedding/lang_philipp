massdevicethe medical device business journal — medical device news  articles  massdevice home » massdevice qa philipp langmassdevice qa philipp lang august   by brad perriello leave a comment philipp lang wears a lot of hats besides being the founder president chairman and ceo of conformis inc he’s a radiologist and former director of the musculoskeletal radiology and distinguished weissman chair at brigham and women’s hospital in boston and associate professor at harvard medical school but conformis and its breakthrough custom knee implant technology aren’t lang’s first forays into the startup medical device world he also founded imaging therapeutics inc where he remains chairman and served on the board at vioptix inc lang started his latest venture in  initially serving as chairman before taking the helm as ceo he’s got more than  pending and issued patents under his belt and an mba from the ucla anderson school of management lang told massdevice about the genesis of conformis why its technology is a radical departure from standard orthopedic implant technology how the company plans to expand the platform beyond knees to other large joints and how it managed to raise  million in a series d round in the worst investment climate in recent memory massdevice was there a moment when a light bulb went off and you said to yourself “there’s a better way to do knee implants” philipp lang i’m a radiologist by training i’ve spent the last  years or so in imaging primarily with musculoskeletal disorders with that background i’m intimately familiar with some of the fundamental challenges of current implant systems that’s basically how conformis was born it’s clinical background married with business background the key issue with today’s standard devices is that they come off the shelf they come typically in six or seven different sizes and they have to fit any patient irrespective of their body build — if they’re tall or small if they’re large or petite when they’re premanufactured you have to fit the patient to the implant meaning you have to cut away a lot of tissue primarily bone in order to fit the patient with the implant we’ve taken a fundamentally different approach we take a ct scan or an mri scan and we use the data to build a virtual model of that patient a d model of that patient from that model we make a patientspecific implant that simply resurfaces the bone preserving most of the bone structure and avoiding the really invasive nature of the traditional devices the initial concept was tissue preservation and less invasive surgery and what we’ve seen since from the perspective of clinical benefit are multiple benefits the potential for faster recovery for the patients faster or time et cetera it was really driven by the issues that we saw with current devices that sort of drove the “light bulb” looking for a better solution and then there’s a lot of technological innovation it’s not simple and straightforward for example we derive these patientspecific surfaces but then we have a lot of technology around correcting the surface for the presence of any arthritic deformities so if the arthritis is advanced and the joint is deformed as a result we actually correct that and bring that back to a shape that’s essentially representative of what the patient had before they developed arthritis massdevice obviously landing the ce mark approval in europe and the  million series d round are big wins for conformis can you give me a quick overview of the rollout in europe and how you plan to enter the markets there for example via direct sales or distribution pl we started out initially in germany we’re building a direct sales force there and we are now expanding into the uk we’re building a direct force there as well and we’re going into austria and switzerland again with a direct sales force other european countries will follow later and there it really depends on the situation we may work with some local distributors we may also place direct salespeople massdevice it’s a notoriously difficult climate for fundraising how did you manage to land such a large investment given the climate what are your insights as to the landscape these days — are things easing up pl it’s fair to say this really wasn’t the best environment for any company to be raising funds in particular during the second half of last year you could really see how the liquidity was stalling in the market but the bottom line is the fundamentals didn’t change for us and investors recognized that healthcare per se is good business with very stable and solid growth within healthcare arthritis is one of the biggest markets a true multibilliondollar market and companies who have entered this market with a wellprotected and disruptive technology have traditionally done very well and so recognizing that we were able to attract a number of different investor groups a lot was obviously driven by the fact that the company had made tremendous progress doing very well in the market and operating with this truly disruptive technology heavily patentprotected in a very large multibillion healthcare market if you look at orthopedics orthopedics is somewhere about  billion total and knee implants is about  billion total annually and i have to emphasize that we aren’t just a knee company we have technology outside the knee that’s going to follow in subsequent years massdevice how do you plan to use the  million from the d round — new product development building the eu sales channels pl it’s basically three major categories the first one is the buildout of our commercial presence we’re expanding our us sales force we’re building a direct sales force in the us in select territories we also have some very good distributors but we’re making a significant investment in a direct sales force the second aspect is we’re building out our manufacturing platform matching the growth we’re seeing in sales and lastly continued product development and product enhancements in  we’re going to see the market introduction of our itotal system a total knee resurfacing system we also have technology related to shoulder to hip to spine and we’re planning to introduce all of those other areas massdevice how do you go about identifying unmet needs and developing products to meet them pl in terms of large joints knee is the biggest segment i believe it’s actually a little bigger than spine hip is the secondlargest segment so very attractive and shoulder is a small segment today but very highgrowth in fact from a growth perspective it’s the highest growth of all the short answer is these are all very significant markets and we have a significant opportunity because we’re coming in with a technology that is so different we’ve pretty much covered all the joints and the clinical applications that’s really the plan here to build out this pipeline it’s truly platform technology and the plan is really to build this out there’s another benefit that we sort of learned later in the game if you think for a moment about justintime manufacturing in the s pcs were generally sitting in a warehouse and you ordered one of those dell came up with this concept of “order your custom laptop or your custom pc and we’ll ship it in three weeks” in a sense we’re doing exactly this kind of model in manufacturing orthopedics we’re doing it with the implants but the other aspect here is that we have novel technology where we replace traditional instrumentation traditional orthopedic implants are implanted using  to  pieces of instrumentation these metal instruments are very expensive — they cost between  and  they’re multiuse but the manufacturers have to provide them typically for free to the hospitals and the hospitals have to store them and autoclave them so one set of instruments is with the patient in surgery and the other set is outside being cleaned after the last surgery it’s a huge inventory in the hospital we have replaced this with highly accurate highly reproducible disposable instruments that are also patientspecific everything is shipped literally in a fedex box directly to the hospital you place the box on the or table everything is sterile inside the setup is much quicker than with traditional instrumentation and the hospitals don’t have to manage the inventory anymore they don’t have to do the sterilization anymore it’s much easier to handle for the hospitals in case you missed it biogen lifts outlook after strong q lilly tops q earnings revenue estimates vertera spine wins k
