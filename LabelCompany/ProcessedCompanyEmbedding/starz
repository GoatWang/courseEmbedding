woman and the crying game the network was originally operated as a joint venture between tci and liberty media both companies were controlled by john malone with tci owning a  controlling interest in the channel starz made its debut as the first phase of a sevenchannel thematic multiplex that was launched by starz then encore media group over the course of the succeeding eight months with the remaining six channels being launched between july and september  the multiplex was intended to only include six channels however on may   encore acquired the pay cable rights to telecast recent feature films from universal pictures released after that year as a result tciliberty decided to create an additional premium pay tv service to serve as a competitor to hbo and showtime the network carried the moniker encore  in its onair branding as part of a numbering system that was used by encores multiplex channels early trademark filings indicated that tciliberty originally proposed names including applause and stars for the service the s in the latter was ultimately changed to a z in the final naming starz focused more on recent feature films while starz encore then encore focused on films released between the s and the s before adding recent film fare itself in july  it also held the television rights to releases from carolco pictures fine line features and its sibling studio new line cinema and the walt disney company–owned studios touchstone pictures hollywood pictures and miramax films from those studios were not carried on starz until  after disneys output agreement with showtime for its nonfamilyoriented films concluded the network restricted the scheduling of films that contained graphic sexual or violent content to late evening and overnight time periods starzs availability was mainly limited to tcis systems at launch debuting with a onemonth free preview available to prospective subscribers it would eventually sign its first major carriage agreement outside of the tci group through a deal with continental cablevision in september  in june  comcast signed an agreement to carry the network on its pennsylvania and new jersey systems to replace philadelphiabased prism after that network shut down that october following the loss of its and sister network sportschannel philadelphias sports programming to comcast sportsnet philadelphia the network gained carriage deals with many other major us cable and satellite providers by the early s particularly with the adoption of digital cable allowing for providers to add channels that they even with capacity expansions of up to  channels previously had limited room to carry starz was available to an estimated  million pay television subscribers by  only one million of whom had subscribed to a cable or satellite provider other than tci as a startup network starz endured major losses during its early years with total deficits topping us million and annual losses of us million by  it was predicted to lose an additional us million in revenue before it was predicted to break even partly in an effort to get the networks substantial losses off its books tci announced a deal on june   in which it transferred majority ownership of the corporate entity that operated starz encore media group to sister company liberty media tci retained a  minority ownership interest in encore media group liberty media assumed the former companys stake in the subsidiary in  following tcis merger with att corporation starz logo used from april   to april   by may  starz maintained a subscriber base reaching  million households with a cable or satellite television subscription encore media group was later renamed the starz encore media group in  as part of a corporate restructuring plan in  starz encore group eliminated  jobs in its nine regional offices and closed four of the offices outright on march   the starz encore group corporate entity was renamed starz

definition – as well as a subscription videoondemand service starz on demand starz broadcasts its primary and multiplex channels on eastern and pacific time zone schedules the respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together though most cable providers only offer the east and west coast feeds of the main starz channel resulting in the difference in local airtimes for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most the premium film services encore and movieplex which are also owned by starz inc operate as separate services as such subscribers to one of the services do not have to subscribe to any of the others some providers offer encore and movieplexs multiplex channels on a separate digital cable tier from starz however

slightly modified logo and applied the encore brand to the names of its six multiplex channels starz underwent a more dramatic makeover with a completely redesigned logo – which included the exclamation mark being dropped from the channels name – and a standardized graphics package that was implemented across all of its channels with some modifications for each channels format the programming formats of several channels changed entirely starz theater was relaunched as starz edge a movie channel aimed primarily at men  to  years old nicknamed the new generation by the channel

structured similarly to the original format of sister channel encores movieplex in which sharper movies would broadcast programming from each starz channel in daily sampler blocks were also planned

the former incarnation of the starzplay online service which is structured as a tv everywherestyle service was launched on october   with the release of the ipad iphone and ipod touch app until they were merged with starzcom on april   the starzplay name was borrowed from a prior service offered in conjunction with netflix it was created in  after the subscription streaming service struck an agreement with starz entertainment to allow netflix to sublicense rights to films from distributors that maintain output deals with the linear starz channel for online viewing – in lieu of acquiring the digital distribution rights on its own due to the expense of acquiring newer film titles – as netflix is considered to be merely a content aggregator because netflix chose to sublicense digital rights through starz instead of negotiating with the studios walt disney studios motion pictures threatened not to renew its output deal with starz unless it either discontinued its deal with netflix or paid disney a licensing fee for digital streaming rights to its films netflix ended up assuming rights to most film releases by walt disney studios from starz in  starzplay as a netflix service was

other studios that maintain pay television distribution deals with starz were not affected and can be acquired from netflix by this method with the expiration of the netflix deal film content from studios with which starz maintains broadcast rights were no longer available for online streaming particularly as netflix and certain similar services such as vudu did not have separate streaming rights to films from these individual studios prior to the beta launch of its starz online service which became starzplay upon its official launch starz announced on november   that it was developing a streaming application for mobile devices allowing the networks subscribers – and in early reports speculation that possibly nonsubscription television subscribers would be allowed as well – to view starzs series and film content the app was released on october   for the ipad iphone and ipod touch and on may   for android devices an app for the xbox  was released on december   followed by an app for the xbox one on august   both are available for no extra charge to xbox live gold members starzplay is the first starzbranded service to be localized outside the united states more precisely

the app whether they had a tv package or not both hbo now and showtime required a different app from hbo go and showtime anytime to use the app also allowed offline playback that let users download content to watch without an internet connection however comcast was the only cable provider not to allow its subscribers to use the new app while it is unclear why comcast did this one reason could be that comcast didnt like the fact that starz had the subscription service in the same app as the paytv authentication service starz on amazon videoedit in the winter of  amazon video began offering

since its launch in the original logo that was used from its launch in february  until march  the star was composed of a two silhouettes one star being embedded within a larger one and a starz logotype styled after sera movie poster typography the original accompanying graphics were set around a cgi movie theater with the main network id featuring seats that opened by themselves various theater imagery and even images resembling the caduceus while feature presentation bumpers also heavily used the movie theater themes using spotlights and film canisters and the encore  branding the theater look that had been used since the networks launch was ultimately abandoned in may  when it switched to a package based around natural themes particularly water a sevennote fanfare was also introduced as a musical motif the new look did not carry over to the multiplex channels starz also introduced the infobar a lowerthird banner graphic that appears onscreen during promotional breaks and during the end credits of films seen on the channel originally purposed to promote upcoming programs this logo was abandoned for an abstract star shooting upwards and a helvetica neue wordmark in

lowerright corner of the screen for two minutes each halfhour though the  logo bug for starz channels appears for the rest of the movies run in summer  along with encore and movieplex channels until starz reverted them back to  minutes for their logo bug during the april  rebrand except for encore movieplex and starz cinema the addition of the onscreen logos was cited by former starz president tom southwick due to a large number of subscribers not knowing which of the channels they were watching when they tuned in particularly if started viewing one of the channels after the start of a film the current logo was introduced in april  with lowercase starz typing featuring a asteroidshaped star inserted between the a and r the coloring of the logo was modified to an orangegold rendering in

after the  logo rebrand the bright white version of the  logo for starz channels stayed on screen for the second time until september  that it will reverted to twominute version along with encore

reporter gdanielholloway share this article linkedin email print talk march    am pt starz is getting an image makeover beginning april  the premium cable network will have a new logo and a new tagline—“starz obsessable” sibling cabler encore is also being drawn under the starz brand umbrella with a new name and programming strategy the primary encorebranded channel will be rechristened starz encore and will carry previous seasons of starz’s original series alongside the network’s library of classic films encore’s multiplex channels — including encore action encore family and encore western — will be similarly rebranded with the starz name the combined starz service will now include  channels the move comes as starz continues to build its subscriber base on the back of an original programming strategy aimed at underserved audiences such as women and africanamericans starz has nosed past showtime as the no  pay cabler in subscribers with  million although showtime has added an undisclosed number of digitalonly subscribers during the past year and like hbo and showtime starz has begun to shift toward a strategy meant to court digital viewers part of the strategy is a forthcoming streaming app the expedited timeline for the rebranding process which took seven months from conception to launch was in part built to get the branding out ahead of the app’s rollout the design developed with the marketing firm troika is meant to evoke the user experience of digital streaming services “i liken it to taking the house down to the studs and rebuilding it” said jeffrey hirsch starz global maketing and product planning president “every aspect of the house when you move in has to be done so all of that stuff is on that same timeline” hirsch initiated the rebranding project shortly after being brought in by starz ceo chris albrecht from time warner cable in july the encore component in particular was designed to help cable operators better promote starz’s suite of channels to customers although it is less watched than starz encore boasts roughly  million more subscriber households than its sibling as it is typically sold on a lower tier of movie networks the company is betting that rebroadcasting reruns of its originals will motivate some of those  million to subscribe to starz evidence suggests they might nielsen found that during a january trial more than  households not subscribed to starz tuned in to reruns of “black sails” on encore and that  of those households went on to subscribe to starz and watch season  “premium is really sold at the distributor level” hirsch said “they do the heavy lifting promoting the channels right down to the call center level where the sellin happens” the new starz branding will debut just four days before the second season of one of the network’s most popular shows “outlander” it was the fan engagement for “outlander” and other originals that inspired the “obsessable” tagline’s creation “we just kept seeing on social ‘i’m obsessed’ whether it was on the starz pages or on our show pages” said alison hoffman starz executive vice president of marketing “we thought there was something there” with somewhat sparse overlap between the audiences for series such as femaleskewing period piece “outlander” the gritty urban drama “power” and fanboyfriendly horrorcomedy “ash vs evil dead” starz latched onto the notion of fandom as a unifying theme for its marketing strategy as the company heads toward its next evolutionary phase “when you married the programming strategy to what we were seeing in the reaction it kind of fell into place” hirsch said filed under encorestarz want to read more articles like this one subscribe to variety today post a comment  biz trump fires reince priebus

service to serve as a competitor to hbo and showtime the network carried the moniker encore  in its onair branding as part of a numbering system that was used by encores multiplex channels early trademark filings indicated that tciliberty originally proposed names including applause and stars for the service the s in the latter was ultimately changed to a z in the final naming starz focused more on recent feature films while starz encore then encore focused on films released between the s and the s before adding recent film fare itself in july  it also held the television rights to

services while encore debuted a slightly modified logo and applied the encore brand to the names of its six multiplex channels starz underwent a more dramatic makeover with a completely redesigned logo – which included the exclamation mark being dropped from the channels name – and a standardized graphics package that was implemented across all of its channels with some modifications for each channels format the programming formats of several channels changed entirely starz theater was relaunched as starz edge a movie channel aimed primarily at men  to  years old nicknamed the new

of starz that broadcasts in the i resolution format in addition to its main channel starz also operates high definition simulcast feeds of its five multiplex channels when it was launched in december  the simulcast covered only the east and west coast feeds of the main starz channel an enhanced definition simulcast feed and a separate hd channel called sharper movies hd that would have broadcast in the i format and be structured similarly to the original format of sister channel encores movieplex in which sharper movies would broadcast programming from each starz channel in daily sampler blocks were also planned plans for the latter service were dropped because of a lack of interest from providers to charge a premium fee for the network hd feeds of starz kids and family starz comedy and

iphone and ipod touch app until they were merged with starzcom on april   the starzplay name was borrowed from a prior service offered in conjunction with netflix it was created in  after the subscription streaming service struck an agreement with starz entertainment to allow netflix to sublicense rights to films from distributors that maintain output deals with the linear starz channel for online viewing – in lieu of acquiring the digital distribution rights on its own due to the expense of acquiring newer film titles – as netflix is considered to be merely a content aggregator because netflix chose to sublicense digital rights through starz instead of negotiating with the studios walt disney studios motion pictures threatened not to renew its output deal with starz unless it either discontinued its deal with netflix or paid disney a licensing fee for digital streaming rights to its films netflix ended up assuming rights to most film releases by walt disney studios from starz in  starzplay as a netflix service was first made available to starz subscribers of the verizon fios television service starz content including most of its original programming and series

the expiration of the netflix deal film content from studios with which starz maintains broadcast rights were no longer available for online streaming particularly as netflix and certain similar services such as vudu did not have separate streaming rights to films from these individual studios prior to the beta launch of its starz online service which became starzplay upon its official launch starz announced on november   that it was developing a streaming application for mobile devices allowing the networks subscribers – and in early reports speculation that possibly nonsubscription television subscribers would be allowed as well – to view starzs series and film content the app was released on october   for the ipad iphone and ipod touch and on may   for android devices an app for the xbox  was released on december   followed by an app for the xbox one on august   both are available for no extra charge to xbox live gold members starzplay is the first starzbranded service to

the aforementioned starzplay service allowed users to use the app whether they had a tv package or not both hbo now and showtime required a different app from hbo go and showtime anytime to use the app also allowed offline playback that let users download content to watch without an internet connection however comcast was the only cable provider not to allow its subscribers to use the new app while it is unclear why comcast did this one reason could be that comcast didnt like the fact that starz had the subscription service in the same app as the paytv authentication service starz on

entertainment brandingedit starzs logo has incorporated a star in some form since its launch in the original logo that was used from its launch in february  until march  the star was composed of a two silhouettes one star being embedded within a larger one and a starz logotype styled after sera movie poster typography the original accompanying graphics were set around a cgi movie theater with the main network id featuring seats that opened by themselves various theater imagery and even images resembling the caduceus while feature presentation bumpers also heavily used the movie theater themes using spotlights and film canisters and the encore  branding the theater look that had been used since the networks launch was ultimately abandoned in may  when it switched to a package based around natural themes particularly water a sevennote fanfare was also introduced as a musical motif the new look did not carry over to the multiplex channels starz also introduced the infobar a lowerthird banner graphic that appears onscreen during promotional breaks and during the end credits of films seen on the channel originally purposed to promote upcoming programs this logo was abandoned for an abstract star shooting upwards and a helvetica neue wordmark in march  as part of a major rebrand of the network that included a blue colored gel standardized graphics package with modifications different colors such as grey red green purple and orange for each multiplex channel the fanfare from the previous graphics package was also reorchestrated the infobar also began to be used to promote events on the other starz networks and to provide entertainment news headlines supplied by variety a similar version was adopted for use by the encore networks that year starz began branding its feature film content with an opaque logo bug appearing on the lowerright corner of the screen for two minutes each halfhour though the  logo bug for starz channels appears for the rest of the movies run in summer  along with encore and movieplex channels until starz reverted them back to  minutes for their logo bug during the april  rebrand except for encore movieplex and starz cinema the addition of the onscreen logos was cited by former starz president tom southwick due to a large number of subscribers not knowing which of the channels they were watching when they tuned in particularly if started viewing one of the channels after the start of a film the current logo was introduced in april  with lowercase starz typing featuring a asteroidshaped star inserted between the a and r the coloring of the logo was modified to an orangegold rendering in april  the channel replaced the opaque onscreen logos with a bright white logo bug on all channels and a bright orange bug for starz hd as of april   and starz kids  familys hd simulcast feed in july  after the  logo rebrand the bright white version of the  logo for starz channels stayed on screen for the second time until september  that it will reverted to twominute version along with encore channels after the current logos introduction the infobar began to once again serve only to promote programming on the main starz channel while it serves mainly as a network id on some of its multiplex channels in  starz redesigned its logo again the current logo is the word starz in bold white capital letters against a black background network slogansedit only on starz and no other movie channel – starz – big movies and more –  movies – movies movies new hit movies –  in new hit movies – an influx of movies – only

showtime anytime to use the app also allowed offline playback that let users download content to watch without an internet connection however comcast was the only cable provider not to allow its

entertainment brandingedit starzs logo has incorporated a star in some form since its launch in the original logo that was used from its launch in february  until march  the star was composed of a two silhouettes one star being embedded within a larger one and a starz logotype styled after sera movie poster typography the original accompanying graphics were set around a cgi movie theater with the main network id featuring seats that opened by themselves various theater imagery and even images resembling the caduceus while feature presentation bumpers also heavily used the movie theater themes using spotlights and film canisters and the encore  branding the theater look that had been used since the networks launch was ultimately abandoned in may  when it switched to a package based around natural themes particularly water a sevennote fanfare was also introduced as a musical motif the new look did not carry over to the multiplex channels starz also introduced the infobar a lowerthird banner graphic that appears onscreen during promotional breaks and during the end credits of films seen on the channel originally purposed to promote upcoming programs this logo was abandoned for an abstract star shooting upwards and a helvetica neue wordmark in march  as part of a major rebrand of the network that included a blue colored gel standardized graphics package with modifications different colors such as grey red green purple and orange for each multiplex channel the fanfare from the previous graphics package was also reorchestrated the infobar also began to be used to promote events on the other starz networks and to provide entertainment news headlines supplied by variety a similar version was adopted for use by the encore networks that year starz began branding its feature film content with an opaque logo bug appearing on the lowerright corner of the screen for two minutes each halfhour though the  logo bug for starz channels appears for the rest of the movies run in summer  along with encore and movieplex channels until starz reverted them back to  minutes for their logo bug during the april  rebrand except for encore movieplex and starz cinema the addition of the onscreen logos was cited by former starz president tom southwick due to a large number of subscribers not knowing which of the channels they were watching when they tuned in particularly if started viewing one of the channels after the start of a film the current logo was introduced in april  with lowercase starz typing featuring a asteroidshaped star inserted between the a and r the coloring of the logo was modified to an orangegold rendering in april  the channel replaced the opaque onscreen logos with a bright white logo bug on all channels and a bright orange bug for starz hd as of april   and starz kids  familys hd simulcast feed in july  after the  logo rebrand the bright white version of the  logo for starz channels stayed on screen for the second time

sevenchannel thematic multiplex that was launched by starz then encore media group over the course of the succeeding eight months with the remaining six channels being launched between july and september  the multiplex was intended to only include six channels however on may   encore acquired the pay cable rights to telecast recent feature films from universal pictures released after that year as a result tciliberty decided to create an additional premium pay tv service to serve as a competitor to hbo and showtime the network carried the moniker encore  in its onair branding as part of a numbering system that was used by encores multiplex channels early trademark filings indicated that tciliberty originally proposed names including applause and stars for the service the s in the latter was ultimately changed to a z in the final naming starz focused more on recent feature films while starz encore then encore focused on films released between the s and the s before adding recent film fare itself in july  it also held the television rights to releases from carolco pictures fine line features and its sibling studio new line cinema and the walt disney company–owned studios touchstone pictures hollywood pictures and miramax films from those studios were not carried on starz until  after disneys output agreement with showtime for its nonfamilyoriented films

down that october following the loss of its and sister network sportschannel philadelphias sports programming to comcast sportsnet philadelphia the network gained carriage deals with many other major

revenue before it was predicted to break even partly in an effort to get the networks substantial losses off its books tci announced a deal on june   in which it transferred majority ownership of the corporate entity that operated starz encore media group to sister company liberty media tci retained a  minority ownership interest in encore media group liberty media assumed the former companys stake in the subsidiary in  following tcis merger with att corporation starz logo used from april   to april   by may  starz maintained a subscriber base reaching  million households with a cable or

starz hdedit starz hd is a high definition simulcast feed of starz that broadcasts in the i resolution format in addition to its main channel starz also operates high definition simulcast feeds of its five multiplex channels when it was launched in december  the simulcast covered only the east and west coast feeds of the main starz channel an enhanced definition simulcast feed and a separate hd channel called sharper movies hd that would have broadcast in the i format and be structured similarly to the original format of sister channel encores movieplex in which sharper movies would broadcast programming from each starz channel in daily sampler blocks were also planned plans for the latter service were dropped because of a lack of interest from providers to charge a premium fee

service was launched on october   with the release of the ipad iphone and ipod touch app until they were merged with starzcom on april   the starzplay name was borrowed from a prior service offered in conjunction with netflix it was created in  after the subscription streaming service struck an agreement with starz entertainment to allow netflix to sublicense rights to films from distributors that maintain output deals with the linear starz channel for online viewing – in lieu of acquiring the digital distribution rights on its own due to the expense of acquiring newer film titles – as netflix is considered to be merely a content aggregator because netflix chose to sublicense digital rights through starz instead of negotiating with the studios walt disney studios motion pictures threatened not to renew its output deal with starz unless it either discontinued its deal with netflix or paid disney a licensing fee for digital streaming rights to its films netflix ended up assuming rights to most film releases by walt disney studios from starz in  starzplay as a netflix service was first made available to starz subscribers of the verizon fios television service starz content including

netflix and certain similar services such as vudu did not have separate streaming rights to films from these individual studios prior to the beta launch of its starz online service which became starzplay upon its official launch starz announced on november   that it was developing a streaming application for mobile devices allowing the networks subscribers – and in early reports speculation that possibly nonsubscription television subscribers would be allowed as well – to view starzs series and film content the app was released on october   for the ipad iphone and ipod touch and on may   for android devices an app for the xbox  was released on december   followed by an app for the xbox one on august   both are available for no extra charge to xbox live gold members starzplay is the

app and service which replaced the aforementioned starzplay service allowed users to use the app whether they had a tv package or not both hbo now and showtime required a different app from hbo go and showtime anytime to use the app also allowed offline playback that let users download content to watch without an internet connection however comcast was the only cable provider not to allow its subscribers to use the new app while it is unclear why comcast did this one reason could be that comcast didnt like the fact that starz had the subscription service in the same app as the paytv

entertainment brandingedit starzs logo has incorporated a star in some form since its launch in the original logo that was used from its launch in february  until march  the star was composed of a two silhouettes one star being embedded within a larger one and a starz logotype styled after sera movie poster typography the original accompanying graphics were set around a cgi movie theater with the main network id featuring seats that opened by themselves various theater imagery and even images resembling the caduceus while feature presentation bumpers also heavily used the movie theater themes using spotlights and film canisters and the encore  branding the theater look that had been used since the networks launch was ultimately abandoned in may  when it switched to a package based around natural themes particularly water a sevennote fanfare was also introduced as a musical motif the new look did not carry over to the multiplex channels starz also introduced the infobar a lowerthird banner graphic that appears onscreen during promotional breaks and during the end credits of films seen on the channel originally purposed to promote upcoming programs this logo was abandoned for an abstract star shooting upwards and a helvetica neue wordmark in march  as part of a major rebrand of the network that included a blue colored gel standardized graphics package with modifications different colors such as grey red green purple and orange for each multiplex channel the fanfare from the previous graphics package was also reorchestrated the infobar also began to be used to promote events on the other starz networks and to provide entertainment news headlines supplied by variety a similar version was adopted for use by the encore networks that year starz began branding its feature film content with an opaque logo bug appearing on the lowerright corner of the screen for two minutes each halfhour though the  logo bug for starz channels appears for the rest of the movies run in summer  along with encore and movieplex channels until starz reverted them back to  minutes for their logo bug during the april  rebrand except for encore movieplex and starz cinema the addition of the onscreen logos was cited by former starz president tom southwick due to a large number of subscribers not knowing which of the channels they were watching when they tuned in particularly if started viewing one of the channels after the start of a film the current logo was introduced in april  with lowercase starz typing featuring a asteroidshaped star inserted between the a and r the coloring of the logo was modified to an orangegold rendering in april  the channel replaced the opaque onscreen logos with a bright white logo bug on all channels and a bright orange bug for starz hd as of april   and starz kids  familys hd simulcast feed in july  after the  logo rebrand the bright white version of the  logo for starz channels stayed on screen for the second time until september  that it will reverted to twominute version along with encore channels after the current logos introduction the infobar began to once again serve only to promote programming on the main starz channel while it serves mainly as a network id on some of its multiplex channels in  starz redesigned its logo again the current logo is the word starz in bold white capital letters against a black background network slogansedit only on starz and no other movie channel – starz – big movies and more –  movies – movies movies new hit movies –  in new hit movies – an influx of movies – only

showtime anytime to use the app also allowed offline playback that let users download content to watch without an internet connection however comcast was the only cable provider not to allow its subscribers to use the new app while it is unclear why comcast did this one reason could be that comcast didnt like the fact that starz had the subscription service in the same app as the paytv

entertainment brandingedit starzs logo has incorporated a star in some form since its launch in the original logo that was used from its launch in february  until march  the star was composed of a two silhouettes one star being embedded within a larger one and a starz logotype styled after sera movie poster typography the original accompanying graphics were set around a cgi movie theater with the main network id featuring seats that opened by themselves various theater imagery and even images resembling the caduceus while feature presentation bumpers also heavily used the movie theater themes using spotlights and film canisters and the encore  branding the theater look that had been used since the networks launch was ultimately abandoned in may  when it switched to a package based around natural themes particularly water a sevennote fanfare was also introduced as a musical motif the new look did not carry over to the multiplex channels starz also introduced the infobar a lowerthird banner graphic that appears onscreen during promotional breaks and during the end credits of films seen on the channel originally purposed to promote upcoming programs this logo was abandoned for an abstract star shooting upwards and a helvetica neue wordmark in march  as part of a major rebrand of the network that included a blue colored gel standardized graphics package with modifications different colors such as grey red green purple and orange for each multiplex channel the fanfare from the previous graphics package was also reorchestrated the infobar also began to be used to promote events on the other starz networks and to provide entertainment news headlines supplied by variety a similar version was adopted for use by the encore networks that year starz began branding its feature film content with an opaque logo bug appearing on the lowerright corner of the screen for two minutes each halfhour though the  logo bug for starz channels appears for the rest of the movies run in summer  along with encore and movieplex channels until starz reverted them back to  minutes for their logo bug during the april  rebrand except for encore movieplex and starz cinema the addition of the onscreen logos was cited by former starz president tom southwick due to a large number of subscribers not knowing which of the channels they were watching when they tuned in particularly if started viewing one of the channels after the start of a film the current logo was introduced in april  with lowercase starz typing featuring a asteroidshaped star inserted between the a and r the coloring of the logo was modified to an orangegold rendering in april  the channel replaced the opaque onscreen logos with a bright white logo bug on all channels and a bright orange bug for starz hd as of april   and starz kids  familys hd simulcast feed in july  after the  logo rebrand the bright white version of the  logo for starz channels stayed on screen for the second time until september  that it will reverted to twominute version along with encore channels after the current logos introduction the infobar began to once again serve only to promote programming on the
