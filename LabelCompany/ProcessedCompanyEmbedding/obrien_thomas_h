obrien retiring rohr to lead pnc obrien retiring rohr to lead pnc friday february  by patricia sabatini postgazette staff writer pnc bank corp announced the end of an era yesterday saying long time chief executive officer thomas h obrien would step down as ceo may  and as chairman a year later he will be succeeded by long time confidant james rohr who has been pncs president since      james rohr left will succeed thomas h obrien as chief executive of pnc bank corp darrell sapp postgazette the selection of rohr confirmed by the board yesterday was expected rohr  has been obriens top lieutenant for the last decade and the two have worked together for nearly  years obrien has made it no secret that the congenial cleveland native and fellow notre dame graduate was his intended heir the timing of obriens departure was a bit of a surprise however the yearold penn hills native who has been running the company since  had suggested in an extensive interview with the postgazette last summer that he would stick around until pncs mandatory retirement age of  yesterday obrien said the time was right he said he actually had wanted to retire a year earlier but didnt feel the companys transition from a regional bank to a diversified financial services firm was far enough along today the company is doing remarkably well he said at an afternoon news conference at one pnc plaza downtown im great the bank is great and its a perfect time to turn over the reins to an extremely talented group of people including rohr and vice chairman walter gregg rohr said yesterday not to expect any big changes under his stewardship well be executing the plan that weve put in place he said the same management team is in place and its working he said one of the biggest challenges he faces is ensuring that pnc harnesses the power of the internet ecommerce is probably the biggest change any of us has seen in the last  or  years maybe in the century its important that we keep pace and actually move ahead of the competition that will be a big challenge for us although the banking industry has been undergoing rapid consolidation rohr said pnc was very committed to remaining independent were very optimistic about that thats clearly the strategy we have committed to rohr known for his disarming sense of humor and aggressiveness has been with pnc his entire career joining the bank in  as a management trainee after making a name for himself in the corporate lending arena he was elected a vice chairman of the corporation in  and chairman and ceo of the banks pittsburgh operations in  he was named president of the corporation and heir apparent in  and named chief operating officer in  obrien currently the citys longestserving corporate chieftain has been with pnc since joining the corporate lending division in  he took over as chairman and ceo of the pittsburgh region in  and was named president and ceo of the corporation in april  he stepped in as chairman in june  pnc has grown dramatically under his tenure assets have more than quadrupled from roughly  billion to about  billion vaulting the bank from the th largest in the nation to th profits which hovered at around  million when he took over have topped  billion in each of the last three years and are higher than at any other major corporation in pittsburgh there also have been some major stumbles under his watch most notably sour commercial real estate loans in the early s resulted in pncs first quarterly loss since it was formed through the  merger of pittsburgh national bank and philadelphias provident national and bad bets on the direction of interest rates slashed profits in  still by most accounts obrien leaves pittsburghs largest banking company in its best shape in years having posted record profits in each of the last four years wall street greeted news of the changing of the guard in stride pncs stock closed at  down  cents rohr is the logical choice for the job said veteran banking analyst james schutz of stephens inc in chicago his experience is right he knows the people at the bank and has signed onto the plan that i think wall street likes after he steps down as chairman next year obrien said he plans to continue serving on several other corporate boards and to stay active in the community i have a lot to do frankly and i want to play a continuing
