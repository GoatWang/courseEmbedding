business executives have suggested that high levels of uncertainty have been a key reason for the economys sluggish performance during the current business expansion if the business and financial community believes the nearterm outlook is murkier than usual then the pace of hiring and outlays for capital spending projects may be unnecessarily constrained thereby slowing the overall pace of economic activity monetary policymakers are also not immune to the challenges posed by rising levels of economic uncertainty this has been noted in the minutes of several recent meetings of the federal open market committee fomc typical is an example from the minutes of the september  fomc meeting many fomc participants also noted that a high level of uncertainty regarding the european fiscal and banking crisis and the outlook for us fiscal and regulatory policies was weighing on confidence thereby restraining household and business spending this article will discuss the concept of economic uncertainty how some economists measure it and how rising uncertainty can slow the growth of economic activity defining uncertainty some basic economics uncertainty and its effects on commerce business decisionmaking are often studied in the context of decisions to expand—chiefly through increased hiring and additions to the capital stock fixed investment these decisions naturally affect the firms profits the link between uncertainty and profit was further refined by introducing the concept of risk to many lay people risk and uncertainty appear to be the same thing but to economists there is a subtle distinction the difference between risk and uncertainty was discussed nearly  years ago by the economist frank knight according to knight there is a fundamental distinction between the reward for taking a known risk and that for assuming a risk whose value itself is not known it is so fundamental indeed that … a known risk will not lead to any reward or special payment at all what knight meant is that the unfavorable outcome of a known risk can be insured against during the decisionmaking process because it has a welldefined distribution of expected probabilities life insurance companies for example have a reasonably accurate estimate of how many policies will pay off in a given year because of mortality statistics however an unknown risk does not have a known distribution of expected probabilities for example should a firm devote its scarce resources to plan against a computer virus that shuts down a key part of the nations electrical grid even if it has no idea what the probability is for such an event knights characterization of unknown risk has subsequently been termed knightian uncertainty by economists how uncertainty affects the economy one of the first attempts to rigorously model the effects of uncertainty on business investment was published by ben bernanke in  the current federal reserve chairman was then a stanford university professor in his analysis bernanke noted that macrolevel factors—such as unexpected changes in oil prices changes in monetary and fiscal policies or the advent of new technologies with widespread applications—are important at the micro level that is a firms decision to invest this decision takes on increased importance for longlived investment projects that are economically costly to reverse thus as new information arrives the business or bank or investor may find that the odds of making a better moreinformed decision increase by waiting for additional information in other words the firm finds that there is an option value for waiting to invest this option value will become more or less valuable to the firm depending on the level of uncertainty it perceives in the economy increased uncertainty arising from macrolevel factors then can become an important factor for business investment and thus for the economy according to bernanke when the option value is large investors are willing to sacrifice current returns in order to receive more information the bad news principle is hard at work here high uncertainty and the possibility that new information will change project rankings depress current investment measuring economic uncertainty discussions about the pervasiveness of uncertainty—whatever its source and persistence—and thus its effects on the economy quickly lead to a followup question how do economists—or business executives and bankers—measure uncertainty one measure might be the amount of cash that firms hold on their balance sheets firms hold cash and cash equivalents for many reasons one is to finance investment however investment is also financed via equity issuance or via loans from financial institutions reflecting the aforementioned option value of waiting a firm may accumulate cash instead of financing investment if it deems the macroeconomic environment too uncertain to determine the investments rate of return figure  shows that cash and cashequivalent assets on the balance sheet of nonfinancial corporate businesses totaled a bit less than  trillion as of dec   while an alltime high in nominal terms this amounted to only a little more than  percent of total financial assets still its share at the end of  was the largest in a little more than  years figure  cash and other liquid assets on corporate balance sheets click to enlarge note cash is checking deposits and currency other liquid assets are time and savings deposits holdings of nonfarm nonfinancial corporations data through q source flow of funds federal reserve figure  economic policy uncertainty index click to enlarge source wwwpolicyuncertaintycom and haver analytics last actual observation is march    researchers at the federal reserve bank of st louis recently examined the reasons for the increased accumulation of cash on corporate balance sheets they argued that increased levels of economic uncertainty are one reason for the recent upsurge in hoarding of cash by firms however there are other valid reasons these include increased competition especially in the information technology sector and financing of research and development another reason stems from a relatively high us corporate tax rate on income generated from foreign operations and subsidiaries in measuring uncertainty economists realize that there are several potential sources that restrain firms hiring and investment plans a further complication is that different types of uncertainty will affect some sectors of the economy more than others this is particularly true in the realm of economic policy for example the pending expiration of an investment tax credit may create more uncertainty for a large capitalintensive manufacturer than for a financial firm or retailer a second measure of economic uncertainty is an index designed to measure economic policy uncertainty figure  plots the economic policy uncertainty index which is the product of work by stanford university economists scott baker and nicholas bloom and by university of chicago economist steven davis the bakerbloomdavis bbd measure of economic uncertainty is comprised of three underlying components i newspaper articles derived from a google news search that contain words like uncertainty economy policy federal reserve and deficit ii the number of provisions in the us tax code set to expire in future years and iii disagreement among economic forecasters index values above  indicate aboveaverage levels of uncertainty while the opposite holds for values below  increases in the economic uncertainty index tend to be associated with declines or slower growth in real gdp and in real business fixed investment this can be inferred from figure  because the bbd measure of economic uncertainty rises sharply immediately before and during recessions and then drifts back to lower levels after the recession ends importantly the index shows that economic policy uncertainty has been at exceptionally high levels during much of this business expansion—levels that normally occur during recessions shaded bar areas in figure  the bbd index seems to accurately portray the anecdotal evidence reported in the financial media and encountered by fomc officials as can be seen in the figure uncertainty has been unusually high for the past few years it is worth noting though that the bbd index is potentially biased suppose that an increasing number of economists policymakers and financial market participants refer to the bbd index and use it as a tool to measure uncertainty or forecast the effects of uncertainty on the economy to the extent that this analysis is reported and picked up in the indexs google citation component the index will run higher but since the bbd index is comprised of other components this bias may be relatively small and inconsequential lowell ricketts of the bank provided research assistance endnotes see knight p  back to
