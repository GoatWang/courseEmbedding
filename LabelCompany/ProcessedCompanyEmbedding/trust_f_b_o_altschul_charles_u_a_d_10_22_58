and along with other key contemporary industrialists such as steel magnate andrew carnegie defined the structure of modern philanthropy the us supreme court ruled in  that standard oil must be dismantled for violation of federal antitrust laws it was broken up into  separate entities that included companies that would become exxonmobil chevron and others some of them still having the largest revenue as individual pieces of the company were worth more than the whole and as shares of these doubled and tripled in value in their early years rockefeller became the countrys first

mysterious but funloving man as big bill and devil bill he was a sworn foe of conventional morality who had opted for a vagabond existence and who returned to his family infrequently throughout his life bill was notorious for shady schemes in between the births of lucy and john bill and his mistresshousekeeper nancy brown had a daughter named clorinda who died young between john and william jrs births bill and nancy had another daughter cornelia eliza a homemaker and a devout baptist struggled to maintain a semblance of stability at home as bill was frequently gone for extended periods she also put up with his philandering and his double life which included bigamy thrifty by nature and necessity she taught her son that willful waste makes woeful want john did his share of the regular household chores and earned extra money raising turkeys selling potatoes and candy and eventually lending small sums of money to neighbors he followed his fathers advice to trade dishes for platters and always get the better part of any deal bill once bragged i cheat my boys every chance i get i want to make em sharp “ from the beginning i was trained to work to save and to give ” — john d rockefeller  when he was a boy his family moved to moravia new york and in  to owego new york where he attended owego academy in  his family moved to strongsville ohio and he attended clevelands central high school the first high school in cleveland and the first free public high school west of the alleghenies then he took a tenweek business course at folsoms commercial college where he studied bookkeeping despite his fathers absences and frequent family moves young john was a wellbehaved serious and studious boy his contemporaries described him as reserved earnest religious methodical and discreet he was an excellent debater and expressed himself precisely he also had a deep love of music and dreamed of it as a possible career prestandard oil career as a bookkeeper rockefeller at age  ca  in september  when rockefeller was sixteen he got his first job as an assistant bookkeeper working for a small produce commission firm called hewitt  tuttle he worked long hours and delighted as he later recalled in all the methods and systems of the office he was particularly adept at calculating transportation costs which served him well later in his career making  cents a day the full salary for his first three months work was  equivalent to  thousand in  dollars as a youth rockefeller reportedly said that his two great ambitions were to make  equivalent to  million in  dollars and to live  years business partnership and civil war service in  rockefeller went into the produce commission business with a partner maurice b clark and they raised   in  dollars in capital rockefeller went steadily ahead in business from there making money each year of his career while his brother frank fought in the civil war rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers he gave money to the union cause as did many rich northerners who avoided combat rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for president abraham lincoln and supported the thennew republican party as he said god gave me money and he did not apologize for it he felt at ease and righteous following methodist preacher john wesleys dictum gain all you can save all you can and give all you can at that time the federal government was subsidizing oil prices driving the price up from  a barrel in  to as high as  this created an oildrilling glut with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes most failed but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient they would blow holes in the ground and gather up the oil as they could often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water in this environment of wasteful boom the partners switched from foodstuffs to oil building an oil refinery in  in the flats then clevelands burgeoning industrial area the refinery was directly owned by andrews clark  company which was composed of clark  rockefeller chemist samuel andrews and m b clarks two brothers the commercial oil business was then in its infancy whale oil had become too expensive for the masses and a cheaper generalpurpose lighting fuel was needed while other refineries would keep the  of oil product that became kerosene but dump the other  in rivers and massive sludge piles rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever using the gasoline to fuel the refinery and selling the rest as lubricating oil petroleum jelly and paraffin wax and other byproducts tar was used for paving naphtha shipped to gas plants likewise rockefellers refineries hired their own plumbers cutting the cost of pipelaying in half barrels that cost  each ended up only  when rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himselfcitation needed in february  in what was later described by oil industry historian daniel yergin as a critical action rockefeller bought out the clark brothers for  equivalent to  million in  dollars at auction and established the firm of rockefeller  andrews rockefeller said it was the day that determined my career he was well positioned to take advantage of postwar prosperity and the great expansion westward fostered by the growth of railroads and an oilfueled economy he borrowed heavily reinvested profits adapted rapidly to changing markets and fielded observers to track the quickly expanding industry beginning in the oil business in  william rockefeller jr johns brother built another refinery in cleveland and brought john into the partnership in  henry m flagler became a partner and the firm of rockefeller andrews  flagler was established by  with rockefeller continuing practices of borrowing and reinvesting profits controlling costs and using refineries waste the company owned two cleveland refineries and a marketing subsidiary in new york it was the largest oil refinery in the world rockefeller andrews  flagler was the predecessor of the standard oil company standard oil main article standard oil founding and early growth john d rockefeller ca  by the end of the american civil war cleveland was one of the five main refining centers in the us besides pittsburgh pennsylvania new york and the region in northwestern pennsylvania where most of the oil originated by  there was three times more kerosene refining capacity than needed to supply the market and the capacity remained in excess for many years on  january  rockefeller abolished the partnership of rockefeller andrews  flagler forming standard oil of ohio continuing to apply his work ethic and efficiency rockefeller quickly expanded the company to be the most profitable refiner in ohio likewise it became one of the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country the railroads competed fiercely for traffic and in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates formed the south improvement company offering special deals to bulk customers like standard oil outside the main oil centers the cartel offered preferential treatment as a highvolume shipper which included not just steep discountsrebates of up to  for their product but rebates for the shipment of competing products part of this scheme was the announcement of sharply increased freight charges this touched off a firestorm of protest from independent oil well owners including boycotts and vandalism which led to the discovery of standard oils part in the deal a major new york refiner charles pratt and company headed by charles pratt and henry h rogers led the opposition to this plan and railroads soon backed off pennsylvania revoked the cartels charter and nonpreferential rates were restored for the time being while competitors may have been unhappy rockefellers efforts did bring american consumers cheaper kerosene and other oil byproducts before  oil light was only for the wealthy provided by expensive whale oil but during the next decade kerosene became commonly available to the working and middle classes undeterred though vilified for the first time by the press rockefeller continued with his selfreinforcing cycle of buying the least efficient competing refiners improving the efficiency of his operations pressing for discounts on oil shipments undercutting his competition making secret deals raising investment pools and buying rivals out in less than four months in  in what was later known as the cleveland conquest or the cleveland massacre standard oil absorbed  of its  cleveland competitors eventually even his former antagonists pratt and rogers saw the futility of continuing to compete against standard oil in  they made a secret agreement with rockefeller to be acquired pratt and rogers became rockefellers partners rogers in particular became one of rockefellers key men in the formation of the standard oil trust pratts son charles millard pratt became secretary of standard oil for many of his competitors rockefeller had merely to show them his books so they could see what they were up against and make them a decent offer if they refused his offer he told them he would run them into bankruptcy and then cheaply buy up their assets at auction but this was not intended to eliminate competition entirely in fact his partner pratt said of that accusation competitors we must haveif we absorb them it surely will bring up another instead of wanting to eliminate them rockefeller saw himself as the industrys savior an angel of mercy absorbing the weak and making the industry as a whole stronger more efficient and more competitive standard was growing horizontally and vertically it added its own pipelines tank cars and home delivery network it kept oil prices low to stave off competitors made its products affordable to the average household and to increase market penetration sometimes sold below cost it developed over  oilbased products from tar to paint to petroleum jelly to chewing gum by the end of the s standard was refining over  of the oil in the us rockefeller had already become a millionaire  million is equivalent to  million in  dollars he instinctively realized that orderliness would only proceed from centralized control of large aggregations of plant and capital with the one aim of an orderly flow of products from the producer to the consumer that orderly economic efficient flow is what we now many years later call vertical integration i do not know whether mr rockefeller ever used the word integration i only know he conceived the idea a standard oil of ohio successor of rockefeller  standard oil trust certificate  in  standard clashed with thomas a scott the president of the pennsylvania railroad standards chief hauler rockefeller envisioned pipelines as an alternative transport system for oil and began a campaign to build and acquire them the railroad seeing standards incursion into the transportation and pipeline fields struck back and formed a subsidiary to buy and build oil refineries and pipelines standard countered and held back its shipments and with the help of other railroads started a price war that dramatically reduced freight payments and caused labor unrest rockefeller prevailed and the railroad sold its oil interests to standard but in the aftermath of that battle in  the commonwealth of pennsylvania indicted rockefeller on charges of monopolizing the oil trade starting an avalanche of similar court proceedings in other states and making a national issue of standard oils business practices rockefeller was under great strain during the s and s when he was carrying out his plan of consolidation and integration and being attacked by the press he complained that he could not stay asleep most nights rockefeller later commented all the fortune that i have made has not served to compensate me for the anxiety of that period monopoly puck magazine cartoon the infant hercules and the standard oil serpents may   issue depicting us president theodore roosevelt grabbing the head of nelson w aldrich and the snakelike body of john d rockefeller although it always had hundreds of competitors standard oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales as market share in the united states through horizontal integration ending up with about  of the us market in the kerosene industry the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system it supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public the price of kerosene dropped by nearly  over the life of the company standard oils business practices created intense controversy standards most potent weapons against competitors were underselling differential pricing and secret transportation rebates the firm was attacked by journalists and politicians throughout its existence in part for these monopolistic methods giving momentum to the antitrust movement by  according to the new york world standard oil was the most cruel impudent pitiless and grasping monopoly that ever fastened upon a country to critics rockefeller replied in a business so large as ours  some things are likely to be done which we cannot approve we correct them as soon as they come to our knowledge at that time many legislatures had made it difficult to incorporate in one state and operate in another as a result rockefeller and his associates owned dozens of separate corporations each of which operated in just one state the management of the whole enterprise was rather unwieldy in  rockefellers lawyers created an innovative form of corporation to centralize their holdings giving birth to the standard oil trust the trust was a corporation of corporations and the entitys size and wealth drew much attention nine trustees including rockefeller ran the  companies in the trust the public and the press were immediately suspicious of this new legal entity and other businesses seized upon the idea and emulated it further inflaming public sentiment standard oil had gained an aura of invincibility always prevailing against competitors critics and political enemies it had become the richest biggest most feared business in the world seemingly immune to the boom and bust of the business cycle consistently making profits year after year the companys vast american empire included  domestic wells  miles of pipeline  tank cars and over  employees its share of world oil refining topped out above  but slowly dropped to about  for the rest of the century despite the formation of the trust and its perceived immunity from all competition by the s standard oil had passed its peak of power over the world oil market rockefeller finally gave up his dream of controlling all the worlds oil refining he admitted later we realized that public sentiment would be against us if we actually refined all the oil over time foreign competition and new finds abroad eroded his dominance in the early s rockefeller created one of his most important innovations rather than try to influence the price of crude oil directly standard oil had been exercising indirect control by altering oil storage charges to suit market conditions rockefeller then ordered the issuance of certificates against oil stored in its pipelines these certificates became traded by speculators thus creating the first oilfutures market which effectively set spot market prices from then on the national petroleum exchange opened in manhattan in late  to facilitate the trading of oil futures fear of monopolies trusts is shown in this attack on rockefellers standard oil company rockefeller as an industrial emperor  cartoon from puck magazine although  of world crude production was still coming from pennsylvania wells in the s drilling in russia and asia began to reach the world market robert nobel had established his own refining enterprise in the abundant and cheaper russian oil fields including the regions first pipeline and the worlds first oil tanker the paris rothschilds jumped into the fray providing financing additional fields were discovered in burma and java even more critical the invention of the light bulb gradually began to erode the dominance of kerosene for illumination but standard oil adapted developing a european presence expanding into natural gas production in the us then into gasoline for automobiles which until then had been considered a waste product standard oil moved its headquarters to new york city at  broadway and rockefeller became a central figure in the citys business community he bought a residence in  on th street near the mansions of other magnates such as william henry vanderbilt despite personal threats and constant pleas for charity rockefeller took the new elevated train to his downtown office daily in  congress created the interstate commerce commission which was tasked with enforcing equal rates for all railroad freight but by then standard depended more on pipeline transport more threatening to standards power was the sherman antitrust act of  originally used to control unions but later central to the breakup of the standard oil trust ohio was especially vigorous in applying its state antitrust laws and finally forced a separation of standard oil of ohio from the rest of the company in  the first step in the dissolution of the trust judge kenesaw mountain landis wags his pen at john d rockefeller who is sitting in the witness stand during the standard oil case on july   in the s rockefeller expanded into iron ore and ore transportation forcing a collision with steel magnate andrew carnegie and their competition became a major subject of the newspapers and cartoonists he went on a massive buying spree acquiring leases for crude oil production in ohio indiana and west virginia as the original pennsylvania oil fields began to play out amid the frenetic expansion rockefeller began to think of retirement the daily management of the trust was turned over to john dustin archbold and rockefeller bought a new estate pocantico hills north of new york city turning more time to leisure activities including the new sports of bicycling and golf upon his ascent to the presidency theodore roosevelt initiated dozens of suits under the sherman antitrust act and coaxed reforms out of congress in  us steel then controlled by j pierpont morgan having bought andrew carnegies steel assets offered to buy standards iron interests as well a deal brokered by henry clay frick exchanged standards iron interests for us steel stock and gave rockefeller and his son membership on the company’s board of directors in full retirement at age  rockefeller earned over  million in investments in  one of the most effective attacks on rockefeller and his firm was the  publication of the history of the standard oil company by ida tarbell a leading muckraker she documented the companys espionage price wars heavyhanded marketing tactics and courtroom evasions although her work prompted a huge backlash against the company tarbell stated she was surprised at its magnitude i never had an animus against their size and wealth never objected to their corporate form i was willing that they should combine and grow as big and wealthy as they could but only by legitimate means but they had never played fair and that ruined their greatness for me tarbells father had been driven out of the oil business during the south improvement company affaircitation needed rockefeller called her miss tarbarrel in private but held back in public saying only not a word about that misguided woman he began a publicity campaign to put his company and himself in a better light though he had long maintained a policy of active silence with the press he decided to make himself more accessible and responded with conciliatory comments such as capital and labor are both wild forces which require intelligent legislation to hold them in restriction he wrote and published his memoirs beginning in  critics found his writing to be sanitized and disingenuous and thought that statements such as the underlying essential element of success in business is to follow the established laws of highclass dealing seemed to be at odds with his true business methods rockefeller and his son continued to consolidate their oil interests as best they could until new jersey in  changed its incorporation laws to effectively allow a recreation of the trust in the form of a single holding company rockefeller retained his nominal title as president until  and he kept his stock at last in  the supreme court of the united states found standard oil company of new jersey in violation of the sherman antitrust act by then the trust still had a  market share of the refined oil market but only  of the us crude oil supply the court ruled that the trust originated in illegal monopoly practices and ordered it to be broken up into  new companies these included among many others continental oil which became conoco now part of conocophillips standard of indiana which became amoco now part of bp standard of california which became chevron standard of new jersey which became esso and later exxon now part of exxonmobil standard of new york which became mobil now part of exxonmobil and standard of ohio which became sohio now part of bp pennzoil and chevron have remained separate companies rockefeller who had rarely sold shares held over  of standards stock at the time of the breakup he and all of the other stockholders received proportionate shares in each of the  companies in the aftermath rockefellers control over the oil industry was somewhat reduced but over the next  years the breakup also proved immensely profitable for him the companies combined net worth rose fivefold and rockefeller’s personal wealth jumped to  million colorado fuel and iron john d rockefeller around  by oscar white in  facing cash flow problems john cleveland osgood turned to george jay gould a principle stockholder of the denver and rio grande for a loan gould via frederick taylor gates rockefellers financial adviser brought john d rockefeller in to help finance the loan analysis of the

rockefeller and gates representing a minority interests osgood left the company in  and devoted his efforts to operating competing coal and coke operations strike of – and the ludlow massacre the strike called in september  by the united mine workers over the issue of union representation was against coal mine operators in huerfano and las animas counties of southern colorado where the majority of cfis coal and coke production was located the strike was fought vigorously by the coal mine operators association and its steering committee which included welborn president of cfi a spokesman for the coal operators rockefellers operative lamont montgomery bowers remained in the background few miners actually belonged to the union or participated in the strike call but the majority honored it strikebreakers called scabs were threatened and sometimes attacked both sides purchased substantial arms and ammunition striking miners were forced to abandon their homes in company towns and lived in tent cities erected by the union such as the tent city at ludlow a railway stop north of trinidad under the protection of the national guard some miners returned to work and some strikebreakers imported from the eastern coalfields joined them as guard troops protecting their movements in february  a substantial portion of the troops were withdrawn but a large contingent remained at ludlow on april   a general firefight occurred between strikers and troops which was antagonized by the troops and mine guards the camp was burned resulting in  women and children who hid in tents at the camp being burned to death costs to both mine operators and the union were high this incident brought unwanted national attention to colorado due to reduced demand for coal resulting from an economic downturn many of cfis coal mines never reopened and many men were thrown out of work the union was forced to discontinue strike benefits in february  there was destitution in the coal fields with the help of funds from the rockefeller foundation relief programs were organized by the colorado committee on unemployment and relief a state agency created by governor carlson offered work to unemployed miners building roads and doing other useful projects the casualties suffered at ludlow were successfully labeled a massacre and mobilized public opinion against the rockefellers and the coal industry the united states commission on industrial relations conducted extensive hearings singling out john d rockefeller jr and the rockefellers relationship with bowers for special attention bowers was relieved of duty and wellborn restored to control in  then industrial relations improved rockefeller denied any responsibility and minimized the seriousness of the event when testifying on the ludlow massacre and asked what action he would have taken as director john d rockefeller stated i would have taken no action i would have deplored the necessity which compelled the officers of the company to resort to such measures to supplement the state forces to maintain law and order rockefeller admitted that he had made no attempt to bring the militiamen to justice

in religious matters during church service his mother would urge him to contribute his few pennies to the congregation he came to associate the church with charity a baptist preacher once encouraged him to make as much money as he could and then give away as much as he could later in his life rockefeller recalled it was at this moment that the financial plan of my life was formed money making was considered by him a godgiven gift a devout northern baptist rockefeller would read the bible daily attend prayer meetings twice a week and even led his own bible study with his wife burton folsom jr has noted he sometimes gave tens of thousands of dollars to christian groups while at the same time he was trying to borrow over a million dollar to expand his business his philosophy of giving was founded upon biblical principles he truly believed in the biblical principle found in luke  give and it will be given to you a good measure pressed down shaken together and running over will be poured

arguing that to help an inefficient illlocated unnecessary school is a waste  it is highly probable that enough money has been squandered on unwise educational projects to have built up a national system of higher education adequate to our needs if the money had been properly directed to that end rockefeller and his advisers invented the conditional grant which required the recipient to root

years after it opened flagler expanded it to accommodate  guests and the hotel soon became one in a series of gilded age hotels catering to passengers aboard flaglers florida east coast railway one of flaglers guests at the ormond hotel was his former business partner john d rockefeller who first stayed at the hotel in  rockefeller liked the ormond beach area so much that after four seasons at the hotel he bought an estate in ormond beach called the casements it would be rockefellers winter home during the latter part of his life sold by his heirs in  it was purchased by the city in  and now serves as a cultural center and is the communitys bestknown historical structure legacy john d rockefellers painting by john singer sargent in  rockefeller had a long and controversial career in the oil industry followed by a long career in philanthropy his image is an amalgam of all of these experiences and the many ways he was viewed by his contemporaries these contemporaries include his former competitors many of whom were driven to ruin but many others of whom sold out at a profit or a profitable stake in standard oil as rockefeller often offered his shares as payment for a business and quite a few of whom became very wealthy as managers as well as owners in standard oil they include politicians and writers some of whom served rockefellers interests and some of whom built their careers by fighting rockefeller and the robber barons biographer allan nevins answering rockefellers enemies concluded the rise of the standard oil men to great wealth was not from poverty it was not meteorlike but accomplished over a quarter of a century by courageous venturing in a field so risky that most large capitalists avoided it by arduous labors and by more sagacious and farsighted planning than had been applied to any other american industry the oil fortunes of  were not larger than steel fortunes banking fortunes and railroad fortunes made in similar periods but it is the assertion that the standard magnates gained their wealth by appropriating the property of others that most challenges our attention we have abundant evidence that rockefellers consistent policy was to offer fair terms to competitors and to buy them out for cash stock or both at fair appraisals we have the statement of one impartial historian that rockefeller was decidedly more humane toward competitors than carnegie we have the conclusion of another that his wealth was the least tainted of all the great fortunes of his day biographer ron chernow wrote of rockefeller what makes him problematic—and why he continues to inspire ambivalent reactions—is that his good side was every bit as good as his bad side was bad seldom has history produced such a contradictory figure notwithstanding these varied aspects of his public life rockefeller may ultimately be remembered simply for the raw size of his wealth in  an audit showed rockefeller was worth about  million—compared to the total national gdp of  billion then his wealth continued to grow significantly in line with us economic growth after as the demand for gasoline soared eventually reaching about  million on the eve of the first world war including significant interests in banking shipping mining railroads and other industries according to the new york times obituary it was estimated after mr rockefeller retired from business that he had accumulated close to  out of the earnings of the standard oil trust and out of his other investments this was probably the greatest amount of wealth that any private citizen had ever been able to accumulate by his own efforts by the time of his death in  rockefellers remaining fortune largely tied up in permanent family trusts was estimated at  billion while the total national gdp was  billion according to some methods of wealth calculation rockefellers net worth over the last decades of his life would easily place him as the wealthiest known person in recent history as a percentage of the united states gdp no other american fortune — including those of bill gates or sam walton — would even come close rockefeller aged  penned the following words to sum up his life i was early taught to work as well as play my life has been one long happy holiday full of work and full of play— i dropped the worry on the way— and god was good to me everyday see also ge
