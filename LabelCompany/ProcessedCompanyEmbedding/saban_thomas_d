and plot their postgame festivitiesat midfield with his back to the visiting arkansas razorbacks a stonefaced nick saban — alabama’s millionayear football coach — watches his team tick off its warmup drills surrounded by a rising tide of crimson as the more than  faithful find their seats at bryantdenny stadiumjim carabin the general manager of crimson tide sports marketing is on the sideline too he hands a signed football to people from golden flake “the official potato chip of the crimson tide for more than  years” and programs to att and cocacola representatives before racing out of a tunnel to check on his broadcast teamthe athletic director and the salesman the football coach and the sorority sister have all taken their places for what at least seven saturdays here each year becomes the center of the alabama universe game day it is equal parts war on the field and worship service and it serves as the centerpiece of alabama football inc an enterprise that generates more than  million annually advertisement continue reading the main story its football prowess is well established going back to  when the crimson tide became the first southern team to win the rose bowl and continuing with the powerhouse s and ’s teams coached by the legendary paul bryant known as bear and saban’s current run of three national titles in the past six years with a realistic shot at a fourth this season continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story but over the past decade the success of crimson tide football can be measured off the field as well as it has become a powerful engine for the university’s economic and academic growth a standout among other large public universities with a similar zest for capitalizing on their sports programsalabama’s football preeminence on television and in the postseason along with an aggressive plan to extend the university reach beyond the state has helped attract a more academicallyminded student body in the past decade from all over the country and served as the catalyst for more than  billion in fundraising according to those who have engineered the explosive growth continue reading

by more than  percent to a record  students this fall and more than half of the students now are from out of state another seismic shift the acceptance rate in the last decade fell to  percent from  percent this year  freshmen are enrolled in its honors college two and half times the number  years ago its  national merit and national achievement finalists rank alabama among the top five public universities“just like nick saban has recruited fivestar athletes the university is going after the best and brightest students” said calvin brown alabama’s director of alumni affairs “we understand that there are young people out there who first view us or any other institution through the window of athletics”as it grows skeptics many outside the university question how much of the financial juggernaut makes its way to the classroom and scoff at what they see as an imbalance of spending on facilities for athletes instead of regular studentsdr allen sack professor emeritus at the university of new haven and a member of the drake group which pushes for educational improvements in college athletics says that while big football universities claim that money is flowing to the classroom it is often difficult to verify though the wealth usually means there is some benefit“they are competing at the top level for tens of millions of network and marketing dollars” sack said “where is that money going how much of it is going into laboratories and academics is it enhancing the reputation of the university nobody really knows those answers” advertisement continue reading the main story alabama has funneled some of its largess into millions of dollars in scholarships and faculty salaries with pledges to do more as it essentially monetizes the passion for the sport and embeds it in the university’s dnaa businessminded athletic departmentin one of the earliest known examples of the power of product placement each episode of “the bear bryant show” on sundays began with bryant twisting off the cap of a coke bottle and opening a bag of golden flake chips a nod to the sponsors bringing his thoughts on the previous day’s game into living rooms across alabamano one embodies this dynamic as neatly as bill battle alabama’s athletic director since  he played on bryant’s  national championship team and then lined up across the field from the bear as the coach of the university of tennessee in  when battle took that job he was  and the youngest head coach in the nationdespite compiling a –– record and winning four of five bowl games he was forced out by tennessee after the  season partly because the volunteers could not supplant bryant and alabama as a southeastern conference power partly to make way for johnny majors a tennessee alumnus who had just led pittsburgh to a national championship bryant may have helped run battle out of coaching but he pushed him into business in a big wayin  while battle ran a company selling aluminum windows bryant told him that he was unhappy with the company managing his speaking engagements and was looking for some help lining up better ones bryant sat on the board of battle’s window company and they had developed a friendship so battle agreed to assume the role himselfas he immersed himself in the business of college sports and the branding of the bear battle discovered that the university of alabama did not have a licensing department nor did any other college football power which meant that its distinctive symbol the script “a” and “roll tide” logos could be appropriated and slapped on shirts hats or coffee cups without the university receiving a dime continue reading the main story photo bill battle alabamas athletic director watched from a box at bryantdenny stadium as the crimson tide played arkansas credit edmund d fountain for the new york times photo battle founded the collegiate licensing company in  to help the university of alabama monetize its symbols and logos credit edmund d

table”battle also knew to steal the playbook for licensing and selling merchandise from the nfl which had in turn taken a page from the walt disney company’s book with alabama as his first client battle created the collegiate licensing company advertisement continue reading the main story thirtyfour years later the collegiate merchandise market takes in  billion in annual sales in  img the

mal moore his predecessor and former alabama teammate deserves the credit for laying the foundation for this efficient money machine in  the athletic budget was  million today it is  million it was moore who launched and presided over the  million in new athletic facilities including two expansions to bryantdenny stadium that brought the seating to  moore also lured saban from the nfl’s miami dolphins with a professionalsize paycheck“it was a brilliant move” battle saidrobert witt who was the president at the time of saban’s hiring and is now the chancellor called the move the university’s wisest investment after he was hired the campus surpassed a  million capital improvement campaign by  million and he has been a key to reaching a  million campaign for the university at largejust as licensing of logos  years ago was considered found money the rapidly increasing revenue from broadcast rights because of the popularity of college sports has been a boon to battle’s department especially the  launch of the sec network a joint venture between the conference and espnlast year the sec received  million  million per university for broadcast rights and bowl game and college football playoff payouts as well as money generated from the conference and the ncaa basketball championships that was up from  million  million per university the previous yearand a robust top line

national champions was a nice bump but it isn’t the dominant reason for our growth we had a vision as an institution and a lot of people worked hard to make it work”last year the athletic department recorded a  million profit according to university documents it gave  million to the university including  million for the university’s presidential scholarships which go to topperforming students

turrets from another era when stuart bell arrived on campus over the summer as alabama’s new president it was as familiar to him as it was the day he left in  to become dean at the university of kansas school of engineering“there always has been a feeling here that once we got kids to step foot on our campus we will keep them here” said bell who most recently was executive vice president and provost at louisiana state “little has changed and a lot has changed”the college of engineering where bell spent  years as a professor and administrator has four new buildings on a quad named after
