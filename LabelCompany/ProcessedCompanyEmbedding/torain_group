automatically update many small business users don’t take the time to install new versions when they come out and keep up with changes in the industry we recommend an antivirus product that integrates with our network monitoring and management we get notified when a virus or malware is detected on your computers and can take immediate action if needed patch management – most security breaches take advantage of known flaws in existing software patch management provides low cost consistent automated ways of making sure your computers stay up to date and detecting any failed updates firewall – the right balance of firewall settings allow you to share information over the internet only with those you intend to we are dealers for and trained in most firewall products including cisco sonicwall watchguard fortinet barracuda and others web filtering – most malware is now delivered simply by visiting the wrong website or clicking on a malicious ad some of this can be caught and prevented by using software that is aware of and catches malicious web browsing activity network management – by using a server based network you can apply security policies to improve security we can help determine what is best for your business passwords – one of the biggest security issues is the management of all the website logins you need to have to conduct business we recommend and help implement lastpass – a password management tool that gives you control of the many logins your employees need to do their job we also recommend setting up some form of  factor authentication and have worked with biometric and token based security systems mobile devices wireless and remote access – keep it secure by understanding the risks and preventing problems inventory – we can help you keep track of

networkingbusiness continuityother networking services it support it projects monitoring  maintenance consulting business continuity business continuity for any business owner three objectives exist when planning to prevent or recover from a disaster the assurance of never losing critical information reducing downtime when emergencies happen quick recovery after a loss of data these three objectives translate into three it services backups the process of protecting your data by copying it to a secure device so that it can be easily and and quickly recovered in case of loss disaster recovery the process of reinstating crucial business data and procedures after a disaster happens business continuity a carefully constructed plan that specifies exactly how your company will recover and reestablish disrupted functions after disaster strikes backups are an essential part of your it strategy even if you just have a single computer at your home office changes in technology have opened up new options for backup cloud computing offers large amounts of storage at low cost improvements in broadband service make it more practical to consider backing up over your internet connection   imaging tools combined with virtual machine technology make it feasible for small business to recover from a lost server in hours instead of days however the fundamentals of disaster prevention have not changed a backup and disaster prevention strategy is still created by thinking through these issues identify the data that is critical to your business and where it is stored be aware of where your email is stored identify programs that use some form of database that runs on a server which may have special backup requirements identify offsite data that may need protection as well such as your website identify dependencies – determine which services such as internet access are required for your business to function identify information that may be required to restore services – vendor contacts software media and license keys passwords etc consider the types of things that could go wrong how likely they are and the consequences determine how long you can be without specific types of data or functionality if these things did go wrong and what the cost would be including the cost of loss or temporary unavailability this determines your “service level” create a backup and disaster prevention plan which allows you to recover functionality within the requirements of your service level create accountability by determining who is responsible develop a plan to monitor and regularly test your business continuity strategy security and disaster prevention are closely related preventing viruses and hackers has become a critical part of staying in business we can consult with you to help develop a good plan of action and then implement and monitor it we offer solutions for local and offsite backup suggested best practices good procedures have an acceptable use policy this should include a policy on where business data is and is not stored this will reduce the chances of getting viruses and other things users can do to damage the systems have and follow a security plan again this prevents problems have and follow a preventative maintenance plan monitoring and maintenance can often prevent problems before they disrupt business  clearly define job roles for backup and disaster prevention build in accountability keep good documentation backups get backup software that can back up any specialized software such as databases or email systems  make sure you can restore a file from as far back in time as needed by keeping multiple copies of your backups set it up to notify you of problems imaging use software that will make a complete image of key computers and servers make these images regularly and keep them separate from the system being imaged back up the image offsite test your ability to restore an image and use the system keep critical data offsite in addition to offsite backups and images keep a list of software licenses with keys documentation on configuration and installation procedures sufficient to rebuild critical equipment and vendor contact information including account numbers and logins keep a copy of all software needed to rebuild your it systems offsite in particular the server operating system and the backup software put redundant parts in servers servers can be ordered with redundant power supplies and redundant hard drives these are the parts most likely to fail buy more than one of the same equipment troubleshooting is much quicker and easier if you have the ability to swap out identical parts establish hardware standards use a battery backup put a hefty ups on each server with software that will automatically shut it down if the power stays off sudden loss of power can cause the server data to be corrupted an orderly shutdown prevents this schedule regular tests of the battery and replace it when needed they usually last  years keep critical spare parts if justified keep spares of power supplies hard drives and other key parts for equipment which can’t be down long enough to order parts resources business continuity technology planning technology policy managed services take this quiz networking it support it projects monitoring  maintenance consulting business continuity
