product safety commission cpsc tested  different home kits and found that more than half of them produced false negatives or not accurately detecting the presence of lead according to the study if a leadtainted object was covered with a nonlead based coating the kits couldnt successfully identify the metal source cpsc also the time required for the swab to change colors ranged from a few minutes to a few hours which could confuse some users consequently the commission recommended that consumers rely on professional inhome lead testing services on a more positive note the commission found a  percent success rate with xray fluorescence xrf screenings of leadtainted surfaces source cpsc xrf evaluates the electron activity of elements in test areas in the presence of radiation the radiation will ionize atoms by causing them to release lowenergy electrons which are then replaced in their orbital by higherenergy electrons source wirth and barth depending on the wavelength the energy emitted from the ionization process the scanner can detect the element such as lead that it came from however xrf technology isnt generally available to the public and its used primarily by the environmental protection agency epa agrees with the cpscs findings it advises people to consider professional testing when moving into houses built before  professional services will examine all of the painted surfaces in a house to determine whether and where any leadbased paint is present source epa beyond that its the responsibility of the home owner to decide the optimal method for removing it     granite radiation testing most radon exposure occurs due to radon that seeps into our homes through the foundation studies have shown that granite countertops can emit radon and radiation but
