enforcement type civil penalty a federal court district of columbia case summary investment trust caledonia investments plc agreed to pay  in civil penalties to resolve charges that it violated federal premerger reporting laws by failing to report its purchase in  of voting shares in the helicopter services company bristow group inc according to the complaint in june  caledonia first acquired voting shares in bristow and reported its purchase to us antitrust authorities as required under the hartscottrodino act subsequently caledonia made additional purchases that were exempt from reporting under hsr rules during that same timeframe however two caledonia employees were designated to serve on bristow’s board bristow awards restrictedstock voting securities to its board members and by agreement it set aside the securities for the two caledonia board members for purchase by caledonia in february  these voting shares vested and caledonia acquired them according to the complaint the commission charged that caledonia was required under the hsr act to report this purchase but failed to do so the hsr act allows a company that has reported an initial purchase of voting shares to purchase additional voting shares from the same issuer – as long as those purchases do not cause the company’s total holdings to cross a higher reporting threshold over a fiveyear period following the initial purchase the complaint charges that caledonia’s  purchase of voting shares in bristow fell outside the fiveyear period following its initial purchase case timeline october

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
