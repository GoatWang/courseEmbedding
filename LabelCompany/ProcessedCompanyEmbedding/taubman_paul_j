independent investment banks have gained ground in recent years as longtime deal makers created new firms devoted solely to advising clients on takeovers and other transactions unlike the big firms from which most of those bankers hailed the new firms do not have huge trading desks or lending armsboutiques now make up about  percent of the market for merger advisory fees according to data from thomson reuters having risen fairly steadily from  percent in during that time a flurry of independent firms — some publicly traded some not — opened they include the likes of evercore partners centerview partners and moelis  company all formed by wall street veteranspjt is on the smaller side of those firms with  employees and  partners the yearold lazard by contrast has nearly eight times as many people on its staffbut pjt is being led by one of the topranked deal makers on wall street mr taubman a year veteran who presided over multibilliondollar transactions involving not only the

conflicts with the firm’s other much bigger investing operations advertisement continue reading the main story some private equity firms for example did not want to hire blackstone bankers to advise their portfolio companies when their colleagues at the blackstoneowned gso hedge fund were taking opposite bets on the debt of those companiesbringing in mr taubman and spinning off the advisory business would solve that problem“this is a firm that has been able to achieve leadership positions with arguably one hand tied behind its back” mr schwarzman saidsoon after mr taubman’s arrival changes took place even faster at the advisory business with about half the merger partners departing in came notables like john trousdale a media deal maker from credit suisse and don cornwell a sports banker from morgan stanleyin the meantime the restructuring team led by timothy coleman and the advisory business’s park hill fundraising group led by dan prendergast were left alone but being part of a firm focused entirely on advisory work would bring additional benefits including regular access to the chief executive for clients“what you have now is like the beginning of blackstone” mr coleman said “the head of the firm will go on pitches”in the span of a year the management team has had to make other decisions big and small from the name of the firm to new office space in manhattan and elsewhere around the worldwhen it begins trading the question is whether the year of preparation will arm the firm for business particularly in a stillfrothy market for mergers pjt so far has secured mandates on deals like altice’s  billion acquisition of cablevision and  billion takeover of the cable provider suddenlink as well as the sale of a huge stake in the economist group to a wealthy italian clanbut if the environment for deals cools the financial restructuring team is meant to provide a useful counterweight according to pjt executives and the park hill fundraising business should remain a constant source of revenue“when we think of this enormous ma market out there we expect to have real market share gains” mr taubman said “even if it cools a bit it works to our favor if our other businesses outperform” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think related coverage taubman’s new firm pjt partners

credit tina fineberg for the new york times when the longtime investment banker paul j taubman left morgan stanley in late  no one was quite sure what he would do nextthen over the next two years he helped spearhead two huge takeover bids — for verizon and comcast — climbing the ranks of wall street’s deal makers as a virtual oneman mergers advisory businessnow mr taubman is set to begin the next stage of his career leading a new publicly traded investment bank formed from the merger of his own budding operations and the yearold advisory arm of the blackstone groupthe firm pjt partners will begin trading on thursday testing whether mr taubman can lead a rapidly assembled team of specialists in mergers reorganizations and fundraising for investment funds in the spotlight of the public markets advertisement continue reading the main story “this wasn’t on my radar when i left” mr taubman  said in a telephone interview “it’s just how the world played out but i’m excited we’re in this place” continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story socalled boutique and independent investment banks have gained ground in recent years as longtime deal makers created new firms devoted solely to advising clients on takeovers and other transactions unlike the big firms from which most of those bankers hailed the new firms do not have huge trading desks or lending armsboutiques now make up about  percent of the market for merger advisory fees according to data from thomson reuters having risen fairly steadily from  percent in during that time a flurry of independent firms — some publicly traded some not — opened they include the likes of evercore partners centerview partners and moelis  company all formed by wall street veteranspjt is on the smaller side of those firms with  employees and  partners the yearold lazard by contrast has nearly eight times as many people on its staffbut pjt is being led by one of the topranked deal makers on wall street mr taubman a year veteran who presided over multibilliondollar transactions involving not only the likes of comcast but also the pharmaceutical giant pfizer perhaps his most important deal however was helping to secure an investment for morgan stanley from the mitsubishi ufj financial group of japan a crucial lifeline during the financial crisisthe birth of pjt has taken place on an unusually fast timeline after leaving morgan stanley mr taubman slowly began assembling his own team including former colleagues like scott matlock and johannes groellerbut blackstone’s senior management including its cofounder stephen a schwarzman contacted mr taubman late last year asking him to take over the business that became the foundation for what is now a  billion investment giant

mergers banker himself has spoken fondly of the advisory business but the division increasingly suffered from conflicts with the firm’s other much bigger investing operations advertisement continue reading the main story some private equity firms for example did not want to hire blackstone bankers to advise their portfolio companies when their colleagues at the blackstoneowned gso hedge fund were taking opposite bets on the debt of those companiesbringing in mr taubman and spinning off the advisory business would solve that problem“this is a firm that has been able to achieve leadership positions with arguably one hand tied behind its back” mr schwarzman saidsoon after mr taubman’s arrival changes took place even faster at the advisory business with about half the merger partners departing in came notables like john trousdale a media deal maker from credit suisse and don cornwell a sports banker from morgan stanleyin the meantime the restructuring team led by timothy coleman and the advisory business’s park hill fundraising group led by dan prendergast were left alone but being part of a firm focused entirely on advisory work would bring additional benefits including regular access to the chief executive for clients“what you have now is like the beginning of blackstone” mr coleman said “the head of the firm will go on pitches”in the span of a year the management team has had to make other decisions big and small from the name of the firm to new office space in manhattan and elsewhere around the worldwhen it begins trading the question is whether the year of preparation will arm the firm for business particularly in a stillfrothy market for mergers pjt so far has secured mandates on deals like altice’s  billion acquisition of cablevision and  billion takeover of the cable provider suddenlink as well as the sale of a huge stake in the economist group to a wealthy italian clanbut if the environment for deals cools the financial restructuring team is meant to provide a useful counterweight according to pjt executives and the park hill fundraising business should remain a constant source of revenue“when we think of this enormous ma market out there we expect to have real market share gains” mr taubman said “even if it cools a bit it works to our favor if our other businesses outperform” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your
