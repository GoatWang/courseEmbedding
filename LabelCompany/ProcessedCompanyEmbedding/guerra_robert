receive fcw magazine for free share tweet guerra bid protests as a business strategy by robert j guerrafeb   in a recent column in fcw i suggested that maybe it was time we as a community came together to figure out why there are so many protests of information technology acquisitions lately well the answer came in my email the other day some company is actually conducting a seminar titled ‚Äúa successful bid protest can produce a contract win‚Äù yes for a mere  the email states ‚Äúthis seminar will give federal salesmen and sales managers the information that they need to use the bid protest process as part of a successful sales strategy the seminar is unique in teaching protests from the salesmans perspective‚Äù they go on to say that there are ‚Äútypes of losses that you should almost always protest‚Äù not that you should only protest when you believe that a procurement was improperly conducted or that the request for proposals was intentionally structured to award to a particular company irrespective of their real ability to perform no they suggest we should protest based upon the type of loss you experience it is appalling that in a time when government acquisition personnel are under increased stress to conduct ever more complex acquisitions we as a community should seek ways to protest more contract awards it isn‚Äôt bad enough that we already have protests that in many cases are ‚Äúfishing expeditions‚Äù now we want sales reps and managers pursuing protests as a way to make their quotas from the seminar summary one would think that all one needs to do is file a protest and that nothing serious happens well sure submitting a protest is easy and not too expensive the initial document if properly structured by outside counsel can cost your company as little as  but it‚Äôs that cumbersome thing called discovery which leads to reviews revisions and updates to your protest that ends up costing you hundreds of thousands of dollars you also run the risk of alienating your customer which must deal with the program delays and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend its award decision how about an alternative seminar maybe one that says ‚Äúprotest a contract award only when you are absolutely certain that a procurement was unfairly conducted and you are sure that the protest is not disrupting a mission critical function‚Äù i think i‚Äôll take my  and donate it to the national institutes of healths children‚Äôs inn that seems a much more worthwhile investment guerra is a partner at the consulting firm guerra and kiviat about the

investigation reader comments fri oct   mike delcolle using protests as a business strategy reminds me of some shady greasyillfitting suit low life who wants to use trickery and misrepresentation to gain entry into an event they are not qualified to attend we do a disservice to and dishonor the acquisition workforce and process when we trivialize a legitimate business tool which should be used sparingly as if it were an everyday hammer i am not against protests when i was in the government i actually thought they could be a good thing  but i am fiercely opposed to protests as a form of

trolling for business and not detered by the stigma of frivolous protests the playing field is not level for while it might cost the protestor a few thousand the cost to the government to assess and dismiss a blatently firvolous protest is at least ten times the filing cost that the playing field isnt quite even is a burden the government duly faces however the resulting high cost of doing

the same topic  ncma member rate with breakfast included  what a deal our expert instructors will identify key issues and offer valuable tips and information regarding how to make effective use of the bid protest process to maximize business for your company i dont think ncma is doing the government any favors no wonder cos have become so risk averse in their jobs  wed feb   mark boster dc metro thanks bob for raising this aricle as someone who has been involved in protests from both the government and commercial side i certainly do not believe these decisions should be made by business development people a decision to protest needs to be made at the highest levels of the company without emotions well founded factual protests are part of the the procurement process and should be encouraged protests that are frivolous waste time resources and damage relationships with the organization especially when gao stops work on the effort we have all seen a number of high profile protests result in awards and these outcomes have fueled the protest fires giving a protesting company an award is the path of least resistance for the agency but only serves to encourage more protests we are all better served when government runs a procurement without errors and protests are allowed to run their course tue feb   joe the contractor many major dod vendors use the protest strategy if they are the incumbent and lose a recompete they protest to keep the business going under an extension on the incumbent contract secondly many a contract are written for the incumbent as
