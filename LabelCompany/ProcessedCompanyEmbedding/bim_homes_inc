builder search form search bim for home builders    tweet building softwareproponents of building information modeling software like warren buffett say now is the time for home builders to adopt the technology by peter fabris contributing editormarch  a new home has risen in a fancy new development but it contains a flaw that is embarrassing and aggravating for the home builder’s project manager a window intersects with a roof line — a formula for leaks into a secondstory bedroom it’s the type of mistake that is all too common in the industry the window must be moved a costly fix during a period when profit margins are tighter than ever this kind of error eats away at the bottom line builders have longed for a system that can prevent such profitstealing construction flaws and in recent years have heard that building information modeling bim is the answer according to the sales pitch bim will not only drastically reduce design flaws and change orders but will also enable home builders to increase productivity in design and drafting reduce overbuying of materials and estimate costs more precisely — all of which will significantly boost profit margins already a success in commercial construction bim has not been widely adopted to date by home builders many feel that the technology hasn’t been tailored for the challenges of homebuilding’s rapid scheduling but that sentiment is beginning to change with recent upgrades of leading bim systems making them better suited to home building is it time for the industry to get serious about bim some are saying “yes” among them is warren buffett chairman of berkshire hathaway one of the most successful investors in history the oracle of omaha is so bullish on bim that he acquired software developer and bim service provider simpadblackpoint builder services now a subsidiary of one of his holdings mitek buffett also authored a book touting bim to home builders “we are making an investment in assisting a limited number of homebuilding companies to automate their cad production and estimating processes” buffett wrote in the book which was distributed to ceos of the nation’s  largest home builders “they will quickly realize the cost savings the quality and accuracy of their design and construction process will be better than ever before and they’ll be delivered in a much shorter period of time” bim is commonly used in the design of major highrise office towers bridges power plants and other complex projects with long timeframes architects engineers construction management firms and owners have reported notable results in improved efficiency on commercial and public works projects and bim is on its way to becoming an industry staple while many people define bim as d design software in order to get the most out of the technology it is better to think of it as a system to manage a construction project from beginning to end “people vary in their use of the term” says ross theilen general manager of structural frame software for ilevel by weyerhaeuser “it’s not just a software application it’s a mechanism for collaboration among platforms” bim d design tools represent elements of a home design as objects the objects can be reused in multiple designs saving time in the drafting process additionally by presenting design in d it’s a lot easier to catch conflicts such as a window intersecting with a roof line but more than that on a bim object of a window for example the designer can attach data including the size type of glass whether a screen is included and the window brand to the d depiction then this information can be fed into an estimating component to obtain the unit price analyze all of the windows in this way and you can get the total cost of all of the windows in the home you can also try alternative window types and brands to find out how they would impact the overall cost if you repeat the process with all of the elements of a home you can come up with a reliable cost estimate of all materials to be used in the project then ideally the d plans and related construction documents such as bills of materials can be accessed by all suppliers and subcontractors over the web thus everyone can work from the same set of plans and data without having to do any redrawing or transposing indeed bim promises much more than a fancylooking electronic blueprint it can be a valuable aid in making strategic decisions this is the longterm vision for bim anyway though very few home builders have achieved such an advanced degree of integration in order to maximize bim’s benefits builders should use it as part of a lean building process lean building is a project management approach that attempts to wring out waste such as overbuying of materials and to reduce errors that lead to change orders — and higher costs “beginning with the crash of  builders have become increasingly desperate to reduce costs and have pushed themselves to the limit yet we see them walk right past some of their greatest savings opportunities” says scott sedam president of truenorth development and a lean building guru “there is a gold mine sitting right under their noses yet builders fail to tap it because they don’t know how to identify measure and track waste most who do see it simply assume these costs are just part of doing business or are just too difficult to deal with” according to industry consultant chuck shinn builders can improve profits from  percent to  percent just by streamlining management systems adding bim d design software alone however will not cut all that fat from the building process “just because you have a d model if you don’t know how to leverage it it’s not going to do you a lot of good” says tim beckman partner with cg visions a bim development and implementation consulting firm to get the most out of bim the design software must work seamlessly with estimating tools and produce usable construction documents for suppliers and subcontractors the major players in bim software and services have focused recently on making it easier for clients to leverage the technology beyond design and drafting simpadblackpoint builder services for instance offers a collaboration portal that allows trade partners and contractors access to clients’ bim plans and documents through a secure web site in addition simpad’s technology which is built to work with autodesks autocad and revit is now integrated with mitek’s truss ordering system eliminating the need for the truss manufacturer to rework designs this not only speeds up the process but also diminishes the possibility of inaccuracies during truss manufacturing another example of multipartner cooperation is cadsoft’s envisioneer and weyerhaeuser’s ijavelin integration that allows designers to model complete structural frames including the floor wall and roof systems and send them along with materials lists directly to a lumberyard for fabrication this too eliminates the need for redrawing plans and transposing data “the lumberyard can cut pieces to the exact length and cut holes for the plumbing elements” says theilen “everything can be labeled so that it can be put together like a jigsaw puzzle on site” there are other instances of collaboration between software vendors and you can expect more of them to be announced it’s in everyone’s interest for all of the various players along the supply chain to participate in bim because each participant stands to improve efficiency the more players involved the more benefits for all this process will take some years to fully develop though recent improvements in bim products are making more builders take the technology seriously but there remains plenty of skepticism doug smith now executive director of estimating with bsb design dallas led a multiyear bim initiative for his former employer centex that was halted in  the home builder had decided that bim required too much training and did not improve plans and estimates enough to make it worthwhile smith still holds that view “to where bim has developed thus far it is too timeconsuming and not accurate enough for home builders” he says but smith’s former employer — pulte homes which acquired centex — is about to jump wholeheartedly into the bim world in  “the valueadd on the estimating side wasn’t really there” says scott thomas pulte’s national director of production since then the tools have improved to the point where the company is now evaluating which ones to embrace not whether to buy into the concept at all the ranks of builders adopting bim are growing but implementation isn’t a fast or easy process it’s essential to take a phased approach to implementing bim tools and processes and to allow enough time for staff to get up to speed with the software and procedures “initially it looks expensive and difficult to implement” cg’s beckman says “but you can do it in progressive steps you can start with the product document set and leverage it to do other things later” a big challenge to veridian homes’ bim implementation was allowing time for training while keeping up with production demands says dan gorski vice president of homebuilding services for the madison wis company veridian’s owners were strongly committed to bim including making sure staff was well trained which was essential to success gorski says “a key was finding a trainer that worked best with our team” gorski says the trainer provided a twoweek course for the design team onsite then followed that up with visits for one week a month for six months to provide oneonone coaching making sure that the trainer had a good rapport with staff was crucial gorksi says for grant giese president of green goose homes based in lafayette ind there is no need to convert d plans to d or revamp legacy estimating systems the company is a startup that will use bim from inception giese says his biggest challenge will be working with suppliers and subcontractors who are mostly unfamiliar with bim “they are still going to want to do things their way” giese says he’s ready to make a strong case to them however suppliers will be enthused by the prospect of fewer material returns he believes thomas senses less opposition from pulte’s trading partners than even a couple of years ago partially due to the struggling economy “they are more willing to do these things today than they were a few years ago when everybody was making money” he says some trades like component manufacturers will get on board early while others such as mechanical contractors that do their own designs will lag different home builders have different ways of designing elements and recording data but software doesn’t work well when there are conflicting standards in some cases builders have to conform their methods to work with bim leslie day president of inland homebuilding group of tampa fla which is implementing bim using simpad’s blackpoint says her company has had to adapt some internal processes to fit the specifications of the system “our biggest challenge right now is taking the way we bid and adjusting it to blackpoint’s format” she says making sure that all of a builder’s suppliers and contractors use and understand designs estimating methods and other data points the same way is another complication when tackling bim brookfield homes southland of costa mesa calif hires multiple architecture firms each with slightly different ways of presenting designs for example “each one has a different style of representing mep systems” says chris formes brookfield’s it manager that will soon change as the company is now requiring its architects to adopt a standard approach   tips on adopting bim in your business be realistic with the timetable while bim can help transform the business with badly needed costsaving capabilities remember that people need time to adjust to change trying to do too much too fast is a recipe for failure use a phasedin approach with realistic benchmarks don’t skimp on training the more proficient your staff is with the software the higher the return on your bim investment so budget enough money and time for training “you have to maintain your commitment to training even while you have production demands” advises dan gorski veridian homes’ vice president of homebuilding services consider outside help the initial stages of converting d plans to d and setting up the related systems that provide estimating data and construction documents are laborintensive “we would have needed to increase staff dramatically to bring the new platform online” says jim risch director of architecture for deluca homes based in yardley pa deluca’s solution was to hire consultant cg visions of lafayette ind to assist in the move to the new platform “they helped us set up libraries material databases and output formats” says risch standardize at the outset design specifications estimating methods and other key data points must be developed consistently across the company and throughout the supply chain this includes architecture consultants subcontractors and suppliers the sooner in the implementation process that these standards are harmonized the better develop a sales pitch for supplierspartners be prepared with some salesmanship to persuade suppliers and contractors that participating in your bim plan will benefit them too in a nutshell suppliers will have fewer material returns and contractors won’t have to spend as much time correcting design mistakes in the field   colorado builder implements building information modeling in  while most home builders would have been thrilled just to match the previous year’s sales oakwood homes sold  homes a big jump from  in  the impressive results can be directly attributed to a new business strategy in which bim plays an essential role late in  the colorado builder decided that it had to reduce its price for entrylevel homes from  to  in order to meet the demands of a changing market reduced price points meant reduced profit margins so cutting costs was critical oakwood needed to scale back the size of these entrylevel homes from  square feet to  square feet to make a profit at the new price point also critical to gaining competitive advantage was to be able to offer customers a wider variety of options for base home designs “a lot of builders are looking to offer fewer options to reduce costs” says don carpenter oakwood’s director of product development “a lot of our competitors are looking to limit choice while we’re looking to expand options” converting their designs to a bim platform using autodesk’s revit and simpad’s blackpoint builder services was the first step using bim models oakwood has been able to accurately gauge its unit costs which gives the company the ability to obtain accurate costs on base homes and many options thus the company can figure its profit margin on every sitespecific plan at the onset of the project also option pricing can be adjusted quickly when the price of materials changes oakwood’s sister company manufactures housing components used in its designs “our component factory lives and breathes costs they work with materials every day” carpenter points out when the sister company finds a good deal on a certain brand of say insulation the new price can be automatically reflected on all plans throughout the design database then oakwood’s designs can be switched to the bargain brand of insulation to reap the savings “all of us are operating with slimmer margins” carpenter says “the ability to measure and manage costs is critical — a matter of survival” bim is essential for accurately gauging costs he adds “builders that are going to be successful will switch to this others are going to struggle” bim providers for the homebuilding market americad provider of d and d architectural services and software solutions

we will hold your information confidential and never provide your information to third parties for marketing purposes if you need assistance sending us drawings or documents ask for directions for using our ftp site guides and faqs about cad and bim services guides introduction to converting pdf to cad why cant scans be used in cad introduction to bim for contractors bim lod level of development definitions faqs converting drawings to cad what formats do you convert inputs for inputs we can accept all drawing formats and prints these include pdf tiff jpeg jedmics c all scans and all common cad formats outputs d cad  autocad dwg dxf d cad  solidworks iges step stl sketchup d dwg d pdf bim  revit rfa and rvt navisworks sketchup coordination and shop drawings in cad and pdf do you produce real cad the cad and bim we produce is properly drafted by trained cad operators with years of experience we use normal architectural and engineering drafting conventions and layer accordingly the files you receive from us will be immediately editable in your own cad or bim application without requiring additional work what do i have to send we typically work from pdfs or scans of existing drawings or plans on occasion we have also worked from photographs of original drawings send us the best copy of the drawing that you have clear copies are faster to convert and the price will be lower if you dont have your best copies to hand when you want a quote send us poorer ones or photos and tell us that better quality copies will be available for the actual job we will take this into account when preparing the quote what factors determine the price of a conversion we price every job individually the primary variables we factor when we look at your original drawing are  how many lines and objects are in the drawing  this determines how many entities we have to draw  clarity and legibility  are lines distinct and is text easily read  density of content  is the drawing very busy with a lot on information squeezed in tight or overlapping  extent to which there is replication  for example can we reuse details or a wall layout that repeats across floors  dimensional accuracy required  a construction or machining drawing needs perfect dimensioning but a pid does not how long do conversions take d conversions to cad dwg or dgn typically take  days for one or a few sheets larger jobs do take longer a set of house plans may take  days an entire set of construction drawings may take a couple of weeks there is a limit to how much faster a job can be completed by adding operators  we try to assign a small team to each job as this makes for higher quality if you do need a job completed very urgently please let us know when you request your quote and we will see what we can do for expedited delivery d conversions solidworks and derivative iges step or stl are harder to predict quite often we have questions about interpreting the original drawings or specs in these cases there is a backandforth between you and us and this adds time to our workflow as a rule of thumb oneoff parts can be turned around in  days bim projects rvt are usually more substantial there is more setup time required and revisions when clashes are found are a normal part of the process for complete architectural projects think in terms of weeks or months creating reusable equipment families rfa takes less time but like d often involves back and forth which adds to the time required my drawings are in bad shape  can you use them in our d cad business poor originals are normal there are many buildings and plants designed on the board and managed over the years by editing actual prints when its time to revamp facilities we can create modern cad from scans of wellworn prints creating good line work in cad is not normally any problem  our operators can usually interpret gaps and coffee stains illegible text can be more of a problem particularly when it comes to dimensions if there is any doubt at all we place the questionable text or entities into a readme layer in the cad file this enables you to quickly see where you will have to do a crosscheck what if there are errors in my original drawings this is a good question in undertaking cad work we are not acting as designers or engineers in any way our commitment is to replicate your original drawings in perfect cad so if a dimension is wrong or words misspelled in the original you send us we will replicate this in the cad file if we do notice an apparent mistake we will place the entity in the readme layer that we create to flag issues but this is a courtesy only  our services do not include correcting errors present in the originals can i send prints to be scanned we do scan prints when required our focus is on cad and bim  we are not a reprographics company if you would like to send us prints for conversion please request shipping and delivery instructions send us a message can you use my title block and layering standard just send us your dwg template and we will use it to draft using your title block and layering how do you handle redline we can either reproduce redline exactly as it is drawn or use redline instructions markups to update the content of the drawing if your redline reflects asbuilts and you have copies of the original design or construction issue cad files we can simply update these to produce asbuilt cad files bim what is bim bim stands for building information modeling traditionally every discipline produces separate drawings and documention for a building bim efficiently centralizes all this information into one model the idea has been around since the early s but its only recently that it has begun to move into mainstream design construction and facilities management in the united states where adoption has been slower than in europe the benefits are being seen in new builds there are several good bim software applications we use revit and navisworks bim models are highly detailed components are objects not just drawn lines so ids and specifications can be captured in the model this makes it easy to export quantity schedules and the integration across disciplines means clashes can be detected and resolved before construction begins design and build is just one aspect of bim  the model continues to be used for operating and managing the completed facility see also introduction to bim for contractors what does lod stand for in bim lod stands for level of development the bim forum defines it as a reference that enables practitioners in the aec industry to specify and articulate with a high degree of clarity the content and reliability of building information models bims at various stages in the design and construction process in practice it is a set of reference numbers      and  that indicate the extent and precision of the bim model as it progresses through its development for contractors a bim model to lod  or  is usually required in order for them to build from the information in the model a summary pdf sheet describing each level is available here if we submit d cad drawings are you able to use these for bim yes we use the d drawings as the basis for a d revit model think of building in d as analogous to actual construction we start with the foundation level and build up one virtual floor at a time when the bim program shows that there are clashes in our projects design how is this relayed to contractors as we build up in d we attend or host coordination meetings this is analogous to actual construction in that problems that have been discovered are reviewed and solved the big difference being that fixes in virtual models cost almost nothing compared to a discovery during construction we use video conferencing to show clashes on screen and discuss how to handle them meeting attendees just need a computer and an internet connection roughly how long does it take to build a bim model that includes every discipline assuming a fairly typical commercial building from receipt of construction drawings ideally as dwgs to architectural and structural bim is typically  weeks then we add in the mepf content over several more weeks this is when we uncover issues and start holding regular web conferencing meetings to resolve them it is possible to model and coordinate entire projects before you actually break ground however its more realistic that just your lower level bim modeling has been completed at that stage with the final upper floor finish modeling overlapping the start of construction how is the cost estimated for bim models we quote a fixed price for your bim project based on our review of your drawings and specifications our price includes clash detection coordination and production of shop drawings as required our teams many years of experience in bim enables us to accurately predict and include the hours needed for clash detection and attending online coordination meetings in addition to building the bim model itself this means we can offer an allin fixed price so you know exactly what your cost will be payment what payments do you accept we accept american express mastercard visa and discover credit accounts can be opened upon application
