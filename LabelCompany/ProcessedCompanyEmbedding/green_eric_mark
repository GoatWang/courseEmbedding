options available to immigrants who wish to obtain a green card or lawful permanent residence is a marriagebased green card with a marriagebased green card an immigrant can live and work in the us and travel internationally this is one of the most common ways to obtain and green card and there is no limit to how many are issued each year but it is not a simple process and immigrants are advised to consult with a jersey city immigration attorney to determine eligibility potential pitfalls and for help with the processin order to qualify for a marriagebased visa greencard an immigrant must meet a set of criteria enforced by the united states citizenship and immigration services an immigrant must be able to prove she is legally married is in a bona fide relationship is married to a us citizen or permanent resident and entered the us with inspection and admission or some other acceptable entry any previous marriages must have ended either through divorce or deathto be eligible for a marriagebased visa an immigrant must prove they are in a marriage legally recognized in the state or country where they were married typically an immigrant must provide official documentation issued by a government agency for example a marriage certificate that shows they are legally married the required documentation varies depending on the details of each case so an applicant is advised to contact an immigration attorney to determine if she has the correct documents and assistance obtaining them if they don’t   an immigrant must also prove the marriage is a serious commitment entered into for the purpose of building a life together a marriage cannot be entered into for the sole purpose of obtaining a green card uscis agents are trained to carefully screen green card applicants to determine if their marriage is fraudulent for this reason an immigrant will be required to provide immigration officials with extensive documentation about the relationship failure to do so will result in denial of the application and possibly referral to immigration court for removal proceedingsimmigrants are allowed to apply for marriagebased green cards before they enter the us through a multistep process involving uscis the department of state and the local consulate a potential green card applicant living in the us may be able to obtain status without returning to their native country others will be required to return to their native country for a brief or extended period before receiving a green card the particular route an immigrant chooses depends on their individual circumstancesobtaining a marriagebased green card requires more than filing the necessary petitions it requires extensive documentation and meetings with immigration officials a simple mistake can cause an application to be denied and an immigrant must start the process over again or worse be deported or forever denied admission to the us this can mean long delays which an applicant can avoid
