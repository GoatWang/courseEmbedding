and james a spangenberg esq office of the general counsel gao participated in the preparation of the decision digest agency failed to determine whether the evaluators of the protester�s proposal under a small business innovation research program solicitation had a conflict of interest where the evaluators were employed by firms that promote a type of technology that assertedly is directly challenged by the type of technology offered in the protester�s proposal decision celadon laboratories inc protests the decision of the department of health and human services hhs not to fund its phase i proposal under the small business innovation research sbir program solicitation no phs  celadon asserts that the agency failed to reasonably consider conflicts of interest that it contends likely impaired the objectivity of the four members of the special emphasis panel sep which evaluated its proposal we sustain the protest the sbir program is conducted pursuant to the small business innovation development act  usc sect   which requires certain federal agencies to reserve a portion of their research and development funds for awards to small businesses firms first apply for a month phase i award to test the scientific technical and commercial merit and feasibility of a certain concept if phase i is successful the firm may be invited to apply for a phase ii award to further develop the concept after the completion of phase ii firms are expected to obtain funding from the private sector andor nonsbir government sources to develop the concept into a product for sale in the private sector andor military markets see small business administration�s sbir website httpwwwsbagovsbir to commence the program the agency issues an sbir solicitation that sets forth research and development topics and subtopics that emphasize the need for proposals with advanced concepts to meet specific agency requirements which may be general or narrow in scope depending on the needs of the agency the object of this phase i procurement is to obtain and evaluate small business proposals under stated evaluation criteria to determine which small businesses should receive phase i contracts during phase i the agency will determine the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and the quality of performance of the small business concern with a relatively small agency investment before consideration of further federal support in phase ii sbir program policy directive para a on august   hhs issued this solicitation which identified a number of research topics for the national institutes of health nih and the centers for disease control one of the topics included in the solicitation was topic  development of inhibitory reagents for the study of protein function which was a research topic of interest requested by the national cancer institute nci a division of nih the purpose of this topic was to solicit proposals from small business concerns to encourage the development and commercialization of new technology for the generation of small molecules and novel mechanisms to modulate protein function within a cancer cell solicitation at  proposals submitted in response to this solicitation were to be evaluated by an sep the sep is an independent peer review panel which evaluates the proposals determines which small business concerns should receive phase i contracts and makes specific recommendations related to the scope direction andor conduct of the proposed research solicitation at  in this instance the sep assembled by the nci consisted of three members from private industry and one from academia according to the agency in preparation for their work on the sep prospective members were mailed a copy of nih�s rules including those relating to conflicts of interest prior to their first meeting the four members provided to hhs a signed nih pre‑review certification form in which each member certified that heshe did not have a conflict of interest with the firms that had submitted proposals for review including celadon additionally according to the agency conflicts of interest were addressed in the sep orientation conference and at the beginning of the first review meeting on april   the protester�s chief executive officer expressed concern to the agency about the composition of the sep asserting that each of its members had a real conflict of interest that would likely bias their review of celadon�s proposal agency report ar tab  letter from celadon to nci april   in this letter and in an april  letter celadon identified with specificity why each of the sep members had what celadon considered a real conflict of interest id ar tab  letter from celadon to nci april   basically celadon asserted that all four of the sep members work for or are associated with a segment of the industry specifically vendors that rely on sirna technology a technology that celadon without rebuttal asserts was directly competitive with the technology it offered in its proposal specifically silna technology celadon provided supporting details for why it considered each of these evaluators to have a real conflict of interest because of their employers� commitment to and reliance on sirna technology ar tab  letter from celadon to nci april   by april  the sep had completed its evaluation of celadon�s proposal and found it to be technically unacceptable in response to the concerns that had been expressed by celadon the agency took the following measures the contracting officer asked the project officer to review the proposal and the minutes of the sep and provide a recommendation as to whether the minutes reflect an accurate assessment of the proposal the project officer�s response concurred with the assessment of the sep and he felt the minutes accurately reflected both the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal the contracting officer reviewed the conflict of interest certifications the minutes of the sep and the recommendation of the project officer and concluded that in his opinion there was no bias exhibited in the review of the celadon proposal contracting officer�s statement at  on july  the agency informed celadon that its proposal would not be considered for award and on that same day celadon requested a formal debriefing the agency provided a debriefing on july  and celadon filed this protest on july  the agency initially contends that celadon�s protest was untimely because it was aware of the composition of the sep prior to the rejection of its proposal and it did not file a protest within  days of becoming aware of the composition of the sep our bid protest regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests these timeliness rules reflect the dual requirements of giving parties a fair opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without disrupting or delaying the procurement process peacock myers  adams b mar    cpd para  at  professional rehab consultants inc b feb    cpd para  at  under these rules a protest such as celadon�s based on other than alleged improprieties in a solicitation must be filed not later than  days after the protester knew or should have known of the basis for protest whichever is earlier  cfr sect a  an exception to this general rule is a protest that challenges �a procurement conducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and when requested is required� id in such cases with respect to any protest basis which is known or should have been known either before or as a result of the debriefing the protest must be filed not later than  days after the date on which the debriefing is held id here the protest was filed within  days of the debriefing celadon received even though it knew its protest bases sometime earlier the abovementioned exception to our timeliness rules however applies only to procurements conducted on the basis of �competitive proposals� a term not defined by our bid protest regulations nor by statute or regulation see systems plus inc v united states  fed cl   we have previously determined that the use of negotiated procedures in accordance with federal acquisition regulation far part  and as evidenced by the issuance of a request for proposals constitutes a procurement conducted on the basis of competitive proposals professional rehab consultants inc supra at  here while this sbir procurement was not conducted under far part  procedures the solicitation requested �proposals� to be judged under specified evaluation criteria we need not resolve whether this procurement was conducted on the basis of competitive proposals within the meaning of our timeliness rules because we find that this protest is appropriate for consideration under the significant issue exception to our timeliness rules  cfr sect c what constitutes a significant issue is to be decided on a casebycase basis pyxis corp b b july   ‑ cpd para  at  we generally regard a significant issue as one of widespread interest to the procurement community and that has not been previously decided satilla rural electric membership corp b‑ may    cpd para  at  the issue herethe application of conflict of interest regulations to peer review evaluators in sbir procurementsis not one that we have previously decided and is one that can be expected to arise in future sbir procurements accordingly we consider the issue raised to be a significant one that should be treated on the merits celadon protests that the agency failed to reasonably consider the real conflicts of interest of each of the members of the sep that would impair the sep�s objectivity in evaluating its proposal celadon claims that all three of the sep members work for companies �whose economic lifeblood� is the development and sale of proprietary sirna technology which would be directly competitive with the technology proposed in celadon�s proposal protest at  while the fourth panelist was an academic researcher celadon contends that his work is supported by one of these companies involved with sirna technology federal acquisition regulation far sect  provides as follows government business shall be conducted in a manner above reproach and except as authorized by statute or regulation with complete impartiality and with preferential treatment for none transactions relating to the expenditure of public funds require the highest degree of public trust and an impeccable standard of conduct the general rule is to avoid strictly any conflict of interest or even the appearance of a conflict of interest in governmentcontractor relationships nih is required to have peer review evaluators of proposals for research and development contracts  cfr sect aiif  there are specific regulations governing scientific peer review of research grant applications and research and development contract projects including �biomedical and behavioral research and development contract project concepts and proposals for contract projects administered by the national institutes of health� such as proposals in response to this sbir program solicitation  cfr part h among other things this regulation defines apparent and real conflicts of interest for peer review evaluators and generally prohibits evaluators with such conflicts from evaluating proposals covered by  cfr part h  cfr sections h h this regulation specifically contains the following definition of a �real conflict of interest� real conflict of interest means a reviewer or close relative or professional associate of the reviewer has a financial or other interest in an application or proposal that is known to the reviewer and is likely to bias the reviewer�s evaluation of that application or proposal as determined by the government official managing the review the scientific review administrator or equivalent as acknowledged by the reviewer or as prescribed by this part a reviewer shall have a real conflict of interest if heshe or a close relative or professional associate of the reviewer  has received or could receive a direct financial benefit of any amount deriving from an application or proposal under review  apart from any direct financial benefit deriving from an application or proposal under review has received or could receive a financial benefit from the applicant institution offeror or principal investigator that in the aggregate exceeds  per year     has any other interest in the application or proposal that is likely to bias the reviewer�s evaluation of that application or proposal regardless of the level of financial involvement or other interest if the reviewer feels unable to provide objective advice heshe must recuse himherself from the review of the application or proposal at issue the peer review system relies on the professionalism of each reviewer to identify to the designated government official any real or apparent conflicts of interest that are likely to bias the reviewer�s evaluation of an application or proposal  cfr sect hq celadon contends that each of these evaluators had a �real conflict of interest� under paragraph  above in that they each had an �interest in the application or proposal that is likely to bias the reviewer�s evaluation of that application or proposal� given that each of the evaluators was employed by a firm whose �economic lifeblood� was directly competitive with the technology proposed in celadon�s proposal  cfr sect hq the record shows that the agency�s investigation of celadon�s allegations consisted of verifying that each member of the sep certified that heshe had no conflict of interest with regard to celadon and reviewing the evaluation record and finding no evidence of bias in the evaluation while it is true that the nih regulations contemplate a selfassessment by evaluators as to whether they think they have a real conflict of interest the regulations do not contemplate that a self‑certification by the evaluator is all that is ever needed to satisfy the requirement that he or she does not have a real conflict of interest particularly where as here specific and colorable allegations of a real conflict of interest on the part of the evaluators were brought to the attention of cognizant agency officials under the circumstances present here nih was required to specifically determine whether these evaluators had real conflicts of interest under the applicable regulations however the record shows that nih made no such determination while the agency contends that the conflicts identified by the protester are too remote to be considered real conflicts of interest it has not explained why this is the case in light of the protester�s specific documented allegations that each of the members of the sep by virtue of their employment or financial relationship with a firm that promoted sirna technology would not be able to objectively evaluate celadon�s proposal that offered silna technology we have recognized that an actual or apparent conflict of interest may arise when an agency employee has both an official role in the procurement process and a personal stake in the outcome for example we sustained a protest because of a conflict of interest that invalidated the evaluation where in the course of a competitive sourcing study conducted pursuant to the procedures of office of management and budget circular a  of the  agency employees who were responsible for evaluating privatesector proposals also held positions that were subject to the study and could be affected by the outcome of their evaluation dzsbaker llc morrison knudsen corp b et al jan    cpd para  at  while we do not decide whether the evaluators here had real conflicts of interest the record shows that the agency failed in its obligation to determine whether these individuals� employment caused them a real conflict of interest that could bias their evaluation of celadon�s proposal as contemplated under its applicable regulation the agency�s determination that there is no evidence of actual bias on the part of the evaluators in the evaluation of celadon�s proposal does not address the concerns arising from a conflict of interest the strict limitations on both actual and apparent conflicts of interest reflect the reality that the potential harm flowing from such situations is by its nature frequently not susceptible to demonstrable proof of bias or prejudice department of the navyrecon b may    cpd para  at  thus where the record establishes that a conflict of interest exists on the part of the evaluators to maintain the integrity of the procurement process we will presume that the protester was prejudiced unless the record establishes the absence of prejudice the joneshill joint venture b et al dec    cpd para  at  indeed where the majority of the evaluators have conflicts as is alleged to be the case here we have consistently presumed prejudice in the evaluation the joneshill joint venture supra dzsbaker llc morrison knudsen corp supra we would ordinarily recommend that the agency consider whether there is a conflict of interest on the part of the evaluators in accordance with  cfr sect h and take appropriate corrective action if a conflict of interest on the part of the evaluators was determined to exist however here the agency has stated that all the sbir funds for the fiscal years have been allocated and it has no funds for additional awards under the sbir solicitation under the circumstances we recommend that it reimburse celadon its proposal preparation costs we also recommend that the agency reimburse celadon for the costs of filing and pursuing its protest including reasonable attorney�s fees celadon�s certified claim for costs detailing the time spent and costs incurred must be submitted to the agency within  days of receiving this decision  cfr sect f the protest is sustained gary l kepplinger general counsel  during the course of this procurement the protester had been informed by an nci official of the identity of the sep members  we note however that federal acquisition regulation far sect b �competitive proposals� begins with the reference �see part  for procedures�  we note that the agency cited far part  in offering celadon a debriefing ar tab  letter from nci to celadon july    the regulation also provides that the director may waive any requirements relating to a �real conflict of interest� if the director determines that there are no other practical means for securing appropriate expert advice on the particular matter and that the real conflict of interest is not so substantial as to be likely to affect the integrity of the advice to be provided by the reviewer  cfr sect hb there was no such waiver here  in support of this proposition the agency cites grassetti v weinberger  fsupp  nd cal  the plaintiff in that case argued that the three members in the peer review panel had a conflict of interest in that these individuals or the institutions with which they were associated were recipients of nci funded grants the court found the alleged conflicts were too remote and granted the defendant�s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the record failed to show any violation of law in the denial of the plaintiff�s grant application  we disagree with the agency�s characterization of celadon�s protest as being limited to a complaint about the �balance� of the sep and thus not for consideration by our office see university research corp b oct    cpd para  at  gao will not generally review objections to the composition of a peer review panel absent a showing of possible abuse of discretion because of a conflict of interest or actual bias on the part of the evaluators in fact the focus of celadon�s protest is on the alleged conflicts on the part of all of the evaluators a matter that the agency has not yet adequately investigated  moreover it does not appear that it would be feasible to disturb the awards already made under this solicitation     facebook usgao
