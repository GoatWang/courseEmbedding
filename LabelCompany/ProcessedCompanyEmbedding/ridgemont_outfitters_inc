luggage brand growing faster than we anticpated nearly  year  year ridgemont outfitters is now ready to expand online and worldwide we doubled sales in our second year and are on track to double again this year our focus is to ramp up our directtocustomer channels and create a loyal customer base  directtoconsumer gross margins  sales revenue fiscal yr   website visitorsconvert to buy these revenue projections are based on web sales growth over the previous years plus one planned collaboration kickstarter project per quarter additionally the increased marketing budget from the wefunder spent digitally and traditionally will generate more web traffic and increased conversions for instance over the last seven weeks we have signed up with a digital marketing agency that has already achieved a return on digital ad spend of x as they fine tune the audiences and advert content we hope to push that return past x we then plan to slowly increase the daily amounts that we spend with facebook and also with google adwords  shopping whilst maintaining a x return on ad spend once the funding is successful we would also introduce affiliate advertising on industry blogs plus allocate a budget for more traditional print marketing with direct to consumer catalogues and event attendance festivals etc we also plan to launch new products onceaquarter on kickstarter the first one this winter hit k and the second one for q is due to go live in late april we expect an even more successful campaign given the broad appeal of the new campaign we already have the projects for q  q planned out a usa made luggage line and a collaboration shoe with the national parks brand parks project respectively with the combination of all these initiatives i am confident in attaining the conservative numbers we have suggested now that we have switched our attention  to direct to consumer we can drive the sales up quickly and then revisit wholesale for the next push in  months time there is no guarantee that the numbers will materialize as projected projections for  and later are dependent on variables outside of our control and may not materialize as displayed show more customers reviews  founder interviews watch customers in action an interview with stacy and a product review the time that i get on the water is my release fishing is freedom to me   justin reynolds professional angler and skateboarder and ridgemont delegate ridgemont is shoes for your entire life shoes to take you from the trail to breakfast in the morning to work to dinner at night this is a really good middle ground between full blown hiking and a floppy skate shoe   stacy lowry founder what’s important here is that you get a stylish boot that is built to be taken off the track but still looks good enough to be worn any time of day you can easily pair these with some jeans or some khakis   isaac tud footwear critic designed by us for us rugged construction coupled with high class style weve spent years designing and perfecting our shoes we use the same leather tanneries as timberland and wolverine and combine that high quality grain leather with bullet proof construction to ensure your feet are protected in any situation where most vulcanized shoes use a texon lasting board ridgemont uses a custom composite lasting board to provide variable flex characteristics along the length of the shoe we wanted a shoe that would be very flexible at the ball of the foot since that’s pretty important for walking but more rigid from the arch to the heel so the shoe is more rugged over uneven terrain this is also one of the main reasons our shoes are super comfortable right out of the box all ridgemont shoes are stitched together with nonwicking thread in order to prevent the cotton from pulling moisture through the upper into the lining as the natural fibre thread gets moist it expands slightly to ‘block’ the stitch hole and seal the moisture out clever huh we use only the best full grain cow leather from european hides dyed in tanneries that are gold rated for their environmentally responsible processes we treat our leather with various oils and waxes to ensure that the leather itself is waterproof as verified by the shoe authorities at satra of course we stitch our shoes together poke holes in them so we don’t claim our shoes are  waterproof but they are more water resistant than most light hikers on the market we worked directly with ortholite utilizing their patented open cell foam technology to develop an insole that would be extremely comfortable yet not completely isolate you from your environment additionally and we feel super importantly we designed real arch support to help abate fatigue and keep your arches well formed and not flat as a board the foam in our insoles is antimicrobial nonabsorbing and it will never compress more than  gusseted tongues are designed to keep dust and debris from getting into your shoe through the throat opening we didn’t invent them but we’re one of the few outdoor lifestyle brands that use them and the next time you walk through a field without getting a briar thorn or annoying little stone in your shoe you’ll be glad we do vulcanization is a process of chemically bonding materials together using high heat if done right this creates very strong bonds and allows for a unique “board feel” we tap in to these characteristics and improve upon them for use in the outdoors with a harder  a rubber along with mm thick foxing to improve lateral and torsional stiffness we believe that feeling the earth beneath your feet is a benefit and something that has been all but eliminated from most hiking boots we worked hard to find the ideal outsole thickness which allows us maintain our connection to the terrain while still providing protection from rocks or the dreaded lego block your kid left on the wood floors in addition to paying close attention to our outsoles thickness we were very mindful of providing as much grip as possible in a variety of terrains the softness of the rubber  asker combined with the thickness and slightly lugged tread pattern provides comfort and grip there’s something about canvas shoes that we just love maybe it’s the texture or the way they feel what it isn’t is their ability to stand up to the elements we want our canvas shoes to perform better so we take our raw material and impregnate it with a  dry wax layer this gives a natural canvas look but creates a water resistant barrier to prevent moisture coming through the fabric finally we add a water repellent coating for a final top moisture barrier two years young and growing hatched in early  were only just beginning projections are dependent on variables outside of our control and may not materialize as

unshakable tenacity of a heat seeking missile i participated in only hardcore activities and i expected the things i spent my money on to furnish me with an uncompromising purity of design all or nothing do or die that was then i’m not old in fact i’m still quite young compared to many land tortoises and mountain ranges but i’ve seen the world and experienced a lifetime of uh experiences not that much has changed really i still follow my passions with the heat soaking tenacity of an electric blanket but i increasingly find myself searching for compromise compromise in fact was the inspiration for ridgemont the fact is i don’t often forge rivers but i do cross the occasional puddle i don’t climb mountains but i regularly climb hills i’ve never hiked the appalachian trail but i hike the trail by my house all the time i hike lots of trails and not once has a mountain suddenly sprung up in front of me you see what i’m saying i want some traction i want some water resistance i want some durability but i don’t want to look like i’m about to summit denali i go places and have adventures and i need great quality gear that won’t let me down but i’m not exploring mars i’ll surely never explore mars so i don’t need boots built to survive a martian winter and blend in with the martian natives i need to hike to the surf break then go get a breakfast burrito i need to walk my dog then go to the office i want to go on vacation to far flung places but i’ve got to navigate an airport before i can get there which definitely doesn’t require more spikes than a football boot i wanted great looking well made simply styled shoes and clothes i couldn’t find it so i made it i named it ridgemont and i’d love for you to join us on this adventure sincerely stacy lowery meet the

you want to breath you have an investment stephan louis penn state smack mgmt investor lucas robinson more investors more investors details expand all take us back to the beginning how did you get started i started importing small brands in the early s when snowboarding was first big on the scene i was the first uk distributor for well known board brands like libtech gnu and ride as well as northwave snowboard boots and a variety of clothing brands snowboarding was a new sport i was the importer for the uk and spent quite a lot of time traveling to and from california mostly dealing with us brands off the back of that i got into fashion footwear through the northwave brand thats based out of italy and as such spent quite a lot of time in italy where i learned about shoe manufacturing i picked up the distribution for duffs skate shoes for the uk in the mid s just after they launched i then took on the european distribution and license for duffs apparel i used to make duffs branded tees sweats jeans bags etc and sell them across europe ultimately it reached the point where our duffs business was bigger than the north american duffs business and so we approached the owners and bought the brand from them in  that was a pretty trying time because that was just as the whole world went into global recession and meltdown we fought our way through that and we sold the brand in  and then set ridgemont up stacy lowery cofounder of ridgemont was head of design for duffs and an ex pro skateboarder he went on his honeymoon to costa rica hiking and before going he wanted to buy some suitable shoes to go hiking in all he could find were some ugly black or brown hiking boots that he didnt feel comfortable wearing and so he approached me and said i think theres a niche market here for fashionable outdoor footwear he then did some drawings and i said it seemed like a good idea and ridgemont was born this happened in  we then took a year we were just sort of checking the market thinking that maybe we just missed something and there were people doing it it probably took another year to totally convince ourselves and then we started working on our design towards the end of  where have the last few years gotten you initially its all about finding vendors that will make the product its designing and creating the brand the brand aesthetic all of which took a little bit of time just coming up with a name takes a lot more effort than you think its going to we both had experience manufacturing in the far east but we still had to find factories that could do the quality that we expected that also took time as well as a lot of traveling to china once we found factories that we could work with and would work with us because its hard for startups to get into a good factory we then developed the first range which consisted of two boots and two shoes then we went to our first trade show agenda in long beach it was just when the outdoor movement suddenly started becoming quite cool there were a few other brands in a similar place as us brands like topo designs and poler stuff who are not reinventing the outdoor product but trying to sort of drag it forward and make it a bit more aesthetically fashionable and pleasing we launched at agenda and we got a great response we also were approached by a few retailers one of the key ones we work with is in san francisco called huckberry they saw the potential immediately some of the other more traditional retailers are much slower when it comes to trying something new we have had to plug away at that and thats what weve been doing for the last two and a half years we’ve been attending trade shows visiting with retailers letting them see that were still here still around now theyre finally committing we’ve just been picked up for next autumn by rei which is the biggest outdoor chain in north america we have a mirror operation in europe because im english and know the uk  european market we have a warehouse facility in california and a warehouse facility in southampton in the uk and dual websites a us website working in us currency that supplies north america and canada and one based in the uk which supplies the uk and europe whilst the websites were there originally for promotional purposes we also had shopify ecommerce shops attached to them and the online shops have actually been outperforming our expectations theyve been growing steadily which has been great it confirms what we thought that consumers like our stuff im not a retailer ive been a wholesaler for twenty years and so its been a bit of a learning curve but i think were doing a pretty good job of it thats one area once this financing goes through that well invest some money into and develop further who are your customers our customer according to google analytics is  abc relatively affluent disposable income travels has keen interest in outdoor pursuits whether that be hiking camping climbing surfing or skating very much an outdoor active person they want to be able to walk the dog go for a hike or go camping on the weekend throw the tent in the back of the pickup and drive off up to yosemite or wherever but then they could just as well wear the same shoes if theyre going out for dinner or down to the park or to the office its an all purpose product and thats what our customer wants they probably have a pair of keen or a pair of lowas or salomon or similar and then theyd probably have a pair of vans or converse for more casual wear i know when weve done photo shoots and on a couple of occasions we didnt have sizes for some of the guys they wore vans or converse and their feet got shredded just on a  mile hike they definitely need something as a result our product works very well for travellers we get quite a lot of gap year students who are in between from college to university who go off traveling for  months its perfect for them theyre going to backpack so they only want to carry one pair of shoes who are your competitors what do you understand that they don’t get brands like merrell north face timberland  new balance are offering something similar but they dont offer the same technical specifications that we do at the same price points from an entry level we offer water resistant products right the way up to our top of the range styles which are fully waterproof and breathable no one else really does that at our prices for that level of technical specification from other brands you start getting into price points which are double ours up in the  area within skate shoes and the lifestyle fashion market where a lot of my background is people are always looking for something new whereas traditionally in the outdoor market theyre not necessarily looking for something new theyre looking for something reliable that they know and they trust we want to give them both something reliable that they know and trust but that is also fashionable form and function why will you win theres always people that want to be different they dont want to have what everyone else has and those people always shy away from the big brands thats something which im very aware of from my days of working in skate and surf there are always people looking for something fresh bigger brands are copying our aesthetic but theyre not copying us from a performance point of view they have a boot that looks similar to ours but it just looks similar it doesnt have a waterproof breathable liner for example it doesnt have all the extra features that we throw in because they cant afford to do it the big companies need a bigger margin because theyre a bigger machine they have a wholesale margin that is probably  or  percent bigger than ours because they need that to pay for all the offices and all the staff stacy and i are both very keen on the performance of our footwear that’s one of the fundamentals of ridgemont fashionable but functional outdoor footwear we are constantly improving the product so were already on the rd version of a couple of the shoes because were finessing our offering nobody else really puts into outdoor shoes or sneaker boots the features that we put in for the price we sell for performance quality the materials  we use the same leather tanneries that the timberlands and the wolverines do similarly the factories we use also make for all the well known brands too they are all gold registered ecoenvironmentally friendly factories to make sure that they recycle repurpose and reuse wherever they can to protect the environment the factories are all clean tidy and a great working space they have to be like that because they have to compete with all of the electronics factories that are making for applesamsung etc to get the workers to come and work for the shoe factories they have to provide the same sort of environment can you talk more about the design and production process everything is made in southern china in gold rated environmentally friendly factories theyre in an area called dongguan which is a big shoe making area and also very big for electronics apple makes most of its products there the samsung factory is right around the corner from one of our factories there are all very good quality and reliable vendors the design is majoritively done by stacy with wholesale we would do two collections a year and work  to  months out now that were focussing on direct to consumer we can draw then sample a style and if we like to go straight to production concept to retail in less than  months its great to have that freedom to bring new styles to life so much quicker and not having to rely on the approval of the wholesale market before proceeding were now aiming to bring out new styles every  months weve got various silhouettes that are working for us so what we tend to do once we get a silhouette thats working well for example outback and monty hi then we go vertically where well do different materials different levels of waterproofness and that way we vary the price offering trying to offer lots and lots of different patterns is obviously expensive because you have lots of development and mold costs but taking one style that you know works and then offering a variety of colours materials etc is quicker and easier to execute how do you make money we aim to set our retail prices based on min x landed cost  landed cost for  retail  for  etc a  gross margin when were wholesaling were only going to be making around less than  before sales related costs volume discounts and trade shows etc so in effect we have to sell x pairs at wholesale to make the same amount of  profit as one pair at retail thats what is great about the economics with the direct to consumer sales its so much more profitable because were small were flexible and we can get the factories we work with to make as little as  pairs of a color for us whereas standard factories want  pairs as we grow and we order more we can increase our margins theres definitely scope we have a guy on the ground in china working for us he already knows he can get better deals he just needs to have volume coming through we also keep our overheads tight by using pl third party logistic warehouses so we dont have an ongoing large financial responsibility  we just pay per unit for them to pick and pack and store which is great it means when youre busy it costs a little bit more but when youre not busy its a lot cheaper you dont have a lot of staff sitting around running up a bill what ideas do you have for growth in the next  months  now that we are focussing on direct to consumer sales we are seeing steady growth in revenues sales for  doubled to  and q  was  up on q  we are focussing on digital marketing pr and print advertising to increase brand awareness and drive sales through our ecommerce site were upgrading our website constantly and introducing more and more retail features to increase conversion rates and drive sales in addition we are introducing new styles and products on crowdfunding sites like kickstarter and indiegogo this gives us an opportunity to test market reaction to products before committing to manufacture we have several new shoe styles some as collaborations with other brands to showcase plus luggage and accessory projects we expect to grow revenues to k in  and expand into other territories we already have a fledging following in europe but we hope to grow that more and more over the next  months once direct sales are m with a  margin then we will revisit wholesale we have good nationwide retail partners in the us that are interested in working with us once our awareness has increased and we already have international interest from distributors in europe asia  australia what’s next for your business why are you raising money now weve created the ridgemont brand and we know people love it when they find it the conversion rate on our website is over  we need to continue to increase awareness to drive more people to our site to do that we are investing significantly in digital marketing through facebook instagram  google as well as traditional pr activities and we have plans to do some print marketing with direct to consumer catalogues and event attendance at festivals etc in addition we want to expand the offering of styles and colours and materials of footwear and branch into luggage apparel and accessories to do both of these things we need to raise money some will go to fund production to be able to make ridgemont shoes and product to sell but the bulk of it will go into our marketing efforts what’s been your largest challenge so far the biggest headache has definitely been wholesale the retailers visit us and see the new products and say i love it but i just dont see a place for it in my store you tend to get an older senior buyer and then you get a younger assistant buyer the assistant buyer is all over us saying we should stock this and then the senior buyer is oh im not sure im not sure and then it doesnt happen thats been the frustration which is why it has led us to now focus on the direct consumer by appealing directly to the consumers who support us and we know love the brand we can sidestep the retailer who isnt willing to commit yet and bring ridgemont to its core fans this is an unusual fundraising strategy why have you given your customers the chance to invest online via wefunder the main reason is because obviously banks are very assetbased when they want to lend money which makes it quite hard as a small business because we dont have the assets to borrow against plus we know how much our consumers love what we do and we feel that theyll want us to succeed and if we can give them a good return on   or  or whatever they feel comfortable investing with us plus some great perks then they get the benefit of not just getting a great return but that theyve done something and helped a company and philosophy move forward can you tell us about the team im the presidentceo alex hall and then theres my cofounder stacy lowery hes the creative director hes responsible for new products and also the look and feel of the brand john lacroix is our digital marketing guru and stephen tims is our head of operations and handles all of the logistics and makes sure everything is where it should be and gets sent to the right people we also have carlos who despite his name is chinese and is based in dongguan in southern china he has  years of manufacturing footwear for lots of well known brands and handles all our production what keeps you up at night about the business the biggest frustration to date is that we havent progressed as quickly as i expected accepting that wholesale is going to take longer than we expected and instead concentrating on direct to consumer in the short term has definitely helped us move forward again once we have a solid base we can revisit wholesale and we will have more brand awareness and it will be easier to make it a success weve got something which we know is good everyone i share it with tells me its great and weve never had a bit of bad press we’ve maybe had  articles across loads of different publications that everyone tells us how wonderful the product is translating that from what we know is a great product into hard sales has been a big frustration but i am now confident we know our path and the recent changes are definitely paying dividends already what is your cash on hand and burn rate as of  march  the company had approximately k cash or cash equivalents and k of fully paid up inventory it operates at a run rate of approximately k per month read all answers view all questions ask a question risks specific to ridgemont outfitters  ridgemont already has revenue but not enough to cover existing expenses there are two revenue streams  wholesale sales to national  international retailers and distributors and  direct retail sales to ecommerce consumers through our website the gross margin on combined sales is close to covering expenses and an increase in revenue will make that possible there is a risk that sales will not grow enough to cover overheads  whilst wholesale sales are growing and ridgemont has attracted some good retailers to partner with from summer  there is a risk that product may not sell through instore as quickly as anticipated and retailers may choose other brands andor discount product to devalue the brands in addition there is also a risk that the retailers may fail without paying for supplied product ridgemont has an agreement in place with a new york based factoring company and intends to only supply retailers that it can credit insure to alleviate the risk of nonpayment  there are production risks that we will not be able to supply product to meet demand due to factory issues in southern china including poor quality and factories going out of business however the senior management have extensive experience of producing footwear  apparel in the area and in addition ridgemont employs a locally based agent who has  years experience in southern china footwear production  competition in the outdoor footwear market is strong and there are many well know established brands whilst ridgemont represents a different approach to technical outdoor footwear there is a risk that the established brands will copy its approach and use their larger distribution network and marketing power to force ridgemont out of the wholesale market however with the introduction of direct to consumer sales and marketing as well as the appetite to champion smaller brands among the public ridgemont should still be successful other disclosures read the form
