employees aum portfolio values historical f current portfolio holdings new positions sector weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by

hedge funds august   by faryan amirghassemi share tweet share  share hedge funds manager analysis manager monday hound partners stan altshuller chief research officer our latest manager monday digs into the public filings of hound partners discovering the source of their outperformance and latest trades in  jonathan auerbach struck a deal with tiger management and secured their blessing and a check from julian robertson to start his own venture he named the newly formed vehicle hound partners with his thenpartner scott mclellan who in  launched his own fund marble arch there is no doubt that auerbach has since earned his stripes currently hound ranks as the second largest tiger seed those managers seeded by tiger management with close to b in publicly filed market value early last year auerbach launched his longonly fund following in the footsteps of his tiger brethren the analysis in this post is very relevant to that fund in particular since it primarily speaks to skills and portfolio characteristics on the long side as usual for our manager mondays everything mentioned in this post is sourced exclusively from public data including the manager’s profile simulated performance and all other analysis and commentary the data used here omits the short side nonequity securities many nonus securities and all nonpublic information such as actual fund performance having said all that we present a detailed look underneath the hood of this highly successful manager with the detail and rigor we’re certain you haven’t seen before hound partners performance first let’s take a look at the simulated performance of hound’s long book hound outperformed the general markets by a wide margin with the majority of that outperformance occurring since  in fact since  the long book has returned  compared to  for the sp  the data also bodes well for the timing of the longonly fund that launched in january  since then the long book returned  compared to  for the market as expected the outperformance has a steady profile if viewed on a rolling month basis the manager outperforms by a moderate margin over long multiyear periods this is characteristic of a longterm fundamental longshort equity strategy versus a strategy that outperforms massively over short periods example hound partners asset growth with good performance asset growth often follows and this clearly has been the case with hound reported market value ballooned from just m in january  to nearly b today what does this asset growth mean in an earlier study we found that managers have three main levers to deal with large asset growth the main finding was that aum growth often leads to increased average market capitalization in manager portfolios increased position counts or declines in liquidity it can also be a combination of any of those three phenomena let’s test some assumptions on how asset growth affected hound partners’ portfolio starting with position count and concentration we might assume that hound put a lot of the new money to work in new positions thereby decreasing overall concentration of the portfolio the data shows quite the opposite position count dropped dramatically post crisis and has remained low since and concentration while always high has actually increased further since  it’s worthwhile mentioning that concentration has not led to higher volatility in this relentless bull market in fact the volatility of the portfolio has cratered this implies that the manager avoids something investors refer to as “diworsification” too many positions hurt returns and keeps just enough positions to control risk and downside volatility but not so much as to detract from returns let’s test another assumption perhaps the new money was invested in previously held names thus significantly driving down hound’s ability to liquidate their holdings turns out this is only partially true liquidity though slightly declined recently has remained healthy assuming hound is to sell no more than  of the  day average volume of all their stocks they can liquidate  of their book in  consecutive trading days better than average compared to  of the book they could liquidate back in january  peak liquidity for the manager and top quartile for all managers the only lever left is moving up the market capitalization spectrum so let’s test our final theory the next chart is that of their portfolio’s median market capitalization bingo the way hound dealt with the increase of assets is the way most managers deal with it they moved up the market cap spectrum the median capitalization of their stocks has increased from just b in  to b today this is partially due to organic appreciation of the names in their book as well as a conscious choice to invest in larger capitalized securities hound partners market capitalization it’s fair for investors to ask if this is an example of beneficial style drift or if they should be concerned data shows that midcaps are actually the sweet spot for this manager and that bucket has been increasing the most while large and mega are also solid sources of returns and alpha the manager is not losing anything by giving up on small and microcap names you can see this from the following charts showing the roic contribution batting average winloss and security selection skill for each bucket batting average – how often are you right  of  mega cap positions have had positive pl win  loss – how much you make when you are right versus lose when you are wrong undefined for mega cap since there are no losing positions average roic for the securities in each capitalization bucket cumulative contribution for each capitalization bucket security selection skill high in mid large and mega these charts show that the style drift in market cap if anything is actually beneficial for the manager and their investors hound partners sector allocation performing a similar analysis on sector exposures shows industrials healthcare financials and consumer discretionary make up  of long portfolio the manager has increased concentration in their top four sectors over the last few years but still keeps a generalist profile looking at a scorecard view of how their sectors performed since  we can see a great deal of skill in the largest sectors the winloss ratio in each is x above average and in financials it’s especially high top quartile below is the value generated by hound partners’ stock picking taking out the effects of the market and sector volatility again areas of strength are also areas of relatively high exposure healthcare financials and industrials this indicates that the manager has an understanding of their strengths and acts on them by allocating to sectors they are skilled at it’s also interesting to see strong skill in energy and it a historically underweight area for the manager hound partners position sizing one of the most valued manager skills often discussed by our clients is position sizing if you have followed our blog you know that many managers owe their success to being able to properly express conviction and size up their winners this is a common trait of the tiger cubs and hound is a prime example take a look at their portfolio compared to a shadow equally weighted portfolio rebalanced monthly we can clearly see that stock selection alone was not responsible for all the return in fact a portfolio of the same exact stocks but equally weighted would have underperformed hound by a whopping  percentage points since  part of the reason is that hound’s sweet spot position size bucket is quite large  –  they make  on the average winner for each dollar they lose on the average detractor in this bucket and a similar pattern can be seen on a pure roic basis as well hound partners positions now let’s shift gears for a minute and talk about actual positions that drove performance for the manager studying positions can yield significant insight into the investment process of the manager as we shall see by looking at the positions filed on  by the manager we can see that they have a lot in common with their tiger cub brethren their top position valeant is shared by nine other cubs and has been a favorite for other hedge funds including activists some other large positions like charter communications and fleetcor are high consensus names with the cubs in fact only  of the value of hound’s portfolio does not overlap with at least one other tiger cub you can see the unique and consensus stocks here high overlap to tiger cub consensus names is not necessarily a bad thing in fact those tend to be the names that outperform most often it’s the unique names that tend to hurt several tiger cubs you can read more on that in our study released last year over the last decade hound invested in just  unique securities with  contributing positive pl average and  of capital allocated to winners average as alluded to before it’s the winloss ratio that really shines for hound they get paid more on their winners than they lose on their detractors and consistently so below are the top contributors to hound’s pl over the last decade notice that there are eight names contributing over  basis points to their total pl – this is good diversification of returns the top winners come from different sectors also good to see for a generalist manager on the flip side only one detractor cost over  basis points petrohawk energy a name they sold in the first quarter of  and since then have done well in controlling downside for any one name hound partners’ largest positions and significant q trades since we have already processed all of the f data that came out last friday we can see hound’s most current public positions and largest trades of note is their initiation of a boxed position long equity plus a put in king digital the makers of candy crush saga for mobile platforms and their exits from salix pharmaceuticals sensata tech and frontier communications conclusion we have covered a lot in this analysis but to summarize the data shows that hound has been able to tap skill and change their investment process to better fit with the skill they have their position sizing stock selection and ability to reallocate amongst sectors has proven beneficial especially over the last five years learn more if you are

capital from tiger management founder julian robertson jr auerbach cofounded his firm with scott mclellan in  while working at tiger management in  mclellan left to launch marble arch partners with tiger alum timothy jenkins auerbach previously served as a senior analyst at ziff brothers investments before joining tiger management the longonly fund is no surprise to alpha readers we reported
