liability company law beware of the parent llc that owns a subsidiary llc beware of the parent llc that owns a subsidiary llc question  my accountant says that i should form a parent llc that will own subsidiary llcs to reduce the administration headaches and expenses  should i have a parent llc own three other llcs that each own a rental property answer  it depends on your risk tolerance a lot of people ask me what i think about the parent – subsidiary entity structure this structure exists when one llc the parent llc owns one or more other llcs subsidiary llcs most people understand that maximum asset protection requires that you put one real estate property or one business in an llc that owns no other property or operates no other businesses we all know what happens if you put all your eggs in one basket and drop the basket – you lose all your eggs the primary reason to put real estate properties and businesses in separate limited liability companies is so that a financial problem with one does not affect the value of any other properties or business there are several disadvantages with owning multiple entities they are more expensive to create and operate the administrative burdens such as bookkeeping and tax returns are multiplied you need a separate bank account for each entity multiple entities are more work and cost more than a single entity some people create a parent – subsidiary entity structure to reduce the burdens of owning and operating multiple limited liability companies the parent – subsidiary structure exists when multiple entities the “subsidiaries” are owned by a single entity the “parent” many accountants recommend the parent – subsidiary structure to reduce administrative burdens and costs some people create this structure when they own a lot of llcs that have rental real estate properties and want to have a parent llc that is a property management company the problem with the parent – subsidiary structure is that you are taking your carefully and expensively created separate entities that you formed to maximize asset protection and putting them all in one basket if a creditor sues the parent and gets a judgment against the parent the creditor can reach all of the parent’s nonllc assets but if the subsidiary llcs are arizona llcs the creditor can only serve a charging order on every subsidiary entity  the charging order would require the subsidiary llcs to make all future distributions of money or property to the creditor instead of to the parent llc you may think the risk of having a claim brought against the parent is low but it may not be for example if you are driving to meet a prospective tenant who wants to rent a home owned by llc  and you run a red light and kill or injure somebody you and the parent and llc  will be sued and you and the two llcs will be liable if the judgment exceeds the parent’s insurance coverage the creditor will take everything the parent owns until the judgment is satisfied if you are contemplating the parent – subsidiary entity structure you will have to decide which is more important i maximizing asset protection or ii minimizing administrative burdens or expenses ps if you do have a parent – subsidiary structure make sure that your insurance coverage is adequate share thisprintfacebookgoogletwitterlinkedin related posts olmstead vs federal

publish a notice in local papers indicating you have formed an llc your state may designate specific newspapers for these notices you have to pay to publish the notice and in some localities this can cost more than the filing fee form subsidiaries  form each of your subsidiaries by filing llc organization papers that list your parent llc as the owner of the subsidiary this will allow all profits from the subsidiaries to pass through to the parent llc and then to you without being taxed until you pay your personal income tax  examine the protections you have if one of the subsidiaries has a claim or judgment against it the parent llcs assets will not be in jeopardy the owner of an llc enjoys protected assets and in this case the owner is itself an llc  examine your liabilities if the parent llc has a claim or judgment against it the assets of the subsidiaries could be in jeopardy any action against the parent can legally go after the parent companys assets which in this case are llcs themselves tip instead of forming subsidiaries you can form separate llcs for each of your business interests they will stand alone and not have interrelated liabilities references
