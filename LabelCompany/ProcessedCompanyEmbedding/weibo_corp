these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive

the advertising spending of companies that market to chinese businesses and consumers social media is relatively new as a means of advertising and we compete for advertising budgets with a wide variety of traditional and new media we must compete effectively for users and for advertising and marketing customers in order to grow our platform and increase our revenues we intend to continue to invest in product development technology infrastructure and our sales and marketing capabilities to address the competition we face  major chinese internet companies including sohu netease tencent and phoenix new media as well as other microblogging services and new players in china who offer online media including content aggregation and distribution services compete directly with us for user traffic and user engagement content talent and marketing resources as a media platform in nature we also compete with offline media companies for audiences and content in addition as a form of social media featuring social networking services and messaging services we are subject to intense competition from providers of similar services as well as potential new types of online services including interestbased social products these services include mobile applications such as whatsapp line ozone wechat qq mobile kakao talk yixin laiwang douban and momo and websites such as renrencom we also compete with both offline and online games for the time and money of gamers we have begun to offer social commerce solutions to our customers that enable them to conduct ecommerce on our platform consequently our offerings compete with ecommerce platforms that enable merchants to conduct ecommerce including locationbased services and onlinetooffline services in addition to direct competition we face indirect competition from companies that sponsor or maintain high traffic volume websites or provide an initial point of entry for internet users including but not limited to providers of search services and navigation pages such as baidu inc and qihoo  technology co ltd we may also face increasing competition from global social media and social networking services such as twitter and facebook some of our competitors may have substantially more cash traffic technical and other resources than we do we also face significant competition for advertising and marketing spending a substantial majority of our revenues is generated from the sale of advertising and marketing services we compete against internet and mobile businesses that offer such services including sohu netease tencent baidu and youku tudou we also compete against traditional media outlets such as television radio and print for advertising and marketing spending some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product or service offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or services to gain a larger share of advertising and marketing budgets we believe that our ability to compete effectively for advertising and marketing spending depends upon many factors including the size composition and engagement of our user base our ad targeting capabilities market acceptance of our advertising and marketing services our marketing and selling efforts the return our customers receive from our advertising and marketing services and the strength and reputation of our brands we experience significant competition for highly skilled personnel including management engineers designers and product managers our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to retain our existing personnel and add additional highly skilled employees company description weibo is a leading social media platform for people to create distribute and discover chineselanguage content by
