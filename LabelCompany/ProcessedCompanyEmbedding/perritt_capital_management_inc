about itt stock  according to zacks investment research itt inc has a robust earnings surprise history having beaten estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters the company’s focus on business streamlining cost controls and efficiency continues to prove beneficial to its financial performance itt inc’s diversified operations across key end markets adds to its strength the company’s bottom line is expected to benefit from improved operating efficiency and successful cost containment actions further itt inc’s shares have outperformed the zacks categorized diversified operations industry average over the past year itt inc has achieved operational excellence through its lean six sigma program restructuring initiatives and global sourcing efforts however softness in industrial oil  gas markets and aerospace and defense business is expected to affect client spending adversely thus restricting the company’s growth to a great extent   ubs ag analysts commented itts process business performed better than we had expected in q but order declines accelerated to   sequentially which stands in contrast to other oil  gas levered companies we cover such as dov and emr which have started showing signs of improvement we think this has to do with itts lack of exposure to north american fracking as most of the companys upstream business  of total og is in latin america and the middle east management remains cautious on its ip outlook expecting oil  gas down ldd and chemicalindustrial pumps down hsd we think itt shares are pricing in a faster recovery for the business but there remains risk that the company could see a more protracted recovery than us competitors in our view   stifel nicolaus analysts commented a reasonable and we think modestly conservative guide here with the main swing factor being primarily in itts short cycle pump business which we think is more likely to be a bit better than a bit worse with some potential upside from increasing rig count in ics potential risks we see center primarily around rising input prices mainly steel and copper we believe ip and ics will likely bottom in  and while the voracity of any oil  gas recovery remains uncertain we expect significant growth in mt benefits from carryover cost savings and price pressures to abate well at least be less of a headwind to drive  eps growth in   who are some of itts key
