history main article history of wwe prior to titan sports main article capitol wrestling corporation wwes origins can be traced back as far as  when roderick james jess mcmahon and toots mondt created the capitol wrestling corporation ltd cwc which joined the national wrestling alliance nwa in  mcmahon who was a successful boxing promoter began working with tex rickard in  with the help of rickard he began promoting boxing and wrestling at the third madison square garden it was not the first time mcmahon had promoted wrestling cards as he had already done so during the s in november  mcmahon died and ray fabiani one of mondts associates brought in mcmahons son vincent james the younger mcmahon and mondt were very successful and soon controlled approximately  of the nwas booking largely due to their dominance in the heavily populated northeast region in  mcmahon and mondt had a dispute with the nwa over nature boy buddy rogers being booked to hold the nwa world heavyweight championship both men left the company in protest and formed the wwwf in the process awarding rogers the newly created wwwf world heavyweight championship in april of that year he lost the championship to bruno sammartino a month later on may   after suffering a heart attack a week before the match capitol operated the wwwf in a conservative manner compared to other pro wrestling territories it ran its major arenas monthly rather than weekly or biweekly usually featuring a babyface heroic character champion wrestling various heels villainous character in programs that consisted of one to three matches after gaining a television program deal and hiring lou albano as a manager for sammartinos heel opponents the wwwf was doing sellout business by  mondt left capitol in the late sixties and although the wwwf had withdrawn from the nwa vince mcmahon sr quietly rejoined in  capitol renamed the world wide wrestling federation to the world wrestling federation wwf in  titan sports inc golden age main article s professional wrestling boom vincent j mcmahons son vincent k mcmahon and his wife linda established titan sports inc in  in south yarmouth massachusetts the company was incorporated on february   in the cape cod coliseum offices the younger mcmahon bought capitol from his father in  effectively seizing control of the company seeking to make the wwf the premier wrestling promotion in the country and eventually the world he began an expansion process that fundamentally changed the wrestling business at the annual meeting of the nwa in  the mcmahons and former capitol employee jim barnett all withdrew from the organization mcmahon also worked to get wwf programming on syndicated television all across the united states this angered other promoters and disrupted the wellestablished boundaries of the different wrestling promotions eventually ending the territory system which was in use since the founding of the nwa in the s in addition the company used income generated by advertising television deals and tape sales to secure talent from rival promoters in an interview with sports illustrated mcmahon noted in the old days there were wrestling fiefdoms all over the country each with its own little lord in charge each little lord respected the rights of his neighboring little lord no takeovers or raids were allowed there were maybe  of these tiny kingdoms in the us and if i hadnt bought out my dad there would still be  of them fragmented and struggling i of course had no allegiance to those little lords mcmahon gained significant traction when he hired american wrestling association awa talent hulk hogan who had achieved popularity outside of wrestling notably for his appearance in the film rocky iii mcmahon signed roddy piper as hogans rival and then shortly afterward jesse ventura as an announcer other wrestlers joined the roster such as jimmy snuka don muraco the iron sheik nikolai volkoff junkyard dog paul orndorff greg valentine and ricky steamboat many of the wrestlers who would join later the wwf were former awa or nwa talent the wwf would tour nationally in a venture that would require a huge capital investment one that placed the wwf on the verge of financial collapse the future of mcmahons experiment came down to the success or failure of mcmahons groundbreaking concept wrestlemania wrestlemania was a major success and was and still is marketed as the super bowl of professional wrestling the concept of a wrestling supercard was nothing new in north america the nwa had begun running starrcade a few years prior in mcmahons eyes however what separated wrestlemania from other supercards was that it was intended to be accessible to those who did not watch wrestling he invited celebrities such as mr t muhammad ali and cyndi lauper to participate in the event as well as securing a deal with mtv to provide coverage the event and hype surrounding it led to the term rock n wrestling connection due to the crosspromotion of popculture and professional wrestling the wwf business expanded significantly on the shoulders of mcmahon and his babyface hero hulk hogan for the next several years the introduction of saturday nights main event on nbc in  marked the first time that professional wrestling had been broadcast on network television since the s when the nowdefunct dumont television network broadcast matches of vince mcmahon srs capitol wrestling corporation the s wrestling boom peaked with the wrestlemania iii payperview at the pontiac silverdome in  which set

origins can be traced back as far as  when roderick james jess mcmahon and toots mondt created the capitol wrestling corporation ltd cwc which joined the national wrestling alliance nwa in  mcmahon who was a successful boxing promoter began working with tex rickard in  with the help of rickard he began promoting boxing and wrestling at the third madison square garden it was not the first time mcmahon had promoted wrestling cards as he had already done so during the s in november  mcmahon died and ray fabiani one of mondts associates brought in mcmahons son vincent james the younger mcmahon and mondt were very successful and soon controlled approximately  of the nwas booking largely due to their dominance in the heavily populated northeast region in  mcmahon and mondt had a dispute with the nwa over nature boy buddy rogers being booked to hold the nwa world heavyweight championship both men left the company in protest and formed the wwwf in the process awarding rogers the newly created wwwf world heavyweight championship in april of that year he lost the championship to bruno sammartino a month later on may   after suffering a heart attack a week before the match capitol operated the wwwf in a conservative manner compared to other pro wrestling territories it ran its major arenas monthly rather than weekly or biweekly usually featuring a babyface heroic character champion wrestling various heels villainous character in programs that consisted of one to three matches after gaining a television program deal and hiring lou albano as a manager for sammartinos heel opponents the wwwf was doing sellout business by  mondt left capitol in the late sixties and although the wwwf had withdrawn from the nwa vince mcmahon sr quietly rejoined in  capitol renamed the world wide wrestling federation to the world wrestling federation wwf in  titan sports inc golden age main article s professional wrestling boom vincent j mcmahons son vincent k mcmahon and his wife linda established titan sports inc in  in south yarmouth massachusetts the company was incorporated on february   in the cape cod coliseum offices the younger mcmahon bought capitol from his father in  effectively seizing control of the company seeking to make the wwf the premier wrestling promotion in the country and eventually the world he began an expansion process that fundamentally changed the wrestling business at the annual meeting of the nwa in  the mcmahons and former capitol employee jim barnett all withdrew from the organization mcmahon also worked to get wwf programming on syndicated television all across the united states this angered other promoters and disrupted the wellestablished boundaries of the different wrestling promotions eventually ending the territory system which was in use since the founding of the nwa in the s in addition the company used income generated by advertising television deals and tape sales to secure talent from rival promoters in an interview with sports illustrated mcmahon noted in the old days there were wrestling fiefdoms all over the country each with its own little lord in charge each little lord respected the rights of his neighboring little lord no takeovers or raids were allowed there were maybe  of these tiny kingdoms in the us and if i hadnt bought out my dad there would still be  of them fragmented and struggling i of course had no allegiance to those little lords mcmahon gained significant traction when he hired american wrestling association awa talent hulk hogan who had achieved popularity outside of wrestling notably for his appearance in the film rocky iii mcmahon signed roddy piper as hogans rival and then shortly afterward jesse ventura as an announcer other wrestlers joined the roster such as jimmy snuka don muraco the iron sheik nikolai volkoff junkyard dog paul orndorff greg valentine and ricky steamboat many of the wrestlers who would join later the wwf were former awa or nwa talent the wwf would tour

origins can be traced back as far as  when roderick james jess mcmahon and toots mondt created the capitol wrestling corporation ltd cwc which joined the national wrestling alliance nwa in  mcmahon who was a successful boxing promoter began working with tex rickard in  with the help of rickard he began promoting boxing and wrestling at the third madison square garden it was not the first time mcmahon had promoted wrestling cards as he had already done so during the s in november  mcmahon died and ray fabiani one of mondts associates brought in mcmahons son vincent james the younger mcmahon and mondt were very successful and soon controlled approximately  of the nwas booking largely due to their dominance in the heavily populated northeast region in  mcmahon and mondt had a dispute with the nwa over nature boy buddy rogers being booked to hold the nwa world heavyweight championship both men left the company in protest and formed the wwwf in the process awarding rogers the newly created wwwf world heavyweight championship in april of that year he lost the championship to bruno sammartino a month later on may   after suffering a heart attack a week before the match capitol operated the wwwf in a conservative manner compared to other pro wrestling territories it ran its major arenas monthly rather than weekly or biweekly usually featuring a babyface heroic character champion wrestling various heels villainous character in programs that consisted of one to three matches after gaining a television program deal and hiring lou albano as a manager for sammartinos heel opponents the wwwf was doing sellout business by  mondt left capitol in the late sixties and although the wwwf had withdrawn from the nwa vince mcmahon sr quietly rejoined in  capitol renamed the world wide wrestling federation to the world wrestling federation wwf in  titan sports inc golden age main article s professional wrestling boom vincent j mcmahons son vincent k mcmahon and his wife linda established titan sports inc in  in south yarmouth massachusetts the company was incorporated on february   in the cape cod coliseum offices the younger mcmahon bought capitol from his father in  effectively seizing control of the company seeking to make the wwf the premier wrestling promotion in the country and eventually the world he began an expansion process that fundamentally changed the wrestling business at the annual meeting of the nwa in  the mcmahons and former capitol employee jim barnett all withdrew from the organization mcmahon also worked to get wwf programming on syndicated television all across the united states this angered other promoters and disrupted the wellestablished boundaries of the different wrestling promotions eventually ending the territory system which was in use since the founding of the nwa in the s in addition the company used income generated by advertising television deals and tape sales to secure talent from rival promoters in an interview with sports illustrated mcmahon noted in the old days there were wrestling fiefdoms all over the country each with its own little lord in charge each little lord respected the rights of his neighboring little lord no takeovers or raids were allowed there were maybe  of these tiny kingdoms in the us and if i hadnt bought out my dad there would still be  of them fragmented and struggling i of course had no allegiance to those little lords mcmahon gained significant traction when he hired american wrestling association awa talent hulk hogan who had achieved popularity outside of wrestling notably for his appearance in the film rocky iii mcmahon signed roddy piper as hogans rival and then shortly afterward jesse ventura as an announcer other wrestlers joined the roster such as jimmy snuka don muraco the iron sheik nikolai volkoff junkyard dog paul orndorff greg valentine and ricky steamboat many of the wrestlers who would join later the wwf were former awa or nwa talent the wwf would tour nationally in a venture that would require a huge capital investment one that placed the wwf on the verge of financial collapse the future of mcmahons experiment came down to the success or failure of mcmahons groundbreaking concept wrestlemania wrestlemania was a major success and was and still is marketed as the super bowl of professional wrestling the concept of a wrestling supercard was nothing new in north america the nwa had begun running starrcade a few years prior in mcmahons eyes however what separated wrestlemania from other supercards was that it was intended to be accessible to those who did not watch wrestling he invited celebrities such as mr t muhammad ali and cyndi lauper to participate in the event as well as securing a deal with mtv to provide coverage the event and hype surrounding it led to the term rock n wrestling connection due to the crosspromotion of popculture and professional wrestling the wwf business expanded significantly on the shoulders of mcmahon and his babyface hero hulk hogan for the next several years the introduction of saturday nights main event on nbc in  marked the first time that professional wrestling had been broadcast on network television since the s when the nowdefunct dumont television network broadcast matches of vince mcmahon srs capitol wrestling corporation the s wrestling boom peaked with the wrestlemania iii payperview at the pontiac silverdome in  which set an attendance record of  a record that stood for  years until wrestlemania  a rematch of the wrestlemania iii main event between wwf champion hulk hogan and andré the giant took place on the main event in  and was seen by  million people the mostwatched wrestling match in north american television history in  titan moved its offices to stamford connecticut before the present building was built nearby in  subsequently a new titan sports inc originally wwf inc was established in delaware in  and was consolidated with the massachusetts entity in february  new generation – main article monday night wars the wwf was hit with allegations of steroid abuse and distribution in  and was followed by allegations of sexual harassment by wwf employees the following year mcmahon was eventually exonerated but it brought bad public relations for the wwf and overall bad reputation the steroid trial cost the company an estimated  million at a time of record low revenues this helped drive many wwf wrestlers over to rival promotion world championship wrestling wcw including s babyface hero hulk hogan during this period the wwf promoted wrestlers of a younger age comprising the new generation featuring shawn michaels diesel razor ramon bret hart and the undertaker in an effort to promote new talent into the spotlight in january  the wwf debuted its flagship cable program monday night raw wcw countered in september  with its own monday night program monday nitro which aired in the same time slot as raw the two programs would trade wins in the ensuing ratings competition known as the monday night wars until mid at that point nitro began a nearly twoyear ratings domination that was largely fueled by the introduction of the new world order nwo a stable led by former wwf performers hulk hogan scott hall the former razor ramon and kevin nash the former diesel the attitude era – main article attitude era see also montreal screwjob as the monday night wars continued between raw is war and wcws nitro the wwf would transform itself from a familyfriendly product into a more adult oriented product known as the attitude era the era was spearheaded by wwf vp shane mcmahon son of owner vince mcmahon and head writer vince russo  ended with mcmahon facing reallife controversy following bret harts controversial departure from the company dubbed as the montreal screwjob this proved to be one of several founding factors in the launch of the attitude era as well as the creation of mcmahons onscreen character mr mcmahon prior to the montreal screwjob which took place at the  survivor series former wcw talent were being hired by the wwf including stone cold steve austin mankind and vader austin was slowly brought in as the new face of the company despite being promoted as an antihero starting with his austin  speech shortly after defeating jake roberts in the tournament finals at the king of the ring payperview in

league that debuted in  the league had high ratings for the first few weeks but initial interest waned and its ratings plunged to dismally low levels one of its games was the lowestrated primetime show in the history of american television nbc walked out on the venture after only one season but mcmahon intended to continue alone however after being unable to reach a deal with upn mcmahon shut down the xfl on october   world wrestling federation inc launched an initial public offering as a publicly traded company trading on the new york stock exchange nyse with the issuance of stock then valued at  million the company has traded on the nyse since its launch under ticker symbol wwe acquisition of wcw and ecw by the fall of  the attitude era had turned the tide of the monday night wars into wwfs favor after time warner merged with aol ted turners control over wcw was considerably reduced and the newly merged company announced a complete lack of interest in professional wrestling as a whole and decided to sell wcw in its entirety although eric bischoff whom time warner fired as wcw president in october  was nearing a deal to purchase the company in march  mcmahon acquired the rights to wcws trademarks tape library contracts and other properties from aol time warner for a number reported to be around  million shortly after wrestlemania xseven the wwf launched the invasion

and his wife stephanie mcmahon on may   the world wrestling federation announced it was changing both its company name and the name of its wrestling promotion to world wrestling entertainment wwe although mainly caused by an unfavorable ruling in its dispute with the world wide fund for nature regarding the wwf initialism the company noted it provided an opportunity to emphasize its focus on entertainment on april   wwe via the wwe corporate website announced that the company was ceasing use of the full name world wrestling entertainment and would henceforth refer to itself solely as wwe making the latter an orphan initialism this was said to reflect wwes global entertainment expansion away from the ring with the ultimate goal of acquiring entertainment companies and putting a focus on television live events and film production wwe noted that their new company model was put into effect with the relaunch of tough enough being a non–scripted program contrary to the scripted nature of professional wrestling and with the launch of the wwe network at the time scheduled to launch in  later pushed back to  however the legal name of the company remains as world wrestling entertainment inc brand extension original main article wwe brand extension in march  wwe decided to create two separate rosters with each group of wrestlers appearing on one of their main programs raw and smackdown due to the overabundance of talent left over from the invasion storyline this was dubbed as the brand extension beginning in  a draft lottery was held nearly every year to set the

sciences corporation the cardiac evaluations are handled by new york cardiology associates pc the wellness policy requires that all talent under contract to wwe who regularly perform inring services

professional wrestlers were suspended for violating the wellness policy after reports emerged they were all customers of signature pharmacy in orlando florida according to a statement attributed to wwe attorney jerry mcdevitt an eleventh wrestler was later added to the suspension list because of the wellness policy physicians were able to diagnose one of its performers with a heart ailment that

early s by homosexual wwf employees pat patterson terry garvin and mel phillips cole accused patterson of grabbing his buttocks as well as staring at his crotch and performing lewd sexual gestures cole also accused garvin of accosting him in a hotel room after his nineteenth birthday coles harshest allegations were direct towards former wwf ring announcer mel phillips cole claims phillips who during coles tenure with the wwf was the head of the ring crew would lure underaged ring boys into the ring and would begin to play wrestle with them during the play wrestling match cole claims phillips would wrestle you for five seconds then he’d grab your toes and pull your shoes off and he’d start playing with your toes squeezing them and stuff cole claims phillips did this to fulfill his foot fetish cole later reached a settlement with the wwf during the s and s dr george zahorian was thought to have routinely distributed steroids and other drugs to wwf wrestlers supposedly with the approval of wwf owner vince mcmahon in  mcmahon was indicted in federal court after the steroid controversy engulfed the promotion forcing him to temporarily cede control of the wwf to his wife linda

been fired after a violent confrontation with mcmahon nailz testified that mcmahon had ordered him to use steroids but his credibility was called into question during his testimony as he repeatedly stated that he hated mcmahon the prosecutions intended star witness was hulk hogan but this backfired when hogan testified that mcmahon never told him to take nor tried to sell him steroids the jury

 item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report our operations are organized around the following four principal activities media division network � revenues consist principally of subscriptions to wwe network fees for viewing our payperview programming and advertising fees television � revenues consist principally of television rights fees and advertising home entertainment � revenues consist principally of sales of wwe produced content via home entertainment platforms including dvd bluray and subscription and transactional ondemand outlets digital media � revenues consist principally of advertising sales on our websites and third party websites including youtube and sales of various broadband and mobile content live events � revenues consist principally of ticket sales and travel packages for live events consumer products division licensing � revenues consist principally of royalties or license fees related to various wwe themed products such as video games toys and apparel venue merchandise � revenues consist of sales of merchandise at our live events wweshop � revenues consist of sales of merchandise on our websites including through our wweshop internet storefront and on distribution platforms including amazon wwe studios � revenues consist of amounts earned from investing in producing andor distributing filmed entertainment corporate  other � revenues consist of amounts earned from talent appearances expenses are presented into two categories comprised of corporate support and business support corporate support expenses primarily include our corporate general and administrative functions business support expenses include our sales and marketing functions include our international offices and talent development function including the costs associated with our wwe performance center as well as business strategy and data analytics support table of contents results of operations the company presents oibda as the primary measure of segment profit loss as a means to summarize the oibda measure we also present total consolidated oibda divisional oibda for certain groupings of our segments discussed further below and oibda as a percentage of revenues the company defines oibda as operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding feature film and television production asset amortization and impairments as well as the amortization of costs related to content delivery and technology assets utilized for our wwe network the company believes the presentation of oibda is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view our segment performance in the same manner as the primary method used by management to evaluate segment performance and make decisions about allocating resources additionally we believe that oibda provides a meaningful representation of operating cash flows within our segments oibda is a nongaap financial measure and may be different than similarlytitled nongaap financial measures used by other companies a limitation of oibda is that it excludes depreciation and amortization which represents the periodic charge for certain fixed assets and intangible assets used in generating revenues for our business oibda should not be regarded as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance or to the statement of cash flows as a measure of liquidity nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap we believe that operating income is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to oibda see note  segment information in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of oibda to operating income for the periods presented we record certain costs within our corporate and other segment since the costs benefit the company as a whole and are not directly attributable to our other reportable segments these costs are presented into two categories corporate support and business support corporate support expenses primarily include our corporate general and administrative functions business support expenses include our sales and marketing functions our international offices talent development costs including costs associated with our wwe performance center and our business strategy and data analytics functions revenues from transactions between our operating segments are not material while the reporting of our financial results is done at a segment level we provide divisional subtotals for revenues and oibda for our media and consumer products divisions the media division is comprised of our network television home entertainment and digital media segments and represents the monetization of wwe content assets across various distribution channels the consumer products division is comprised of our licensing venue merchandise and wweshop segments which derive their revenues from the monetization of our intellectual property through royalties license fees and the sale of wwe branded merchandise we believe the divisional construct is relevant as we continually evaluate the best manner to exploit our content and intellectual property through various channels in a rapidly changing media landscape table of contents three months ended march   compared to three months ended march   dollars in millions
