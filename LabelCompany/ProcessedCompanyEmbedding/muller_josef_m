mueller who has a great passion for doing business in china and asia at large a proactive and entrepreneurial spirit pragmatic risktaking and a “can do” attitude with the ability to rapidly adjust to

high speed” he said “mainly due to china’s diversity and magnitude complexity and pace there really isn’t a previous model to follow getting information is one thing but what is essential is rapidly converting this information into meaningful knowledge and speedy actions as part of a sound and sustainable overall strategy i will try to provoke thinking in this regard” along with the research and teaching opportunities mueller will also help represent imd at a number of functions in asia including business forums and alumni events “i hope to bring asia and in particular china closer to imd
