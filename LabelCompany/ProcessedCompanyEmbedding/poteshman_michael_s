first quarter  conference call thank you it is now my pleasure to turn the conference call over to mr rick goings chairman and ceo please go ahead sir e v rick goings  tupperware brands corp thank you very much and thank you good morning everyone im in hainan province china in sanya here attending an important tupperware china event mike poteshman is there in orlando as well as james hunt our head of investor relations if for some reason we lose the connection here and that has happened before mike will pick it up on that end as usual were going to use some slides to go along with our prepared remarks and that begins with our comments on forwardlooking statements on slide two let me turn to slide three we are pleased to report that both the first quarter sales and eps came in above the highend of our february guidance in the quarter we saw continued strength of our businesses in brazil and china they were the real main contributors though im also happy to highlight the solid performance in a number of other markets tupperware mexico south africa united states and canada also there were other businesses in the portfolio sequentially that improved on their run rate and they also helped us take us to a number above the guidance range im going to touch on some of those in a moment but its good to see a number of markets moving in the right direction allin local currency sales grew  which was  points better than our february guidance and a  point sequential improvement for q after adjusting for the extra week also its really good to see that weve now raised our full year sales outlook by  point mikes going to get into that a little bit later emerging markets contributed twothirds  of sales in the quarter and grew by  in local currency while the established markets were flattish after a year of down  which was though sequential improvement compared to q as mentioned also in our february call at the onset of the year we communicated to all of our global management team somewhat of a call to action to see innovation with regard to new sales force expansion strategies and we spent a lot of time on that in december and january and im pleased to see that were off to a good start the sales force was at  million at the end of march and thats a  point advantage yearoveryear and a  point sequential improvement from q active sellers were down just  this also was sequential improvement again it seems like with all things ill let mike get more in detail on that and give you some insights continuing with our focus performing even better on the bottom line than the top line our adjusted eps came in at  which is  above the highend of the guidance and this includes  of foreign exchange benefit versus the february outlook and compared with  this was an  point increase in both dollars and in local currency so its a really nice strong start to  anyway let me go forward and drill down on some of the key drivers and turn to slide four in the americas our largest business unit brazil was up  in the quarter we already consider them bestinclass at sales force expansion however they continue to innovate with new strategies that really are helping generate a larger number of leads that they convert into sales force additions weve spoken before theyre consistent disciplined process to build their sales force and they really get this done by never taking the focus off monthly recruiting pushes also a highly successful approach like they use in brazil is now being migrated to other business units within the portfolio and the management team in brazil has also done a fine job of upgrading the process and getting productivity by utilizing more demonstration in selling and some new digital technologies on the recruiting side this enhanced approach in brazil involves giving prospects an opportunity to get into the business earn an easy commission if they share the product with five friends by simply passing along a video its almost breaking down the barriers to entry and if she meets this she then gets to join the sales force and she comes in she already has confidence because shes already tasted success so its more a question of sharing products with relationships than it is selling the approach accelerated the additions that were already at a high level and in fact during q brazil set alltime recruiting records they now have a  point sales force size advantage and this is also important they maintained an activity rate and that really illustrates the substance behind the overall approach including better onboarding of these new sellers and also better marketing and merchandising so theyre really converting new recruits very illustrative of where were going is also the use in brazil of digital strategies that really support the relationship selling that were doing and its helping us to build an effective contact platform and also giving her more business tools that support the women who are building businesses there in brazil turning to another strong performance the united states and canada  up in the quarter and that was good news which was on top of a challenging  comp in  in our last call i spoke with you about their powerful q recruiting well they correlate that into momentum and a good start to  through real coordination of the recruiting campaigns the sales force incentives and the product marketing program so theyve lapped the compensation program changes that was launched about a year ago and while certain segments of the sales force are still adjusting to the new standards and the new processes the successful recruiting activities in q and the  sales force advantage i think that should insulate the business against any turbulence as we continue to work our way through this conversion of a new and different kind of a compensation the comps in the back half of the year are a bit more challenging but we have momentum on our side and a strong leadership team let me turn southward to mexico tupperware mexico came in very nicely in q up  after a very modest q and it was really due to tough comparisons and shaky externals following the us election still they were in q up against really tough comps plus  in q  and yet they blew the doors off that management there did a great job activating the sales force and they really leveraged the whole theme of confidence becomes you that is a strong pillar of our brand especially there in mexico and they did a great job with regard to our onboarding activation and retention so theyve now got a nice doubledigit sales force size advantage and with negative externals in mexico seemingly settling down and the peso regaining some of its lost value we continue to have confidence in our growth opportunities for our mexican businesses now again talking about tough externals argentina continues to balance inflation related price increases against stagnation in consumer spending and consumption kpis were holding our own theyre still positive the management team is focused on maintaining growth and profitability q performance in our north american beauty business however wasnt good it was down i am pleased to say with fuller mexico yes it was down  and yet were seeing some signs that are really positive and precursors to what could be ahead very strong recruiting and even better retention rates and as a matter of fact they chipped away at a very strong doubledigit sales force size deficit to now the deficit is just  and now that were more active sellers reflecting the initiative to allow smaller order sizes and again breaking down the barriers to entry also underway in fuller are plans to expand the product line weve been really too narrow with our cosmetics fragrance and toiletry lines and were as much a channel there as we are a beauty brand and were expanding this really to meet the interests of our target consumers in mexico also we were very pleased to name a new managing director evaristo hernández who during his career had previously served as head of marketing in fuller there in mexico was also at one point head of sales and frankly a couple of years back we moved him to orlando and had him focused on global roles and we decided hey that fuller business needs what evaristo has with regard to a skillset so hes back there hes revitalizing his sales and marketing team and hes really focused on creating and executing we think dynamic strategies to regain the rest of the line that the fuller name should really carry our focus really there is enhanced morale expansion of the sales force and much more dynamic campaigns and hes experienced in doing this so were optimistic about the contribution fuller is going to make in the future yes theres work to do but sequential improvement every single month of the first quarter got better than the previous month so that really bodes well for our confidence beauticontrol it was an issue in the first quarter down  at present we are evaluating just what role beauticontrol will play in our overall portfolio going forward now i realize you may have further questions but at this point we are firm in saying thats all we have to say and all were willing to say as we go through this evaluation process turning our attention to asiapacific china has again led the way with an outstanding result up  in the quarter i spent all day doing business evaluation meetings with that management team here and tomorrow well have just under  of our studio leaders here the studio count is up to  and we really had to focus this last year of shifting to locations to larger and residentially sited studios and by the way so many people in china live in highrises thats the first thing that shocked me when i moved to asiapacific in hong kong in the late s theres a lot of land in china but everything in the west is mountains and no one can really live there so the cities are really highrise cities and where were moving to is having studios on the first floors of these highrise facilities proximity matters because of congestion even on this island hainan island that im on  million people live here so proximity matters so were focused on getting these studio locations better sited also in growing the studios membership base which is up  yearoveryear and while the majority of sales at the studios is really unique bigticket items very much like the water filtration system weve discussed in the past i am pleased to see and just reviewed it today a growing sales contribution coming from social media communication platforms mainly here in china its called wechat while you cant get facebook here and hardly can you get google and you cant get youtube wechat everybody has members can enjoy really relevant things on wechat recipes homemaking tips product offerings and it keeps our member base engaged and really builds big relationships promotional campaigns also via this ecommerce channel are designed to drive foot traffic into these studios for further demonstrations and for cooking class and the business is only beginning to realize its potential and ive been so pleased the last two years to see incredible productivity gains per studio and that means our studio leaders are really making money let me turn to indonesia a tough quarter but some improvement they were down  in the quarter this was sequential improvement versus q in our february call we cited a few elements that weve acted on to get this business growing at the rate were used to firstly our efforts to build team leaders under distributorships where they have separate meeting locations thats been in the past moving too slowly im pleased to say its picking up now were starting to grow the number of sites and that really helps grow the business were also adding diversity to the product line in the second quarter we moved forward on this initiative and youre going to see more in the months ahead we also are continuing to use more demonstration selling than weve ever done in the past in indonesia and as a matter of fact we now in our starter kits it includes demonstrable products one quick example of the recent campaign it really showed the sales force how to use our turbo chopper to demonstrate how to make a local salsa and its been very well received and importantly it gets our sales force comfortable with demonstrating products and that gets you away from other kinds of promotions that can impact margins finally the recruiting focus continues they have adapted to some of the style approaches that weve used in brazil its promising that the sales force deficit in indonesia has narrowed over these past three months from a deficit of  to just  so theyre really gaining on it still have work to do and by the way the timing of ramadan now its going to be in the second quarter as you know it moves each year that will be helpful and it may delay some of the full benefits of the heavy lifting our indonesian people have been doing but were optimistic that youll see more of this begin to pay off in the second half of the year also moderating their downside in the first quarter was india they were only off  and thats an  sequential improvement india is going to be a significant player in our long term plans with over  billion people despite the ongoing disruption with externals our management team have begun to really stabilize the kpis and you know that was really destructive the demonetization and it really didnt uncover anything we were talking to some members of management today from india and we believe all of the big money that they think was being hidden is still where it was in swiss bank accounts and this really largely impacted consumer spending that government policy i think india too has now got a good locked in expansion strategy using a lot of the best practices theyve learned from other markets so i think were going to see progress there before i move on from asiapacific let me also mention malaysiasingapore and the philippines each of these markets were up midsingle digits  in fact in malaysiasingapore they continue also to carry doubledigit sales force size advantage and that bodes well for momentum in the future they also have theyre a muslim country they see ramadan timing issues in q same as indonesia but like people said what does that impact well during ramadan people fast they have only one meal in the evening and that really does impact normal routines and schedules and then finally again philippines its good to see them on the grow weve got to work there very much like weve done with our fuller business though to offer a more differentiated product line because were very much a channel of distribution once you get outside metro manila finally let me turn to europe africa and the middle east segment as a whole was down  points were working very hard in this part of the world to modernize our business model including the conversion to more nonstocking distributors and that really does mean that less administrative responsibilities a better value chain and at the same time weve got to strengthen what our managers can earn in our february call we noted that germany had a good start in january however we didnt see that momentum continued through february and march although after being down double digit in q they had a point sequential swing in q but that still was a modest  increase and were hoping to see that get better theyre currently focused on building the sales force through these onboarding activation and retention strategies and that modernization contemporization is in effect as well in france really difficult quarter for a number of reasons some internal and some external they were down  points and some of this drag was related to the timing of easter in  where they benefited from earlier easter you ship in q set of products when it falls into q you dont get that most of it really though in france was related to lower productivity and the negative impact from changes we had to make in the compensation plan of team leaders frankly they implemented the wrong kind of a team leader compensation program more than a year ago recruiting though its nice to see picked up at the end of the quarter turkey i was there in march was also a drag in the quarter if any of you are reading any newspapers or the economist clearly the political tension youve been reading about is not helping our business there also ive got to say we did a price increase in turkey and we also modified the incentive standards during the quarter and looking back and this is the evaluation we just did we really could have executed this and handled it a lot better and it wouldnt have been so disruptive but ive got to say i was there in march i saw every one of the distributors and plus we had  of their dynamic managers and ive got to tell you in spite of what you may read about bedouin when you see the power of turkish women and their resolve their commitment and their passion i think everything is going to be fine lastly let me comment on south africa and i was just there  days ago outstanding performance up  in the quarter and now theyve got a  sales force size advantage and so theyve really done a fabulous job and theyre also getting these people onboarded and activated the right way as ive highlighted before one of the key drivers there is under distributors they have subdistributors which we call team leaders and this really is a low cost way for her to build a serious business and with  million people  million are black particularly the black south africans need and want an opportunity and the tupperware business opportunity is such a sweet spot and it resonates with them because the first place they really spend money is kind of on maslows hierarchy of needs – food clothing and shelter now as i said i was there  days ago saw the sales force theyre committed the dark cloud however ive got to say about south african is the zuma presidency protests were going on even as i was there even his own anc the african national congress party has lost faith in him he fired more than a dozen ministers over the last month and from the incredible leadership of nelson mandela to the brains of thabo mbeki who followed him now the country is in the hands of a zulu with a thirdgrade education and it doesnt bode well for the future of that country the strength though is theres enough good people there that therell be a change in some of these government policies going forward michael ill turn it over to you michael s poteshman  tupperware brands corp thank you rick rick has highlighted the units that most significantly moved our first quarter results versus  our sales were about  million over the highend of our guidance and the main upsides were in china and the united states and canada in both cases we had forecast good growth but at plus  and plus  respectively they did meaningfully better on the sequential improvement from the fourth quarter when we were down  in local currency sales without the extra week benefit as we had foreseen there were big contributions from indonesia and germany that rick touched on with some drag from brazil which is our largest unit and where we were up a great  in the first quarter but an even better  in the fourth quarter rick mentioned that weve assessed that about  point of our  local currency sales growth in the first quarter came from the net favorable impact of timing related to starting this year on january  compared with last year starting the day after christmas partially offset with easter and a promotional timing impact in turkey still the underlying trend was clearly much better in the first quarter than the fourth and better than we expected and this led us to increase our full year sales outlook range  point to plus  to  recall that this is net of having a  point drag on the full year comparison from having one less week in  than  looking at volume mix and price increase contributions to the  first quarter sales growth  points was from volume mix  points better than minus  from the fourth quarter without the week and  points was from higher prices compared with plus  points from price in the fourth quarter on the sales force statistics rick noted the nice  point improvement in the total sales force side comparison in the first quarter to plus  this came most significantly from good execution by tupperware south africa better retention in indonesia from improved onboarding and good activity with those added to the sales force in the fourth quarter and good retention by fuller mexico on the strength of better contact with the sales force members and from the initiative that will allow smaller orders to enable us to reach more categories of consumers the sequential improvement from minus  on the average active seller comparison in the fourth quarter to minus  in the first quarter reflected most significantly an estimated  point benefit from the flow of the weeks in light of the week in fiscal  meaning not having the week between christmas and new year in the first quarter average also contributing was a better sales force recruiting comparison in indonesia and the stronger promotional programs there together with the higher activity rate at fuller mexico also in connection with the initiative to open the gate to smaller sized orders consistent with what weve been seeing the main contributors of local currency sales being up  in the quarter with  less average active sellers reflected the terrific growth in china where we operate under the outlet model without a sales force the mix benefit from the fast growth in brazil that had largerthanaverage order size and the mid change in the sales force manager commission approach in india that has led to less splitting of orders and along with all of this the  point benefit from higher prices on slide six diluted earnings per share without items at  was  above the highend of the range which included a  benefit from strong foreign exchange rates the  local currency upside reflected the higher sales particularly as noted in china and the united states and canada on top of the sales upside in china the gross margin management and leverage on fixed costs came in better than we had foreseen unallocated corporate expenses were better than expected which we see as a timing benefit that will come back out as we move through the year against these upsides the profit comparison versus sales was poor in europe much of which related to the structure of sales offers and promotional spending in france in an effort to improve the top line on slide seven putting all of this together this meant that our pretax return on sales without items improved  basis points over   basis points more than had been in our outlook turning to gross profit and distribution selling and administrative expenses the gross profit percentage was good at  although  points below  half of this was from the mix impact associated with movements in fx rates with small ups and down accounting for the rest dsa was  basis points lower than last year coming in at  here there was a  basis point benefit from mix associated with fx the other  basis point improvement came most significantly from better net leverage on promotional spending coming from several of the units along with the offset from france already mentioned that dragged down the return on sales in europe on slide eight cash flow from operating activities net of investing activities came in at a  million outflow in the quarter a little lower than we expected and  million worse than last year reflecting timing differences in receivables and payables and higher cash taxes in connection with the fiscal calendar our outlook for the full year has come up  million in light of the higher net income outlook and now stands at  million to  million it continues to include  million of capital expenditures on slide nine turning to the outlook for sales and profit in the second quarter the  local currency sales growth at the high end of our range would put us at a twoyear stacked growth rate of  which is where we came in in the first quarter with the  increase on top of a  increase last year sequentially versus the plus  growth in the first quarter the plus  in the second quarter most significantly reflects good growth continuing in china but not at the  rate achieved in the first quarter net income without items at the high end of the range is up  about in line with the sales growth reflecting give back of some of the timing benefits in unallocated expenses from the first quarter and close to  million more in net interest expense against a relatively low number last year associated with  points on hedging activities on slide  pretax return on sales without items shows  basis points higher than the second quarter of  at the high end of the range for the full year the  point improvement in the sales range to plus  to  that again is after a  point drag from having one less week than  primarily reflects the upsides versus the first quarter guidance flowing through to the year the earnings per share outlook excluding items is up  to  at the high end reflecting the flow through of the  local currency upside from the high end of the first quarter guidance together with  of a lift from more favorable exchange rates that now put us at plus  on the full year comparison with  compared with minus  when we gave the previous guidance on february  this outlook continues to include unallocated corporate expenses in the low  million and net interest expense of  million finally on resin we foresee a full year impact of negative  million versus the previous outlook for a  million hit in cost of sales the first quarter included just a minor drag and the full year hit will come through about evenly in the second third and fourth quarters and so with that seneba will turn it over for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and our first question comes from the line of jason gere jason m gere  keybanc capital markets inc okay thanks good morning guys nice quarter a couple of questions i guess the first one ill lead off with is the balance this quarter between price and volume was a lot more balanced than i guess weve seen in the past couple of quarters can you just talk about pricing and what given that a lot of your currencies have actually started to move in your favor how much as the year progresses will the price roll off where are you able to get kind of price maybe through new innovation some of the products out there and how we should think about as we head to the back half of the year where theres some tougher comparisons just the level of volume kind of helping that versus maybe what pricing might be still in the plans for this year e v rick goings  tupperware brands corp jason rick hi ill answer the first part of that and mike you can cover what i havent covered the overall strategy firstly for the last couple of years jason is really to move more toward getting – not exiting food storage but as a category its the most commoditized category so even when we stay in food storage we go for more highly differentiated kind of food storage products like fridgesmart for example which almost doubles the shelf life of produce but – so thats been really the strategy to find more white space on products that are differentiated where its features and benefits enable us not to have pressures with regard to pricing china here is a case in point that my goodness were selling  per piece items in our studios here and still i think the number one in total dollar volume sales product we have globally is the water filtration at  a pop so the more we do that it basically insulates us some from whats happening with regard to competition in pricing pressure additionally i would say it also leverages the power of the earning opportunity i used to say to sell a  lipstick versus selling a  micro gourmet steamer takes about the same amount of time and she makes ever so much more so and then secondly to go with that features and benefits we had to get better at demonstrating and so the example jason i used in indonesia was with an herb chopper theyre selling the  or  product versus that they actually use shows  results versus a  food storage product so it is with regards to product differentiation this is the strategy of the company to move away almost in the way and mike ill turn it over to you almost in the way apple moved away from basically being laptops and desktops which both became commodities and moved toward these products that are   products where they dont have the same kind of competition so that is our strategy would you add to that mike please jason m gere  keybanc capital markets inc okay michael s poteshman  tupperware brands corp sure the mix benefits that rick is talking about help us in a couple of ways as it would relate to the volume mix and versus pricing one is the introduction of the more differentiated products where were having initial pricing that in concept might be higher than it was a year ago or not but its higher than the average price points in many cases and that really comes through in the volume mix and then the move towards more demonstration in our businesses also lead us to higher price point products that would come through in that portion of the split of our sales growth between price and then volume mix as it relates to the price component itself that you were asking about youll see as has been the case but youll see when our q comes out that our bigger pricing benefits came in the south america and the beauty north america segment and there we do continue to see some inflation so the overall price benefit in the first quarter here was  points it was  points in the fourth quarter i would expect that as we continue to price in line with inflation and think about where our businesses are that well just continue to see a contribution from price thats relatively modest so clearly the bigger swing this quarter versus last sequentially was the volume mix and thats what were looking to drive through a larger sales force jason m gere  keybanc capital markets inc okay and then maybe that will lead into my next question so i guess im just trying to think about the macro versus the micro so the micro seems to be a lot of the initiatives whether its the digital strategies or the onboarding is starting to take hold in a number of good markets and i guess im trying to think about the macro because as you see other multinationals out there emerging markets still seems like it hasnt really improved that much maybe not getting worse but maybe not getting that much better so this quarter you did  emerging markets growth albeit i think it was a year ago was very very depressed but how do you think about i guess one how the macros are kind of playing into your guidance for organic sales versus the micro and then secondly whether or not is it really more a midsingle digit type of emerging markets growth or do you think that highsingle digits can be sustained given both the macro and the micro that youre working on simultaneously thank you e v rick goings  tupperware brands corp ill handle again one part of that and michael you can handle what ive missed very interesting firstly with regard to shifts that i see macros that are happening so many people talk about china is china going to slow down they talk about now you know china had a as a country first quarter was  and what many people dont understand its  times a much larger economy than it ever then was a decade ago the other factor is and its interesting i was telling them before the call began were having this meeting here in sanya sanya most people on this call im sure have never heard of it before its in this hainan province hainan province is an island an hour north of hong kong and  million people live here its resort kind of property im at an mgm grand here and i was interviewing the hotel manager yesterday and this just helps jason as far as whats going on in some of these macros in some of these kinds of markets i said my god this – the average entrée of lunch is  who can afford this and he said all of our customers are basically chinese we get about  europeans a month well i said well who can afford this and we discussed we said  of the chinese have money but when you go  times  billion thats  million people there and thats who loves our products and the other thing thats helping us so much in many of these markets if somebody turned the clock back to  and who sold tupperware it was – now it was my mother it was somebody who wanted to earn parttime money the family wanted a second car she maybe worked she was rosie the riveter during the war but thats who sold tupperware who now is selling and who i will be seeing tomorrow in there she is yearsold shes got a college education she wants to do this because shes an entrepreneur and she doesnt want a regular kind of a job i see the same thing  days ago in africa i see the changing face of our sales force and that sales force sells to their friends neighbors and relatives who reflects them which this enables to your first question them to sell higherpriced products where use shows results i think this is going to be in our benefit in not only china but in emerging africa in indonesia and if they ever get their act together in the country in india the problem with india versus china too much democracy nothing is standardized and if somebody wants to say whats the secret to china china is just a big singapore and theres hardly a country in the world you can visit where they dont have drugs they dont have crime its cleaner now it is a benevolent dictatorship to speak of but it works with that centrally planned economy so mike you carry it back to the other less esoteric comments michael s poteshman  tupperware brands corp yeah jason youve heard us say before probably when we think about micro versus macro that fortunately in our kind of a business where were goto with the sales force that we can you know macros matter and they are better sometimes and worse sometimes but our goto strategy and the things that make that up allow us to do well in any reasonable set of external factors and i think were continuing to see that so if you look at the big drivers in the first quarter they werent all good but we did very well in brazil where the externals are not great china where the externals are pretty good but theres some pressure on consumer spending we did much better in tupperware mexico very well in south africa where the externals arent necessarily great either but on the other hand we were down at fuller mexico and although better than the fourth quarter also down in indonesia so we talk a lot and you heard rick talk today about the things were doing in the markets that were not doing well as well as we would like and that goes to this push aspect and the levers that we have so i think the story continues that the things that were doing on the micro level matter more in our business than macro but theyre related and the things we need to do micro are related to whats going on in the macro and we certainly dont live in a vacuum in terms of how do we think about the  growth in the emerging markets in the first quarter and how we flowed that while we dont make an explicit split in the way we give our guidance the high end of our range for the full year is at the  and we were up  in the first quarter so we tend to see that we – when we look out at our very fast large growing markets we dont necessarily always see those trends continuing as strongly and the one thing that i noted in the prepared remarks was that sequentially in the second quarter were still projecting very good growth in china but not at the  that we had in the first quarter so we would expect to see some of that but sometimes were pleasantly surprised as you know and can have an extended run in some of these big emerging markets where were just really able to go on all cylinders jason m gere  keybanc capital markets inc okay and if you dont mind i am just going to squeeze in just on that last point you were saying just like last quarter i think you talked about january being off to a strong quarter just wondering if there was any type of color you can provide on april i know you did say that there was like a pull forward you saw in the first quarter but i was just wondering if theres any change that youre seeing in terms of april versus how maybe the first quarter ended thank you very much michael s poteshman  tupperware brands corp yeah i guess i would characterize it that were fine with how we started in april there is not so much of a pull forward having to do with the weeks but theres the easter impact and exactly how that flows through in different of our business units so we certainly considered the first couple of weeks that we had visibility on on studying the  to  range that we gave for sales in the second quarter so were always going for the high end jason m gere  keybanc capital markets inc great thank you very much guys operator and our next question comes from the line of beth kite with citi michael s poteshman  tupperware brands corp hi beth operator beth your line may be muted beth n kite  citigroup global markets inc apologies good morning  i wanted to just first touch on brazil and china i think when rick spoke about brazil he described some sharing tactics kind of newly deployed for direct sales could we just go back to that and explain that a bit more michael s poteshman  tupperware brands corp sure i think what youre referring to and what rick was referring to is in our monthly recruiting push approach that weve been under there actually every four weeks weve extended that with something called the tupperware challenge where the prospective sales force member can forward a video of a product demonstration and if shes able to sell five products enter the sales force in that way so shes contacting the people in her social media circle and leveraging the demonstration video to get started in the business is that what you think you were referring beth n kite  citigroup global markets inc yeah that helps its kind of a preemptive measure before you officially kind of sign on as a sales force member is that a way to think about it michael s poteshman  tupperware brands corp i wouldnt call it preemptive but its a way to engage so the brazilian team does a great job of generating a huge number of leads with this what we call the dday recruiting approach so really whats going on in that dday is everybody is out from the people in the office symbolically and the people in the large sales force and really knocking on doors contacting people they know and generating leads that we then look to bring into the sales force over the coming weeks and one way that were now doing that is through this tupperware challenge which is a way for these prospects to engage in the business by selling product through this demonstration to their friends neighbors and relatives through this technological way beth n kite  citigroup global markets inc got it okay thank you and then for china apologies if i missed it but was there a number of studios cited this quarter and sort of how does that change yearoveryear and quarter over quarter and then for the full year what growth of studios are you forecasting in china i understand that theres a lot of great productivity growth going on but im just curious as to the extent of new studios you might see there michael s poteshman  tupperware brands corp so the numbers going to be e v rick goings  tupperware brands corp mike can handle the first part of that because – yeah i think the number on the quarter was up  wasnt it mike michael s poteshman  tupperware brands corp yeah up  to  thats right e v rick goings  tupperware brands corp yes but what we were really doing this last year was while the focus has been on expansion of sites over the previous years we really got going here about the year  where the business really started to have this model and move forward and i think weve had a plus cagr since then but it was grow the number of sites it was the first thing we really worked on last year there was a shift and the shift said two things number one we shift from some of these somewhat remote locations to more a city location where it was on the first floor of that high rise so that said take some of the focus on just growth of number of locations but just for now because i look at the numbers over the last four years and theyre printed doubledigit growth per year in the number of locations but in  and  it was more a shift in where these are located and what were seeing two things that have happened with that that confirmed that it was the right thing to do the success level of new studios has gone way up and secondly this incredible increase in the productivity for us to be up what  michael in the quarter and only  were same studios that says wow this was the right decision but expansion is still the idea going forward weve said in the past theres the opportunity for  locations i looked at the numbers today we may not have to get there if were building units that are as big as these are right now and productive we may only need  to  to get full access to the consumer base beth n kite  citigroup global markets inc terrific thats super helpful thank you i just had one last question then on the beauty business understanding that some of the beauticontrol is under review for the fuller business where youre seemingly kind of doubling down on that with new management and some new strategies sort of how will that impact profitability here in  sort of how long do you envision the timeframe to be before you can potentially turn the sales in the fuller mexico business e v rick goings  tupperware brands corp well im going to be disappointed personally ive been deeply involved in fuller over the last number of months and michael and i and luciano garcia made the decision that lets send evaristo there that was a question of sending one of our more seasoned leaders who knows this business doubling down is not a bad way to put it either its that its so damn good a business the brand name is so well known that this last couple of years have been really difficult with the business and i think part of the culprit was us that we got too purist in our product approach so focused on higher priced cosmetics fragrance and toiletries that we missed some of the other categories that would enable her to get a higher average order and we started to sit there and say hey were one of the leaders in that market lets start acting like it and so weve got a threefold strategy that i mentioned basically its morale coverage and campaign energy coverage means expanded sales force and every one of the associates down there has a little signal of a gold flame on their lapel and it talks about a proud tradition and an even brighter future so were actually quite charged about whats ahead for us competition is having a very difficult time down there now back to your question again im going to be disappointed if you dont see progress in the second half of the year in fuller its a very profitable business but we were used to the first five years we owned it getting a what michael a  ros we used to talk about it really and i want to get back to those kinds of – i want to get a top line there that is in the mid to high singledigit and a doubledigit ros and its a good place to win and we know that business beth n kite  citigroup global markets inc terrific thank you all so much operator and our next question comes from the line of frank camma with sidoti frank camma  sidoti  company llc good morning guys michael s poteshman  tupperware brands corp hi frank frank camma  sidoti  company llc hey rick i didnt hear you talk much or maybe i missed it specifically on tupperware north america i mean granted its a smaller part of the business but specifically in the us given the increase there and the challenge for just direct selling as a whole can you talk a little bit about that like what may have impacted the results there e v rick goings  tupperware brands corp yeah frank first of all good to talk to you ill tell you whats happening there weve got an incredible leadership team there they have gone through the challenge of contemporising the business and that includes not only leveraging new technology out there theyre probably the most in connected with the sales force of any of our businesses worldwide they have a thing called tupper tv i mean tens of thousands will be connected to that internet television channel and weve got dynamic leadership there and we not only do training but product promotions so if somebodys running a little distributorship in whitefish montana she feels connected right to headquarters right to stein ove right to the head of marketing and sales when were holding big events those things are broadcast everywhere so all members of the sales force can do it theyve moved the compensation program away where basically legacy kind of people could sit on kind of back and talk and check what they did in the past what theyve got to do is be really building new leaders for the future and the management team has done a wonderful job of executing on this were lapping these changes some of the people didnt make the changes but the new ones who are so excited about it are out there and theyre filling the gap and were getting doubledigit increases and the other thing i talked about it earlier youre seeing the shift of whos coming in to sell tupperware and to build the tupperware business shes younger she wants to be an entrepreneur the barrier to her needing resources isnt there anymore we bring her into orlando we train her how to do it and she goes back and builds her business and every time we see the groups come in who are being trained as the new field sales leaders theyre getting younger and younger and theyre more entrepreneurial so its a fabulous transition as a matter of fact theyre doing so well with it that we had stein ove and the management team bring in four of our managing directors from europe to sit there and show them heres what can happen in a market where many directselling companies in the us are having issues and almost no one is having doubledigit increases frank camma  sidoti  company llc right right okay thats all i had thanks guys operator and our next question e v rick goings  tupperware brands corp mike would you add anything to that michael s poteshman  tupperware brands corp no operator and our next question comes from the line of olivia tong with bank of america olivia tong  bank of america merrill lynch great thank you i just want to talk a little bit about the sales force because you obviously accelerated that total sales force number nicely this quarter but what are you doing differently to ensure better conversion to actives because weve had times in the past where youve managed to accelerate that number and then it will last for a quarter or two and then it sort of decelerates again without really making too much of a needlemoving moment on actives so that would be my first question thank you michael s poteshman  tupperware brands corp well i mean certainly olivia youve heard us talk about onboarding is key for us i would say broadly and thats meant to change things over time from where weve been in the past by being more consistent with the approach more thoughtful that were getting it right marketbymarket and that were importantly coming up with training and communication tools that give it depth and consistency so that should help us get more people started through the activities that will allow them to do well in their business better and then that will lead to some longevity and when youre going up against  million or so sales force additions per year that can pay off very well in terms of some of the specifics in the quarter fuller mexico made a nice contribution in terms of the total sales force size comparison so were still not at plus but we were better than we had been and also on actives and that reflected in part the strategy to broaden both our product line to start to move towards more categories although thats early in execution still but also to allow for smaller order sizes to be able to address more of the sales force population and also on the consumer side so that should be the sort of thing that could continue well a couple of the other places where we had nice netadditions were in south africa and thats really good execution in that business weve been able to grow the leadership part of the sales force and so that sort of thing should have longevity indonesia as well and frankly that was reflected a lot these activity driving programs at the beginning of the quarter that really helped us maintain connection with the fourth quarter recruits that we talked about in our prepared remarks so thats the kind of the thing where you do have to see if you can activate them again in the quarter and its not just that fourth quarter group theres a group in the first quarter as well so its not like you only have one chance but thats one of the places where you can see more volatility and then in india while the comparison is not great after the change in the direct selling regulations its starting to flatten out a bit and so thats another element thats hit us pretty significantly over the last few quarters in terms of a drag that should straighten itself out so i realize those are specifics to this quarter but those are the sorts of things that we have where there should be elements in our business that have legs and longevity to them but youre right there are cases where theres more volatility and ups and downs in particular business units olivia tong  bank of america merrill lynch got it thanks and then just can you talk a little bit about the improvement in the selling and admin expense just to sort of parse out the key drivers because thats obviously been pretty decent over the most recent two or three quarters and specifically in terms of two regions europe youve talked in the past about the need to cut overhead and so specifically in that market where do you stand on that and then north america how much of that improvement in the margin is a function of changes in strategic spend and then also is your average sales force member are they making more or less than they were a year ago michael s poteshman  tupperware brands corp okay theres quite a bit in there but the  basis point improvement that we had in dsa in the first quarter you heard  basis points came from mix and what we mean by that is we have different expense characteristics and returns on sales in different of our business units and as the fx moves that can move the percentage because sales is hit in a different way or benefited in a different way than the profit and so we got a  basis point improvement from that which is nice youve heard us talk the last few years about drag the biggest impact more operationally was better leverage netnet on promotional spending and that as we know and you know is an important element for us because we do spend a lot on promotions and we should the key is to get the right kind of leverage out of them and so in the places where we got the good growth we did tend to see good leverage on that spending and you would expect that but then in some of the other places we were able to do a better job on a casebycase basis in terms of north america specifically we did get good sales growth there so there was a scope for volume leverage we did see in mexico some drag from the cost of resin because its priced in dollars and then the peso although its improved since the election has been down yearoveryear so thats on the gross margin line theres been some drag there in terms of changes to the business models in europe we have taken some steps there but clearly theres more to do and its not kind of a global or one thing that were doing so its more businessbybusiness unit and then as well as in some of the admin centers in the supply chain so its fairly broad based and has initiatives that are moving at different speeds so if you look at what we said in terms of guidance for this year its not that we baked in a huge improvement this year olivia tong  bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you very much operator and there are no further questions at this time michael s poteshman  tupperware brands corp okay i understand that rick fell off from china so i will just close by saying
