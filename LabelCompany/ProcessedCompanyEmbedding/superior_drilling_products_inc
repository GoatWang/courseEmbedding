goals important highlights included we addressed the measurable increase in demand and demonstrated the significant leverage gained on that volume our dpm optimization design programming and machining contributed to this ability to ramp up as rapidly as we did the value of our drillnream is being realized by a continually growing number of operators with more beginning to use multiple tools of various sizes on a single well in their drilling processes the tool improves penetration rates helps rotary steerable systems around the curve and off bottom reduces shock and vibrations thereby improving mwd measurementwhiledrilling tool life we commercialized the coiled tubing strider cts that incorporates our patented stridertm oscillation system technology while revenue was modest and costs are still high market reception has been very positive our review of market channel opportunities for the cts is advancing as we also consider interim approaches to getting the tool to market we continue to advance the open hole strider with innovative materials that can withstand abrasive drilling fluids we expect to commercialize this tool later in  we are very encouraged with the reception of the technologies we have brought to market and believe in time there will be additional solutions we can develop to advance drilling efficiencies”first quarter  financial summary  in

services are the inhouse units at hughes christensen the division of baker hughes responsible for drill bits however our competitive advantage is demonstrated by both our significantly superior production times according to reports we have received from baker hughes regarding their inhouse production times as well as our client’s continuing requests for us to take over or manage the work currently being done by those inhouse units other drill bit manufacturers also have inhouse remanufacturing units but they are not our competitors since we have an exclusive contract with baker hughes drill string tools the primary competitors for our drill n ream tool are several singlesection reaming tool manufacturers including baker oil tools a division of baker hughes nov and schlumberger each priced between  –  per unit on a rental basis for each run however we believe that the drill n ream tool is the only dualsection or dual cutting structure drill string reamer on the market today it is priced at  to  per unit per run with most runs extending for five to ten thousand feet we believe that distinction will allow us to continue building on the drill n ream tool’s firstmover advantage once we complete our acquisition of hard rock upon closing of this offering we believe that our other pending drill string tools are at the forefront of drill string tool technological development for horizontal drilling consequently potential competitors who may be developing similar technology are currently unknown there are existing tools that would compete with the drill string stimulation tool such as the agitator tool marketed by nov however we believe our technology in the drill string stimulation tool offers significant advantages over the agitator and we believe will be rapidly accepted in the drilling market company description we are an innovative cuttingedge remanufacturer of pdc polycrystalline diamond compact drill bits and a designer and manufacturer of new drill bit and horizontal drill string enhancement tools for the oil natural gas and mining services industry we currently operate four basic lines of business  our pdc drill bit remanufacturing service exclusively for baker hughes  our drill n ream tool division that will be merged with hard rock solutions llc “hard rock” and serve as our drilling tool marketing and distribution arm after our pending acquisition of hard rock upon closing of this offering  our emerging technologies business that manufactures the drill n ream tool our new drill bits custom drill tool products to customer specifications and our innovative pending drill string enhancement tools and  our new product development business that conducts our research and development and designs our new drill bits horizontal drill string enhancement tools other downhole drilling technologies and drilling tool manufacturing technologies from our headquarters in vernal utah we operate a technologically advanced pdc drill bit remanufacturing facility as well as a stateoftheart hightech drill tool machining facility we manufacture our drill string enhancement tools including the patent pending “drill n ream” well bore enhancement tool and conduct our new product research and development from this facility we believe that we continue to set the trend in oil and gas drill bit and drill string tool technology and design our cofounder troy meier developed the first commerciallyviable process to remanufacture pdc drill bits after a successful year career with a predecessor of our largest client baker hughes the world’s fifth largest oilfield services company for the past  years we have serviced the rocky mountain california and alaska regions exclusively for baker hughes’s substantial oil field operations we continuously work with our customers to develop new products and enhancements improve efficiency and safety and solve complex drilling tool problems we employ a senior work force with special training and extensive experience related to drill bit remanufacturing and tooling manufacture they produce our products and services using a suite of highly technical purposebuilt equipment much of which we design and manufacture for our proprietary use most of our manufacturing equipment and products use advanced patentpending technologies that enable us to increase efficiency enhance drill bit integrity and improve safety recently challenging new horizontal oil and gas well designs and construction have substantially increased the technical demands on drill bit and drill string components to respond to this horizontal drilling challenge we collaborated with hard rock solutions inc “hrsi” hrsi designed the drill n ream well bore conditioning tool in  “drill n ream” the drill n ream tool is a dualsection reaming tool which is located behind the bottom hole assembly “bha” of the drill string to smooth and slightly enlarge the well bore in the curved and horizontal sections of horizontal wells in both oil and water based mud the drill n ream tool is available in multiple sizes and can be custom manufactured to fit any hole size the drill n ream tool allows the drill string to move through a conditioned well bore left by the drill bit with less friction and material stress extending the horizontal distance that can be drilled during a run and making tripping removal of the drill string and the running of casing in the completed well much easier each time a drilling operator has to retract a drill string and replace a bit or other drill string component it costs the operator substantial time and money so we believe anything that allows each run to extend further is of great value to our customers as a result the drill n ream tool is now in use in over  well drilling operations which we believe indicates significant initial industry acceptance in a fairly short period of time we are also developing a suite of other horizontal drill string tools each of which addresses a different technical challenge presented by today’s horizontal drilling designs under our existing agreement with hrsi we produce the drill n ream tools and hrsi markets them to well operators on a rental basis this arrangement allows the well operator to switch out drill n ream tools when theirs becomes dull and hrsi then returns the dull tools to us for refurbishing we now have the opportunity to purchase hrsi’s interest in the drill n ream tool rental business including the drill n ream inventory rental arrangements customer lists contract employees facilities and its owner’s  interest in the patents pending relating to the drill n ream before closing our acquisition hrsi will move those assets into its whollyowned subsidiary hard rock solutions llc we intend to use a portion of the offering proceeds to complete our purchase of hard rock at which time we will operate hard rock as our whollyowned subsidiary we believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competitors on the basis of the quality and reliability of our products and services our proprietary technology and our ability to rapidly respond with products that meet the most demanding and
