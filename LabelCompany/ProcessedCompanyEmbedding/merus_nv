merus pipeline are based on the biclonics® format biclonics® are bispecific full length human igg antibodies with its proprietary technologies merus is able to rapidly generate lead product candidate biclonics® with the potential to produce tumor cellkilling activity with the same or potentially better functionality as combinations of conventional monoclonal antibodies furthermore because biclonics® are based on the robust and proven igg format they are manufactured using industry standard processes yielding the predictable in vivo behavior associated with conventional therapeutic antibodies such as long halflife and low immunogenicity biclonics® unprecedented antibody functionality in a reliable and manufacturable format a suite of technologies merus exploits a suite of technologies integrating the generation of large panels of high quality human antibodies and their rapid conversion into thousands of biclonics® ready for functional screening in clinically relevant assays human antibody generation merus uses its proprietary transgenic mouse memo® and stateofthe art phage display libraries of human fab fragments for the generation of panels of common light chain monoclonal antibodies large and diverse panels of high affinity antibodies have been generated against a broad variety of targets biclonics® format merus has successfully modified the ch constant region of the igg antibody isotype to efficiently drive heterodimerisation and production of stable biclonics® by eukaryotic cells the biclonics® format retains several of the favourable attributes of the standard human therapeutic igg antibody format including stability long halflife and low immunogenicity biclonics® highthroughput functional screening the panels of targetspecific human antibodies are combined with the modified constant regions and introduced as pairs of dna constructs into eukaryotic cells the common light chain format and engineered ch domains ensure the secretion of pure functional biclonics® into the cell culture medium the medium of thousands of cell cultures is harvested and used in cell and tissuebased functional assays the merus technology platform allows for functional evaluation of biclonics® in the relevant therapeutic format leading to the discovery of therapeutic candidates with differentiated properties news merus announces first quarter  financial

berlin  utrecht the netherlands june   globe newswire  probiogen ag and merus nv nasdaqmrus today jointly announced that merus has signed a commercial multiproduct license agreement for probiogens glymaxx ® adcc antibodydependent cellmediated cytotoxicity enhancement technology under the terms of the agreement merus has obtained nonexclusive use of glymaxx ® technology for merus biclonics ® pipeline of bispecific cancer antibodies to enhance their adcc activity financial details of the license agreement were not disclosed mcla is the first glymaxx ®modified adccenhanced bispecific antibody being developed under this commercial license mcla is being developed as a potential treatment for colorectal cancer and other types of solid tumors the compound is designed to bind to cancer stem cells that express egfrs epidermal growth factor receptors and lgr leucinerich repeatcontaining g proteincoupled receptor  merus had previously utilized the glymaxx ® technology for its lead candidate mcla which is designed to bind to her and herexpressing solid tumors merus reported interim clinical data from an ongoing phase  clinical trial for mcla in april  these data included a favorable safety profile and early signs of antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors we are pleased that merus is again collaborating with probiogen for development of their promising antibody cancer therapy mcla said dr wieland wolf ceo of probiogen merus biclonics ® platform represents an encouraging approach to the killing of cancer cells and we believe that biclonics ® utilizing our enhanced adcc technology hold great promise in potentially transforming the cancer treatment paradigm   probiogens glymaxx ® technology is proven to increase an antibodys ability to bind to cellular targets resulting in greater cellkilling proficiency said ton logtenberg phd chief executive officer of merus we are eager to advance development of mcla utilizing this exciting technology and we plan to file an ind with the fda by the end of next year at the same time we are continuing to advance our other glymaxx ® enabled candidate mcla for herexpressing solid tumors and we expect to report topline results from our ongoing phase  trial in the second half of     probiogens glymaxx ® technology is based on the heterologous cytosolic expression of a bacterial enzyme that redirects the denovo fucose synthesis pathway towards a sugarnucleotide that cannot be metabolized by the cell the enzyme mediates the secretion of antibodies with minimized fucose content the resulting modification of the glycostructure of igg antibodies enhances their binding to natural killer or nk cells and thus the adcc response in potency assays consequently the potency of the modified antibodies directed against tumor or infected cells is substantially increased about adcc adcc antibodydependent cellmediated cytotoxicity activity is an important antibody function leading to the selective killing of target cells ie cancerous cells or pathogeninfected cells several therapeutic antibody drugs on the market rely on adcc as a mechanism of action adcc enhancement has the potential to increase the therapeutic effect andor to greatly reduce antibody dosage requirements resulting in fewer sideeffects and treatment costs if you liked this article you might like what you need to

to purchase additional shares in full at the initial public offering price per share of  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses of the offering that are payable by us we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering together with our existing cash and cash equivalents as follows • approximately  million to advance clinical development of mcla for the treatment of herexpressing solid tumors which we expect will be sufficient to complete our phase  clinical trial that we initiated in february  • approximately  million to advance clinical development of mcla for the treatment of aml which we expect will be sufficient to complete our phase  clinical trial that we initiated in may  • approximately  million to advance development of mcla for the treatment of colorectal cancer which we expect will be sufficient to complete preclinical development and submit an ind application to the fda to initiate a phase  clinical trial in the united states and • the remainder to fund our other current and future research and development activities and for working capital and other general corporate purposes this expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions we may also use a portion of the net proceeds to inlicense acquire or invest in additional businesses technologies products or assets although currently we have no specific agreements commitments or understandings in this regard as of the date of this prospectus we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above predicting the costs necessary to develop bispecific antibody candidates can be difficult the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors including the progress of our development efforts the status of and results from preclinical studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in the future as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our bispecific antibody candidates and any unforeseen cash needs as a result our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering based on our planned use of the net proceeds of this offering and our current cash and cash equivalents we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next  months we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect pending their use we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short and intermediateterm interestbearing obligations and certificates of deposit we compete directly with companies that focus on immunooncology and companies dedicating their resources to novel forms of cancer therapies we also face competition from academic research institutions governmental agencies and other various public and private research institutions with the proliferation of new drugs and therapies into oncology we expect to face increasingly intense competition as new technologies become available any bispecific antibody candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future many of our competitors have significantly greater financial manufacturing marketing drug development technical and human resources than we do mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies these competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining top qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs the key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic bispecific antibody candidates if approved are likely to be their efficacy safety dosing convenience price the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other thirdparty payors our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer more effective less expensive more convenient or easier to administer or have fewer or less severe effects than any products that we may develop our competitors also may obtain fda ema or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market even if our bispecific antibody candidates achieve marketing approval they may be priced at a significant premium over competitive products if any have been approved by then in addition to currently marketed therapies there are also a number of products in latestage clinical development to treat cancer including other bispecific antibodies or similar molecules our closest competitors in this area include affimed nv oncomed pharmaceuticals inc genmab as macrogenics inc merrimack pharmaceuticals inc regeneron pharmaceuticals inc and xencor inc these bispecific antibody candidates in development may provide efficacy safety dosing convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies as a result they may provide significant competition for any of our bispecific antibody candidates for which we obtain marketing approval company description we are a clinicalstage immunooncology company developing innovative bispecific antibody therapeutics our pipeline of fulllength human bispecific antibody candidates which we refer to as biclonics are generated from our technology platform by binding to two different antigens or targets biclonics can be designed to simultaneously block receptors that drive tumor cell growth and survival and to mobilize the patient’s immune response by activating various killer cells to eradicate tumors in our preclinical studies our bispecific antibody candidates were effective in killing tumor cells a result that we believe supports their potential efficacy in the treatment of cancer in february  we commenced a phase  clinical trial of our lead bispecific antibody candidate mcla for the treatment of herexpressing solid tumors and we expect to report topline results from this trial in the second half of  in may  we commenced a phase  clinical trial of our second bispecific antibody candidate mcla for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia or aml we are also developing mcla a bispecific antibody candidate that is designed to bind to cancer stem cells expressing leucinerich repeatcontaining g proteincoupled receptor  or lgr and epidermal growth factor receptors or egfr for the potential treatment of colorectal cancer and plan to submit an investigational new drug or ind application to the us food and drug administration or fda by the end of  to initiate a phase  clinical trial in the united states additionally we have several other bispecific antibody candidates in preclinical development that bind to combinations of immunomodulatory molecules including programmed death receptor or pd and programmed deathligand  or pdl both of which we believe play a significant role in treating cancer our biclonics technology platform enables rapid functional screening of large collections of biclonics which allows us to identify lead candidates with multiple mechanisms of action the biclonics format retains the immunoglobulin g or igg format of conventional monoclonal antibodies or mabs and is designed to preserve the format’s key features including stability long halflife and low immunogenicity when developing our bispecific antibody candidates we leverage industrystandard manufacturing processes and infrastructure to efficiently produce biclonics our lead bispecific antibody candidate mcla is currently in a phase  clinical trial in europe for the treatment of various solid tumors including breast colorectal and ovarian cancers we believe mcla has the potential to be a more effective treatment of herexpressing solid tumors than existing therapies due to its ability to inhibit cellular growth factor receptors on tumor cells and simultaneously involve immune system cells to attack tumor cells mcla is designed to bind to and block growth factor receptors known as her and her as well as recruit immune killer cells such as natural killer or nk cells and macrophages in our preclinical studies mcla was more effective in inhibiting heregulindriven tumor growth than her or her mabs as well as their combinations and a combination of currently approved her mabs the production of heregulin which is the binding molecule or ligand for her has been widely shown to cause cancer cells to grow and become resistant to treatment with hertargeted therapies our phase  clinical trial of mcla will assess its safety tolerability and antitumor activity in the dose escalation phase of the trial we observed an objective positive effect in  out of the  patients or  treated and evaluable for efficacy in  of those  patients the disease had not progressed at the completion of the first two cycles of treatment a condition defined as stable disease in one patient we observed significant reductions in tumor size and disappearance of some metastatic lesions with no new tumors appearing through the beginning of the thirteenth cycle of treatment a condition defined as a partial response this partial response has been confirmed at later evaluation dates and this patient continues to receive mcla after more than  months in the trial the disease progressed in the remaining patients evaluable for a response three of the  patients initially assessed with stable disease continued without progression of the disease beyond the fourth cycle of their treatment in the remaining eight patients initially assessed with stable disease the disease progressed at a later evaluation date we expect to report topline results from the phase  trial in the second half of  our second bispecific antibody candidate mcla is currently in a phase  clinical trial in europe for the treatment of aml aml generally has a poor prognosis and limited progress has been made in disease outcomes despite a growing aml patient population clinical and preclinical studies suggest that treatmentresistent leukemic stem cells are a potential cause of disease relapse mcla binds to cd a cellsurface molecule present on all tcells and to cleca a cell surface molecule present on approximately  to  of aml tumor cells and stem cells in newly diagnosed and relapsed patients mcla is designed to recruit and activate tcells to kill aml tumor cells and stem cells in our preclinical studies mcla killed tumor cells in blood samples of aml patients we plan to seek orphan drug designation for mcla for the treatment of aml from the fda and the european medicines agency or ema we expect to report topline results from the phase  trial in the first half of  we are also currently evaluating mcla for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome or mds in preclinical studies in addition to mcla and mcla we are developing mcla a bispecific antibody candidate that is designed to bind to cancer stem cells expressing lgr and egfr for the potential treatment of colorectal cancer we are conducting preclinical studies of mcla and plan to submit an ind to the fda by the end of  to initiate a phase  clinical trial in the united states mcla is designed to kill cancer stem cells using two different mechanisms of action the first mechanism of action involves blocking growth and survival pathways in tumor stem cells the second mechanism of action involves the recruitment and enhancement of immune effector cells  we

merus nv signs commercial multiproduct license for probiogen’s glymaxx® adcc enhancement technologysidebarpress releases overview june merus nv signs commercial multiproduct license for probiogen’s glymaxx® adcc enhancement technologybispecific cancer antibody pipeline optimized by glymaxx® manufacturing technologyberlin germany  utrecht the netherlands june   probiogen ag and merus nv today jointly announced that merus has signed a commercial multiproduct license agreement for probiogen’s glymaxx® adcc antibodydependent cellmediated cytotoxicity enhancement technology under the terms of the agreement merus has obtained nonexclusive use of glymaxx® technology for merus’ biclonics® pipeline of bispecific cancer antibodies to enhance their adcc activity financial details of the license agreement were not disclosedmcla is the first glymaxx®modified adccenhanced bispecific antibody being developed under this commercial license mcla is being developed as a potential treatment for colorectal cancer and other types of solid tumors the compound is designed to bind to cancer stem cells that express egfrs epidermal growth factor receptors and lgr leucinerich repeatcontaining g proteincoupled receptor  merus had previously utilized the glymaxx® technology for its lead candidate mcla which is designed to bind to her and herexpressing solid tumors merus reported interim clinical data from an ongoing phase  clinical trial for mcla in april  these data included a favorable safety profile and early signs of antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors“we are pleased that merus is again collaborating with probiogen for development of their promising antibody cancer therapy mcla” said dr wieland wolf ceo of probiogen “merus’ biclonics® platform represents an encouraging approach to the killing of cancer cells and we believe that biclonics® utilizing our enhanced adcc technology hold great promise in potentially transforming the cancer treatment paradigm”“probiogen’s glymaxx® technology is proven to increase an antibody’s ability to bind to cellular targets resulting in greater cellkilling proficiency” said ton logtenberg phd chief executive officer of merus “we are eager to advance development of mcla utilizing this exciting technology and we plan to file an ind with the fda by the end of next year at the same time we are continuing to advance our other glymaxx®enabled candidate mcla for herexpressing solid tumors and we expect to report topline results from our ongoing phase  trial in the second half of ”probiogen’s glymaxx® technology is based on the heterologous cytosolic expression of a bacterial enzyme that redirects the denovo fucose synthesis pathway towards a sugarnucleotide that cannot be metabolized by the cell the enzyme mediates the secretion of antibodies with minimized fucose content the resulting modification of the glycostructure of igg antibodies enhances their binding to natural killer or nk cells and thus the adcc response in potency assays consequently the potency of the modified antibodies directed against tumor or infected cells is substantially increasedabout adccadcc antibodydependent cellmediated cytotoxicity activity is an important antibody function leading to the selective killing of target cells ie cancerous cells or pathogeninfected cells several therapeutic antibody drugs on the market rely on adcc as a mechanism of action adcc enhancement has the potential to increase the therapeutic effect andor to greatly reduce antibody dosage requirements resulting in fewer sideeffects and treatment costsabout glymaxx® wwwglymaxxdethe glymaxx® technology developed by probiogen prevents the synthesis of the sugar “fucose” and hence in antibodyproducing cells its addition to the nlinked carbohydrate part of the antibody the absence of fucose is known to greatly enhance adcc the glymaxx® technology is based on the stable introduction of a gene for an enzyme which literally eliminates the producer cells’ fucose biosynthesis pathway as a unique feature differentiating it from other approaches glymaxx® can be applied to both novel and already existing antibody producer cell lines and entire antibody expression and discovery platforms without negatively affecting their productivity or product characteristics moreover it is simple rapid potent and universally applicable to different chinese hamster ovary or cho hosts and all other eukaryotic cell species glymaxx® can be rapidly applied in a few weeks to any existing antibody producer cell line can be used in the context of probiogen’s preengineered glymaxx® host cells or can be introduced into entire animal cell expression platforms by modifying the host cell line probiogen offers its glymaxx® technology royaltyfree as a service or as an individual licenseabout probiogen ag wwwprobiogendeprobiogen is a specialist for the development and manufacturing of complex therapeutic
