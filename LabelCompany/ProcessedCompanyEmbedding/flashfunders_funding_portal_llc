through changes to reg d before the jumpstart our business companies jobs act of  private companies who wanted to raise capital had to solicit investments via private channels the jobs act quickly

benefits of investing in private companies what are the risks of earlystage investing what are the risks of investing in notes  debt securities including convertible notes  revenue participation notes what are the risks of investing in equity securities preferred stock  common stock what are the benefits of investing in private companies there are more high value companies staying private longer traditionally only angel investors and venture capitalists had access to invest in these private companies but now theyre publicly available on flashfunders its not just about a potential financial return on investment its about becoming part of a company that may change the world think about all the companies that have fundamentally changed our culture early stage venture capital investing means investing in ideas entrepreneurs and innovation it means changing the way the world works influencing peoples lives and becoming an inextricable part of that story on flashfunders anyone can have access to those opportunities on an open transparent online market without earlystage investing the world would be a very different place great ideas need you what are the risks of earlystage investing in investing the greater risks can yield the greatest gains but investors should be aware than they can lose some or all of their investments less than  of companies make it to a subsequent round of funding were an open marketplace and we believe that companies from anywhere in the world and from any sector deserve an opportunity to be on our platform although fintech clearing andor flashfunders funding portal conduct a limited proprietary review of all offerings your due diligence is vital investors should be familiar with and willing to accept the high risk associated with private investments private stock with no public market private stocks are securities with no public market for resale the investments are private and illiquid so you cant convert them to cash easily you should be willing to hold that investment indefinitely need to do due diligence any securities offered on flashfunders are offered directly by the companies themselves and those companies are solely responsible for the contents of any materials made available to prospective investors on the flashfunders website flashfunders only reviews a companys selfverifications that it is free of “bad actors” flashfunders also conducts corporate status checks using public databases verifies the identities of key founders and conducts antimoney laundering compliance checks investors are responsible for conducting research on a potential investment including understanding the companys exit strategy an exit strategy is how a company intends to “cash out” their shareholders investments however there is no guarantee of when or whether that exit strategy will happen difficulty in valuing private companies its incredibly difficult to value earlystage companies theyre just starting out so the companys value generally cant be based on its assets book value or historical results of operations you shouldnt consider the offerings valuation or share price a formal indication of the companys worth use your judgment to decide the worth of the shares you buy risk of total loss many companies fail  thats why due diligence is so important its up to you to judge if an earlystage company has the potential to succeed flashfunders does not recommend or endorse any of the materials that companies post on the flashfunders website and does not conduct diligence on the business plan disclosures risks prospects or other investment considerations of any company you may lose some or all of your investment and you need to be in a financial position to be able to bear that loss what are the risks of investing in notes  debt securities including convertible notes  revenue participation notes investing in private companies through any type of note includes the risk of total loss and is extremely speculative since notes are debt securities there is an obligation by the company to pay back principal and interest to the investor however if the company encounters financial difficulties there could be missed payments or total loss of the investment to the investor revenue participation notes rpns are a specific form of note that bear an annual interest rate but also have an added feature of revenue participation whereby the investor can receive a percentage of sales if the amount is greater than the annual interest rate rpns allow investors to have upside benefits in a situation where a company has significant revenue growth however as is the case with many early stage businesses revenue forecasts may not be met and investors in rpns may not reap the benefits of any revenue participation the expectation of revenue participation in an rpn is highly speculative and is not guaranteed notes typically have maturity dates which means that investors may no longer hold the security past a specified date if the company has performed all obligations specified in the note if a company is liquidated noteholders would receive their capital back prior to any equity investors preferred or common shareholders however investors may depending on the companys financial circumstances be returned some all or none of their invested capital andor accrued interest what are the risks of investing in equity securities preferred stock  common stock investing in private companies through any type of stock or equity security includes the risk of total loss and is extremely speculative when an investor makes an equity investment in a private company an investor has the opportunity to share in the benefits of a companys potential business success however there is no guarantee or obligation by the company to provide any returns cash flows or dividends to the investor unless otherwise specified equity investors may lose their entire investment or may not have a chance for a return for many years some equity investments take over a decade to see any returns if a company is liquidated equity investors typically only receive their capital after all noteholders are paid their capital first with preferred shareholders then receiving priority over common shareholders however investors may depending on the companys financial circumstances be returned some all or none of their invested capital investors should always review the disclosures and risks specific to a given offering and its securities structure which can be found in a companys offering materials

target offering amount has been met if a company reaches the target offering amount in a reg cf offering prior to the deadline identified in its offering materials it may close the offering early if it provides notice about the new offering deadline this must be at least five business days prior to such new offering deadline absent a material change that would require an extension of the offering and reconfirmation of the investment commitment if an investor does not cancel an investment commitment in a reg cf offering before the hour period prior to the offering deadline the funds will be released to the company upon closing of the offering and the investor will receive securities in exchange for his or her investment what is a successful close a successful close is when the company has reached either its target raise amount or its maximum raise amount what happens if an offering fails to close all investment funds are transferred into an offering deposit account andor escrow

dashboard in the investors flashfunders account and inquiries regarding the shares and communications with the company for reg cf investors can be directed to flashfunders shareholder services contactffshareholderservicescom what happens to my share of ownership if the company issues new shares in future financing rounds as is the case with any equity financing round companies will naturally be diluting the equity ownership of existing investors that means your proportion of ownership will be reduced unless you own flashseed preferred stock and exercise your right to maintain proportionate ownership what happens if a business fails as with any investment there is an inherent risk that the company in which you invest may fail if that is the case and there is a liquidation event holders of flashseed preferred and flash cf preferred stock will have a liquidation preference over common stock holders of the company however in many cases there are no assets left to distribute and the entirety of the investment may be lost how are returns distributed to investors all distributions will be managed by the company itself however as transfer agent flashfunders

complete guide to getting started – process street what is crowdfunding the complete guide to getting started adam henshall july   business startups technology are you a wannabe investor or an aspiring entrepreneur there are now more ways than ever to get those valuable connections to make you and others money the online crowdfunding world is a network of forward thinking companies and people who want to help them succeed in the second installment of our future finance series focused on modern investment and millennialfriendly financing we’re looking at the particular niche of equity crowdfunding in  the total global crowdfunding industry estimated fundraising volume was  billion in  this had grown to  billion the industry is booming and growing each year so it’s about time we picked it apart for you in this article we’re going to look at two key areas how you can become an investor through crowdfunding opportunities including platforms available to help you along your journey how you can raise investment for your startup through crowdfunding platforms with expert advice from flashfunders’s evan markiles what is crowdfunding you probably already know but let’s clarify it for ourselves crowdfunding is the act of sourcing a large amount of money from many small contributions simple in many ways crowdfunding isn’t a new concept on a local level building societies and credit unions have been crowdfunding their operations ever since the germans invented the concept back in the th century think bailey brothers’ building and loans rather than the nasty mr potter who tries to shut it down of course in the modern age of the internet is isn’t only communities located in the same place who are able to come together to fund things the internet is awash with communities or people with similar interests never mind the countless people who see a good idea and recognize the money making potential of it this leads us to the emerging world of equity crowdfunding unlike previous crowdfunding sites like kickstarter or indiegogo where you might kick in  to help a film come to production with your name in the credits equity crowdfunding means you own a part of the business you’re a real investor this provides you with a greater incentive to invest a larger amount of money which in turn increases the chances of companies raising the total amounts of money they feel they need to take that next step in their business journey you could be someone who is looking to kick in  here or there or you could be an established angel investor already who is looking to broaden your net with equity crowdfunding platforms you can be an investor doing deals without having to have pockets a mile deep the crowdfunding we’re seeing now is a result of both legislative and technological changes obama’s the jobs act changed the scene by opening up investing opportunities prior to this rulings by the sec meant that only accredited investors could purchase equity in private companies to be an accredited investor you needed a net worth in excess of m and an annual income of above k or k with your spouse the changes to this investment firewall originally intended to protect people from repeating many of the mistakes of the great depression mean that your regular joe or joan can now get in on the act and this is how we end up with companies like flashfunders and the emergence of crowdfunding as a serious investment channel should i start investing through crowdfunding sites before i start convincing you to pour your life savings into an investment opportunity let me remind you that i am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice if you want to act on the stellar information i’m giving you i recommend you speak with a professional that said… if you want high risk with high reward then you can try out equity crowdfunding as an option admittedly you’re not going to get rich investing small drops at a time in crowdfunding and you’d be exposing yourself to much greater risk than keeping it in the bank or in a savings package but if you’re feeling a bit financially healthy and open to a bit of risk you could take advantage of the technological shifts in your own way it’s worth mentioning that you can offset some of that risk by spreading your bets like a vc might have multiple investments all ongoing in the knowledge that if one fails they still have more equity elsewhere diversifying your portfolio reduces your exposure to risk and increases your chance of stumbling on a diamond in the rough equity crowdfunding tends to be based on purchasing equity in particular small companies which you believe in and reckon could turn your small amount of money into a larger amount of money unlike regular investing where you hope your money stays safe and grows gently year by year you’re throwing your money into the deep end and hoping it learns how to swim i’m being alarmist but you need to make sure you know what you’re getting into with crowdfunding so that you can make the right decisions and land that green you could receive perks and gifts for investing as part of a slick media campaign on behalf of the company but these shiny trinkets should not distract your eyes away from the boring financials you might often be investing in interesting products or things which appeal to you but check that this isn’t the only reason you’re investing let’s run through a couple of considerations you’ll want to make when deciding whether to invest into an equity crowdfunding round how to judge whether a crowdfunding opportunity is a good investment as with any pursuit start with the basics do you just like their product or is there a market for it what are their financial projections is there a vc or an angel leading the round the last point is an interesting one and one presented by sramana mitra in his critique of the topic many investors in crowdfunding campaigns might be first time investors or people who haven’t led a round before this doesn’t mean they’re amateurs or that they don’t know what they are looking for but it is indicative of a potential lack of experience if the fundraising round is being led by an angel investor or a venture capitalist then you can be more confident that a professional level of due diligence has been performed topping up a vc funding round with crowdfunding is a useful way for startups to generate more money with a couple of added benefits firstly it gives the startup a way to raise more money while still being able to focus on their business operations secondly as we’ll expand on later it creates a sea of evangelists for the business one example of a company which topped up its funding through crowdfunding and went on to generate huge rewards for investors was cruise automation which raised through angel list as part of a syndicate led by zach coelius where many small investors took part involved vcs in the company included spark capital and sam altman and all parties were presumably very happy when general motors acquired cruise in march  for a cool billion dollars crowdfund investors will have made their decision to invest on the back of seeing prominent vc involvement a neat concept and presumably a solid business plan moreover a specialized company like that in such a globally massive market is always a good contender for an exit which is worth bearing in mind we asked evan markiles head of business operations at flashfunders what key things new investors should be looking for before they take the plunge and commit their money to a project first always remember that any sort of investment in an equity crowdfunding offering is an extremely risky and speculative investment and the time horizon for seeing returns if any is very long therefore you should only invest as much as you are comfortable losing on that investment this is your investment  do not risk your food budget on an investment opportunity it would be like donating your tuition money to a candidate who promises to abolish tuition only for that candidate to lose it’s well meaning and that risk taking quality is to be admired but it might not pay off in the long run another factor to consider when thinking about evan’s point is the emphasis on the horizon for returns even if your investment goes well and starts to greatly appreciate in value it’s not like you can just withdraw your funds you’re tied in perhaps you could sell your stake but that’s a tricky option to depend on unlike micro investing which we looked at in the previous future finance installment you don’t really have the flexibility to manage your money once it’s in liquidity is certainly not the name of the game you’re in this investment for the long run remember that as you consider your options second do your due diligence potential investors should not only review all materials on a company’s offering page but really dive into the company’s sec form c filing which will provide information about the company’s operating history business plan and any risk factors but don’t necessarily stop there google the company check out their social media presence read any press about the company feel free to even contact the company or its founders to inquire about the business this is where you remind yourself that you’re not just a user at a computer you’re a real investor now remember do the leg work and reach out to the founders if you take up an hour of their time and then chip in a large sum of money then that hour has been massively worth it for them excellent roi startups are friendly reach out to them as you dig deep into their operations if you want a helping hand in understanding how to approach your due diligence you can use this process street template embedded below simply click i want this for my business to add the template to your process street account should i crowdfund my start up perhaps you’re not looking to be an investor perhaps you have a startup or have an idea you’ve always wanted to kickstart pun intended is crowdfunding the right option for you it’s difficult to say one advantage of crowdfunding is it removes the need for what the french philosopher pierre bourdieu calls social capital if you’re ingratiated into the silicon valley startup scene then you likely have high levels of social capital and you can leverage that to access financial capital but not all great ideas are born in silicon valley great ideas happen everywhere all over the world crowdfunding your venture allows you to bypass those connections and networks to try to gain funding wherever you’re based and whatever your social capital maybe you can approach andreessen horowitz later anyway moreover different concepts are more or less likely to capture people’s imagination a business centered around a concept which solves an obviously identifiable problem and is relatively unique will likely attract interest as part of a crowdfunding campaign however it’s probably a little more difficult for a company who offer insurance services and believe their business model means they can undercut their competition one of those is engaging the other not so much the latter might be a great business opportunity and still suited to crowdfunding but it could be a little harder to sell to an insurancelayperson elon musk somehow capturing both fredo and vito corleone “you come to me on the day of my rocket’s landing…” evan gives us his breakdown on what helps a startup to have a successful equity crowdfunding round according to evan companies suited to equity crowdfunding generally share a couple of key characteristics  a very large usercustomer base as these people already use and love your product and will be excited to become part of the company as an investor you also already have their contact information so reaching out to them via a newsletter would be a really costeffective way of acquiring investors  a successful kickstarter or indiegogo campaign in the past as it will show that there is a market for your product you will have a big list of potential investors to go back to and you have experience reaching out to the crowd and using the internet and social media to raise funds  a good supply of capital to pay for a marketing budget it’s no secret that almost all successful and “viral” kickstarter campaigns actually have a ton of marketing dollars behind them it costs money to make a great video pitch and to buy facebook ads the general theme emerging is that you shouldn’t simply rely on investors within the platform you choose they may help and get involved but your chances of success are boosted if you can drive potential investors en masse to the opportunity you’re presenting to them step  build a big user base whether through the growth of your product or an earlier crowdsourced seed investment funding round step  leverage that user base to cream off the investors who will help you move forward but remember the advice we gave above to potential investors make sure your company is in a good position to be invested into you have your financials properly displayed and you’re willing to engage with those who have shown an interest in you  equity crowdfunding sites you can use to raise or invest flashfunders flashfunders is the company of evan markiles and offers a full service equity crowdfunding package we asked evan what his priorities are for the company at ff our first focus was always being compliant and having a robust regulatory framework while we are a finra funding portal flashfunders funding portal llc we also conduct c and reg a offerings through our clearing broker dealer license fintech clearing llc thus issuers and investors can be confident that we’re doing things the right way from a compliance perspective this framework also allows an issuer to travel with us as they grow they may start with us doing an equity crowdfunding round and then a few months later conduct a c series a round and a year later a reg a offering all on the same platform sounds good flashfunders provide a clear line of development for companies looking to raise funds within their platform this assistance in the natural progression from seed to series a is good for startups and good for investors it shows there is space for forward movement without having to distract focus away from the business operations we also focus on providing a soup to nuts end to end solution we provide all the tools to manage your incoming investors track your marketing analytics and conduct the entire round in a compliance manner as we’re conducting our backend compliance procedures on all investors one of the benefits to investors is this interactive aspect where you can monitor the performance of the companies you have a stake in directly from within the platform flashfunders is a true equity crowdfunding site as there are no obligations in regards to being an accredited investor anyone over the age of  in the continental us can jump aboard angellist angellist is one of the big players in the world of equity crowdfunding they were pretty much first on the scene and continue to offer their services angellist is known for being one of the largest social networks for startups and has a huge number of companies and investors within its platform as a result as an investor angellist offers three membership levels the first is the most flexible and requires minimum investments of  the next step up gives you the opportunity to treat your angellist investments like an index fund but requires big bucks  the final premium version gives you the benefits of both membership forms with a dedicated angellist representative whether you choose to crowdfund through angellist or not you should probably become a member for the social network value and access to other forms of investment like accelerator programs gust okay so this is sailing a little close to the wind geddit in terms of being equity crowdfunding or not gust is one of the largest networks of angel investors and was founded by the now legendary david s rose the og angel generally to get involved as an investor it’s best to become a member of one of the angel investment groups within the platform and invest alongside them this allows you to draw upon the collective wisdom of the group when deciding whether or not to invest but for investors gust is a little more big league than regular crowdfunding suggests for startups you can simply make your profile and work from there gust acquired rival fundacity in  so one would expect their startup portal to improve in light of this purchase as well as their presence within europe and latin america circle up circle up has a different focus to some other crowdfunding sites it isn’t a social network nor is it investor led circle up provide more of a curated experience for investors the platform focuses on onboarding consumer brands and working out what their investment needs are from there the startups are matched with potentially well suited investors and introductions are made this provides a degree of vetting while also adding value into the startup’s pitch the team at circle up will assist in reviewing materials and providing coaching to make sure each startup is representing itself well and professionally this kind of approach is good for inexperienced startups who are often uncertain about what they need to provide or how best to convey the message as an added bonus circle up sell themselves on a range of added bonus services for companies postraise with partner offers from amazon and others fundable picking up fundable as our next platform brings us back into the proper world of crowdfunding a world of small donations and social media campaigns fundable is part of the ever expanding startupsco network which includes zirtual for virtual assistants and launchrock for landing pages fundable operates much like kickstarter or indiegogo where you can start a campaign and raise funds from the network the minimum commitment from investors is  and no money changes hands through the platform itself as with some other platforms accredited investors are the only ones with full access to browse company materials in depth honorable mentions there are new sites opening up in the field of equity crowdfunding all the time the market for these sites is large and growing as we’ve seen already fundacity was acquired by gust and fundable by startupsco there’s definitely activity notable others not included in the list include equity net crowdfunder wefunder seedinvest and republic given that the equity crowdfunding explosion occurred in  with obama’s jobs act the industry is still somewhat in its infancy evan suggests that we could continue to see the market change over the next few years as new elements of legislation are making their way through congress the fix crowdfunding act bill aims to increase the amount of money a company can receive from true crowdfunding in one year from m to m these kinds of legislative changes could further increase the scope of this industry in our next future finance article we’re going to look at cryptocurrencies and the role they’re playing in funding and investment given their advances it may serve the government well to remove the barriers on regular outintheopen investing the stories of a financial wild west with gibraltarian saloons and singaporean cattle ranches should start the banks and the regulators hoping this town is big enough for the two of them mining bitcoin ain’t easy but it’s honest work to crowdfund or not to crowdfund… wait what was the question i know we’ve meandered a little through different elements and areas of crowdfunding even covering at least one platform which is barely within the crowdfunding category but that’s part of the problem the distinction between what qualifies as crowdfunding and what is small time angel activity has become blurred it’s both the problem and the core concept we’re all angels now the key takeaways from this article are if you can afford to invest  there are plenty of sites which allow you to pump that money into the company of your choice if you are a startup with a large user base it is worth looking at leveraging that base to drive your funding round there are plenty of sites to help you but it all comes with risk there are no guarantees you’ll raise the money you want to raise and there are no guarantees you’ll see returns on your investments whether you’re brave enough is up to you have you invested through equity crowdfunding sites or maybe you’ve crowdfunded for your startup let us know
