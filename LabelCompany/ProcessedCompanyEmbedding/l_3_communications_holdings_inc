growth orchestrated by former loral executives frank lanza and robert lapenta origins loral corporation was an assemblage of defense units acquired from fairchild ford ibm unisys and others between the mids and mids by wall street investor bernard l schwartz in april  lockheed martin acquired most of these businesses for  billion two loral executives coo frank lanza and comptroller robert

which had been formed in  by the merger of lockheed corp and martin marietta corp began to divest noncore units after the massive loral acquisition it sold its stake in the martin marietta construction materials business in  lanza described by the washington post as a taciturn new yorker admired for his creativity and engineering genius reportedly felt stifled by the bureaucratic corporate atmosphere at lockheed martin an electrical engineer by training lanza had joined loral in  and was named president and chief operating officer in  along the way he was instrumental in growing the company from modest origins to a  billion giant in  as he approached traditional retirement age lanza convinced his new employer lockheed chairman norman r augustine to spin off ten former loral companies to form l communications it took me less than half an hour to get a yes lanza later told business week lanza finally got a chance to be ceo and numbers whiz lapenta was named president and chief financial officer the ten businesses spun off had annual revenues of  million and  employees the largest of these were wideband systems in salt lake city and communications systems in camden new jersey also included were two northern california companies randtron and nardamicrowave which manufactured microwave antennas for military applications these two together had fewer than  employees

financed with bank debt and highyield bonds the name of the new company came from lanza lapenta and either lockheed or lehman brothers according to varying reports in july  l found itself aggressively bidding against its partowner lockheed martin for control of a texas instruments chipmaking business that raytheon was being forced to unload as part of a justice department settlement the desired unit produced gallium arsenide highpower amplifier monolithic microwave integrated circuits or mmics a proprietary product l was eager to expand its microwave components business which accounted for a

announced in february  the ipo at  a share came on may  in the next six months the companys share price would rise to  a share helped by strong earnings lanzas acquisition strategy was to buy technology leaders either struggling independent companies or black sheep divisions of major defense contractors observed business week lanza focused on small to medium sized companies to avoid costly takeover battles with aerospace giants essco a leading producer of groundbased radomes protective shields for antennas and precision millimeter wave antenna systems acquired in september  was a representative purchase by november  l had already acquired seven companies including spd technologies which supplied power equipment to the us navy and storm control systems inc which made satellite

corporate foster parents lanza declared l was committed to help link thrive in the growing training market in march  however l sued raytheon to cancel its acquisition agreement alleging that raytheon failed to disclose liabilities in the business bigger game in the new millennium when institutional investor asked lanza ls next move in november  he quipped were gonna go buy lockheed ls impressive
