mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a

also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf

periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

corporation  anchor capital advisors llc who we are about philosophy  process team what we do institutions managed accounts private client investment strategies overview read disclaimer barrons is an american weekly newspaper published by dow jones  company a property of news corp that covers us financial information market developments and relevant statistics each issue provides a summary of the previous weeks market activity as well as news reports and an informative outlook on the week to come the top  independent advisors as identified by barron’s is published annually scoring for the publication reflects the assessment of data provided by the nation’s most productive advisors investment performance is not an explicit component because not all advisors have audited results and because performance figures often are influenced more by clients’ risk tolerance than by an advisor’s investmentpicking ability barron’s states that ranking reflects the volume of assets overseen by the advisors and their teams revenues generated for the firms and the quality of the advisors practices furthermore that the scoring systems assigns a top score of  and rates the rest by comparing them with the topranked advisor anchor capital did not provide data to barron’s to be included in this assessment and receipt of this designation is no way indicative of any individual client or

nasdaq haemonetics corporation hae provides products for processing handling and analyzing blood for each facet of the blood supply chain its products and services ensure that patients receive the most appropriate treatment at the right time  the company was founded in  and is based in braintree ma  investment thesis anchor has followed haemonetics for over five years and always liked the business as it is a leader in blood management and provides products that are vital to the blood supply chain the balance sheet appears to us to be underutilized as it has just m in net debt  a new management team is in place and has laid out a multiyear turnaround plan which will address productivity and organic growth  as a result it hopes to achieve number one or two market positions in each segment and deliver superior returns on invested capital roic  confirmation through research the growth outlook appears favorable for haemonetics given attractive market fundamentals and the opportunity for more efficient use of resources  haemonetics is the only company that offers a full blood management solution including tracking and managing blood and the company’s products provide a very clear cost and productivity benefit to its users  haemonetics has been fighting a number of operational headwinds the last couple of years including foreign exchange as  of revenues are generated outside the us a change in the number of calendar weeks and continued declines in blood transfusions  chris simon ceo and bill burke cfo joined the company in may and august of   previously chris led the global medical products practice at mckinsey and bill most recently led the integration of covidien into medtronic  anchor believes that a strong management team is important and after spending a half day with management at the company’s headquarters we feel that these two can achieve or even exceed the company’s turnaround plan goals which include right sizing the business and driving growth in the high potential plasma and hospital segments  variant perception we believe that there is additional upside beyond management’s goals we see an opportunity for natural addons in the critical information space the possibility of an expanding addressable market for devices and the option to sell less attractive segments of the business we believe that haemonetics is a compelling investment opportunity right now with a new management team that we expect to drive above average returns over the next several years   disclosures in order to enhance current and prospective investor
