financial planners what is feeonly financial planning and why does it matter when choosing an advisor every financial advisor gets paid for doing their job however they dont all get paid the same way a feeonly financial planner all napfa advisors are feeonly is paid directly by the client on a transparent and prearranged payment plan this can be an hourly or project rate monthly retainer or percentage of the investments managed other financial advisors are paid through other sources including by the companies they recommend for example if the planner sells you a specific investment mutual fund insurance or other products they receive a commission or partial commission directly from the company when working with a napfa registered financial advisor there are no hidden fees commissions thirdparty payments or product sales if you are not sure how your financial advisor gets paid just ask them it is not something that is easy to tell how a planner is paid is quite important because it can affect the advice that they offer to their clients professional financial planners need to make a living like everyone else and they are likely to be most loyal to the person who pays them if that person is you the client then pleasing you will bring them longterm business they will consistently offer you the best financial advice that they have a commissionbased financial planner may be focusing on the companies they work for before the clients best interest that situation may not be beneficial for all of their clients ultimately you want to pick a planner who will be

reviewsverified purchases see all  reviews out of  starssolid brunner who wrote very good sf for many yearsbycypherpunkon september  format kindle editionverified purchasejohn brunner wrote one of my alltime favorite sf stories times without number i first read it as a teenager maybe even preteen and years later i tracked it down and read it several more times i see why i liked it as a teenager but it was also a good novel reading it as an adult none of his novels have had revolutionary ideas but all of them have several fully realized characters enough detail and logic to make the world feel substantial and characters do things that make sense all of these seem like simple things but its surprising how often even very good novels can throw you out of the story by not doing these things well really there is a limit to how much disbelief one can suspend a few details here and there or plot holes that zip by due to an otherwise wellwritten story are no big deal throw out a couple of things that make sense or just dont ring true and do it at a crucial phase of a story and its overthe avengers of carrig is the first in a series and its the first novel of his that is squarely space opera not a novel with an sf backstory or setup the main characters are all wellwritten one of the main characters is a woman and women historically are weak characters in sf i dont think thats the case shes a career woman from a soft earth center of the empire background and everyone including her is wondering if she can make it as a secret agent shes clearly smart enough but she cant get along with any of her coworkers and her superiors cant figure out what to do with her other main characters are people who live in a backward society on a planet that has lost contact with their version of the federation smugglers and pirates have moved in and are trying to use the locals as slaves to mine radioactive or toxic orelike every brunner novel that ive read description is direct and to the point characters are reflective and have serious problems but they dont dwell on those problems for entire chapters his characters do things he has an economical writing style that reminds me of asimov clarke and dick where asimov and clarke often focus more on the ideas and dick gets wrapped up in one persons reality brunner focuses on their humanity and their efforts to do the right thing even in horrible situationsi agree with many who feel that brunner is an unrecognized master and this is the first of several novels that display his deft writing style and economical storytelling ive avoided saying much about the actual novel because i dont want to spoil it for others if what ive said so far about the story sounds interesting theres a very good chance youll enjoy this noveljust know that many of the s and s novels are collectors items these days due to their cover art and the often high quality of the stories thats why the kindle versions of these
