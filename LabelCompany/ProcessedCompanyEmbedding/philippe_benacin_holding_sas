audit committee has the sole authority and is directly responsible for the appointment compensation and oversight of the work of the independent accountants employed by our company which prepare or issue an audit report for our company during  the audit committee consisted of messrs heilbronn levy and choël   the company does not have an “audit committee financial expert” within the definition of the applicable securities and exchange commission rules first finding qualified nominees to serve as a director of a public company without substantial financial resources has been challenging second despite the applicable securities and exchange commission rule which states that being named as the audit committee financial expert does not impose any greater duty obligation or liability the company has been met with resistance from both present and former directors to being named as such primarily due to potential additional personal liability   however as the result of the background education and experience of the members of the audit committee our board of directors believes that such committee members are fully qualified to fulfill their obligations as members of the audit committee   ·executive compensation and stock option committee – the executive compensation and stock option committee oversees the compensation of our company’s executives and administers our company’s stock option plans during  the members of such committee consisted of messrs heilbronn levy and choël the charter of the executive compensation and stock option committee is posted on our company’s website   ·nominating committee – the members of such committee consist of messrs heilbronn levy and choël the purpose of the nominating committee is to determine and recommend qualified

of the nominating committee is posted on our company’s website        director independence   the following are our existing directors who are “independent directors” within the applicable rules of the nasdaq stock market francois heilbronn jean levy robert bensoussantorres and patrick choël in addition michel dyens is also a nominee for director and he is independent within the applicable rules of the nasdaq stock market   we follow and comply with the independent director definitions as provided by the nasdaq stock market rules in determining the independence of our directors which are posted on our company’s website in addition such rules are also available on the nasdaq stock market’s website in addition the nasdaq stock market maintains more stringent rules relating to director independence for the members of our audit committee and the members of our audit committee messrs heilbronn levy and choël are independent within the meaning of those rules   on january   our company was advised that one of our directors serge rosinoer passed away and on the same day we notified nasdaq omx of such event prior to the death of mr rosinoer we had nine  directors with a majority of independent directors as the result of the death of mr rosinoer our company was not in compliance with the requirement of the majority of independent directors rule nasdaq rule b however our company intends to comply with the cure period stated in rule ba to have a majority of independent directors at this annual meeting of stockholders by the election of michel dyens to the board of directors   procedures for approval of related person transactions   transactions between related persons such as between an executive officer or director and our company or any company or person controlled by such officer or director are required to be approved by our audit committee of our board of directors our audit committee charter contains such explicit authority as required by the applicable rules of the nasdaq stock market   board leadership structure and risk management   for more than the past ten  years jean madar has held the positions of chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of our company almost since inception mr madar has been allocated the responsibility of overseeing our united states operations and the operation of inter parfums inc as a public company philippe benacin as chief executive officer of interparfums sa has been allocated the responsibility of overseeing our european operations and its operation as a public company in france in addition mr benacin is also the vice chairman of the board of directors of our company our board of directors is comfortable with this approach as the two largest stockholders of our company are also directly responsible for the operations of our company’s two operating segments accordingly our board of directors does not have a “lead director” a nonmanagement director who controls the meetings of our board of directors   our board of directors manages risk by i review of period operating reports and discussions with management ii approval of executive compensation incentive plans through its committee the executive compensation and stock option committee iii approval of related party transactions through its committee the audit committee and iv approval of material transactions not in the ordinary course of business since our inception we have never been the subject of any material product liability claims and we have had no recent material property damage claims        further we periodically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure related to receivables denominated in a foreign currency and to manage risks related to future sales expected to be denominated in a foreign currency we enter into these exchange contracts for periods consistent with our identified exposures the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the receivables and cash flows of interparfums sa our french subsidiary whose functional currency is the euro all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions which are rated as strong investment grade   in addition we mitigate interest rate risk by continually monitoring interest rates and then determining whether fixed interest rates should be swapped for floating rate debt or if floating rate debt should be swapped for fixed rate debt   business experience   the following sets forth biographical information as to the business experience of each executive officer and director of our company as well as first time director nominee michel dyens for at least the

any reporting person who has failed to file the reports required to be filed under section a of the securities exchange act of  on a timely basis   executive compensation   compensation discussion and analysis   general   the executive compensation and stock option committee of our board of directors is comprised entirely of independent directors and oversees all elements of compensation base salary annual bonus longterm incentives and perquisites of our company’s executive officers and administers our company’s stock option plans other than the nonemployee directors stock option plan which is selfexecuting   the objectives of our compensation program are designed to strike a balance between offering sufficient compensation to either retain existing or attract new executives on the one hand and maintaining compensation at reasonable levels on the other hand we do not have the resources comparable to the cosmetic giants in our industry and accordingly cannot afford to pay excessive executive compensation in furtherance of these objectives our executive compensation packages generally include a base salary as well as annual incentives tied to individual performance and longterm incentives tied to our operating performance        mr madar the chairman and chief executive officer takes the initiative after discussions with mr russell greenberg executive vice president chief financial officer and a director and recommends executive compensation levels for executives for united states operations mr benacin the chief executive officer of interparfums sa takes the initiative after discussions with philippe santi the chief financial officer of interparfums sa and recommends executive compensation levels for executives in european operations the recommendations are presented to the compensation committee for its consideration and the compensation committee makes a final determination regarding salary adjustments and annual award amounts to executives including jean madar and philippe benacin mr madar the chief executive officer is not present during deliberations or determination of his executive compensation by the compensation committee further messrs madar and benacin in addition to being executive officers and directors are our largest beneficial shareholders and therefore their interests are aligned with our shareholder base in keeping executive compensation at a reasonable level   the compensation committee was pleased that the most recent shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation held at our last annual meeting of shareholders in july  overwhelmingly approved the compensation policies and decisions of the compensation committee as such vote validated the compensation policies and decisions of the compensation committee the compensation committee has determined to continue its present compensation policies in order to determine similar future decisions   our compensation committee believes that individual executive compensation is at a level comparable with executives in other companies of similar size and stage of development that operate in the fragrance industry and takes into account our company’s performance as well as our own strategic goals further the compensation committee believes that its present policies to date with its emphasis on rewarding performance has served to focus the efforts of our executives which in turn permitted our company to weather the storm of the recent recession and put our company on track for a continued high rate of growth and profitability which management believes will result in a substantial increase in value to our shareholders   elements of compensation   general   the compensation of our executive officers is generally comprised of base salaries annual cash bonuses and longterm equity incentive awards in determining specific components of compensation the compensation committee considers individual performance level of responsibility skills and experience other compensation awards or arrangements and overall company performance the compensation committee reviews and approves all elements of compensation for all of our executive officers taking into consideration recommendations from the chief executive officer of our company and the chief executive officer of interparfums sa as well as information regarding compensation levels at competitors in our industry   our named executive officers have all been with the company for more than the past ten  years with messrs madar and benacin being founders of the company in  as messrs madar and greenberg for united states operations and benacin and santi for european operations are most familiar with the individual performance level of responsibility skills and experience of each executive officer in their respective operating segments the compensation committee relies upon the information provided by such executive officers in determining individual performance level of responsibility skills and experience of each executive officer        the compensation committee views the competitive market place very broadly which would include executive officers from both public and privately held companies in general including fashion and beauty companies but not limited to the “peer companies” contained in the corporate performance graph contained in our annual report rather than tie the compensation committee’s determination of compensation proposals to any specific peer companies the members of our committee have used their business experience judgment and knowledge to review the executive compensation proposals recommended to them by mr madar for united states operations and benacin for european operations as such compensation committee did not determine the need to “benchmark” of any material item of compensation or overall compensation   the members of the compensation committee have extensive experience and business acumen and are well qualified in determining the appropriateness of executive compensation levels mr heilbronn is a managing partner of a business consulting firm in the area of mergers and acquisitions of large international companies in retail consumer goods and consumer services throughout the world mr levy has over thirty years’ experience as an executive officer including more than ten years as president and chief executive officer of wellknown cosmetic companies such as cosmair and sanofi beaute france mr choël the final committee member is presently a business consultant and advisor who previously worked as president and chief executive officer of two divisions of lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton sa which included such wellknown brands as parfums christian dior guerlain and parfums givenchy mr choël has also been president and ceo of both elida fabergé france and chesebrough pond’s usa   base salary   base salaries for executive officers are initially determined by evaluating the responsibilities of the position held and the experience of the individual and by reference to the competitive market place for executive talent base salaries for executive officers are reviewed on an annual basis and adjustments are determined by evaluating our operating performance the performance of each executive officer as well as whether the nature of the responsibilities of the executive has changed   as stated above as messrs madar and greenberg for united states operations and benacin and santi for european operations are most familiar with the individual performance level of responsibility skills and experience of each executive officer in their respective segments the committee relies upon the information provided by such executive officers in determining individual performance level of responsibility skills and experience of each executive officer        for executive officers of united states operations the bulk of their annual compensation is in base salary however for executive officers of european operations base salary comprises a smaller percentage of overall compensation we have paid a lower percentage of overall compensation in the form of base salary to executive officers of european operations for several years principally because european operations historically have had higher profitability than united states operations and european operations are run differently from united states operations by the chief executive officer of european operations mr benacin as the result of this historically higher profitability european operations have had the ability to pay higher bonus compensation in addition to base salary as bonus compensation is and has historically been discretionary no targets were set in order to maintain flexibility further if results of operations for european operations were not satisfactory again no target amounts were set to maintain flexibility then bonus compensation as well as overall compensation could be lowered without otherwise affecting base salary finally by keeping annual bonus compensation at a higher percentage of overall compensation and base salary at a lower percentage our company benefits because the base amount for annual salary adjustments would be smaller   for  each of mr philippe santi the chief financial officer of interparfums sa and mr frederic garciapelayo director of the luxury and fashion division had their based salaries increased upon the recommendation of mr benacin and received a base salary of € an increase  from € in  these increases in base salary for  were in line with the base salary increases also recommend by mr benacin for  of  to € the compensation committee considered the recommendations of mr benacin as well as the services performed for european operations by messrs santi and garciapelayo   with regard to mr benacin his base salary remained constant for   and  at € per year in view of the uncertainty of the status of the burberry license at the end of  and beginning of  which accounted for approximately  of net sales of interparfums sa for  mr benacin believed it to be prudent to recommend only a limited base salary increase to messrs santi and garciapelayo and not to increase his base salary the compensation committee agreed with mr benacin’s assessment of the uncertain business prospects of interparfums sa and his proposed disposition relating to base salary for interparfums sa executive officers   however for  in addition to his base salary which was increased from € to € a  increase philippe benacin holding sas mr benacin’s personal holding company will receive  for services rendered and to be rendered outside of the united states by mr benacin for the benefit of the company’s united states operations in his capacity as president of our company payment is being made by the company’s united states operations a consulting agreement has been agreed in principle with mr benacin’s holding company which provides for review on an annual basis of the amount of compensation payable to such company   the compensation took into account the following three salient factors in authorizing payment to mr benacin’s holding company— services rendered to united states operations for several years by mr benacin in connection with licensing and distribution of international brands without any cash compensation from united states operations future international services to be performed by mr benacin relating to licensing and distribution of international brands for united states operations as well as three years without any increase in his base salary        a different approach is taken for united states operations as that segment is smaller and less profitable a more significant base salary is paid in order to attract and retain employees with the skills and talents needed to run the operation with a lesser emphasis placed on bonuses none of the executive officers for united states operations have employment agreements as we believe that having flexibility in structuring annual base salary is a benefit which permits us to act quickly to meet a changing economic environment   for  andy clarke the president of inter parfums usa llc the largest subsidiary of the united states operations did not have his base salary increased from the  he received in  and  beginning in  in lieu of a base salary increase mr clarke was awarded a commission on certain new sales that he was instrumental in bringing to our company for  and  mr clarke received commissions of  and  respectively for a detailed discussion of mr clarke’s commission structure for both  and  please see “bonus compensationannual incentives”   for  russell greenberg the executive vice president and chief financial officer received a   increase in his base salary to  as compared to the   increase in his base salary he received in  from  in connection with these increases in salary the compensation committee considered the following material factors in granting mr greenberg his salary increase his individual performance level of responsibility skill and experience as well as the recommendation of the chief executive officer   for  mr madar the chief executive officer did not receive any increase in his base salary which has remained at  since  mr madar also shared the view of mr benacin that in view of the uncertainty of the status of the burberry license at the end of  and beginning of  mr madar determined not to recommend any increase in his base salary to the compensation committee however over the past  years net income of us operations has grown from a loss of  in  to a profit of  million in  accordingly after several years of no increase in his base salary for  in addition to his base salary which remained at  jean madar holding sas mr madar’s personal holding company received  for services rendered outside of the united states by mr madar in his capacity as chief executive officer a consulting agreement has been signed with mr madar’s holding company which provides for review on an annual basis of the amount of compensation payable to such company for  both the base salary of mr madar as well as the consulting fee payable to his personal holding company will remain the same as they were for  in determining mr madar’s base salary as well as the consulting fee for  being paid to mr madar’s holding company the committee took into account mr madar’s leadership of our company in general the increasing profitability of united states operations over the past several years and his services in assisting united states operations in acquiring three new fragrance licenses during         bonus compensationannual incentives   we have paid a higher percentage of overall compensation in the form of bonus compensation to executive officers of european operations for several years principally because european operations historically have had higher profitability than united states operations as the result of this historically higher profitability european operations have had the ability to pay higher bonus compensation in addition to base salary as bonus compensation is discretionary no targets were set in order to maintain flexibility further if results of operations for european operations were not satisfactory again no target amounts were set to maintain flexibility then bonus compensation as well as overall compensation could be lowered without otherwise affecting base salary   for  mr benacin the chief decision maker for european operations proposed and the compensation committee concurred in the payment of bonus compensation of € to mr benacin approximately  of base salary and € approximately  of base salary to each of messrs santi and garcia pelayo in addition to individual performance level of responsibility skill and experience other factors considered by the compensation committee were the increased sales of european operation ongoing brands lavin montblanc and jimmy choo as well as the work with recently licensed european operation brands balmain repetto and karl lagerfeld however mr benacin recommended that his bonus compensation for  be reduced to € approximately  of base salary from € which he received for  approximately  of base salary in order to offset in large part the new  in consulting fees he is to receive in  through his personal holding company as discussed above the difference in the bonus compensation from  to  € approximates  at current exchange rates the compensation committee approved the bonus compensation in tandem with the consulting agreement based upon services mr benacin rendered to united states operations for several years in connection with licensing and distribution of international brands without any cash compensation from united states operations future international services to be performed by mr benacin relating to licensing and distribution of international brands for united states operations as well as three years without any increase in his base salary the compensation committee also understands that both mr benacin and the corporation will benefit from lower tax rates by having compensation taken in this form   for  mr benacin the chief decision maker for european operations proposed and the committee concurred in the payment of bonus compensation of €  to mr benacin approximately  of base salary and € approximately  of base salary to each of messrs santi and garcia pelayo such bonus compensation exceeded prior bonus compensation as a percentage of base salary and was given in recognition of the services performed in connection with the resolution of the disposition of the burberry license as well as the record year for sales and earnings of european operations for  bonus compensation was approximately equal to  of  base salaries   a different approach is taken for united states operations as that segment is smaller and less profitable a more significant base salary is paid in order to attract and retain employees with the skills and talents needed to run the operation with a lesser emphasis placed on bonuses based upon the recommendation of the chief executive officer for  mr greenberg received a discretionary cash bonus of  which was the same amount he received in  the compensation committee considered the following material factors in granting mr greenberg his  bonus his individual performance level of responsibility skill and experience as well as the recommendation of the chief executive officer the compensation committee authorized the bonus in  in recognition for his services in connection with the disposition of the burberry license as well as the record year for sales and earnings of our company        for  in lieu of a base salary increase mr clarke was awarded a commission on certain new sales that he was instrumental in bringing to our company the commission rate was determined based on internal estimates of sales targets for the new business for  in determining the projected amount of the commission portion of mr clarke’s estimated compensation the initial assumption was based upon internal net sales projections of  million which included  million for anna sui brand sales and  million for new secondary market distribution the commission rate of  of net sales would yield  based upon internal projections however net sales exceeded the internal projections and his commission rate of  was based upon actual sales of  million which yielded a total commission of  as mr clarke was instrumental in obtaining the anna sui license for the company and obtaining this new secondary market distribution it was determined that such additional compensation was fair in view of his contribution to the company’s increase in sales   for  no changes were made to the commission structure for mr clarke actual net sales for both the anna sui brand and secondary market product sales aggregated approximately  million and therefore based upon the commission rate discussed above mr clarke received a commission of  for    for  and  mr clarke did not receive a discretionary cash bonus however as discussed above in lieu of an increase in base salary mr clarke received a commission on sales of anna sui in which he was instrumental in obtaining the business the commission was based upon sales targets determined after negotiation with the chief executive officer for  the amount of mr clarke’s commission under this plan was    mr madar the chief executive officer did not receive any cash bonus for  or for years   and  however as discussed above under the heading “base salary” over the past  years net income of us operations has grown from a loss of  in  to a profit of  million  accordingly after several years with no increase in his base salary for  in addition to his base salary jean madar holding sas his personal holding company will receive  for services to be rendered outside of the united states by mr madar in his capacity as chief executive officer also for  any further bonus compensation for mr madar would be at the discretion of the compensation committee   as required by french law interparfums sa maintains its own profit sharing plan for all french employees who have completed three months of service including executive officers of our european operations other than mr benacin the chief executive officer of interparfums sa benefits are calculated based upon a percentage of taxable income of interparfums sa and allocated to employees based upon salary the maximum amount payable per year per employee is € or approximately         calculation of the total annual benefits contribution is made according to the following formula    of interparfums sa net income less  of shareholders’ equity without net income for the year times a fraction the numerator of which is wages and the denominator of which is net income before tax  wages  taxes other than income tax  valuation allowances  amortization expenses  interest expenses   contribution to individual employees is then made pro rata based upon their individual salaries for the year   longterm incentives   stock options we link longterm incentives with corporate performance through the grant of stock options all options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares of our common stock on the date of grant and terminate on or shortly after severance of the executive’s relationship with us unless the market price of our common stock increases corporate executives will have no tangible benefit thus they are provided with the additional incentive to increase individual performance with the ultimate goal of increasing our overall performance we believe that enhanced executive incentives which result in increased corporate performance tend to build company loyalty as a general rule the number of options granted is determined by several factors but most importantly both individual and company operating results for the past year as well as past option grants to such executives   for executive officers of united states operations and european operations we typically grant nonqualified stock options with a term of  years that vest ratably of a year period on a cumulative basis so that the option will become fully exercisable at the beginning of the sixth year from the date of grant in addition option grants to purchase shares of our majorityowned french subsidiary interparfums sa have a term of  years and vest  years after the date of grant however no options were granted by interparfums sa to any executive officers during  and    we believe that the vesting period of these options serve a dual purpose  executives will not receive any benefit if they leave prior to such portion of the option vesting and  having a vesting period matches the service period with the potential benefits of the option pursuant to our stock option plan nonqualified stock options granted to executives terminate immediately upon the executive’s termination of association with our company this termination provision coupled with a vesting period reduces benefits afforded to an executive when an executive officer leaves our employ   over the past several years as our company has grown and the market price or our common stock has increased messrs madar and benacin have realized substantial compensation as the result of the exercise of their options as the two executives most responsible for continued growth and success of our company the compensation committee believes the granting of options is an appropriate tool to tie a substantial portion of their compensation to the success of our company and is completely warranted        the actual compensation realized as the result of the exercise of options in the past as well as the future potential of such rewards are powerful incentives for increased individual performance and ultimately increased company performance in view of the fact that the executive officers named above contribute significantly to our profitable operations the compensation committee believes the option grants are valid incentives for these executive officers and are fair to our shareholders generally we grant options to executive officers in december of each year   in december for each of the years  upon the recommendation of the company’s chief executive officer the compensation committee granted options to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock to each of jean madar and philippe benacin at the fair market value on the date of grant option grants to messrs madar and benacin were identical as each is the chief executive officer of their respective operating segments also in december for each of the years  the compensation committee granted options to purchase  shares to mr greenberg the chief financial officer at the fair market value on the date of grant the compensation committee determined that the option grants for messrs madar benacin and greenberg which have remained the same for years  were reasonable so based upon the recommendation of the chief executive officer it determined to keep the option grants for such executive officers at the same level for    in december  options to purchase a total of  shares were granted to messrs santi and garciapelayo which were the same amounts as the aggregate amount granted in december  and january  to messrs santi and garciapelayo these amounts represent an increase as additional compensation for their contribution to the efforts of the united states based operations as compared with  when options to purchase  shares were granted to messrs santi and garciapelayo   stock appreciation rights our  stock option plan authorizes us to grant stock appreciation rights or sars an sar represents a right to receive the appreciation in value if any of our common stock over the base value of the sar to date we have not granted any sars under the  plan while the compensation committee currently does not plan to grant any sars under our  plan it may choose to do so in the future as part of a review of the executive compensation strategy the interparfums sa stock option plan does not have stock appreciate rights   restricted stock we have not in the past and we do not have any future plans to grant restricted stock to our executive officers however while the compensation committee currently does not plan to authorize any restricted stock plans the compensation committee may choose to do so in the future as part of a review of the executive compensation strategy        other compensation   mr benacin is the chief executive officer of interparfums sa european operations as well as a founder of our company and we believe we should recognize his responsibility skills and experience as well as the results of the company for  mr benacin received an automobile allowance of € which is the same amount paid in   and    no stock ownership guidelines   we do not require any minimum level of stock ownership by any of our executive officers as stated above messrs madar and benacin are our largest beneficial shareholders which align their interests with our shareholder base in keeping executive compensation at a reasonable level   retirement and pension plans   we maintain a k plan for united states operations however we do not match any contributions to such plan as we have determined that base compensation together with annual bonuses and stock option awards are sufficient incentives to retain talented employees our european operations maintain a pension plan for its employees as required by french law   compensation committee report   we have reviewed and discussed with management the compensation discussion and analysis provisions included in the annual report on form k for fiscal year ended december   and the proxy statement for the upcoming annual meeting of shareholders based on this review and discussion we recommend to the board of directors
