thanks jean good morning everyone and thank you for joining us to review steve maddens fourth quarter and fullyear  results with me to discuss the business is derek browe the companys director of finance and investor relations we ended the year on a good note delivering fourthquarter eps at the high end of our guidance range while consolidated sales for the quarter declined modestly from last years fourth quarter due primarily from softness in our private label footwear and coldweather accessories businesses we had another quarter of outstanding growth in our steve madden womens wholesale footwear division we also achieved strong gross margin improvement as our ontrend product assortments and robust sellthrough at retail enabled us to reduce closeouts and minimize markdown allowances overall our financial performance for the fullyear  was solid particularly in light of the challenging retail environment we faced throughout the year and the struggles of many of our key wholesale customers sales for the year were approximately flat at  billion and diluted eps was  a  increase compared to  we also made progress on a number of key initiatives that position us for growth going forward let me briefly touch on the highlights first and foremost we had outstanding performance in our core steve madden womens wholesale footwear business steve and his design team created exceptional products across a range of categories that kept us ahead of our competition the trendright merchandise drove strong sellthrough performance on the floors and websites of our wholesale customers which in turn resulted in increased orders from those customers for the year our steve madden womens wholesale footwear division had a net sales increase of  an impressive feat given the soft overall performance and destocking initiatives of many of our largest wholesale customers in addition we increased initial markups and reduced closeouts and markdown allowances in steve madden womens resulting in significant gross margin improvement which was the primary driver of the  basis point consolidated gross margin improvement we recorded in  as we head into  we continue to have strong momentum in this business with sellthrough performance thats outpacing the competition and great feedback from our wholesale customers on our new styles strong steve madden womens product also benefited our retail segment in  where we delivered a solid  comparable store sales increase on top of a robust  same store increase in the prior year in addition to the comp increase we expanded the store base from  stores at the end of  to  stores at the end of  driven primarily by new store openings in the outlet channel as well as openings in international markets in  we expect to open seven new stores to eight new stores and to close one location another highlight in  was the outstanding performance of our newer brands dolce vita and blondo dolce vita net sales increased approximately  for the year crossing the  million mark and operating margin reached the midteens continuing to drive wholesale growth in dolce vita will be a priority in  as will the relaunch of dolcevitacom with a new mobilefirst design blondo was also a bright spot since our acquisition of this brand in early  we have evolved the product line to include more fashionable styling combined with the waterproof technology that blondo has always been known for we call this waterproofing the trends and the response from wholesale customers and consumers has been outstanding in  blondos us business experienced rapid growth particularly with its largest customer nordstrom leading to overall sales growth for the brand of  margins were also up dramatically and profitability for the year more than doubled from  based on the feedback that weve received from our partners and customers we believe that there is an appetite for blondo footwear outside of the boot category and in  we are testing expansion of the brand into new categories most notably sneakers we delivered our first sneakers last month and the early read looked very good another area of focus for the company is expanding our digital presence both in wholesale and retail in wholesale we continue to grow with both the pureplay ecom players like amazon and zappos as well as the ecommerce businesses of the traditional bricksandmortar retailers like nordstromcom and macyscom the aforementioned businesses represent our four biggest ecommerce accounts and our sales to them were up a combined  in  and in our own retail segment we continue to invest in our four branded websites in  we launched a new mobile app for steve madden and as i mentioned earlier we will be relaunching dolcevitacom in  our own ecommerce properties grew  on a combined basis in  another important strategic step we took in  was the formation of sm europe joint venture with spm shoetrade that manages the steve madden footwear and handbag business in much of europe including germany france england switzerland the benelux region scandinavia central europe and the baltic states consumer demand for the steve madden brand in europe has increased dramatically over the past few years and we decided that the time was right to transition from a distributor model to a joint venture model in these territories by operating the business directly with our joint venture partner rather than through a distributor were able to better control the merchandising and overall brand positioning in the market and by cutting out the middle man were able to offer a more compelling price value proposition to the consumer we are thrilled with the results so far and building our business in this region will be a major area of focus for us in the years to come at the tail end of the year we also wound down our relationship with our distributor in asia in preparation for transitioning to a new business model in that territory we are currently working towards forming a new joint venture for china and potentially other parts of asia and are targeting a relaunch in the region in the back half of  we believe there is tremendous opportunity in china and the rest of asia for steve madden and we look forward to providing you updates throughout the year on our progress on this endeavor finally we continue to use our strong balance sheet and healthy free cash flow to generate returns for shareholders in  we repurchased over  million shares or approximately  of the company including open market repurchases and shares acquired through the net settlement of employee stock awards and on january  of this year we acquired schwartz  benjamin which specializes in the design sourcing and sale of licensed and private label footwear and is known for its outstanding capability in the designer and accessible luxury space schwartz  benjamin had  net sales of approximately  million and its current brand partners include kate spade rebecca minkoff alice and olivia and avec les filles we see significant opportunity to expand the business and enhance its profitability by combining schwartz  benjamins strengths which include premier execution in the design and sourcing of highquality footwear as well as a strong portfolio of brand partners with our proven business model and infrastructure transaction was completed for approximately  million in cash at closing plus an earnout based on financial performance through january   we expect the deal to be approximately neutral to eps in  excluding onetime transaction integration costs and to be accretive thereafter in summary while we faced a tough retail environment over the last year we delivered solid financial performance and made progress on a number of key strategic initiatives as we enter  we have strong momentum in our core business and we are confident that we are well positioned to drive sales and earnings growth and create shareholder value over the longterm with that ill turn the call over to derek to review our financial performance in more detail and provide our outlook for  derek browe  steven madden ltd thanks ed and good morning everyone as ed mentioned we were pleased with our financial results for the fourth quarter considering the challenging retail environment our fourth quarter consolidated net sales modestly declined  to  million compared to the prioryear net sales of  million as sales growth in our retail business was offset by decrease in our wholesale segment as we look at the wholesale segment wholesale footwear net sales decreased  to  million compared to  million in the prior year driven by continued softness in our private label business and a decline in our international distributor business we were pleased however to see another quarter of doubledigit growth in our core steven maddens womens wholesale business which benefited from a strong product assortment additionally other footwear brands such as dolce vita blondo betsey johnson and superga all performed well in wholesale accessories net sales were  million in q compared to  million in the prioryear period we were pleased to see growth in our handbag business however softness in our coldweather accessories more than offset the growth in handbags retail net sales increased  to  million and samestore sales increased  on top of a  gain in last years fourth quarter strong performance in sneakers offset softness in boots and booties during the fourth quarter we opened two full price stores one in mexico and one in south africa additionally we added a new outlet location we ended the quarter with  companyoperated retail stores including  outlets and  ecommerce sites turning to other income our commission and licensing income net of expenses was  million in the quarter versus  million in last years fourth quarter while first cost commission income and licensing royalty income were down versus the prior year during the quarter we were pleased that our consolidated gross margins expanded  basis points to  compared to  in the prior year this expansion was driven by an increase in our wholesale gross margin wholesale footwear gross margin increased to  for the quarter compared to  in the prioryear quarter the improvement was driven by our ontrend product assortments which led to higher initial markups and lower markdown allowances and closeouts additionally we benefited due to sales mix wholesale accessories gross margin rose to  compared to  last year due to higher margins in coldweather accessories which despite lower sales had better sell through retail gross margins were  compared to  last year the decrease in our retail gross margin was primarily the result of our decision to proactively clear through slower moving product mostly casual boots and booties while this negatively impacted the fourth quarter margin it enabled our stores to showcase newer trends and left us in much cleaner inventory position heading into the first quarter in addition retail gross margin was also negatively impacted by fx at our foreign retail locations continue to see margin contraction due to the strength of the us dollar since the vast majority of their inventory purchases are in us dollars operating expenses for the quarter increased to  million or  of net sales compared to operating expenses of  million or  of net sales in the same period last year operating income for the quarter totaled  million or  of net sales compared to last years fourth quarter operating income of  million or  of net sales our effective tax rate for the quarter was  compared to  in the same period last year lower rate reflects the benefit of investing in our international business as well as the benefit from exercising and investing of stockbased awards provided as compensation and finally net income for the quarter was  million or  per share diluted compared to  million or  per diluted share in the fourth quarter of  with that id like to briefly touch on fullyear results consolidated net sales for  decreased  to  billion from  billion in the prior year net income was  million or  per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to net income of  million or  per diluted share for the year ended december   net income in  included an aftertax net benefit of  million related to early lease termination of the companys th avenue store location as well as an aftertax loss of  million related to the partial impairment of the companys wild pair trademark moving to the balance sheet which we are pleased remained strong as of december   we had  million of cash and marketable securities and no debt inventory increased  to  million compared to  million in the prior year our onhand inventory was flat to the prior year but intransit inventory was higher due to the earlier chinese new year as well as forecasted sales increases in q we are comfortable with both the amount and the content of our inventory position our consolidated inventory turn for the last  months ended december  was  times and our capex in the quarter was  million bringing our fullyear capex to  million during the quarter we repurchased approximately  shares for approximately  million and for the full year we repurchased over  million shares for approximately  million this includes shares acquired through the net settlement of employee stock awards now to our guidance for the fullyear  we expect that net sales growth will be  to  and expect that diluted eps will be in the range of  to  the eps guidance assumes a tax rate of approximately  up from  last year forecasted increase in the tax rate impacts  eps negatively by approximately  now id like to turn it over to the operator for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and well take our first question from erinn murphy with piper jaffray erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co great thanks good morning ed i was hoping you could unpack a little bit how youre thinking about the major sales drivers for  i guess if you were to back out the acquisition it seems like the organic growth underpinning that is about  to  so maybe just help us rank kind of the biggest drivers to get there both from a footwear as well as an accessory perspective edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd sure so if you look at footwear we are at low doubledigits including the acquisition in wholesale footwear but youre right that if you back out – i think that schwartz  benjamin is going to add about  to the wholesale footwear growth rate so were probably looking at sort of  to  wholesale footwear growth for the year and – excluding schwartz  benjamin and thats really sort of up  in branded down  in private label so much stronger growth in the branded piece and weve talked about where we have nice momentum there and most notably steve madden womens in terms of accessories i think you should think about that as kind of a midsingledigit grower and same for retail and i think thatll get you to the annual numbers erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co okay thats helpful and then just the private label can you just talk about how you are thinking about payless within that down  is that the majority of the shortfall there edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd no i cant – we wouldnt address our forecast for a specific customer but i think that all we can provide is that were looking at down  for the overall private label footwear erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co okay fair enough and then just on the eps im a little surprised there wasnt more flow through just given the strength of the top line so if you could just walk through what youre seeing from an sga perspective and are there any onetime costs from the acquisition in the guidance edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd sure i mean so just to highlight what were looking at there youre right that the sales growth is  to  but keep in mind theres  million in there from schwartz  benjamin which weve said is not going to contribute or is going to be neutral from an earnings standpoint so the sales growth is sort of   on the low end to   on the high end of the guidance excluding schwartz  benjamin and i think the earnings growth were looking at is high singledigits if you back out the tax impact so i think its a reasonable relationship of earnings growth to sales growth erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co yes got it okay and then just on gross margin youve seen some good kind of imu improvement over the last year can you talk about kind of your outlook for gross margin in  and just help us think about maybe first half versus second half whats your visibility there edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd sure i think when you put it altogether gross margin could potentially be up very modestly i mean maybe  basis points for the year because youve got some puts and takes in terms of mix there on the wholesale footwear side weve got – excluding schwartz  benjamin weve got branded growing faster than private label so thats a mix benefit however schwartz  benjamin is a mix negative and that really offsets the other impact so thats why youre looking at flat or up very modestly for the year i think the opportunity is a little bit better in the first half as opposed to the back half in terms of yearoveryear comparisons operator well take our next question from camilo lyon with canaccord genuity camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc thank you good morning guys how are you edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd good morning camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc so just going back to the commentary on private label ed if you could just maybe talk about how youre viewing – whats embedded in the guidance from a protective stance given some of the headlines that weve seen around some of your private label customers and any sort of offsets that you have also that can serve to mitigate any one particular customers shrinking of sales edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd really other than what weve already provided which is that were planning the private label footwear business down about  i cant – theres not much more i can comment on there certainly wouldnt comment on any specific customers as i said weve got a lot of potential offsets to that and thats why the sales growth that weve embedded in the guidance or the guidance includes positive sales growth because weve got great momentum in steve madden womens weve got strong momentum in another of our – a number of our other brands whether its dolce vita blondo betsey johnson superga et cetera weve got the new program called madden nyc at kohls which will be a benefit this year so weve got a lot of positive things happening in the business camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc and is it right to assume that those positives and mainly the incremental initiatives like madden nyc at kohls is there a gross margin benefit thats greater than some of your private label gross margin businesses that would actually yield to a significant greater gross profit dollar improvement edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd well youre absolutely right that these branded businesses that we were just talking about including madden nyc at kohls carry a higher gross margin than the private label footwear business im not going to speculate on exactly where the gross profit dollars are going to come out on individual businesses but youve got the overall guidance which incorporates all of our assumptions there camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc got it and then – and just to be clear that theres no incremental expectation of risk associated with some of these private label customers relative to where youve guided do you feel like youve appropriately guided to manage that downside risk edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd yes weve tried to take a pretty conservative look at that camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc great and then as it relates to schwartz  benjamin if we go back to blondo and even dolce vita when bought those brands understanding theres a greater licensing component to schwartz  benjamin versus wholesale for the prior two if i remember correctly i think your profitability improvement particularly on dolce vita was pretty fast it sounds like youre not expecting any profitability improvement so it remains a breakeven business for schwartz  benjamin this year is there an opportunity to fast forward the profitability realization in the back half edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd yes i think that there is potential to start seeing some earnings contribution in the back half we still think for the full year the right way to look at it and the prudent way to look at it is basically breakeven in terms of eps but we do expect to start to – were fast at work on integrating the business and finding some cost savings where we can and so we would expect to start to see some improvement in the back half and then start to see earnings accretion in  camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc got it and then just lastly i think youve increased the amount of skus that are on autoreplenishment by  times over last year if you could just help us understand what that means to your business and how much flexibility that gives to inseason reorders because that was kind of an issue last year despite what were very good sellthrough rates edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd yes were really pleased with what were seeing out of our replenishment business as you point out we have more styles on replenishment now than we ever have before in our steve madden womens business i think were up to  styles on replenishment in steve madden womens as a point of comparison historically in many seasons that was only one or two styles that we would have on replenishment so that means weve got a lot of styles that are core styles where were getting weekly orders and it generates sales with high margins and limited markdown liability so we like that quite a bit and we have one department store customer or one big retailer that im thinking of in particular i think is doing about a third of their business right now on replenishment and so thats something thats really driving a lot of business for us and highmargin business for us so were pleased about that camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc sounds great good luck in the year thanks ed edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd thanks camilo operator well take our next question from jay sole with morgan stanley jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc great thank you ed i just wanted to ask you about inventory on the balance sheet it looks like the inventory is up about  yearoveryear but your commentary suggests the inventory is in line can you explain the inventory situation right now and why it looks higher a little bit on the balance sheet than maybe the commentary suggests edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd yes its a good question as derek mentioned briefly when he touched on it in the formal remarks we were actually flat on hand so the inventory that we actually had on hand in our warehouses and our stores et cetera was flat but we were up significantly in intransit inventory and a very big piece of that was the timing of chinese new year this year chinese new year was almost two weeks earlier i think it was  days or  days earlier so we had to have more products on the boat at yearend or in transit that was a big piece of it we also do have a sales forecast increase in q for  and so needed some more intransit inventory to support the sales and then the last thing ill just mention is we have to think about the composition of sales because we have different businesses that have different – require more or less inventory so the private label business that we are projecting to be down that has no inventory the branded business that were projecting to be up does require inventory and so theres a mix issue thats part of the equation there as well jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc got it and then you touched on the challenging retail environment is that something where – is that different from what weve seen over the last few quarters or is that really a factor of the tax refund delays can you just talk about what youre seeing in the environment now that kind of led to that comment edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd no i was really talking more broadly about what weve been seeing over the last  months in the industry and the challenges that many of our big wholesale customers have faced as we all know many of them have been comping negatively a lot of them have been seeing very weak store traffic trends and so thats really what we were referring to jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc okay and then maybe one last one for me can you just talk about how schwartz  benjamin fits into the overall portfolio is it addressing maybe a gap where there was a business opportunity that your brands really werent touching on or how does the deal fit in overall edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd yes i think what we like about it is that its a complementary capability because it really adds a capability in that higherend segment of the market and an expertise in designing and sourcing really highquality footwear at higher price points and also they have very strong customer relationships at places like neimans and saks where we historically have not done a lot of business so we just think it really rounds out the offering i think that we felt very good about our capability if you think about sort of steve madden or even dolce vita price points and down we felt like we would match up our capability against anybodys but when it got into that accessible luxury space or designer space it was not where we really had a lot of expertise and thats what schwartz  benjamin brings jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc got it thanks so much edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd thanks jay operator well take our next question from corinna van der ghinst from citi research corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc thank you hi good morning guys i think you had said previously that the backlogs are down again going into this year similar to the kind of ordering behavior that you guys saw from sale last year but could you talk about how your reorders are trending or how you expect them to trend into this spring season and does your topline guidance today assume a higher level of reorders than last year edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd so reorder activity has been very strong for us for the last few quarters and it continues to be very strong yes i believe reorder activity particularly in the first half is up in the guidance to be honest with you we really dont look at it that way but yes it is trending higher and i expect it will be higher particularly in the first half corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc okay great and then maybe you could talk a little bit about your momentum in europe right now it sounds like its been going pretty well so far where exactly is that growth coming from in terms of markets and where do you see the biggest nearterm opportunities for the brand as youre looking out into this year edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd yes were off to a really good start there i think were seeing strength in a number of markets germany holland the uk even poland where weve got a few franchise retail stores open that are exceeding plan so we feel very good about what were seeing really across a number of different countries i think the highlight is really what were seeing with the online accounts so zalando asos amazon the business is really flying with them and were exceeding expectations there and weve got some pretty healthy growth plans from those customers so were going to really look to focus on that corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc and are those trends that you guys are seeing out there are those similar in terms of like the styles that are working is that something thats a similar readthrough from what youre seeing in the us edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd yes very similar corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc okay great and then lastly you did mention amazon in europe but could you just touch on how that amazon business is proceeding and also if there is any tax refund impact on your consumer thanks edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd sure yes amazon continues to be a very important growth account for us and only getting more important you guys as you know its something that weve started putting a lot more focus on maybe  months to  months ago and were really pleased with the dividends that were seeing there from that increased investment in time and resources the business is just growing very dramatically and theyve given us a very aggressive growth plan over the next four or five years and so were going to continue to focus on it in terms of tax refunds i think that there is some impact to us we dont know exactly what that looks like but its really a timing impact and its not something we spend a lot of time worrying about corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc okay great thanks so much edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd thanks cori operator well take our next question from scott krasik with buckingham research group scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc hey ed and derek how are you doing edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd good morning scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc so i guess without giving quarterly guidance is there any progression to the year that we should think about either in terms of sales growth or eps growth that youd want to call out edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd the only thing i would call out is that despite the fact that we have a tax headwind in q we actually think that the eps growth yearoveryear will be strongest in q and theres really a couple of things driving that the biggest one is that we just have this really strong momentum in our branded wholesale footwear business right now and were seeing some really strong performance in q there and thats our most profitable business so thats a big driver and then secondarily in wholesale accessories we do have an easier compare in q as opposed to the remaining three quarters and so were looking for better performance yearoveryear there as well in q scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc interesting okay and then in terms of sm asia you mentioned you were looking at a joint venture there is any of that contemplated in the guidance and what would that entail either from an investment standpoint an expense standpoint and then potentially revenues edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd yes we dont have that in the guidance right now but – and i think its too early to speculate about what exactly that will look like but what i will say is that i would expect the financial impact this year certainly from a profitability standpoint to be very modest i would say pretty immaterial certainly we cant expect it to be a profit contributor right off the bat but also were not talking about a plan that requires a ton of investment and requires us to incur significant losses at the outset either so i dont think its something that you really need to build into your models scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay thanks and then on schwartz  benjamin  million in sales in  sounded like you were planning for  million in  just wondering what portion of that is kate spade and then as the noise heats up that kate spade is a potential acquisition target how would that impact those sales in the change of control edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd sure so just one point of clarification yes youre right we did say  million just keep in mind thats for the  months that were going to own it so its not necessarily that were expecting that the business declines by  this year its just that were not owning it for the full year cant disclose the sales by brand for schwartz  benjamin kate spade is a meaningful brand for them its one we hope we have for a very long time we do have a license agreement that runs through the end of  and so we expect to have the brand or we will have the brand through the end of  no matter what happens with respect to the kate spade review of strategic alternatives but certainly we would hope that wed be able to keep the brand in a renewal period beyond  as well scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay all right well thanks and good luck edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd thanks scott operator well take our next question from tom nikic with wells fargo tom nikic  wells fargo securities llc hey good morning guys i was wondering on the wholesale footwear side i was kind of wondering about the margin difference between the branded and the private label and if theres any sort of help you could give us on that end and then i was also wondering on the tax rate i know it was really lumpy quarterbyquarter last year i think q was really low after you adopted the new accounting standard for stock compensation and i was kind of wondering if it should sort of follow a similar pattern this year thanks guys edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd with respect to the gross margin branded versus private label keep in mind private label is significantly lower private label is in the teens and the branded gross margin it really varies by brand but its in the high s low s for many of our brands derek do you want to address the tax derek browe  steven madden ltd sure yes tom i mean you did see a little bit of unusual activity throughout this year but as we look at  and as we mentioned in our remarks that its kind of baked in the ish tax rate for the year and as we kind of look at this year were looking at it more consistently through the first three quarters with maybe a little bit lower in the fourth quarter i think thats the way we should think about it tom nikic  wells fargo securities llc all right sounds good best of luck this year edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd thank you operator well take our next question from jeff van sinderen with b riley  company jeff van sinderen  b riley  co llc good morning i know its really early but just wondering if theres any color on reads on some of the spring product maybe in some of the warmer weather markets just wondering if theres anything there to relay maybe we can start there edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd yes we feel really good about what were seeing in terms of consumer reaction to our spring product in terms of category the first thing we have to call out is sneakers our sneakers are just flying and that continues to become a more and more important category for us in steve madden womens in our steve madden womens wholesale business sneakers for q we expect to be in the lows as a percentage of the total which is the first time weve ever been up that high so thats something that were excited about in terms of other categories footbeds are also performing very very well for us mules are performing very very well the next thing i would call out is novelty is performing great so whether its patchwork pearls floral prints fur theres a lot going on in terms of novelty that were having a lot of success with and that creates a lot of excitement on the shoe floor and its a nice complement to what we talked about earlier which is also at the same time having a lot of core replenishment product particularly in the sneaker and dress shoe categories jeff van sinderen  b riley  co llc okay good to hear and then just wondering if theres any more you can give us on how we should think about growth in dolce vita and then also in brian atwood especially i was wondering if the schwartz  benjamin acquisition will have an impact on brian atwood this year edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd yes in terms of dolce vita obviously thats been a tremendous success story for us we talked about the brand being up nearly  in sales last year should see growth in  certainly were not expecting it to be to the same level but we still feel good about what were seeing in that brand and then i think you made a good call on brian atwood obviously having schwartz  benjamin under our umbrella makes a – we think it makes a lot of sense to have them work on b brian atwood and potentially even brian atwood and so thats what were working on the plan with them and with brian for that and we hope to have something to talk about maybe even on the next call jeff van sinderen  b riley  co llc okay good to hear continued success thanks edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd thanks jeff operator well take our next question from steven marotta with cl king  associates steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc good morning guys can you talk a little bit about the weighting of schwartz  benjamin throughout the year with the exclusion of course the month of january which you didnt own it are there any material differentials from quartertoquarter edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd third quarter is the biggest followed by fourth followed by second followed by first because we only owned it for two months steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc okay edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd we dont have the percentages of total for each but that would be directionally the weighted steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc thats fine and as it pertains to the current revenue penetration run rate for pureplay ecommerce what is it roughly and what would you expect that to grow at in  edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd im sorry can you say that again the penetration of ecommerce steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc pureplay ecommerce as a percent to total sales more or less again on a run rate basis and what you would expect that growth to be in  edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd i dont have that number off the top of my head if i had to – i mean its in the singledigits maybe midsingles something like that and growing much faster than the overall steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc right edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd but i wouldnt put a number on it steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc we can talk about it more offline thank you thats all i had edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd thanks operator well take our next question from sam poser with susquehanna sam poser  susquehanna financial group lllp good morning thanks for taking my question a few things can you talk about how youre viewing – what the opportunities are with the madden nyc line at kohls and then the impact that youve built into your guidance from payless liquidation edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd on madden nyc thats something that were pretty excited about thats a new brand that were offering them so far on an exclusive basis its in about  doors and weve got a range of product categories in there not only the shoes and accessories that we do but weve got some licensed categories that are important there like activewear and outerwear and so far were very pleased with the early sellthroughs just hit stores over the last month or so and so were optimistic about the future there in terms of payless as i mentioned earlier were not going to comment on our forecasts for any specific customer sam poser  susquehanna financial group lllp all right and then can you also talk – theres been a lot of conversation about how the shrinking pie youve got a lot of your – a lot of retailers are closing doors or being cautious can you talk about the kind of share gain that youre seeing and how you view that how you look at all that edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd yes clearly were seeing particularly in steve madden womens brand very nice share gains in all of our key retailers and many of them are seeing their overall businesses either flat or even declining but our business is growing nicely with them because were taking share just over the last couple of days we heard about another of our big retailers who said theyre cutting their plans for everybody except for steve madden going forward so were very pleased that were taking share and that were an outperformer right now but also we would prefer if the overall environment was healthier and the customers were doing better overall because of course a rising tide lifts all boats sam poser  susquehanna financial group lllp thanks and then two other things one can you talk about how – sort of how these various brands that youve acquired over the last few years are interacting and how your plan for them to interact for instance with the banana republic business being done through schwartz  benjamin is that something that steve madden sourcing mechanism may be able to do better while as you mentioned brian atwood it may be better within the schwartz  benjamin sourcing mechanism are you going to utilize any waterproofing type technologies that currently exist in blondo and other brands i mean and how is all of this starting to gel i mean youve got a lot of benefit from top line a few years ago how do you see how all of this sort of works together including dolces sourcing mechanism edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd theres a lot there look were always looking for ways to get synergy out of the various brands and businesses that we own that being said were also very careful to make sure that the various brands that we have in our portfolio retain their own identity and that always means a dedicated design team that also means a dedicated sales team and in many cases that means dedicated sourcing so we do look for ways to get cost savings and synergies where appropriate but we also want to make sure that we dont start to make everything look the same so happy to address any of those specifics with you offline i think theres probably too much for me to cover on this call sam poser  susquehanna financial group lllp thank you good luck and continued success edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd thank you operator well take our next question from camilo lyon with canaccord genuity camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc hey ed just a followup on a comment you made earlier regarding q sales being the strongest given the strength that steve madden womens is experiencing and the comment around you getting an incremental amount of openbuy orders and your net share gaining benefit that youre seeing at retail why would that strength decelerate as the year progresses in wholesale footwear as you face easier comparisons so just want to make sure i have the cadence right or understand exactly whats embedded in the guidance edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd i think were just telling you what we see today and so we have obviously very good visibility into q i think we have to be – recognize that steve madden womens is a big business and its primarily distributed into channels that are not growing themselves and so i dont think its sustainable for a long period of time to look at very very robust sales growth or at least it wouldnt be prudent to forecast it that way so i certainly hope that we can continue to see the type of sales growth that were seeing in q going forward but its not something that we would put into our plans and then the other thing ill just comment on is at least with respect to steve madden womens the comparisons do get tougher as the year goes on we were singledigit last year a singledigit grower in steve madden womens in first half last year and a strong doubledigit grower in the back half camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc okay theres nothing that suggest that that momentum cant continue though despite the sm comparisons given that theres just fewer players that are executing at your level edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd were going to do our best to continue the momentum for sure camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc great and then just rounding out my questions mexico do you have can you just address any sort of puts and takes around your exposure there i know that theres a lot of volatility around policy decisions but how youre planning your business around mexico and what are the risks and benefits that we can understand a little bit better around that at this point edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd in terms of our sourcing from mexico thats been on the decline having nothing to do with any trade policy out of washington but simply because the types of looks that we source out of mexico has been declining so that hasnt been the trend so whereas years ago when we were doing the trueup out of mexico it was something like  of our overall sourcing now its down to about  out of mexico and headed south so we do think that mitigates the impact of any potential change in trade policy including renegotiation of nafta in terms of our business in mexico because we also have an operation in mexico were performing well there on the top line but we have seen a profitability impact due to the strength of the dollar against the peso because obviously weve seen a very dramatic strengthening of the us dollar against the peso and because our mexican subsidiaries is primarily buying in us dollars and then selling in pesos there is a margin impact there in addition to just the impact of the translation back to us dollars for our reported financials camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc got it thanks ed for the clarity edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd thank you operator we have no further questions in queue at this time i would now like to turn the conference back over to ed rosenfeld for any additional or closing remarks edward r rosenfeld  steven madden ltd great well thank you very much for joining us on todays call and have a great day and we look forward to speaking with you on the

would now like to turn the call over to ed rosenfeld chairman and ceo of steve madden edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer thanks megan good morning everyone and thank you for joining us to review steve maddens fourth quarter and fiscal year  results with me to discuss the business is derek browe the companys director of finance and investor relations we delivered solid financial performance in  bouncing back after a tough  successfully capitalized on some new fashion footwear trends recorded strong growth in both sales and earnings in our retail and ecommerce business made significant progress in building our newlyacquired dolce vita and blondo brands and further expanded our international presence as expected our earnings performance improved as the year progressed and we finished  with both net sales and eps up about  for the year the year ended on a good note in the fourth quarter despite an overall tough retail environment we delivered eps growth of  in q on the strength of margin improvement in both wholesale and retail we achieved this growth during one of the warmest seasons on record which pressured seasonal products like boots and cold weather accessories and contributed to a heavily promotional retail environment before i turn the call over to derek to walk you through the financials let me spend a few minutes recapping the year in a little more detail first steve and his design team did a great job in  of creating fashion forward products that resonate with our consumers our dress and fashion sneaker offerings were particularly outstanding the ontrend merchandise assortment led to a dramatic improvement in our retail segment performance retail comparable store sales were up  for the year and operating margin for our retail business expanded  basis points we remain pleased with the momentum in our retail business and expect continued improvement in  as we work toward our goal of a  operating margin in this segment while the strong product assortment also resulted in improved sellthrough performance in the wholesale channel our overall wholesale footwear financial results were negatively impacted by a number of factors during the year including the lingering effects of a challenging  the west coast port slowdown in the first half and the extremely unfavorable weather in the back half as we entered  we have better momentum with our key wholesale partners than we did a year ago and are confident that we can show sales and earnings improvement versus  in this segment that being said the overall tone among most of our largest wholesale customers is one of caution we are planning our business accordingly within the wholesale footwear segment the biggest highlight in  was the progress we made with our newest brand acquisitions in dolce vita our strategy of focusing our efforts on the flagship dolce vita brand paid dividends dolce vita was a clear outperformer at retail in tough fall season and as we head into  the brands positioning with both retailers and consumers is stronger than its ever been we also executed on a number of operational initiatives and the result was a business that went from losing money in  to a  operating margin in  for spring  we have relaunched the diffusion brand dv as exclusive brand to target in footwear and handbags and for fall  we are launching dolce vita apparel under licensing agreement with amerex group overall we couldnt be happier with the direction were headed in dolce vita we are also really pleased with what were seeing in blondo the waterproof boot brand we acquired in early  blondo sales in the us were up approximately  in our first year of ownership of the brand overall sellthrough performance was good particularly in light of the unfavorable weather and we expect another year of strong growth in  turning to wholesale accessories we had a solid year in  with net sales up approximately  compared to  our handbag business performed well both branded and private label had strong gains for the year but we did see pressure on this business in q which we expect to continue into q  due to overall weakness in the handbag market and excess inventory in the channel our cold weather accessories business was of course challenged in  by the historically warm weather in the back half and we see opportunity for improvement in that division in  overall were expecting our wholesale accessories business to be approximately flat in  compared to last year finally we continue to make significant progress on our most important longterm growth initiative which is growing our business internationally overall international sales were up  in  our net sales to international distributors were up  compared to the prior year with particularly strong gains in asia and the middle east in our sm mexico which we acquired in late december  had an outstanding first year under our ownership with retail comps in excess of  and wholesale sales up over  in local currency in sum we had a good year in  stabilizing our core business after a challenging  and taking significant steps forward on our key initiatives we entered  with positive momentum our brands are outperforming the competition and we are confident in the strength of our current product assortments that said we are cognizant that many of our wholesale customers are taking a cautious approach to initial orders in the wake of a tough fall season and therefore we are planning our business conservatively in the near term as we look out farther however we remain as optimistic as ever about our companys longterm growth prospects given the underlying strength of our brands and our business model as well as the significant opportunities we have available to us with that ill turn the call over to derek to review our financial performance in more detail and provide our outlook for  derek browe  director of finance and investor relations thanks ed and good morning everyone turning to our financial results for the fourth quarter consolidated net sales grew  to  million compared to prior year net sales of  million during the quarter sales growth in both our wholesale footwear and retail businesses was mostly offset by a decline in our wholesale accessory business our wholesale net sales in the quarter decreased  to  million wholesale footwear net sales increased  to  million excluding sales from acquisitions the wholesale footwear segment was down  overall the boot category was soft particularly tallshaft boots though we did have strong success with overtheknee boots and some of our ankle booties additionally our dress and sneaker offerings were strong during the quarter as they have been throughout  in wholesale accessories net sales declined  to  million in q compared to  million in the prioryear period the decline was partially driven by the unseasonably warm weather which had a strong negative impact on our cold weather accessories business the decline was also attributable to a shift of handbag sales from q into q and lower sales from our offprice channel in our retail division net sales increased  to  million our comps were once again strong at  an impressive result given we had a comp decline in the boot and bootie category which accounts for more than half of our retail mix in the fourth quarter during the quarter we opened one fullprice store in mexico and three outlet locations in the us we ended the quarter with  companyoperated retail stores including  outlets and four ecommerce stores turning to other income our commission and licensing income net of expenses was  million in the quarter versus  million in last years fourth quarter despite the headwinds from a very promotional environment we increased our consolidated gross margin by  basis points to  compared to  in the prior year with increases in both wholesale and retail wholesale gross margin increased to  from  last year due to improvements in both the wholesale footwear and accessories segments gross margins in the retail division increased to  compared to  as strong product performance resulted in higher fullprice selling and lower promotional activity as compared to the prior year operating expenses for the quarter were  million or  of net sales which was consistent with the same period last year when operating expenses were at  million or  of net sales operating income for the quarter totaled  million or  of net sales compared to last years fourth quarter operating income of  million or  of net sales our effective tax rate for the quarter was  compared to  in the same period last year and net income for the quarter was  million or  per share diluted compared to  million or  per share diluted in the fourth quarter of  now id like to briefly touch on fullyear results consolidated net sales for the year increased  to  billion compared to  billion in  operating income for the year totaled  million or  of net sales compared to  operating income of  million or  of net sales operating income for  included a net benefit of  million related to an early release termination of our fifth avenue store location as well as a  million loss related to the partial impairment of our wild pair trademark both in the first quarter of this year our net income for  was  million or  per diluted share this compared to net income of  million or  per diluted share in  our balance sheet remained strong as of december   we had  million of cash and marketable securities and no debt inventory increased  to  million compared to  million in the prior year our consolidated inventory turns for the last  months ended december  was  times and our capex in the quarter was  million bringing our full year capex to  million during the quarter we repurchased approximately  million shares for approximately  million and for the full year we repurchased over  million shares for approximately  million now turning to guidance for fiscal year  we expect that net sales will increase  to  over net sales in  diluted eps for fiscal year  is expected to be in the range of  to  now id like to turn it over to the operator for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you well take our first from camilo lyon with canaccord genuity camilo r lyon  canaccord genuity inc thanks good morning guys how are you edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer good morning camilo camilo r lyon  canaccord genuity inc if we could just start off ed and just – could you talk about how the different channels are performing with regard to your wholesale footwear business where are there incremental pockets of weakness or caution as youre seeing the first of the year start to flow through and if we think about the good product that youre bringing to market compared to the overall cautionary stance by your wholesale partners where is there an opportunity for kind of a reorder scenario to occur should demand trends normalize after we get out of this kind of lingering q holiday cold weather scenario edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer sure well in terms of the first part of your question which was about the difference in performance by channel i actually think that were not seeing as much variation by channel currently so whereas that was something that we were calling out for a good chunk of  right now i dont think were seeing a big difference between what were seeing – seen in say department stores offprice or as private label accounts et cetera i think that what were seeing is that overall on the whole wholesale customers across the spectrum are pretty cautious a lot of holiday fall holiday sales overall were not great a lot of folks missed their sales plan a lot of folks had elevated inventory levels and theyve moved to try to get those in line and theyve also turned a little bit more cautious with their order patterns going forward the good news is for us that we believe weve been an outperformer with the vast majority of our big wholesale customers in terms of sellthrough we clearly have momentum with the brand and with our product which you can see with our own retail comps and so we believe that were going to do better than our peers and that in fact our big wholesale customers are planning our business better than our peers but clearly its overall a cautious environment i think the second part of your question was where are there – where is there ability to – for upside here is that right camilo r lyon  canaccord genuity inc yeah it just seems – well just going to the topline guidance of  to  it just seems that we strip out some of the acquisition benefit that youre kind of looking for kind of flattish to maybe up orso growth in the front half and it seems like thats sort of running through the year first is is that a correct read and second it sounds like – it looks like youre taking the conservatism thats being placed in your q business and running that through is that in fact what youre doing and really not anticipating any material improvement in the business edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i mean first of all i want to just clarify i know you understand this camilo but just for everybody listening that we have anniversaried all of the acquisitions so there isnt any inorganic growth here i think what you are referring to is that some of the more recent acquisitions have the potential for stronger growth in the near term but it is its not growth through acquisition per se i guess i want to just clarify that yeah i mean we have – the guidance does assume that there – it does not assume i should say any dramatic improvement in the overall environment if inventories get cleaner and the wholesale customers see good sellthroughs and start to get more aggressive with order patterns that would certainly be an opportunity for upside and i think wed be very well positioned to benefit from that and to chase into that demand should it develop camilo r lyon  canaccord genuity inc and still on that topic of inventory its come down from last quarter still a little bit elevated i think probably more than youd like it to be can you just talk about the composition of that inventory and if there were an increase in demand when would we likely be – when would we see that materialize its probably not in q but when would that – when could there be a matching of inventory that you have on hand versus incremental demand from your wholesale partners edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer youre asking about our inventory on our balance sheet not in the channel correct camilo r lyon  canaccord genuity inc correct edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i feel actually pretty good about the inventory level for us if you strip out the acquired businesses sm mexico and blondo were up by  at yearend and i think more importantly i feel good about the composition of inventory and the inventory content there in fact i think particularly in our retail segment the composition of that inventory is a little bit healthier than it was a year ago so i think youll continue to see inventory levels converge towards sales thats something thats been happening recently keep in mind i dont think they should be exactly in line with sales growth on a consolidated basis because our retail business is growing faster than our wholesale and as you know our wholesale business turns three to four times faster than our retail business so on a consolidated basis when retail is growing faster youre always going to see inventory growing faster than sales camilo r lyon  canaccord genuity inc okay and then just the last one i had on – you mentioned the strength in retail despite some of the cautionary stance at the wholesale channel youve had really good comps pretty much throughout the year youre coming up against some very difficult comparisons in  is there any – can you help us understand how we should think about some of the progression around your retail comps given the incremental product youre bringing to market thats been received well and some of the positive trends that youre seeing in the business today edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah so we do we are going up against doubledigit comps for each of the next few quarters but i dont continue to feel good about the momentum that we have in our retail business and i think that we do have an opportunity to comp positively against the doubledigit comps we have cautioned people that clearly q in particular is a very tough comparison were up  comp in last years q but overall we continue to feel good about what were seeing in our retail business camilo r lyon  canaccord genuity inc well thanks a lot ed ill jump back in the queue good luck edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer thanks camilo operator well take our next question from erinn murphy with piper jaffray erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker great thanks good morning i guess just circling back on one of camilos question just at on the sales guidance for the year of  to  decelerating from the  last year i mean is that just more of a nod to the overall environment decelerating or is there something else fundamentally that we should be aware of just that step function change i just – i guess i wouldve thought that the organic growth wouldve come back a little bit stronger and i know theres some caution around kind of replenishment or just stuff thats not fully in there but just any help you can give us on just the magnitude of the deceleration would be very helpful edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i mean i dont – i guess i would just – i wouldnt characterize it as deceleration because in fact if you strip out acquisitions we were actually down i think it was  last year so we are expecting an improvement from that to the  to  because there is no acquisition growth again in  as to why its not faster than that yeah i think thats really a function of the overall environment but were still over  wholesale and most of our wholesale customers are quite cautious right now the other thing is we did call out some nearterm headwinds in the hand bag category and so were looking at our wholesale accessories business to be about flat this year and then i guess the last thing i would touch on is that we do have some negative fx impact in our international businesses particularly canada and mexico which have created a little bit of a drag erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker okay thats helpful and i guess if you were to then think about now that the acquisition – i guess acquisition growth is now organic and in the base – could you just maybe  for us how youre thinking about the biggest drivers of growth within like the dv blondo and i guess sm mexico as well as we go into  where are you expecting to see the most growth out of i guess newlyacquired businesses edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i think that you had them in the right order i would say dolce vita is first erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker okay edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer blondo would be second and sm mexico would be third part of that is the function of the size of those businesses though dolce vita is just a significantly bigger business than the other two on a percentage basis were going to see quite – we expect to see quite strong growth in blondo and in sm mexico again on a constant currency basis were looking for strong growth but unfortunately at this moment when we translate that back to us dollars that fx impact is chewing up a lot of that growth erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker okay got it and then i guess in terms of some of the newness that youre seeing in footwear and now that were cycled through kind of the winter season can you just talk about what youre seeing in terms of dress sneakers or any other categories that are really standing out to you guys right now edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah clearly fashion sneakers is a category that were just really excited about what were seeing there really exceeded our expectations and weve really just developed a really strong presence in that category we went from having one real hall of fame style to now having a full collection in the category and with high tops low tops flipons laceups all performing and i think that particularly if you look at really fashion footwear players at our price point weve really developed a market leadership position in this category so were really excited about that dress shoes you mentioned and you hit the nail on the head there because thats also been a really strong category for us particularly the opened up dress shoes the dress sandals were really excited about particularly some of the things that were doing out of brazil were having an opportunity to do more products out of brazil because of the strength of the us dollar against the real and we think weve got some great product coming out of there with a real strong price value proposition and the customer is really responding to it so those are a couple of categories that were probably the most excited about i guess id also call out heavy heels as something thats really important right now anything with the leg wrap continues to do well so weve got a good amount of trends to sink our teeth into which were pleased about erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker okay and then i guess just longerterm i mean you guys have talked about an operating margin in the midteens how comfortable are you with that target at this point and kind of how are you thinking about the path or the timeframe to get there thanks edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i think that there is – we continue to think that thats the right longterm target i dont think theres anything structurally thats going to lead us to believe that we cant get there however were looking this year to be essentially flat the guidance implies essentially flat op margins and so i think that we have to – its going to be a couple of years before we can get to that midteen target erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker got it and then sorry just one more clarification the buyback is not included in your eps guidance for the year is that correct edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer correct erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker okay thank you guys edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer thanks erinn operator well take our next question from jay sole with morgan stanley jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc hi good morning edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer good morning jay jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc just wondering if we can dig into the guidance a little bit just on gross margin and sga how are you thinking about those two line items and then as well as the cadence for earnings growth as we go through the four quarters of the year edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer sure yeah so i mentioned the flat op margin i think that we think theres some opportunity for modest gross margin improvement but at this sales growth rate we would give a little bit of that back in terms of higher sga as a percentage of sales and thats how we get to the flat operating margin for the year in terms of the earnings throughout the year with a quarterly breakdown i dont think theres a heck of a lot to call out in terms of seasonality thats different from what youve seen previously other than that in some respect i think q is our toughest quarter at least in comparison to the prior year i think that were looking for little to no eps growth in q and the reason for that in addition to just what weve already laid out which is wholesale customers taking a cautious approach coming off this tough fall holiday season but in q its really where were seeing the pressure on the handbag business and weve seen particularly in the offprice channel weve seen a pullback in that handbag category we felt that in q were feeling that again in q as those offprice retailers have elected to or because theres so much excess inventory out there theyve elected to buy closeouts as opposed to upfront buys from us so thats creating some pressure on q the good news is that we see that coming back for q and our order file supports that so i think that pressure will ease as we go forward but thats definitely a little bit of a headwind in q jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc okay got it and then if i can just ask one fashion question can you touch on mens how is that business been developing whats your expectation for the year in mens edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah so mens was another business that came under pressure in q and as business slowed down as boots did not perform well and we saw retailers start to pull back because they were seeing their inventories get a little out of whack we actually felt that pretty acutely in mens even more so than in womens in q so we had a decline in the mens business in q were still – again thats another one that weve got some pressure on q as retailers continue to try to get their inventory in line but again here we see this business picking back up for q based on the order file that we have in hand and the conversations that we had with our retailers at the platform show in las vegas last week so that business again a little bit of pressure in q but we see that coming back in for q and you asked about the fashion the thing thats helping us i think in q and going forward is that the dress category specifically the fashion dress category is coming back and thats a category that we have a very nice position in jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc okay got it thanks so much edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer thanks jay operator well take our next question from corinna van der ghinst with citi corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc broker hi good morning ed derek could you maybe talk about or give us a sense of percentagewise maybe of how much of your second tier business is moving towards an inline model as opposed to purchasing smus upfront and are you concerned about the change in visibility that that creates and just in terms of potential cannibalization from your more traditional inline wholesale accounts like macys edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer no were definitely not concerned about it in fact i think that its a positive development for some of these retailers to do more of that business and really have the most fashion forward product that we have and its also helping them to raise their aurs to some degree in terms of a percentage its still a relatively small percentage of that overall pie that youre talking about i dont have the number but its a small percentage still corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc broker okay great and then i was wondering how ecommerce performed versus your expectations this quarter did you guys see a greater shift within your directtoconsumer channel this holiday and can you maybe talk about some of the initiatives that you have on the docket this year as you lap the replatforming from last year edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah ecommerce did outperform bricksandmortar for us in q as it did for most we were up about  comp in our ecomm business that does not include the growth which was much stronger than that in canada because we launched the new stevemaddenca last year but that will come into the comp i believe in q of this year but were continuing to see real strong performance out of our ecommerce business were very pleased with what were seeing from that channel and theres a lot of things we continue to work on just to strengthen it as you know were still in the process of bringing some of our brands on to the new platform and the next one is going to be dolce vita which we hope to get up on our new platform sometime in junejuly corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc broker okay great and then just lastly kind of a bigger picture question on supply chain you guys have clearly had a competitive advantage in terms of your speedtomarket just as the broader industry also kind of shifts from initial opentobuys to more atonce orders are you guys seeing more of your competitors move to a faster model or model thats closer to home or can you give us your thoughts on where you guys stand versus the competition edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i think that everybodys trying to get faster and that just creates pressure on us to continue to try to get faster as well at this moment i still think we have a speedtomarket advantage over our key competitors and its going to be a strategic imperative for us to continue with that corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc broker great thank you edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer thanks cory operator well take our next question from taposh bari with goldman sachs taposh bari  goldman sachs  co hey guys good morning ed question for you so a lot of your retailers are struggling has been an ongoing theme for a while not sure when it ends but i guess the question for you is do you feel like your fate is dependent on their success at a high level maybe ask this a different way you have things like acquisitions international dtc opportunities im curious to see if those are areas that you are looking to accelerate in light of the environment that you are managing through in the us edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i think that thats a – its a good point youre raising and certainly we do have to look for some alternative places to grow when some of our key wholesale customers are not showing a lot of growth so international is clearly a big priority here you saw the strong performance we had in  and were very focused on continuing to grow that business you are seeing us grow our directtoconsumer business faster than the wholesale business were adding particularly new stores on the outlet side as well as growing our ecommerce business and in fact the growth from the new brands so all that is important that being said the us wholesale footwear in particular market is still very very important to us and we need to find out how to grow there and were working pretty hard with our wholesale partners to do that were also looking at some of the channels that are showing faster growth so whether thats some of the pure play ecommerce guys or some of the offprice retailers were looking at ways to grow with them taposh bari  goldman sachs  co great and then just a quick followup on the category call it fashion footwear for teen women that you obviously are concentrated in about a year ago it feels like thats when your tone improved for the first time in a while do you feel like – are you still feeling equally as optimistic on the fashion cycle for the product that you are operating in and if not whats changed edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer i do i feel quite good about where we are in the fashion cycle and the opportunities that we have available to us in terms of fashion trends to capitalize on so that part im not worried about taposh bari  goldman sachs  co okay thanks guys edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer thank you operator and well take our next question from jessica schmidt with keybanc capital markets jessica l schmidt  keybanc capital markets inc hi thanks for taking my question i guess just given some of the heavier inventories in the channel can you talk about what you are seeing in terms of prebuys with the offprice channel i know you mentioned fewer upfront orders in handbags but what are you seeing in footwear edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i think that if you look at at least our numbers compared to last year it looks a little bit better in footwear but keep in mind we had a pullback in  for that very reason that some of the offpricers were electing to buy fewer upfront goods and focusing more on closeouts so i think that business has now stabilized and we can grow off that slightly smaller base but we have not really – i just also want to say we havent seen the pendulum swing back either to where it was pre so were looking for a kind of modest growth in that channel in footwear and again some pressure in that channel in handbags jessica l schmidt  keybanc capital markets inc great thanks and just quickly on the handbag market so it seems like thats gotten more challenging you mentioned excess inventory i guess where are you seeing this and just given some of the changes youve made in  to your offering how are you positioned if the environment does get more promotional edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer well in terms of where were seeing the promotions i mean i think thats pretty widespread across the spectrum it was particularly in holiday a pretty promotional category in terms of what were doing from a product perspective i still feel that were on the right track and as i said despite the sort of nearterm headwind in q we do see that with this business starting to rebound in q and i think that well be back on a better path as we move into the back half jessica l schmidt  keybanc capital markets inc and then just quickly are you seeing any performance differences by region i know that you had talked about some touristimpacted areas a while ago i was wondering if you were seeing anything in maybe some oilimpacted regions and if any of the tourist markets have seen some improvement edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah in terms of the regions that would be impacted by oil we just dont have a very heavy exposure there we have seen some impacted traffic in sales but its not a needlemover for our overall retail business or our overall consolidated results the one thing that weve called out that we continue to see is this weakness in new york city which we attribute to the tourism impact again in q while we had a  consolidated comp we had a down comp in new york city and i think that were still seeing pressure there i think that hopefully were going to start to lap this in a couple of months and be able to start to see some positive comps there again but were not there yet jessica l schmidt  keybanc capital markets inc thanks ill pass it along edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer thank you operator well take our next question from jeff van sinderen with b riley jeff van sinderen  b riley  co good morning and id just like to have a followup on the retail segment maybe you could just touch a little more on the performance of your outlet stores versus fullprice and then maybe also how your newest outlet units are performing versus your plan and then i know you also mentioned the – i think there was a closure of one new york store maybe just if you can touch on that edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer sure the outlets are performing well were pleased with what were seeing there they were actually stronger than the fullprice stores in fourth quarter for the full year outlets were up about  and fullprice stores were up  so both quite strong but a little bit stronger in outlet and were also pleased with what were seeing in the profitability there the fourwall operating margins are a touch higher now in outlets than they are in fullprice stores in terms of the new stores were also on track in terms of productivity of the new stores so were pleased with what were seeing there and youll see us open another say  to  outlets again in  in terms of the store closure i think you might be referring to in first quarter of last year we closed our th avenue location i cant think of anything else in new york that closed since then jeff van sinderen  b riley  co okay got it yeah thats what i was thinking of thanks and then as far as international just maybe any more color you can give us on where you are most confident that you can grow this year what sort of progress we should look for maybe by country there this year edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah well overall again international remains a real important growth opportunity for us i think that i still view the middle east as a really important growth region for us and i think we should see some nice growth there in  weve got very strong partner in the uae as well as in saudi arabia as well as in israel so were excited about that and im also – were working on some things in europe which hopefully well be able to talk about on the next call which should fuel some growth in that region as well jeff van sinderen  b riley  co okay and then finally is there anything in terms of opportunities you might have this year for sourcing supply chain anything thats shifting there that could potentially help you edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer i think the biggest thing is is what i mentioned earlier which is being able to – because of the strength of the us dollar were able to work more in terms of – in some other regions that we havent been able to as much of late so were doing a lot more sourcing out of brazil thats probably the most important but were also doing more sourcing out of italy and we think that were able to get product with – that just really has a real value to the consumer out of those countries and its a product that just frankly wasnt affordable for our price point a few years ago so thats probably the most significant thing obviously theres been the revaluation in china as well and we are capturing some benefit from that some of that were putting back into the product to try to increase the value proposition there and some of it well capture in gross margin and of course some of it well have to share with our wholesale customers jeff van sinderen  b riley  co got it okay thanks very much and good luck for the rest of the quarter edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer thanks jeff operator well take our next question from sam poser with sterne agee sam poser  sterne agee crt good morning thank you for taking my call ed just real quick what share count should we use for the full year edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer given that we dont have any buybacks in the guidance it should be pretty similar to where it was in  sam poser  sterne agee crt so about  million edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah thats a round number sam poser  sterne agee crt okay and then when you look at the samestore sales for the year ahead – i mean you had some really good numbers i mean should we be thinking about low singledigits with q being in the flat range is that a good way to think about it or do you think youd do a little better than that edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer we dont – we really dont provide comp guidance so ill leave that to you to build your model there sam poser  sterne agee crt you can always change what you do edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer i appreciate i appreciate the offer sam poser  sterne agee crt when we looked at like macys and dillards just came out with their numbers the other day and their inventories look like they were pretty much in line with sales are they beginning to get clean the guidance that you are providing was that guidance basically as what you were seeing as of december  or is this guidance as to what you are seeing today edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer the guidance incorporates our most updated thinking in terms of inventory in the channel yes i do believe that retailers – many of our wholesale customers have moved through a lot of inventory recently i think they are getting cleaner i wouldnt say that across the board everybody is exactly where theyd like to be but theyre certainly much better than they were at the end of december sam poser  sterne agee crt at then at platform there was some commentary on some of your new product i believe it was some of the opentoed dress some of the sneakers and a few others and i think some of the flat sandals that you were already starting to see some reorders now i just want to – i think it was one of the first questions asked i mean the guidance youve given is basically your visibility now but thats going to probably change a lot by the end of march when easter comes and depending what the spring looks like is that a fair statement edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah thats a fair statement and as you know sam relative to – many of our competitors or many of the companies that you guys look at we work close to season and we chase pretty darn well because of our speedtomarket capability so there is clearly potential for things to get better but this is what we see today sam poser  sterne agee crt and then lastly you talked about brazil and italy can you give some idea of sort of the percentage that you produced in  out of those markets or shipped out of those markets versus what that percent of your total buys are looking like for  because i would think youre going to save a lot of money on freight and you can make smaller runs without it costing you a fortune out of those markets as compared to china if im not mistaken edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i would say if you look at what were ordering right now and were just talking about the steve madden line because of course many of the more moderately price lines are still exclusively out of china but if we think about just steve madden its only around  out of china weve got  out of brazil another  out of mexico  out of italy and about  other which would include india and some other places i hope that added up to  sam poser  sterne agee crt it was a little more but edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer but anyway i dont have off the top of my head what brazil and italy were last year but meaningfully smaller than that sam poser  sterne agee crt and when you combine mexico which i also gather would be growing when you add mexico in those three countries youre talking about the ability to come a lot faster to market and at significantly less freight cost i would think on a yearoveryear basis edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer thats right sam poser  sterne agee crt okay well thank you thank you very much and good luck edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer thanks sam operator well take our next question from scott krasik with buckingham research group mr krasik your line is open scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc yeah sorry about that thanks for squeezing me at the end here just some followups international what percentage of sales was it in  edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer  scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc  and then dv how much in sales roughly edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer it was around  million in  scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay and then blondo if i remember correctly the us portion when you bought it was sub million is that edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yes scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay good thanks and then the dv at target rollout both shoes and handbags is that all q is that spaced out over q q whats the expectation for fall and just generally speaking how meaningful can this be edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer just one clarification on blondo it was sub million when we bought it in the us not anymore scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc right edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer in terms of dv yeah the initial shipments there were in q of  so you did have that showing up in last years numbers in december so youll see more of that throughout the year im sorry what was the – and what was the final part of the question scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc well just what is the plan for fall going forward and then how meaningful is this compared to maybe candys or peak or some of the other big programs youve had edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer look its an important brand for them its all door in shoes and bags and its doing very well its exceeding plan in terms of what the sales numbers look like thats particularly for something like this thats one account we dont disclose that scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc but you are going forward for fall in both categories edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer yeah yeah we expect this to be a longterm brand in the store scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc and then it seems like there are a lot of tailwinds in terms of the gross margin outlook for  but youre only guiding to modest improvement we would have expected i guess a little more recovery so whats holding that back edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer well i just think that its a challenging overall environment thats all and so i hope that we can get a little bit more than what i articulated earlier but this is what were seeing at the moment scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc so assumptions around additional markdown support could be an upside a place for upside or youre just forced to compete and to get market share you have to give better term upfront pricing whats the edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer well look we have not assumed any material improvement over  in terms of markdown support so if we can do better than we did last year that would be upside scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay that makes sense and then did you say how many stores youre going to open in  edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer derek you want to derek browe  director of finance and investor relations we didnt scott the plan is to do five to seven fullprice store openings but thats going to be mainly in canada and mexico and then on the outlet side i think ed commented that thats an area well continue to focus openings were looking at  to  scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay awesome thanks very much guys edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer thanks scott operator well take our next question from corinna freedman with bbt corinna lynn freedman  bbt capital markets hi good morning guys quick question on the apparel for dolce vita it does appear to be a bit more refined than its previous foray into apparel im wondering if you can talk about the changes in strategy there going forward and then does this open the door for standalone retail stores that would include apparel and then my second question is on the core steve madden line are there any other opportunities in dress and athletics to take up pricing it does seem like you have more styles over  this year than you did last year thank you edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer sure yeah in terms of the dolce vita apparel as you point out they – prior to us acquiring the business they did have an apparel line for a few years and it actually did pretty well was not a tiny business but i think – but they had closed it prior to us acquiring the business and the reason was i think that they felt that while it was doing well it wasnt  aligned with the footwear and wasnt really consistent with the vision for the brand and so weve now licensed it out and worked very closely with the licensee to make sure that this apparel line really has that dolce vita brand essence and i think its much more in line with what were doing to shoes and were really pleased about it so were excited to see how that does when it starts shipping in fall of this year in terms of aurs well see selectively where we can try to push price if we have great quality dress shoes for instance out of brazil there may be an opportunity to get a little bit more on those products but given an overall environment thats not particularly robust we also want to be careful about trying to push price too much we really want to make sure were delivering great value for the price corinna lynn freedman  bbt capital markets great thank you so much edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer thank you operator well take our next question from steve marotta with sic cl king  associates steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc good morning ed and derek edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer good morning steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc considering that seasonal weather patterns play such a large role in retail traffic trends and there is an inventory overhang currently with a little bit of winter merchandise in the wholesale channel whats better for steve madden in the next four weeks if we were to look for mile markers as it pertains to weather is it cold weather in order to clean up what – is this winter overhang in the wholesale channel or is it warmer weather in order to spur your fullprice selling what are you rooting for edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer i think wed still rather have warm weather and sell a lot of the spring goods steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc thats helpful and second question is i had to join the call late did you comment at all on quartertodate trends either at wholesale or companyowned retail edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer we did not steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc still a few minutes left in the call edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer no i dont think so steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc no worries thank you much edward r rosenfeld  chairman  chief executive officer thanks steve operator with no further questions in queue id like to
