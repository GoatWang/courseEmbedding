capacity to endure by designing projects of the utmost quality contextual sensitivity flexibility and performance we produce work that not only succeeds in the near term but also builds value over time as our practice has grown we have reinforced this strategy by incorporating the latest methods and technologies to maximize occupant comfort while lowering longterm operating and maintenance costs reducing consumption of nonrenewable resources and minimizing waste and negative environmental impacts during the construction process applying our global experience at a local scale we develop holistic solutions that are unique to place climate and program and are evaluated through regional environmental performance standards such as leed breeam three star and estidama among others we extend this approach beyond the individual building to the realm of urban design with the core belief that density as opposed to sprawl is the best way to address the worlds most pressing issue rapid population growth and consequent migration into cities the tall tower is a key part of this sustainable paradigm in which individual buildings form part of a larger system of vertical centers linked by horizontal networks of public transportation rather than objects in isolation these transitintegrated mixeduse vertical cities represent a sustainable model for future development whereby public transport is encouraged land is conserved and energy and water uses are reduced we apply this philosophy not only to our work but also to the way we run our business developing design and operations targets monitoring changes reviewing strategies and reporting progress publicly we strive to continually improve the firm and increase our positive contribution to the environment through business and design practices that are consistent with our broader social and environmental values the leed gold certification of our headquarters in new york city is one of many examples of how we fulfill this longstanding commitment we are also active members of the united nations environment programme sustainable buildings and climate initiative unepsbci the us green building council usgbc and the uk

management team  david gurzenski  alan lukes proud distributor of jr watkins naturals products  all natural country store independent watkins management team  david gurzenski  alan lukes proud distributor of jr watkins naturals products  welcome welcome to the  all natural country store  proud distributor of jr watkins naturals all of us remember fondly certain products that our moms kept their kitchens baths and medicine chests that made our childhoods special that’s why when we first considered a homebased business to help ends meet alan remembered watkins his folks were always watching the family budget carefully shopping for the best bargain on necessities imagine his surprise when he requested further information about starting a homebased watkins business in february of  and received a company catalog in flipping through the pages he recognized a number of items – in the same packaging – that lined the shelves of his boyhood home  but more importantly the prices seemed quite reasonable in comparison with some of the bigname brands that line the shelves of our big supermarket and drug store chains the man behind watkins j r watkins was a wise man not only did he create a company that has been around since  he realized that people will most likely buy a product if they hear about it from a friend or tasted it in their friend’s home he also realized that rather than pay for expensive advertising and marketing or pay a store owner a commission to sell his products friends could tell their friends about watkins and earn that commission themselves america’s first directsales company was on its way watkins also stood behind his products and offered the country’s first moneyback guarantee today you will see a line on bottles and jars that indicate customers should use the product until the contents reach that level if the customer is not satisfied for any reason they will be refunded their full purchase price just imagine how easy it is to sell products with that kind of guarantee behind them a commitment to quality as watkins matured as a company it grew because of its commitment to quality as well as its goal to create additional products that help sustain the planet for future generations  we suppose you could say that watkins was this country’s first green company long before the term was ever used  no wonder the company has experienced such a long successful history of course it is nearly impossible for watkins to be sold doortodoor as it was for many years today with the growing popularity of online shopping it has become even easier for individuals to launch a watkins homebased business the support you receive from individuals who have successfully been doing this for many years is amazing it is with this kind of support that our all natural country store has become a thriving homebased business we invite you to explore this site review this month’s specials and check out the full watkins catalog
