  am edt by mfv franchise expo shutterstock photo bio after managing more than  preparers in  offices for hr block john hewitt identified that the future of tax preparation needed a technological

father created and also outperform the competition with superlative customer service by  jackson hewitt was the second largest tax preparation company and sold for  million by then hewitt was ready for a new business venture but after brainstorming with some of his trusted colleagues they decided that they knew and loved one thing taxes and they knew they could do it better by starting over so

tell us about the liberty tax service concept the concept of providing excellent customer service and keeping the customer happy so that they become a repeat customer isnt new but so few companies act on it they talk a good game but they dont do the research and the follow up it requires changing the status quo thats where liberty tax is different we deliver for example if you come into our offices and have to wait more than  minutes we pay you we truly do put the customer first our dedication to unparalleled customer service and delivering the wow factor is what we call the liberty edge  we deliver the little unexpected extras that make people take notice and feel appreciated how and when did you decide on liberty tax service it really did start on a napkin some of my most trusted colleagues and i sat down and wrote on the back of a napkin  things we would do differently from what we had done in the past to create an environment of success we wanted to take on the lb gorilla in hr block and the company that bore my name jackson hewitt people thought we were crazy  insane but we vowed to implement some of those  ideas we acted on what we knew was the right way to do business and we succeeded what was your background prior to liberty tax service when i was  years old i started a job as a tax preparer and it was the most interesting job i had ever had i enjoyed the work immensely and it showed i quickly climbed the ranks becoming a district manager and then the youngest regional director in hr block history at the time of course i then went on to found jackson hewitt

experience and proven track record remember the two certainties in life death and taxes well we must also embrace the third certainty  change while other companies flounder to understand market changes at liberty tax we respond and move forward what are some of the greatest lessons youve learned in growing this franchise that im still learning in starting a business you need to really test your concepts and ideas test test and retest be willing to go back to the drawing board also treat your employees as if they are your best paying customer because in reality they are the daytoday representatives of your company and probably the most important lesson i learned when you put your heart and soul into a company always have a controlling interest do you have a mentor and is there someone you use for inspiration my father was a great mentor he advised me on when to get in and when to get out of a career situation we were both visionaries he showed me the vision of computerized tax preparation and when we couldnt convince hr block to buy our program he convinced me to start my own retail tax company he was a great supporter and motivator what advice do you have for someone looking to acquire a franchise the passion has to be there you have to be committed to your success follow the system that the franchisor has put in place and follow the advice they give be prepared

liberty ceo talks lawsuits  franchising posted tue   by bmm virginia beach — ceo john t hewitt weighs in on how his franchising firm liberty tax service is coping with the challenges of a lack of business loans for franchise owneroperators the state of california suing the tax preparer and the federal government clamping down on tax refund loans hewitt’s  years in the tax preparation industry starting at hr block nysehrb leaves him arguably its most seasoned leader after his former employer turned down hewitt’s vision of using software to prepare taxes he branched out on his own in  his company became jackson hewitt tax services nysejtx a leader in electronic tax filings the cofounder left the chain when cendant corporation a conglomerate of hotel real estate and car rental franchisors bought it for  million john hewitt founded liberty tax services in  according to worldfranchisingcom the online publication of franchise researcher source book publications liberty tax services has  franchise units and  companyowned units it is a tough environment for tax preparers on many fronts on october   meta financial filed a report announcing that the office of thrift supervision had determined that metabank had engaged in alleged deceptive practices which were in violation of federal trade law on october  the company announced that subsidiary metabank had been blocked from entering into contracts for refund loans that federal action is causing repercussions on october  hr block a tax preparation franchising firm that has over  franchised offices sued hsbc bank saying that the bank was no longer backing up hr block’s taxrefund loans but that its contract obliged it to do so hewitt responds “this new development adds a level of complication for many small tax preparation offices as metabank is one of the few financial institutions still participating in refund loan product disbursements seemingly this directive might very well not allow metabank to continue offering products for taxrelated programs many tax preparers will be left without any option to provide an accelerated refund loan” bmm while on the topic of regulators and lawsuits in  liberty tax service lost a deceptive ad suit to california’s attorney general regarding the  million win california attorney general jerry brown said “liberty tax service lured cashstrapped californians into paying for highcost loans when they could obtain tax refunds free from the irs just weeks later” he explained that liberty tax services print and television ads misled customers by promising most refunds in  hours this ruling bars liberty from deceptive advertising that blurs the line between irs tax refunds and pricey loans said brown pretty strong words what happened hewitt about six years ago california went after jackson hewitt hr block and liberty saying that we violated some obscure law in our case they did not have a customer complaint what happened is that they first settled with jackson hewitt jackson hewitt paid them close to  million jackson hewitt had been doing business in california since  liberty did not enter the california market until  we are a lot smaller so we said that we would settle if jackson hewitt did x amount of products and you penalized them for  million we did  percent as many products that the complaint is about so we will settle for  percent of  million they said “no no no no these are fines you have to pay  million or  million we said “wait a minute we are only  percent as big” california sued all of us as we were preparing for trial hr block settled it only paid  million we said if hr block paid  million we only handled  percent of the returns that block did so we are only guilty of  percent we should only pay  but we will put a  offer on the table they would not take it and we would not settle we took it to trial and lost i think the total judgment added up to  million right now the lawsuit is at the court of appeals bmm according to worldfranchising the state with the largest number of liberty tax franchises is california with over  offices is this lawsuit affecting franchisees hewitt no not at all california did not sue the franchisees data franchise times worldfranchising the international franchise association signed an amicus brief in the appeals court because they californias attorney general office said we the franchisor were vicariously liable for the actions of our franchisees even though what happened was that some of our franchisees in los angeles ran some ads that were not approved in the franchise agreement it says that you cannot run ads that aren’t approved yet the franchisee violated that and ran ads in this little teeny penny saver in northern los angeles in violation of internal revenue service statutes the franchisee ran them for two to three weeks without our permission as soon as we saw them we shut them down and stopped them from running the ads the state held that not only did the franchisee break the law but that we the franchisor were also responsible for breaking that law that is unprecedented i don’t think there is any other court case or major court case where a franchisor is found guilty for a franchisee breaking the law california is a tough place to do business there was another thing that was very unusual with two of our products loans and tax refunds it works like this a customer comes in and you say “sir you have a  refund your fee to me is  if you pay this fee then you get  in ten days or if you don’t want to pay the  you can pay an additional  fee and we will withhold it from your refund so instead of getting  you don’t pay me anything today but you’ll get  less  less the  fee in two weeks we are the only ones liable for this jackson hewitt and block because they settled aren’t subject to this they california said the  is a loan and subject to interest and all kinds of stuff liberty has to give different disclosures to our customers than hr block or jackson hewitt we said that we would settle for the same language as block and jackson hewitt use the court said “no no” so it is all at the appellate court now bmm how tough is it right now to sell franchises hewitt it is a tough time in previous recessions when i have been a franchisor franchise sales actually increased as whitecollar executives were laid off they wanted to control their own destiny they said they didn’t want to be put in the position again where they could be laid off many of them would take severance money and move into a franchise in this recession more people than ever are just frightened to death that was especially the case back in  when many potential buyers felt that the economy was going into a depression nowadays even if they want a franchise such as our franchise which can be bought for a low investment of  that includes everything people just do not have  in their checking account they typically have cash tied up in their home but they have not been able to draw equity out of their home for the last two years or they have money in a k retirement plan in  the k plans became  k’s what i mean is that retirement funds lost  percent of their value people just do not have discretionary money today so a lot fewer people have money to take the leap to become selfemployed when you are selfemployed it is going to take you two three or four years before being able to draw major cash out of the business it is a tough time to start a business so franchise systems are down across the board in bringing in new franchisees bmm how are you dealing with the shortage of franchise buyers hewitt on wall street they call me a serial entrepreneur that is because this is the third company i have been successful with in making investors a lot of money it is a lot easier for me to tap into money than for a lot of people for example liberty tax services has a  million line of credit and our line of credit is so good that it is only a little over libor london interbank offered rate it is about  percent it is not even a yearly line of credit but a fiveyear line of credit and we still have three years left liberty pays it back every year at the end of the year we have no debt liberty uses most of that money not for us but to lend to franchisees to expand we have lent franchisees  million over the last ten years to grow their businesses so we go out and get the money what we had to do over the last three years was finance more of that  in initial investment we have never done that before on average instead of people putting in the entire  we are now lending them a third of that to help transition into our franchise system we have stepped up our lending to firstyear franchisees normally in years past before the recession we lent money to second thirdyear or older franchisees but now we have to lend in order to pull new people into the business the second part of this interview with john hewitt will be published shortly in it mr hewitt discusses his attempt to acquire hr block and jackson hewitt he also provides insights into independent franchisee associations average select
