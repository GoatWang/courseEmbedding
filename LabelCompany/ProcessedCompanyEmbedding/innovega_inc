wearable displays that are free from usual bulky optics announced today that it has demonstrated megapixel eyewear in a compact and stylish formfactor management now intends to accelerate delivery of designs components and licenses to selected strategic partners innovega will be exhibiting at the  international ces event from booth   in the ballroom at the venetian hotel “conventional mobile device screens are too small to read and certainly too small to enjoy over the past months we have demonstrated contact lens enabled eyewear for mobile devices including smartphones portable game devices and media players that deliver panoramic highresolution experiences for entertainment and planned augmented reality ar applications” said steve willey innovega ceo “during this same period we collaborated with partners to finalize initial specifications of launch platforms” willey added “unless the display industry can deliver transparent highperformance and compact eyewear developers of ar and other compelling media applications will simply fail to create the excitement that consumers crave and the functionality that professional users absolutely need” innovega’s new and natural interface comprises familiar lightweight eyewear working with advanced contact lenses one hundred million global consumers including more than  of america’s  to  yearold already wear contact lenses with low switching costs innovega expects many will join other early adopter groups who wish to access rich media while remaining fully involved in their realworld activities management believes that consumers will be thrilled to wear and benefit from its new lensbased eyewear given the unique combination of benefits that this new interface offers innovega designers and partners considered the future of personal media social networking and mobile computing and converged upon an aggressive designpoint that meets today’s needs as well as demands of highperformance ar which require a seethrough and panoramic display interface innovega refers to its innovative product as a ‘lifestyle interface‘ since consumers view their digital content in a way that is similar to how they see the world around them by providing a transparent fashionable and comfortable interface that is consistent with today’s active lifestyles the architecture also eliminates the social barrier that traditional opaque and bulky video eyewear seems to create the innovega ioptiktm architecture meets the demanding performance requirements of ar by eliminating the focusing optics that tend to limit the field of view of displayed media innovega replaces them with micro and nanofabricated optical elements that are integrated into otherwise conventional contact lenses the recent demonstration of stylish megapixel eyewear has proven the power of this proprietary architecture innovega will provide the new system to media and consumer electronics oems who wish to design natural display interfaces that consumers want and need innovega believes that its new personal display interface will become an essential social media and entertainment accessory augmented reality  definition from “wikipedia” augmented reality ar is a live direct or indirect view of a physical realworld environment whose elements are augmented by computer generated sensory input such as sound video graphics or gps data … with the help of advanced ar technology eg adding computer vision and object recognition the information about the surrounding realworld of the user becomes interactive and digitally manipulatable artificial information about the environment and its objects can be overlaid on the real world about innovega inc innovega provides components core technology and reference designs that will enable its customers to develop generations of personal media eyewear innovega’s novel approach improves comfort field of view and styling by eliminating bulky and heavy focusing optics from the eyewear at the same time the use of a modern soft contact lens substantially improves the field of view and resolution of any digital media experience innovega’s media eyewear is also transparent and therefore eliminates the social barrier that traditional wearable displays create innovega maintains offices in seattle wa and in san diego ca source innovega inc contact steve willey

from one page to another this value is called link juicea pages link juice is split between all the links on that page so lots of unnecessary links on a page will dilute the value attributed to each link theres no exact number of links to include on a page but best practice is to keep it under using the nofollow attribute in your links prevents some link juice but these links are still taken into account when calculating the value that is passed through each link so using lots of nofollow links can still dilute pagerank broken links high impact easy to solve no broken links were found on this web page  broken links send users to nonexistent web pages they hurt a sites usability and reputation which impacts seofortunately your page doesnt contain any broken links be proactive in checking your pages to make sure they dont have any broken links fix or delete broken links www resolve high impact easy to solve great a redirect is in place to redirect traffic from your nonpreferred domain  search engines see wwwinnovegainccom and innovegainccom as different websites this means they could see a large amount of duplicate content which they dont likefortunately your website redirects wwwinnovegainccom and innovegainccom to the same site redirect nonwww to www  robotstxt medium impact easy to solve missing  a robotstxt file allows you to restrict the access of search engine crawlers to prevent them from accessing specific pages or directories they also point the web crawler to your page’s xml sitemap filewe checked innovegainccomrobotstxt didnt find a robotstxt file use google search console to submit and test your robottxt file you can also test individual pages to make sure google isnt crawling any restricted files add a robotstxt file  xml sitemap medium impact easy to solve missing  we checked innovegainccom but couldnt find an xml sitemapxml sitemaps contain the list of your urls that are available to index and allows the search engines to read your pages more intelligently they can also include information like your site’s latest updates frequency of changes and the importance of urlsyour site is currently missing an xml sitemap we recommend you generate one for your site and submit it through both google search console and bing webmaster tools normally your xml sitemap would be found at innovegainccomsitemapmake sure to only include the pages you want search engines to crawl so leave out any that have been blocked in a robotstxt file avoid using any urls that cause redirects or error codes and be consistent in using your preferred urls with or without www correct protocols http vs https and trailing slashes you should also use your robotstxt file to point search engine crawlers to the location of your sitemap add and optimize your xml sitemap url parameters good the urls look clean  url parameters are used to track user behaviors on site session ids traffic sources referrer ids or to give users control over the content on the page sorting and filtering the issue with url parameters is that google sees each unique parameter value as a new url hosting the same thing  meaning you could have a duplicate content problem sometimes it’s able to recognize these urls and group them together it then algorithmically decides which url is the best representation of the group and uses it to consolidate ranking signals and display in search results you can help google recognize the best url by using the rel”canonical” taguse the url parameters tool in google search console to tell google how your url parameters affect page content and how to to crawl urls with parameters use this tool very carefully  you can easily prevent google from crawling pages you want indexed through overly restrictive crawling settings especially if you have urls with multiple parameters rewrite your urls and clean them up underscores in the urls low impact hard to solve great you are not using ‪underscores theseareunderscores in your urls  great you arent using ‪underscores theseareunderscores in your urls google sees hyphens as word separators while underscores arent recognized so the search engine sees

you arent using flash or frames on your sitewhile it often looks nicer flash content cant be properly indexed by search engines maximize your seo efforts by avoiding flashsearch engines also have
