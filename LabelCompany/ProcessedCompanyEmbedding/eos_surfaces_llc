sentara healthcare opens copperinfused hospital wing to improve patient care reuters norfolk va – november   – as patient fears of hospital infections and superbugs continue to rise one hospital in norfolk va is taking a unique approach to battling these issues – copper sentara healthcare will open a new bed patient tower at its sentara leigh hospital site where the patient rooms and most clinical spaces have been outfitted with antimicrobial copperinfused surfaces including countertops overthebed tables and bed rails in early  sentara will add antimicrobial copperinfused textiles ranging from bed linens to patients gowns throughout the entire east tower the use of the copperinfused surfaces and textiles will be part of an evaluation to determine whether they decrease the development of infections and thus the need for antibiotics prescribed as a result of hospitalacquired infections it will be the world’s largestknown study to date of durable biologically active antimicrobial surfaces which is expected to begin q  the secret ingredient to these materials is a copper technology developed by richmond vabased cupron a biotechnology company that has found ways to isolate copper so that it can be stabilized and imbedded in a variety of materials to take advantage of its natural antimicrobial properties cupron partnered with eos surfaces in norfolk va to develop antimicrobial cupron enhanced eos surfaces which have been approved by the epa for their ability to kill greater than  percent of gram negative and gram positive bacteria within two hours of exposure it is the only copperinfused antimicrobial surface with this epaapproved public health claim “sentara is pleased to become the first largescale deployment of these advanced antimicrobial materials” said dr gene burke vice president of clinical effectiveness for sentara “over the years sentara has implemented many advanced practices in an effort to minimize hospitalacquired infections at our facilities and we believe that new technologies such as the copperinfused materials have the potential to create another layer of protection in this very important effort” in the united states hospitalacquired infections hais account for nearly  million infections and  deaths each year a  cdc study estimates the annual direct costs of hais between  billion and  billion “after spending two years developing antimicrobial cupron enhanced eos surfaces and most of the past  months expanding our manufacturing capabilities the opening of sentara’s leigh east tower and the launch of the world’s largest study of antimicrobial materials is a pivotal moment for eos surfaces” said ken trinder ceo of eos surfaces “we expect the study to validate what our epa registration and testing has already affirmed that cupron enhanced eos surfaces can play a significant role in hospitals’ efforts to reduce hais” “hais are a complex problem that will require new technologies and healthcare products working together to continue the journey to zeroinfection environments” said paul rocheleau chairman of cupron “but what our cupronenhanced materials do is provide hospitals with another layer of protection that is constantly working in the background to complement their existing infection control practices we look forward to ‘cupronizing’ more hospitals in the future like we’ve done with sentara” the use of antimicrobial cupron enhanced eos surfaces is a supplement to and not a substitute for standard infection control practices users must continue to follow all current infection control practices including those practices related to cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces antimicrobial cupron enhanced eos surfaces have been shown to reduce microbial contamination but they do not necessarily prevent cross contamination sentara has received national recognition in recent years for its efforts to improve patient care and reduce infections national quality leaders such as vha have blueprinted sentara practices at reducing and in some cases eliminating ventilatorassociated pneumonia in addition sentara hospitals have been recognized for work in its icus to

richmond va – january   – sentara healthcare cupron eos surfaces and encompass group are joining together to evaluate the clinical and economic effectiveness of deploying antimicrobial copperbased hard surfaces and textiles in a range of healthcare environments this comprehensive program is believed to be the world’s largest hospital evaluation todate of antimicrobialprotected materials with the goal of combating the spread of pathogens that are known to contribute to healthcare infections cupronenhanced eos surfaces and cupronenhanced textiles will be evaluated at multiple sites including a new bed acute care facility to assess the improvement of patient outcomes and the reduction of healthcare costs this largescale program will include the installation of more than  horizontal square feet of patentpending cupronenhanced eos surfaces the antimicrobial hard surfaces will be installed on virtually all clinical and patient room surfaces antiodor textiles manufactured by the encompass group will be used for patient bed linens patient gowns and other textiles the trial will initiate this april at sentara norfolk general hospital followed by a largescale study that will take place at sentara leigh hospital in norfolk va where a series of acute care towers are now under construction the first “cupronenhanced” units are slated to open in q  the existing acute care tower without any cupronenhanced surfaces or textiles will serve as the comparative additional studies are planned for various longterm care facilities and outpatient centers “sentara is pleased to become the first largescale deployment of these advanced antimicrobial materials” said dr gene burke vice president of clinical effectiveness for sentara “over the years sentara has implemented many advanced practices in an effort to minimize hospitalacquired infections hais at our facilities and we believe that new technologies such as the cupronenhanced materials have the potential to create

to reduce central line blood stream infections and urinary tract infections “we are increasingly realizing that there are processes and technologies that are effective at reducing and possibly eliminating some of these infections once believed to be an inevitable part of the healthcare experience” burke added “approximately seven million people worldwide acquire a hospitalacquired infection each year” said paul rocheleau chairman of cupron  “despite aggressive monitoring hand washing campaigns and other infection control measures hai rates especially those caused by antibioticresistant pathogens are unacceptably high worldwide and in the united states the sentara program supported by eos surfaces and encompass group will hopefully be one of the first steps to define a new level of patient care” in the united states hais account for nearly  million infections and  deaths each year  a  cdc study estimates the annual direct costs of hais between  billion and  billion “we have worked diligently with cupron in developing this new product and are excited to test its clinical effectiveness and monitor the hopeful difference it can make in a healthcare environment” said ken trinder ceo of eos surfaces “the timing of the sentara program was fortuitous as we have made a major investment in new manufacturing capabilities and are rapidly building the network of companies that will play important roles in fabricating countertops lavatories furniture and other products that utilize the cupronenhanced eos materials” a smallscale clinical trial with cupronenhanced textiles in israel resulted in significant positive outcomes for chronically ill patients adding further evidence of the role textiles may have in supporting pathogen transmission also cupronenhanced eos surfaces recently received us epa public health registrations to certify the efficacy durability and ability to continuously kill a range of pathogens  cupron expects to receive additional public health registrations during  the use of textiles and hard surfaces containing copper may not only significantly contribute to the reduction of hospital infections but may also help protect other

  —cupron creator of a copperbased antimicrobial technology and eos surfaces a solid surface manufacturer jointly announce that their surface cupron enhanced eos surfaces has received the environmental protection agency’s epa approval to make a public health claim that their copperenhanced material can kill greater than  of gram negative and gram positive bacteria within two hours of exposure prior to this only elemental copper and certain copper alloys held this official distinction the approval is based on cupron enhanced eos surfaces’ ability to kill specific disease causing bacteria including methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa staphylococcus aureus enterobacter aerogenes pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli oh mrsa is one of the most common strains of antibioticresistant bacteria and a wellrecognized cause of health careacquired infections hais the two companies expect this material to help health care organizations and infection control specialists manage hais the product is approved for use in a wide range of applications including health care “the epa’s approval of our public health claims surrounding cupron enhanced eos surfaces is a pivotal moment in not only the commercialization of our technology but also how health care facilities combat hospital infections” said paul rocheleau chairman of cupron  “hais have a devastating effect on the health care environment causing thousands of deaths and costing billions of dollars each year while we fully acknowledge our surface won’t end this problem we believe these innovative materials will provide an additional layer of protection in managing the risks associated with microbial control” the centers for disease control and prevention cdc estimates hais affect  million individuals and result in about  deaths annually the use of antimicrobial materials for frequently touched surfaces may be an effective supplement to existing cdcprescribed handwashing and disinfection regimens in order to submit these claims to the epa the surface first had to achieve a percent pass rate of thousands of samples at an independent testing laboratory under the highest laboratory standards available the samples were tested in various environmental conditions cleaning protocols and for  efficacy after repeated exposure eos surfaces also performed extensive astm testing to support mechanical performance claims specifically the following statements are included in the epa registration “this surface continuously reduces bacterial contamination achieving a  reduction within two hours of exposure” “this surface kills greater than  of gram negative and gram positive bacteria within two hours of exposure” “this surface kills greater than  of bacteria within two hours and continues to kill  of bacteria even after repeated contamination” “this surface helps inhibit the buildup and growth of bacteria within two hours of exposure between routine cleaning and sanitizing steps” testing demonstrates effective antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc  enterobacter aerogenes atcc  methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsaatcc  escherichia coli oh atcc  and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc  “this approval affirms what we’ve known for a while that our surface has the potential to make a real impact with infection rates among
