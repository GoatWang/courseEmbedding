sixandahalfyear experiment with the mass beauty market as anticipated the company on monday said it has sold its jane cosmetics teen brand the new parent is jane  company llc a joint venture recently formed between brothers harry and alex adjmi owners and operators of the apparel company one step up and lisa yarnell a longtime mass market beauty executive whose experience includes stints at loreal coty and renaissance cosmetics the purchase price was not disclosed harry adjmi is chairman and yarnell is president and chief executive officer yarnell will be running the business out of janes baltimore md headquarters replacing todd c first who had been general manager of jane under lauder yarnell said monday that her first order of business would be to meet with retailers to learn what the concerns and issues are so we can reinvigorate mass efforts towards it jane remains in  walmart doors  target doors and a smattering of drugstores yarnell believes its possible to rebuild janes retail sales which have sunk under  million from a high of  million a few years ago i dont see why jane cant be a  million brand she declared industry observers say lauder underinvested in jane but the brands sales also were hurt by a flood of competitors into the teen cosmetics market adjmi who sells private label apparel lines to discounters like walmart and kmart as well as specialty and department stores said the intention is to broaden the brand base and maybe launch a fragrance and accessories to complement the cosmetics he said a new york showroom is being created for jane which yarnell described as offering highquality products with a fashion sense at a value price lauder surprised the industry when it snapped up jane in september  taking the prestige vendor into the massmarket segment for the first time jane cosmetics was a darling of mass retailers in the beginning for it was the first dedicated teen color brand and it was hoped that it would unlock sales in an expanding market segment a heartfelt spirited brand with a bit of sassiness it was launched in  as an offshoot by the sassaby company a maker of cosmetics boxes the line awakened other marketers to the swelling ranks of teen consumers and the strength of their buying power up until then cover girl a general market brand that enjoys a teen following and bonnie bell a youth brand with an emphasis on flavored lip items were the brands most directly connecting with young shoppers the introduction of jane inspired a flood of teen and tween brands that followed such as caboodles and fira along with a host of private label youth collections from the beginning lauder had big visions for jane chairman leonard lauder said in  that what drew lauder to jane was the company needed a brand with more modest price points to help it break into emerging markets such as china and india another intention was to use jane as a learning vehicle and as a wedge into the  billion mass color market when acquired lauder initially retained janes founding managers don pettit and howard katkov to guide its growth but over time both were quietly eased out of lauder organization as highlevel lauder management began weighing in on the brand i think we learned that each of the major cosmetics channels be they direct mass or prestige has certain skills and the fact that we are in the cosmetics business doesnt necessarily give us the data bank to compete in every channel daniel brestle a group vice president at estee lauder said in an interview monday jane was a business we looked at to give us exposure to the mass channel i thought it was a great experience for those of us here but at the end strategically it was never going to be as big was what we wanted brestle noted that the brands general manager todd first had done a terrific job over the past two years brestle said the jane brand that was sold was a wellrun organization with highquality products but in the end analysis he said lauders core competence is in service environments said brestle we do that pretty well the goal is to evolve estée lauder president jane hertzmark hudis on beautys sea change  digiday skip to

group president jane hertzmark hudis had an “aha” moment jenner was of course glued to her instagram and hertzmark hudis took notice “at that moment it was ‘wow something fundamental is happening’” said hertzmark hudis who oversees eight lauder brands estée lauder la mer bobbi brown aerin darphin bumble and bumble origins and aveda “my eyes opened to the whole world of social media at the time and i started to understand the millennial mindset and how it’s influencing so much of what’s going on today” jenner didn’t steer her wrong beauty has been rocked by the rise of social media once an industry defined by big legacy companies there’s been a decided changing of the guard any young brand can be propelled to success by enough passionate voices online for estée lauder the past five years have yielded a fundamental shift in how the yearold organization is run the company in order to stay competitive has gobbled up independent brands poised to eat its lunch a recent series of acquisitions brought too faced smashbox becca cosmetics glamglow rodin frédéric malle le labo and by killian under the company umbrella to hertzmark hudis — who was promoted in  from her position as the estée lauder brand global president which she had held since  — that mindset applies to beauty brands no matter what age group they’re targeting we spoke to her about estée lauder’s brandbybrand playbook the next social media trend and how to win when every brand is positioned to catch customer attention power in the beauty industry has shifted to the brand level how does a company like estée lauder adapt to this beauty is changing at the speed of light because anybody is able to get into the game but it’s a moment where the consumer — not the brand — is at the heart of the conversation whether you’re an indie brand or an established brand it’s not a zerosum game anymore anyone can win to adapt you put the customer at the center you have to bring people into the brand in a twoway conversation beauty is participative it’s visual and we hear from our customers every day it used to be you put together one strategy in the fall then changed it for spring now you might do something at  am and by  pm you’re talking about something completely different because everything happens in real time the fact of the situation is whether you’re an indie brand or not whether your customer is a millennial or not you better be on your game we have some of our most forward thinkers working on our heritage brands because the goal is to evolve digiday retail summit july     napa ca register now trimming the fat streaming skinny bundles are all the rage but for how long by sahil patel join digiday for access how did beauty get to this state of immediacy did you have an eyeopening moment where you realized the industry had changed i learned a lot from kendall jenner we were on set for an estée lauder shoot and i was watching her on her phone on instagram on social media — and i wanted to reflect our brand through her lens that meant moving outside of our comfort zone and letting go of control a bit without a doubt we’ve seen a significant shift in the industry all of our brands are spending increasing amounts in digital and social we’re innovating in product development where products are being thought about in regard to how they’ll look on instagram and youtube what’s happening is that the power is in the hands of the consumer it was literally a passing of the baton it’s not about how a brand defines itself today it’s how an audience defines you in their mind so usergenerated content and social listening has become so important consumers tell our stories now beauty on social media is crowded how do you cut through the noise you deal with the noise by having a distinct product each brand is known for rather than focusing on every item a brand sells we focus on the standout product for that brand and build the rest of the story around it for estée lauder that’s advanced night repair at bobbi brown it’s the foundation stick la mer it’s the original face creams quite frankly beauty is about hero products the notion that you would buy every single one of your products from one brand is not happening the customer wants the best from every brand that’s guided our portfolio strategy with different brands addressing different expertise and strengths what a customer wants from mac origins and bumble and bumble is very different we’re very strategic about what’s in our portfolio the global strengths of each brand and each category what’s exciting now is there’s a fundamental transformation happening across all of our brands and everyone’s playing a new game whether you’re with a brand that was here since the beginning or working on a new acquisition how do you bring a young brand under estée lauder without alienating its early customers the beauty of estée lauder is that we’re a company of many brands that understands entrepreneurs we like to give the freedom to those entrepreneurs but we have the resources and expertise to help them fill their potential the key is that we’re very careful about rolling out distribution we have big consumer reach but an enormous amount of patience builds brands over time we want the consumer demand to exceed the supply so we’re always feeding it over time what’s exciting about social media is that it connects the entire world and we can build up demand in a country before we even roll it out that’s become a big part of our business model what do you consider to be the culmination of beauty’s sea change what comes next in terms of digital and social there will be an influencer bubble what consumers want is authenticity and what they’re looking for is the unbiased review i think there will be a shakeout in terms of how consumers get to the truth and big lucrative influencer deals will happen less companies are moving toward the microinfluencer who are making more specific localized recommendations beyond that great marketers have their fingers on the pulse of where their consumer is going i learn more about scrolling through social than i do anywhere else i believe that skin care is going to be the next makeup so that’s where i’m focusing my attention but most importantly make sure you’re listening to the millennials in your own organization who have a better sense of the touch and feel of what’s happening so you can stay openminded and move faster than everyone else related articles why conde nast with the help of anna wintour is turning to hackathons to innovate july

estée lauder companies we left inspired and dying to know more about what happens behind the scenes at the cosmetics and skin care megacompany that meeting ultimately led to an interview with jane hudis demsey’s counterpoint as group president overseeing brands like estée lauder aerin la mer origins darphin and aveda and surprise surprise we left even more moved by the estée team than before hudis is passionate about her work to say the least but that passion comes from a true love of what she’s doing and of the people she surrounds herself with she was recently named wwd’s newsmaker of the year and has been working closely with the likes of kendall jenner on estée edit and victoria beckham on her cosmetics line when she’s not tirelessly traveling the world the best way to stay familiar with the  countries her six brands have a major presence in she’s conferencing with the younger generation of creatives—“the only people who have a handle on what’s going on” despite being a major major player in the intersection of business creativity and beauty she’s humble beyond belief and seemingly in awe of the company as a whole having gotten her start at the brand prescriptives as their marketing manager right out of grad school she had leonard lauder  act as her personal mentor since then she’s played a major role in the growth of the company and has had a hand in helping the brand evolve from “a productdriven company to a media company” here she outlines exactly what drives her and how she stays inspired    view more view more view more  “the only person who will really give you a good handle on what is going on is someone who is twentyfour years old”   why she starts work at  am “the thing about it is i’m a morning person my brain is active and i’m moving and grooving i also get the peace and the separation to do the work and to concentrate all day long i’m with people and in meetings so this is my time to get my work done i love my mornings “i don’t know what day it is half the time i don’t know time it is my days are full—morning ’til night they are chockfull i haven’t spent a day here looking at my watch like ‘ugh it’s only ’ it’s not like that i love the people i work with they inspire me i especially love the young people because they know what is going on”    view more view more view morehow she got her start at the company and was brought into the family fold “my first job was marketing manager for prescriptives it’s kind of a crazy story—the cuttothechase version of it is that i went to vassar undergrad and i was an art history major i was very inspired by all things visual and it was a great vehicle to learn history and culture and language anyway i worked in pr for three years after that i went to graduate school at columbia to get my mba and when i was in grad school i did a final project that ended up being in cosmetics through that i met someone who did all the advertising for estée lauder at that time we had four brands estée lauder clinique aramis and prescriptives when i joined i became the marketing manager for prescriptives what i did in the beginning was work a lot on organizing and getting our products shipped i rose in prescriptives to do almost every job there i was head of marketing this is when we were a small private company “very early on my mentor was leonard lauder i knew estée and leonard became my mentor my office was next to william lauder i was jane lauder’s second boss i’ve worked very closely with evelyn lauder for years in fragrance evelyn introduced me to my husband—when you work here the lauder family is very eager to make sure you are happily married”   “the idea that i was committed to was building on our heritage to create a modern future”    view more view more view morethe importance of maintaining company culture “we are a company that gives back we are a company that cares as big as we’ve gotten today almost  billion dollars in revenue and public there remains a strong family connection first of all there are generations of lauders involved and it’s been the family mission to keep the culture the caring and the values it’s extraordinary it makes life far more meaningful than just having a job i am lucky because i’ve found my passion and my passion was doing this and my passion was being here” how social media is turning estée lauder into a media company “social media has changed everything the consumer has changed it all estée really started with having a real connection with her consumer because she stood in the store and that’s how she got feedback and learned how to do a better job when you think about it she went from store to store to store what would she be like if she had instagram facebook and twitter next level it’s totally transformed the way we think we went from a place as brand marketers where we’re putting stuff out there and letting everyone respond and maybe doing a focus group three months later to see what everyone thought to real time interactions to dialogues to endless content i think we are all evolving from being a productdriven company to being a media company—it’s all that content content is king—or should i say queen in this office it’s queen “you have to understand content creation and the way people respond and it’s all evolving what you know today is different tomorrow the only person who will really give you a good handle on what is going on is someone who is twentyfour years old”    view more view more view morehow she stays educated about their markets “the most important thing we all do is travel like crazy it may seem very simple but there is no substitute we are on the road all the time i am in china multiple times a year i go to europe a lot i travel the united states a lot there is nothing like it the way to get the heartbeat of the consumer is to spend time with her in the store to understand what she is doing to look at social media in a particular country it is very different there are a million different things there might be five main platforms here and there might be twentyfive main ones in china you need to understand everything about your customer today how she lives what she likes what she consumes what she reads what she spends time on and what she doesn’t spend time on it is a complete and total understanding” how they innovate while staying true to the brand’s identity “when i took over the lauder brand—and i’ve been around long enough to know that people have had different approaches to it over time—but the idea that i was committed to was building on our heritage to create a modern future this brand has been built over decades and i understood early on what was rich and important about it the modernization of the brand has been an evolution building on its greatness and its original founder it’s caring for others and it’s passion for quality which the brand is known for all around the world there are what we call franchises like advanced night repair which have become cultlike products that people love all over the world a product like double wear that is loved by a twentyfiveyearold and a seventyfiveyearold you have to have a great respect for those and say ‘how do i nurture the great things about this brand and evolve it over time’ i am incredibly proud of being very sensitive to where that line is and i’m not sure that is something you can teach “you have to have respect for your history life isn’t just about an instagram post it’s about understanding great brands have stood the test of time you have to understand why and you need to understand what matters and what the values are and really respect that”    view more view more view more  “you only have one chance—might as well take advantage of it”   what inspires her “great creatives rock my world and great entrepreneurs rock my world i admire the great architects of the world i think it’s really cool when people build things that are meant to stand the test of time “i am very inspired by entrepreneurs and i can’t not be having studied estée lauder for so long and trying to make her proud every day i am inspired by aerin lauder—she is a great entrepreneur and following in her grandmother’s footsteps katia beauchamp who started birchbox these are great women who are starting things emily weiss starting into the gloss i do admire michelle obama—i think she has been an amazing first lady but you know what i admire victoria beckham and i work very closely with her she was a rock star reinvented as a fashion designer with four children and this cool husband and i love her clothes she is incredible if you meet her and get to know her she is so smart and so caring about women” why it’s crucial for women to support each other “i think women who really care about women are so interesting michelle obama cares about women victoria beckham cares about women they really get into a woman’s mindset and try to understand and try to make the world a better place i think that is inspiring i admire kendall jenner i know her extremely well and she is making her own way from her family and paving a new road for herself she’s an independent thinker and definitely has her finger on the pulse in so many ways those are the kinds of people who turn me on i get so turned on by the younger people at our company who are so brilliant and so great there is a great woman named alexandra hardyment who is running the aerin beauty business who just has a great take on the world and business and how it happens and is inventing it in a way that is happening today i think those people are really cool i love sharing my life with them it’s fantastic it’s very important to me to be very good to other women and to bring them along and to mentor and to show them a great path to the future”    view more view more view more  “great creatives rock my world and great entrepreneurs rock my world”   the best advice she’s ever received “the best career advice i ever received was from leonard lauder who said ‘always hire people who are smarter than you’ that’s how it goes that’s what it’s about they make it work better and i love that it’s always been true he told me that when i was probably twentysix years old and i didn’t understand what it meant and now i’ve come to appreciate it and it’s the best advice that anyone could ever give me “the advice i give is find your passion no matter what if you love what you do and you do what you love life is a beautiful thing when you spend so much time working if you don’t like it change that idea of experimenting early on and having the courage to change and take risks and try new things is important i think in addition to that it’s important that people get out of their comfort zone you don’t really know your full potential unless you take on something and try on something that is big and different it’s important to feel uncomfortable when you try new things to move yourself to the next level when people come to me for advice and say ‘well i don’t know if i’m good at that—’ there is only one way to find out try you only have one chance—might as well take advantage of it”    view more

lauder notes from jane lauder notes from jane lauder company feature mar   in celebration of women’s history month and international women’s day we are debuting a series of firstperson essays featuring female leaders from the estée lauder companies who will share their perspectives on a range of topics primarily relating to women and the workplace march   – growing up in the lauder family i internalized many values that have served me well in my personal and professional life including generosity of spirit fearless persistence and the courage to challenge and change  as we mark international women’s day with a focus on “be bold for change” i want to share a few thoughts that have helped anchor me in a complex world that seems to be moving faster every day my grandmother mrs estée lauder was an incredible woman she always told me if you believe in it you can sell it this has stuck with me whenever i am advocating for something new to be bold and to create change you need to be convinced in your head and heart that your idea is game changing and will really benefit our consumers and our company as the leader of clinique i encourage my team to take risks to push the boundaries of possibility embracing opportunities is what drives our business forward yet as gratifying as success can be from my own experience i know that failures are often more instructive  which is why my advice to young people in particular is never be afraid to fail    that said its important for women to understand that they are not a failure if they cant do it all so many women today believe that they need to be a super woman that they should be able to perfectly balance work family social life etc the truth is that some of the most successful women in business have a solid infrastructure of support no one can do it all alone we need to help lift each other up   that said its important for women to understand that they are not a failure if they cant do it all so many women today believe that they need to be a super woman that they should be able to perfectly balance work family social life etc the truth is that some of the most successful women in business have a solid infrastructure of support no one can do it all alone we need to help lift each other up   while my grandmother was always striving for perfection she also knew that women needed to be there for one another and she helped many achieve success along the way she used to say “in many ways women share a common language no matter what our culture no matter what our background we understand each other” times have changed dramatically since my grandmother blazed trails in the beauty industry but the wisdom of her words rings just as true today as the need for all women to share a common
