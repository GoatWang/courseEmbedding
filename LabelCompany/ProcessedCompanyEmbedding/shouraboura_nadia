experience by merging the best of the physical and digital universe shopping is an immersive experience in a beautiful world full of delightful new products to touch and try visual displays that catch the eye and the excitement of finding the perfect fit the perfect gift or the next big thing spreading this magic has been our goal all along we launched as a men’s denim shop in seattle with the aim of helping men find the perfect pair of jeans for every occasion soon we realized that our customers didnt enjoy sorting through piles to find a size standing naked in the dressing room waiting for our help or a long line to check out online shopping offered the hope of speed and convenience but also resulted in getting wrong sizes bad fits uncomfortable materials and the dilemma of doireallywanttogothroughthehassleofreturningthis so we asked ourselves – why not offer the conveniences of the online world paired with the tangible excitement of instore shopping to create the ultimate customer experience we started to work with mobile technologies invented etags and instore sensors to power our smart showroom we developed an uberefficient microwarehouse capable of locating and retrieving items in under  seconds occupying a fraction of traditional warehouse footprint and placed it in the back of our store with that our technology platform was born it started with one store – our men’s jeans shop in seattle – and grew into a robust endtoend software platform for retailers everywhere who sell everything delight customers we give retailers the tools to delight customers and empower sales associates we offer an amazing digital experience that turns customer smartphones into remote controls to the physical store so they can get what they want when and how they want increase sales and improve margins our tools aren’t just for fun – they help reinvent customer experience and optimize in store cost structure making online shopping expensive in comparison retailers also gain neverbeforecollected instore shopping activity data this allows retailers to improve instore processes and optimize inventory and assortment allocations our in store personalized recommendation system delivers items to key decision making zones instore fitting rooms and test areas where customers try out products increasing sales and driving units per transaction meanwhile customer relationship management crm becomes easy and digital so stores can drive repeat business without hassle save money our system more than pays for itself through decreased store operations costs better use of space in visual displays and storage areas shrinks store footprints supporting smallerstore formats store staff members become more productive so fewer need to work at one time decreasing labor costs and inventory holding requirements decline because of digital inventory tracking and eliminated need to fill up the rack while instore items no longer go missing our team driven by the spirit of innovation and a focus on customers our team is made up of designers and engineers who won’t settle for the status quo we thrive on continuous improvement and of course none of it would be possible without our fearless leader dr nadia shouraboura a retail revolutionary she has wide ranging talents and bold vision she holds a phd in mathematics from princeton university has extensive retail and technology experience and was former head of supply chain and fulfillment technologies for amazoncom nadia also served on jeff bezos senior leadership team responsible for overall direction and operations of amazon breaking all the retail rules by matt pillar mattpillarcom the beginning soviet russia was a decidedly uninspiring place for young nadia shouraboura buying shoes meant taking anything close to her size that the central department store had to offer style and fit weren’t on the list of purchase criteria choice was virtually nonexistent the closest thing to a positive grocery experience was being rewarded with something—anything—for standing in a long line for a long time the dismal reality of “retail” during her formative years in russia is one reason you might consider her rise to retail tech pioneer status improbable in reality it was the stark contrast between shopping in her native russia and the retail experiences she enjoyed after immigrating to israel and traveling the world that inspired her shouraboura’s mathematics and science education landed her work as a software developer working on computer aided design systems for industrial robotics that work put her on the fast track to a fullride at princeton university where she earned her phd in mathematics important work in the energy sector followed where shouraboura made a name for herself developing software algorithms for the energy trade through it all the allure of retail beckoned in  shouraboura joined a thenfledgling amazoncom it was early during her tenure at amazon when shouraboura made it a priority to break away from her workstation frequently to gain firsthand experience of the company’s operations during a month long commitment to the call center—where she actually worked the phones and took customer calls—that shouraboura had one of those moments that would define her mission for years to come “more often than not when a customer called it was to inquire about an order or when a backordered item would be in stock and shipped” she says “in the early days we had no answer after a month of practicing every possible way to say ‘i don’t know’ i dedicated myself to that question” her relentless pursuit of supply chain certainty led to shouraboura’s management of software development infrastructure and operations for the technology that powers amazon’s worldwide supply chain and fulfillment operations that landed shouraboura a coveted slot on jeff bezos’ elite “s team” where her work proved foundational to amazon’s rollout of several product categories including books and appliances and ultimately apparel the apparel rollout preceded another defining moment for shouraboura “we had a lot of experience launching new categories so we modeled our apparel rollout in similar fashion to the rest” she explains “every christmas season i would work our call centers and i learned that the apparel rollout gave rise to a new common customer challenge clothes that didn’t fit had to be returned and the ecommerce model wasn’t conducive to that it was nearly impossible to make returns a good experience which wasn’t good for customers and it wasn’t good for us” the pitfalls of the physical store experience years removed from her lackluster childhood experiences buying footwear and apparel in soviet russia the apparel rollout at amazon rekindled shouraboura’s passion for the physical retail experience in  shouraboura made another seemingly improbable move seeking to focus solely on improving the shopper’s apparel buying experience she left amazon she walked away from the revolutionary ecommerce marketplace that she had so much skin in creating to pursue a vision that she’d been harboring for decades shouraboura opened a store to be more precise she opened a brickandmortar store admittedly she knew very little about what she was setting out to do shouraboura played a central role in the early growth of amazon if she could quickly take new categories and concepts to scale there how difficult could it be in a physical sales environment where she could personally attend to shoppers’ needs she appointed herself sole proprietor of selffinanced hointer a highend seattle men’s denim store she opened with her own money she studied denim relentlessly she got to know all the top designers and she stuffed her store racks to the gills with expensive inventory in  she opened her doors in altruistic pursuit of her dream she envisioned spending her days helping shoppers discover their styles focusing on the fashion and delighting her customers six months later shouraboura was on the verge of closing up shop and cutting her losses “the experience was horrible” she laments “instead of improving the personal experience of fashion retailing and selling lots of jeans i spent six months chasing and folding clothes my displays were a constant mess the fitting rooms were a constant mess i hated customers i hated the whole experience” rather than quit however shouraboura doubled down she decided to change the physical retail apparel experience from the inside out acknowledging that her life as a retail sales associate was miserable she began to think about running a store from the associate’s perspective “the more i thought about it the more clear it became that if i wasn’t having a good time neither were my customers” she says ever the observant recorder of equations she decided to change her perspective she began by charting and analyzing the customer experience instead of her own as a storeowner she found that ultimately her customers weren’t trying on enough clothes and if they weren’t likely to buy what they weren’t trying on “my customers would pick a few items and go into the fitting room if it didn’t fit they’d have to get dressed and go find something else they would only repeat this process a couple of times at most before yelling through the fitting room door for associate help to find another size” the traditional means of delivering that assistance proved no more pleasant there’s something decidedly uncomfortable and awkward about handson personal interaction between a female store associate and a man in his underwear “they would ask me once to bring them another size rarely twice” recalls shouraboura “the reason they came to my store was to try on clothes but it was so awkward and cumbersome they wouldn’t try on enough” a petri dish of retail experimentation shouraboura’s solution to the physical retail experience conundrum at hointer would raise a lot of eyebrows drawing on her experience designing amazon warehouses and her experience with robotic automation before that she made a radical change to her store’s design and operations she completely removed the stacks and racks of jeans from her store save for a display model of each style and wash the sales floor became a showroom instead of a stockroom inventory was arranged in orderly fashion in a micro warehouse in the back of the store invisible to customers fitting rooms were equipped with two chutes—one in one out using an app shoppers punch in the style and size they want and in fewer than  seconds the item is delivered to the fitting room via the “in” chute items that don’t fit are placed by the customer into the “out” chute for return to the micro warehouse “suddenly shoppers were trying on an exponentially higher number of items” says shouraboura “it wasn’t uncommon for my customers to try on thirty items in one visit” that facilitated a simple numbers game—the more jeans customers tried on the more they bought for every success ten failures shouraboura’s automated fitting room experiment at her hointer store is one of many she’s engaged in since the  launch of her business and she’s not afraid to admit that more of them fail than succeed that’s why she’s adamant that a retailer’s “innovation lab” should be a store not a skunk works operation “ninety nine percent of the experiments i try don’t work at all” she says “when i hear about retailers experimenting with new ideas in a lab i often chuckle when we’ve already failed what they’re attempting i don’t think a lab helps i think experiments nee to happen in a physical store where it’s make or break everything looks good in a lab every midnight idea sounds brilliant there then you put it in a store and more often than not it doesn’t work” shouraboura chalks many failures up to fragility and complexity stores she says are active environments where kids play cords get pulled hardware and software get abused and associates are not trained to maintain troubleshoot and resolve complex technology what does work she says must be scalable and inexpensive a fitting room concept that costs  dollars per installation isn’t feasible for a department store with hundreds or thousands of locations and dozens of fitting rooms in each store she also cautions that lots of new technologies look fantastic but they don’t lift sales for that reason she advises extremely careful and patient measurement of sales lift even with good ideas she says you don’t typically see an immediate impact on sales “with a good idea and proper execution you will see lift within a couple of months if i receive positive feedback from customers and it’s inexpensive and scalable and they love it i give it some time before i expect sales to increase” interestingly shouraboura says the best instore technology—the stuff that does have a positive impact on sales—is commonly invisible to the consumer “as strange as it sounds coming from a technologist people don’t go shopping to play with technology” she says “they shop to experience products and interact with associates in many cases technology has a negative impact on sales because shoppers spend their time playing with gadgets and displays instead of trying on products if they’re not trying on products we’re not selling them” expanding the concept shouraboura’s appetite for disruption isn’t abating as her original hointer concept in seattle continues to thrive she’s busy applying variations of the model to other segments including grocery and toys in traditional toy stores shouraboura’s dissatisfaction lies within store shelves packed with toys that are meant to be interactive but are ziptied into clamshell packages that limit children’s interaction with them “in our toy store experiment we took all the racks away and created a playground we allow kids to come in and play and using the same concept developed for our hointer denim store we leverage chutes to introduce new toys to them based on their interests” parents can quickly purchase the toys their children choose using their smart phone or a storesupplied “magic wand” which adds the toy to their order upon touching it when the experience is over the packaged items in the purchase are automatically delivered from the micro warehouse “the concept is so popular the store is constantly busy even on monday mornings because it’s a destination similarly shouraboura’s experience working on amazon fresh has shaped her vision of the grocery store of the future “grocery stores are crammed with shelf real estate that’s expensive from a merchandising and inventory perspective” says shouraboura “but it isn’t necessary for shoppers to touch feel and smell a great majority of that inventory” consumers want to touch an apple or smell a melon for instance but that tactile and sensory experience isn’t necessary to the purchase of a bottle of ketchup “shelves upon shelves of identical items require a lot of space yet add nothing to the consumer experience” instead shouraboura’s grocery concept in keeping with the hointer model provides a showroom where one bottle of each ketchup variety is on display using a smart phone or a magic wand items are quickly added to the cart and collected from the back room for checkout “the same customerheld technology can provide suggestions and reminders and other grocery shopping applications” she says shouraboura’s ideas have garnered attention and funding from several large international retailers and winning concepts are being licensed to other retailers “the future of the store is much like we envisioned the future of ecommerce twenty years ago” she says “it started slowly and no one accurately predicted its impact we’re starting the same way and we’re confident that the store of the future will look and act very differently than it does today” having said that and despite her passionate commitment to brickandmortar retail she’s still a fan of amazon “ecommerce is perfect for products where price convenience and selection are the primary sales drivers product like printer cartridges with which a shopper has no emotional connection” she says “but when shopping for apparel or jewelry or toys a photo won’t do i for the consumer because she doesn’t feel anything” online she says speed will continue to be the merchant’s main focus for the next several years “we had a comfortable  day fulfillment window when we started amazon now two days is a given and we’re moving rapidly toward a day or an hour” the next big opportunity for stores to thrive says shouraboura is experiential and she’ll continue taking risks and working tirelessly to enable it case studies improving digital operational excellence digital technology can create dramatic changes in the efficiency and productivity in the store including making the showroom more productive by showcasing more styles macy’s recently partnered with hointer a retail store technology platform that brings the efficiency of online ecommerce to brickandmortar retail to transform the swimwear department by automating the picking of items in the back room and bringing them to the dressing room on behalf of the customer macy’s and hointer are able to move the bulk of the inventory into the stock room thus

joined the company in  she made a huge mistake when a shipment of new products came in she instructed them to be put up on the highest shelves of the warehouse when a bunch of orders for that product came in there wasnt enough staff to get the product down fast enough remember this was pre amazons warehouserobot days      i was trying to figure out how i would save the situation she told business insider so i came up with a model to figure out how to minimize the amount of money spent to fix the issue so they wouldnt fire me her model helped her figure out how late how many of the products would have to be to theoretically cause the least damage  i brought the model to jeff bezos and the s team and they basically told me that i was being an idiot she says they said we just needed to ship everything as fast as we could without regards to cost we needed to make sure the experience was right and then worry about the money afterwards amazon brought on outside help and paid expedited shipping for all the orders so that everyone would get their package on time  it cost a lot — was a big number shouraboura says with a slight laugh thats customer obsession for you that situation taught me a lot very quickly they still adhere to that philosophy today customer obsession is one of the companys main tenets amazon obviously didnt fire shouraboura after her mishap and she says she internalized that idea throughout her next  years at the company eventually she left to found her own retail startup called hointer hointer is antiamazon in that it focuses solely on ways to improve brickandmortar retail however one thing is the same the main focus of her company is to make the shopping experience more convenient for customers  see also check out how much amazoncom has changed

rather than academia but the former amazon executive may hold the keys to success for bricks and mortar retailers in a digital age“there’s a very beautiful part of retail the beauty of the store and the fun that people have when they go to the store” says ms shouraboura founder and chief executive of retail technology firm hointer “but there is a part that’s really old and hasn’t changed much    it could be a great experience if they added great technology to it” share share on facebook share share on twitter tweet link hointer ceo nadia shouraboura photo lisa maree williams the sovietborn mathematician software developer and robotics engineer believes bricks and mortar retailers are better placed than pureplay online retailers to satisfy consumer demand for products such as apparel and consumer electronicshowever many traditional retailers are stuck in the th century burdened with inefficient systems and costs that make it almost impossible to compete with lowcost online rivals“when i look at ecommerce in the past  years the progress has been on the technology side but when i look at retail i don’t see much progress at all” ms shouraboura told fairfax media ahead of an online retail conference in sydney this weekafter almost nine years running ­supply chain fulfilment and inventory buying at amazon ms shouraboura started developing a suite of retail ­technologies that promise to transform bricks and mortar retailers by giving them the tools to compete with online retailers while reducing rent labour and inventory costs advertisement two years ago she launched

while wanted items are purchased by swiping a credit or debit cardhointer stores have onefifth the floor space of traditional stores as inventory is tightly packed in storerooms rather than displayed on shelves and half the number of staff who have more time to serve customers costs are substantially lower while the sales uplift is estimated to be between  per cent and  per cent “customers who come to hointer end up trying on a lot more items” ms shouraboura said “normally customers try on three to five – at hointer on average they try on  because it’s very fast”ferrier hodgson retail partner james stewart says the technology and store experience pioneered by hointer could be a game changer for retailers“the tech companies think this is a really interesting concept and ultimately you could see a blend of this sort of technology with human interaction” mr stewart said“the role that retail staff will play in the next five years will be a lot less about the checkout process and a lot more about the valueadd process”ms shouraboura is now in talks with several retailers including a major consumer electronics chain in the united states about incorporating hointer’s technology into their modelsit may seem futuristic but ms shouraboura believes some of hointer’s retail technology will eventually become mainstream “it works well for apparel it works well for toys it works well for electronics when customers want to experience before they decide it works for jewellery and it will probably work well for grocery” she said advertisement huffpost australia bill gates is

nadia shouraboura december   by dr nadia shouraboura a series of firsthand views from industry leaders on the retail landscape careers personal insights and the future of retail how did you get into this business i was born in soviet russia where “retail” meant that when you see a line you try to cut in and wait to grab whatever you can regardless of what it is when i crossed the border into hungary and saw my first food store i was in awe at that moment i fell in love with retail and most importantly with the impact it has on people’s li who has been your greatest influencementor my grandfather a russian space scientist taught me that we could put a man in space using the computing power of a t calculator when people ask me how expensive the hointer solution is i always think of high school calculators what is your greatest source of inspiration or where do you get your best ideas making love to my husband is my source of inspiration i always dream about making shopping as exciting and passionate as sex what retail operation do you think is innovative and sustainable convenience through technology the reason tech has been used in so many ways in the online world is because we can easily learn about individual customers and change the way they interact with products while harder to understand customers and their product interactions in the physical world the retail experience is much richer—so we have greater opportunity over time to change the overall game innovation though is about constant change it doesn’t sit still so anything i call out as innovative is only sustainable if it soon becomes something different what is your favorite place to shop macy’s herald square on thanksgiving put a spell over me since i was a student and i love their ongoing makeover given the amazing history of that store and yet its ability to constantly reinvent itself i always feel hope for the future of physical retail when i shop there over the last five years what has been the biggest change in the industry the maturity of ecommerce and early attempts by retailers to fuse physical and digital shopping what do you think will change the most in the next five years the instore experience and fusion of digital and physical this is our biggest opportunity both in customer experience and supply chain what would people be surprised to know about you i walked out of the soviet union and lived on the streets of hungary before i could find my way to america also i love to read and write computer programs i used to read through millions of lines of code at amazon and i write a lot of code at hointer what books are you reading i’m reading about spacex and tesla by ashlee vance i think when we create a teslalike fitting room at macy’s men will line up what’s your favorite leisure activity i don’t have one i love to work and i’m okay doing it all the time when my daughter wants to spend time with me she comes to hointer what lessons have you learned from elsewhere in your life that you can apply to retail i did my phd in mathematics and i learned how to apply many different ideas and use data to confirm which solution works best we do the same at hointer most things we try do not work but the several things that work really well for us and for macy’s have increased sales so we double down on those ideas what’s your favorite quote and who said it jeff bezos likes to say “step by step ferociously”—and it sits well with me what’s your favorite online site nasa’s website httpwwwjplnasagov it covers space missions i keep thinking if we
