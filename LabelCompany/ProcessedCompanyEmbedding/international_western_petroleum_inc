statements unaudited   note  – organization nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies   international western petroleum inc “iwp” or the “company” was incorporated on february   as a nevada corporation the company was formed to conduct operations in the oil and gas industry   the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and the rules of the securities and exchange commission and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the company’s annual report on form k filed with the sec for the year ended february   in the opinion of management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein the results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year notes to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year as reported in the form k have been omitted   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the period actual results could differ from those estimates   fair value of financial instruments   the carrying amount of the company’s accounts payable and accrued expenses and advances from officer approximates its estimated fair value due to the shortterm nature of that financial instrument   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of six months or less to be cash equivalents the company had  and  of cash and cash equivalents at november   and february   respectively   concentrations of credit risk   financial instruments which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk include cash deposits placed with financial institutions the company maintains its cash in bank accounts which at times may exceed federally insured limits as guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic at november    of the company’s cash balances was uninsured the company has not experienced any losses on such accounts   accounts receivable   accounts receivable typically consist of oil and gas receivables the company has classified these as current assets in the balance sheet because the company expects repayment or recovery within the next  months the company evaluates these accounts receivable for collectability considering the results of operations of these related entities and when necessary records allowances for expected unrecoverable amounts to date no allowances have been recorded            oil and gas properties   the company follows the full cost method of accounting for its investments in oil and gas properties whereby all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition exploration for and development of petroleum and natural gas reserves including unproductive wells are capitalized such costs include lease acquisition geological and geophysical activities rentals on nonproducing leases drilling completing and equipping of oil and gas wells and administrative costs directly attributable to those activities and asset retirement costs general and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred   disposition of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized unless such adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capital costs and proved reserves of oil in which case the gain or loss is recognized in the statement of operations   future development site restoration dismantlement and abandonment costs are estimated property by property based upon current economic conditions and regulatory requirements and are included in amortization of our oil and natural gas property costs   depletion of capitalized oil properties and estimated future development costs excluding unproved properties are based on the unitofproduction method based on proved reserves   at the end of each quarter the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties net of related deferred income taxes is limited to the sum of the estimated future aftertax net revenues from proved properties after giving effect to cash flow hedge positions discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties adjusted for related income tax effects this limitation is known as the “ceiling test” and is based on sec rules for the full cost oil and gas accounting method there was no ceiling test writedown recorded during the three and nine months ended november   and    the company assesses the carrying value of its unproved properties for impairment periodically if the results of an assessment indicate that an unproved property is impaired which was assessed in connection with the company’s evaluation of goodwill impairment then the carrying value of the unproved properties is added to the proved oil property costs to be amortized and subject to the ceiling test   fixed asset   fixed asset is stated at cost and depreciated using the straightline method over the fiveyear estimated useful life of the asset   asset retirement obligations   if a reasonable estimate of the fair value of an obligation to perform site reclamation dismantle facilities or plug and abandon wells can be made the company will record a liability an asset retirement obligation or “aro” on its balance sheet and capitalize the present value of the asset retirement cost in oil and gas properties in the period in which the retirement obligation is incurred in general the amount of an aro and the costs capitalized will be equal to the estimated future cost to satisfy the abandonment obligation assuming the normal operation of the asset using current prices that are escalated by an assumed inflation factor up to the estimated settlement date which is then discounted back to the date that the abandonment obligation was incurred using an assumed cost of funds for the company after recording these amounts the aro will be accreted to its future estimated value using the same assumed cost of funds and the capitalized costs are depreciated on a unitofproduction basis over the estimated proved developed reserves both the accretion and the depreciation will be included in depreciation depletion and amortization expense on our statement of operations   revenue recognition   all revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service or sale is complete the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenue is derived from the sale of crude oil and natural gas revenue from crude oil and natural gas sales is recognized when the product is delivered to the purchaser and collectability is reasonably assured the company follows the “sales method” of accounting for oil and natural gas revenue so it recognizes revenue on all natural gas or crude oil sold to purchasers regardless of whether the sales are proportionate to its ownership in the property a receivable or liability is recognized only to the extent that the company has an imbalance on a specific property greater than its share of the expected remaining proved reserves if collection is uncertain revenue is recognized when cash is collected            income taxes   income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of asc topic no  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized   stockbased compensation   the company measures stockbased compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense over the vesting or service period as applicable of the stock award   basic and diluted net income loss per common share   basic net loss per common share amounts are computed by dividing the net loss available to international western petroleum inc shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding over the reporting period in periods in which the company reports a net loss dilutive securities are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would be antidilutive for the three and nine months ended november   and  there were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding   reclassifications   certain reclassifications have been made to amounts in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation all reclassifications have been applied consistently to the periods presented   subsequent events   the company evaluated all transactions from november   through the financial statement issuance date for subsequent event disclosure consideration   recent accounting pronouncements   the company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on its results of operations financial position or cash flows   note  – going concern   as reflected in the accompanying financial statements the company has generated a net loss of  and cash flows used from operations of  during the nine months ended november   revenue is mainly generated from oil and gas sales from the company’s oil and gas properties    management has a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future the company will be required to raise additional funds to fully execute its business plan however the company believes it has sufficient cash on hand and limited near term obligations to sustain its current operations for the next twelve months            note  – oil and

  international western petroleum inc “iwp” “we” “our” “us” or the “company” was incorporated on february   as a nevada corporation and is based in irving texas the company was formed to conduct operations in the oil and gas industry we are an oil and natural gas company that focuses on the acquisition development and exploration of crude oil and natural gas properties in texas on may   the company acquired significant working interests from the bend arch lion a joint venture and the bend arch lion b joint venture encompassing a total production of seven  producing oil and gas wells on a total  acres out of  acres of the bend arch lion project showing proven recoverable reserves of approximately  mbbl and  mmcf to date the company together with its affiliated operator international western oil corporation “iwo” have completed drilling an additional three  oil and gas wells thus totaling ten  gross wells in production it is noted that the bend arch lion a and b joint ventures are parts of the total acre leaseholds that have not been fully explored currently iwo holds approximately  acres in leaseholds in the central west texas region the company plans to acquire additional leaseholds from iwo in the future   the company is continually seeking strategic investors to help it develop additional exploration projects located within the bend archfort worth basin as well as other prime acquisition targets in the central west south and east texas as such the company is working on obtaining enough funding to provide a budget for new acquisitions in the remaining calendar year of  as well as new exploration projects in  to meet its financial objectives during the fiscal year ending february              strategy and implementation summary   sales strategy   abilene texas is the closest city with oil handling and sales firms our sales strategy in relation to spot pricing will be to produce less when the sales price is lower and produce more when the sales price is higher to maintain the lowest production cost we will aim to have our inventory in tanks be virtually zero members of the ramsey family that are related to our ceo have business relationships with bml crude oil marketing inc bml and west texas gas wtg jameson the company has started producing oil and natural gas while leveraging tier  business relationships and having entered into material agreements with bml so that as our tier  buyers bml can handle pickup and sales of our crude oil stock to refineries and wtg jameson can collect natural gas from our gas lines connecting to wtg pipelines   as such crude oil will be picked up from the leases and natural gas can be collected as needed during the calendar month at the end of the month the hydrocarbon total sales will be tallied by lease and the day average of the daily closing of oil and gas will be tabulated on or about the th of the following month the proceed checks from oil and gas sales will be issued to the financial parties of record   plan of operations   during fiscal year  the company is actively looking for largereserve oil and gas concessions and existing production to acquire and continue to raise enough capital via equity andor debt financing options to meet its operational goal in fiscal year    based on management’s general management and petroleum exploration experience as well as its geology expertise the company believes in its ability to identify high potential acreages and high production fields   since the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company has reviewed several good acquisition candidates in the west permian basin and south texas after identifying any new prospect additional research and evaluation was carried out using personal contacts geologists seismographs satellite hydrocarbon imaging production data and every available resource to glean information and data in order to make an acquisition decision our operational plan after each acquisition is to increase production of the acquired oil and gas properties using stateoftheart production technologies within a designated budget preapproved by the company’s senior management team   the company has plans to design a cost effective operating budget for each exploration project associated with an acquisition project and each budget will vary depending on the total depth of drilling and whether it is a new drilling or a reentry for each project the company plans on hiring selected operators to work under the close supervision of a core team of company geologists engineers and scientists   the company also has an immediate operational plan to apply selective leading edge enhanced oil recovery “eor” technologies from technology vendors to improve existing production after each future acquisition   on may   the company acquired a  working interest from international western oil corporation “iwo” in the bend arch lion a joint venture the pittard bend arch white property encompassing  acres – state id  the “a venture” and a  working interest in the bend arch lion b joint venture the pittard bend arch red property encompassing  acres  state id  the “b venture” by acquiring these working interests the company will directly receive the share of working interest revenue after accounting for applicable taxes expenses and landowner royalties iwo was receiving prior to the acquisitions it is noted that in march  the company sold  of its working interest of the bend arch lion b to a buyer thus reducing the ownership of the working interest down to  in the bend arch lion b   the company has spent over  past months to examine a proven stateoftheart organic oil recovery oor technology proposed by an advanced enhanced oil recovery eor technology company which has proposed a partnership with the company in order to identify suitable mature oil fields and apply this oor technology aiming to significantly increase the current production from mature oil and gas fields the company believes that this technology is one of the most important oil recovery breakthroughs in decades this technology based on natural ecology of the oil reservoir has shown highperformance records on  continents onshore and offshore with over  applications in over  oil fields resulting with an average increase of  in oil production the technology is believed to be pure organic and biodegradable with fast result and cost effectiveness bringing major economic benefits to many oil and gas producers in low oil price environment today   as  of oil in the world are being trapped underground today leading to a major opportunity for the company to gain significant growth in revenues the company is doing indepth studying on this technology to see if it is applicable to

rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in reaching a reasonable level of assurance management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures in addition the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected   pursuant to sec rule ab the company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on form

combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control our financial reporting as of november   the company determined that the following items constituted material weaknesses     ● the company does not have policies and procedures in place to ensure the timely review disclosure and accurate financial reporting for significant

services rendered   the above shares were issued in reliance on the exemption under section  of the securities act these shares of our common stock qualified for exemption under section  since the issuance shares by us did not involve a public offering the offering was not a “public offering” as defined in section  due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the deal manner of the issuance and number of shares issued we did not undertake an offering in which we sold a high number of shares to a high number of investors in addition the investors had the necessary investment intent as required by section  since they agreed to and received share certificates bearing a legend stating that such shares are restricted pursuant to rule  of the act this restriction ensures that these shares would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a “public offering” based on an analysis of the above factors we have met the requirements to qualify for exemption under section  of the securities act for this transaction   item  defaults upon senior securities   there were no defaults upon senior securities during the quarter ended november

relating to the registration of the common stock for the selling security holders we may face substantial competition in the oil and gas industry to management’s knowledge there are many exploration companies in the oil and gas industry which will compete directly with us there are many large wellcapitalized private and public companies in this industry which have the resources lease access loyal buyers and expertise to drill and produce oil if they wish to do so many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies this type of pricing pressure could force us to offer discounts decreasing our profit margin company description we are an explorationstage oil and natural gas company that focuses on the acquisition development and exploration of crude oil and natural gas properties in texas we do not yet have however reserves undeveloped reserves delivery commitments any wells in the process of being drilled or drilling or other exploratory and development activities we also do not yet own any oil and gas properties or acreage the company is currently managed by two people who are business and oil and gas exploration veterans who specialize in the oil and gas acquisition and exploration markets of the centralwest texas region its chief executive officer president chief financial officer and cofounder ross henry ramsey a fourth generation oil man who has been involved in several vertical and horizontal exploration works along with deep and shallow drilling with successful results and its chairman secretary and cofounder dr benjamin tran who has vast experience in corporate finance private equity and merchant banking the company’s chief geologist is dr syed ahmad who has thirty years of diversified experience in the petroleum industry including extensive geological and operational experience with exxon exploration texas saudi geophysicalaramco and petrolog de venezuela at the moment the company’s management team mr ramsey and dr tran collectively “management” control the majority of the company’s outstanding shares the company has recently prospected several lucrative exploration projects in the prolific bend arch region which is approximately  miles long and  miles wide running from archer county texas in the north to brown county texas in the south this area has been one of the most active drilling areas during the recent resurgence of united states drilling activities unlike many major oil companies that often drill very deep wells with a high degree of risk the company plans to be a specialist in shallow well exploration  to  feet that is less expensive and has lower risk factors management believes that the company has the capacity and capability to take potential oil and gas reservoirs and develop them from the ground floor to completion management believes that the company also has the ability to acquire several high potential acreage that possess proven reserves of hydrocarbons from evaluating seismic data to the final steps of drilling testing completing and proceeding to production our staff has expertise in geology petroleum engineering geophysics and mechanical engineering the company is currently developing several acquisition candidates including existing hydrocarbon production and proven reserve hydrocarbon land leases capable of additional drilling located in the bend archfort worth basin the company is aiming to develop a six  well drilling program in coleman county of texas this program shall execute drilling to an estimated depth of  feet which will place the wells into the geological formation known as the ellenberger formation management has access to the geology survey report as well as mud log and open hole log of some existing wells of the bend arch lion project this data shows that there are a total of up to five  potential oil and gas producing zones between the surface and the ellenberger formation the primary geological zones to be explored in the initial  well drilling package will be the palo pinto gardner sand gray sand barnett shale and ellenberger once the wells have entered the ellenberger formation a suite of electronic logs will be run and the information gathered off of the logs combined with the information gathered during drilling will dictate which zone each well will be completed in management believes that surrounding acreage would suggest that each well targeted within the ellenberger formation will be completed and produced management believes however that each of the other named formations also have the potential to provide very good commercial production in order to promote fast growth management envisions that the majority of capital we generate from operations of acquired production will be reinvested to fund new exploration projects our core business strategy is to a acquire petroleum exploration companies with moderate production growth and add capital to instigate explosive growth b acquire new highpotential hydrocarbon land leases and perform initial exploration on those leases to add value as “proven reserve” properties and then sell them off at multiples of the cost basis and c acquire existing oil and gas production with large reserves to increase the company’s value we are currently an exploration stage company since inception our operations are limited to forming the company and raising capital resource we have not generated any revenues to date we do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow at the date hereof we have minimal cash at hand we require additional capital to implement our business
