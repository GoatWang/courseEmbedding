mr wang boming known as the “stockexchange executive council” “seec” by the time of the publication giving rise to the action the magazine was publishedin beijing by a company known as “beijing caijing magazine limited” “the publisher” and seec continued to have a role inrelation to the governing and management of the magazine  the respondent is a prominent businesswoman and wellknown philanthropist in hong kong and the mainland she participates in charitableactivities organised by the li ka shing foundation and also by a foundation bearing her own name  the words giving rise to the respondent’s action for libel appeared in two articles contained in issue no of the magazinedated  june  the articles were respectively entitled in translation “alliance of the newly appointed officials or vip”and “middle chapter twoway tollbooth” and the issue in question carried a cover which bears a banner title reading in translation“alliance of the newly appointed officials or vip how did a group of young technocrats who stretched across business commercialindustrialand forex sectors set up the twoway tollbooth on foreign investment approval involving the richest chinese man li ka shing therichest man in china huang guang yu and also famous enterprises such as siemens philips and capital group” the second articlereferred to the respondent by name and alleged that she had engaged in corruption by paying us by way of a “consultancyfee” part of which was intended by her to be distributed to a senior government official in mainland china for assisting in theapproval of projects related to cheung kong holdings limited by the mainland authorities that article also alleged that the respondenthad admitted to the police that she had paid the us “consultancy fee”  the appellant is a company incorporated in the cayman islands whose shares are listed on the hong kong stock exchange it is aholding company of a group of subsidiaries including the company having the exclusive advertising rights for the magazine thereis a close connection between the appellant and the publisher its four directors who include mr wang are also directors of thepublisher mr wang is the chairman and chief executive officer of the appellant the chairman and legal representative of the publisherand the editorincharge of the magazine and chief executive officer of seec the offices used by the appellant the publisher andseec in beijing are all located on different floors of the same building  in hong kong the appellant handled the subscriptions of the magazine here and overseas excluding china and its distribution tosuch subscribers of which there were about  distribution of the magazine by the appellant occurred in the following manner  at the material time the appellant had a small office in hong kong with two employees for each issue of the magazine one ofthe appellant’s employees a ms chan would prepare envelopes with address labels and postage for subscribers overseas and forthose in noncommercial areas of hong kong for the local subscribers in commercial areas ms chan prepared address labels  ms chan would then give all the envelopes and labels to a courier company eds express co who in turn would collect a numberof copies of the magazine from a newspaper distributor chan sun kee books and newspaper ltd “chan sun kee” to whom copieswere delivered directly from the printer in shenzhen the courier company would then put the subscribers’ copies of the magazineinto the envelopes prepared by ms chan or stick the address labels she had prepared onto the plastic wrapping of the magazine thecourier company would then deliver or post the subscribers’ copies of the magazine  the appellant’s two employees in hong kong would only receive copies of each issue of the magazine after they had been distributedby the courier when chan sun kee would return the leftover copies about two or three days after the bulk of the copies of the magazinehad been dispatched to newsagents for sale or delivered or posted to subscribers by the courier b the proceedings below  at trial in the court of first instance the appellant did not contest the defamatory nature of the words complained of and the recorder found that those words were defamatoryof the respondent “in a serious way” in that they suggested that she was involved in paying bribes to corrupt officials on themainland in her capacity both as a good friend of mr li ka shing and as a director of the li ka shing foundation in return for favoursshown or facilities granted to mr li’s companies  instead the main issue at trial was whether the appellant as a distributor of the magazine was liable to the respondent for thelibel or whether it could avail itself of the defence of innocent dissemination the recorder rejected the appellant’s argumentthat the defence was only defeated where a subordinate publisher distributed with knowledge that the material contained an actionablelibel on the plaintiff to which there was no defence he held that the appellant was not entitled to rely on the defence of innocent dissemination because he found that its ignoranceof the “libellous material” was due to its negligence in adopting a system whereby it did not vet the issues of the magazinedistributed by it in any manner he also held that the appellant failed to prove that it did not in fact know the relevant issue of the magazine “contained thelibel complained of” before it caused copies to be distributed to the subscribers in hong kong and overseas so that the defenceof innocent dissemination failed regardless of any negligence  the recorder gave judgment for the respondent and awarded damages in her favour in the sum of hk  on appeal to the court of appeal the only issue was whether the defence of innocent dissemination relieved the appellant of liability for the libel the appellantcontended as it had at trial that a subordinate distributor should not be held liable for a libel unless he knew or ought to haveknown that the material distributed contained an actionable libel on the plaintiff to which there was no defence  cheung ja delivering the only reasoned judgment with which yeung vp and chu ja agreed rejected the appellant’s contentionas to the ambit of the defence of innocent dissemination and concluded that the defence was not available because upholding therecorder he held that the appellant’s lack of knowledge “of the defamatory content” was due to its negligence having held the appellant to have been negligent cheung ja dismissed the appeal and declined to address the issue of whether theappellant had actual knowledge of the defamatory matter through attribution of mr wang’s knowledge of the libel c the question of law for which leave to appeal was granted  the court of appeal dismissed the appellant’s application for leave to appeal to this court and the appellant renewed its application to the appeal committee which granted leave to the appellant to appeal to this court onthe following question of law of great general or public importance namely “what is the nature of the knowledge possessed by a secondary publisher or which taking reasonable care a secondary publisherwould have acquired which suffices to exclude such secondary publisher from relying on the defence of innocent dissemination inparticular must it be knowledge simply that the publication contains a statement which carries a defamatory meaning or must itbe knowledge that the publication contains an actionable libel subject to no valid defences”  as can be seen the question posits two alternative states of knowledge for the defence of innocent dissemination namely i knowledgethat the publication contains a statement carrying a defamatory meaning and ii knowledge that the publication contains an actionablelibel subject to no valid defences it was the appellant’s case that the correct answer to the question is ii and that sincethe courts below did not exclude reliance on the defence on the basis of such knowledge the judgments below must be set aside anda retrial ordered alternatively the appellant invited us to go further and hold that on any view of the evidence it could notbe said that the appellant was negligent in not knowing that the magazine contained an actionable libel to which there was no defenceand that whatever mr wang’s state of knowledge this could not be attributed to the appellant on that basis the appellant invitedus to set aside the judgments below and dismiss the action altogether  to put the question into its proper context it is useful to review some of the general principles applying to the law of defamationrelating to libel and publication and the defence of innocent dissemination d libel and publication  subject to the balance that needs to be struck to protect freedom of expression the law of defamation seeks to protect a person’sreputation it being recognised that it is necessary to afford such protection against untrue statements which lower that personin the estimation of rightthinking members of society generally in hong kong the law of defamation is governed by the common law as modified by the provisions of the defamation ordinance a defamatory statement may be made orally in which case it constitutes the tort of slander or in writing in which case it constitutesthe tort of libel one of the necessary elements of either tort is publication of the defamatory matter complained of  in oriental press group ltd v fevaworks solutions ltd ribeiro pj with whom the other members of the court agreed comprehensively reviewed the law relating to what constitutes publicationof a libel as there pointed out at  until mitigated by the common law defence of innocent dissemination liability for publishing alibel was strict “a person was held liable for publishing a libel if by an act of any description he could be said to have intentionally assistedin the process of conveying the words bearing the defamatory meaning to a third party regardless of whether he knew that the article in question contained those words” emphasis added  at common law as a matter of general principle the person who first spoke or composed the defamatory matter who may be calledthe originator is liable provided he intended to publish it or failed to take reasonable care to prevent publication liabilityextends to any person who participated in secured eg by encouraging or procuring or authorised the publication including theprinter of a defamatory work these persons may all be referred to as the first or main publishers to distinguish them from subordinate publishers which areaddressed below and in a newspaper or magazine setting the journalist editor printers and vicariously the newspaper proprietorare all treated as the first or main publishers  liability for the publication of defamatory material at common law is strict and so a first or main publisher is liable for thetort of libel unless broadly he establishes a defence such as justification or honest comment or demonstrates that the publicationwas on an occasion of privilege or establishes one of the specific defences available under the defamation ordinance  it was in order to mitigate against the harshness of the publication rule as it applies to first or main publishers that the commonlaw developed the defence of innocent dissemination this defence is available to a person who is not the author printer or first or main publisher of a work which contains a libelbut who only takes a subordinate part in disseminating it for example by selling distributing or handing to another a copy of thenewspaper or book containing it such distributors or subordinate publishers can avoid liability for the publication if they establish the elements of the defenceaddressed below  apart from the first or main publishers and subsidiary publishers the common law also recognises that persons may be involved asintermediaries in the publication of defamatory matter but simply as mere conduits that do no more than fulfil the role of a passivemedium for communication a telephone carrier is an example of this type of intermediary which may be referred to as a mere facilitator such an intermediary does not publish at all and therefore has no need for the mitigating defence of innocent dissemination  in the present case it was accepted by the appellant that it was a subordinate publisher of the magazine and it was not contendedby the respondent that the appellant was either a first or main publisher who would be strictly liable for publishing the defamatorystatements complained of or by the appellant that it was a mere facilitator who would not have published them at all e the defence of innocent dissemination e the elements of the defence as identified in fevaworks  as a subordinate publisher the appellant could avoid liability if it were able to establish the elements of the defence of innocentdissemination in fevaworks ribeiro pj identified those elements by reference to the judgment of romer lj in vizetelly v mudie’s select library ltd namely the subordinate publisher must show  that he was innocent of any knowledge of the libel contained in the work disseminated by him  that there was nothing in the work or the circumstances under which it came to him or was disseminated by him which ought to haveled him to suppose that it contained a libel and  that when the work was disseminated by him it was not by any negligence on his part that he did not know that it contained thelibel the onus lies on the subordinate publisher to prove the elements of the defence where he does so ribeiro pj held that althoughhe will have published the libel he will not be responsible for it  ribeiro pj drew attention to two important features of the defence first that it is not available to the first or main publisherbut only to persons who in the ordinary course of business play a subordinate part in disseminating it and secondly that forthis class of persons it replaces the strict liability rule with one which imposes liability on the basis that the person playingthe subordinate role knew or ought by the exercise of reasonable care in the circumstances in which the work came to him or wasdisseminated to have known that the article disseminated contained defamatory material  in this appeal it was accepted by both parties that the defence of innocent dissemination is correctly stated in fevaworks and it was not suggested that the court should depart in any way from its decision in that case as to the nature and elements ofthe defence instead the question of law which is raised by the appellant’s case in this appeal relates to an aspect of the defencenot directly addressed in fevaworks e the question of law posed and the parties’ respective positions  the question of law for which leave to appeal was granted is set out at paragraph  above and as noted in paragraph  abovethe appellant’s case in answer to the question posed is that the state of knowledge required to exclude the defence of innocentdissemination is knowledge that the publication contains an actionable libel subject to no valid defences  the appellant’s case as further clarified by mr shieh in his oral submissions was that the true rule is that the subordinatepublisher is only excluded from the defence of innocent dissemination if it knew or ought reasonably to have known a that the material distributed contained the statement complained of b that such statement bore a defamatory meaning and c that there was no defence against an action for defamation reformulated to reflect the appellant’s acceptance that it bears the burden of proof it was the appellant’s case that it is onlyexcluded from the defence if it is unable to show on a balance of probabilities that it did not know and could not reasonably havebeen expected to have known the matters in a b and c in the course of argument knowledge extending to all three of thesematters was referred to as “type c knowledge” and i shall adopt that description in this judgment  for the respondent mr johnny mok sc invited us to reject the appellant’s contention as to the requisite state of knowledge however he rightly pointed out that thefirst alternative posed in the certified question namely knowledge that the publication contains a statement carrying a defamatorymeaning itself posited two alternatives  the respondent’s first alternative was that the defence is excluded unless the subordinate publisher can show that it did notknow of and could not reasonably have discovered the existence and gist of the content complained of in the article distributedit being irrelevant whether the defendant knew that such content had a defamatory meaning it will be seen that this is the sameas knowledge limited to a in the appellant’s formulation above and for convenience it was referred to as “type a knowledge”  the respondent’s second alternative was that the defence is excluded unless the subordinate publisher can show that it did notknow of and could not reasonably have discovered the existence and gist of the content complained of in the article distributedor that it knew of such content but did not know of and could not reasonably have discovered that such content had a defamatory meaning this is the same as knowledge that extends to b in the appellant’s formulation above and was referred to as “type b knowledge”  strictly the question of whether the requisite knowledge to defeat the defence of innocent dissemination is type c knowledge mightbe said not to arise on the facts of the case it was not suggested in the appellant’s evidence at trial that prior to publishingthe words complained of it had considered them but had formed a reasonable belief that an action for libel could be successfullydefended however the courts below fully considered and rejected the appellant’s contention that as a matter of law proof oftype c knowledge was required to defeat the defence of innocent dissemination moreover in deciding the case the courts belowclearly did not apply that test of knowledge to the facts in arriving at their conclusion that the appellant had not establishedthe defence it is therefore appropriate for this court to resolve the question of whether the appellant’s contention that proofof type c knowledge is required is correct e lord denning’s judgment in goldsmith v sperrings  the appellant’s assertion of the need for proof of type c knowledge to defeat the defence is solely based as mr shieh candidlyaccepted on a view expressed by lord denning in his judgment in goldsmith v sperrings that case involved multiple actions against the publishers of the satirical magazine “private eye” which led to an applicationby a group of retail distributors of the magazine for an order that the actions against them should be stayed or struck out as anabuse since they were being pursued not to protect the plaintiff’s reputation but instead for the collateral purpose of destroyingthe magazine by cutting off its retail outlets the parties had argued the appeal on the assumption that the distributors were prima facie liable and the majority of the court of appeal scarman and bridge ljj dismissed the distributors’ appeal on the basis that atan interlocutory stage there was no sufficiently clear evidence to establish that the action was being pursued for an illegitimatecollateral purpose  the third member of the court lord denning mr took a very different view he disagreed with his brethren on the issue of abusebut additionally he held in effect that the action did not disclose a reasonable cause of action because there was no liabilityon the part of the distributors this was based on his view of the law that “common sense and fairness require that no subordinate distributor – from top to bottom – should be held liable for a libelcontained in it unless he knew or ought to have known that the newspaper or periodical contained a libel on the plaintiff himselfthat is to say that it contained a libel on the plaintiff which could not be justified or excused and i should have thought thatit was for the plaintiff to prove this”  it will be seen that this dictum of lord denning which was clearly obiter posits proof of an absence of type c knowledge for the defence of innocent dissemination hence the appellant’s reliance on hisjudgment as already noted however the appellant did not go so far as to adopt lord denning’s suggestion that the burden shouldbe on the plaintiff to prove that knowledge on the part of the distributor  lord denning’s view of the law on this point does not appear to have been embraced by any other common law court it was consideredat first instance by eady j in metropolitan international schools ltd trading as skillstrain andor traingame v designtechnica corpn trading as digital trendsand others in the context of an action against an internet search engine google in respect of allegedly defamatory comments appearing in a“snippet” of information generated on a search he held that google had no responsibility for the publication and set asidethe grant of leave to serve the writ on it out of the jurisdiction of relevance to this appeal is that he rejected lord denning’sview on the ambit of the defence of innocent dissemination for the reasons addressed below  academic commentators have taken mixed positions on this issue the editors of gatley set out the elements of the defence at  where they adopt the formulation that the defendant must show “that he did not know that the book or paper contained the libel complained of” in footnote  reference is made to bridgelj’s judgment in goldsmith v sperrings at p where he refers to knowledge that the publication contained “defamatory matter” suggesting type a or type b knowledgebut not type c and then contrasts lord denning’s dissenting judgment quoting the passage cited above the editors of duncan and neill on defamation th ed also note the difference of opinion between lord denning and bridge lj but do not offer a view as to which is correct support for lord denning’s view is however forthcoming in carterruck on libel and privacy where it is suggested his is the “better view” although it is noted that the position is “not without doubt” and in collins on defamation which appears to favour lord denning’s view and criticises eady j’s rejection of it in metropolitan international schools e is type c knowledge required  this is the critical question on which the appeal turns and for the reasons which follow the appellant’s contention that proofof type c knowledge is required in order to defeat the defence must be rejected  first as a matter of principle the rationale of the defence of innocent dissemination is to mitigate against the harshness ofthe strict publication rule which does not require the first or main publisher to be aware of the defamatory nature of the materialhe is publishing instead the criteria which affix him with liability as the first or main publisher are knowledge and control as to the nature of the knowledge required ribeiro pj’s judgment in fevaworks demonstrates clearly that it is knowledge of the contents of the publication whilst this analysis is material to the antecedent and different question of whether someone is a first or main publisher andas such subject to the strict publication rule there is no logical basis for importing a different test of knowledge for the subsequentquestion of whether a person who is not a first or main publisher because he does not exercise any control over the content published can bring himself within the requirements of the defence of innocent dissemination  in this context it is highly material that ribeiro pj equated the knowledge criterion that identifies a distinguishing characteristicof a first or main publisher with the first requirement of the defence of innocent dissemination it is also noteworthy that ribeiro pj considered that the same standard of reasonableness should apply to the situation of acquiredknowledge where a subordinate publisher had unwittingly published defamatory matter he would be protected by the defence of innocentdissemination ribeiro pj held that he should be afforded the continued protection of the defence “if he proves that upon becomingaware of such content he promptly took all reasonable steps to remove the offending content from circulation as soon as reasonablypracticable”  to make the defence dependent on proof of an absence of type c knowledge would therefore be to put the defence on a very differentfooting to its underlying rationale of mitigating the harshness of the strict publication rule  secondly in his judgment in goldsmith v sperrings lord denning does not cite any authority for his formulation of the knowledge element of the defence to the contrary none ofthe leading cases in which the defence was developed support the requirement of proof of type c knowledge to defeat the defence  in emmens v pottle lord esher mr held that the defendant vendor of a newspaper was “primâ facie liable” for having sold a newspaper containing“a libel on the plaintiff” and therefore required to demonstrate facts which showed they did not publish the libel similarly in vizetelly v mudie’s select library ltd supra romer lj referred to dissemination of the defamatory material as resulting in “primâ facie publication of it” and hence liabilityunless the elements of the defence of innocent dissemination were established prima facie liability in defamation is necessarily subject to positive defences such as justification honest comment or privilege there isno reason to suppose that lord esher or romer lj were contemplating type c knowledge for the defence of innocent dissemination sinceprima facie liability necessarily suggests a liability which stands until defeated by some positive defence and in neither case did they suggestthat the respective defendants would have avoided liability if they merely proved they believed such a defence existed  nor is type c knowledge suggested as relevant to the defence of innocent dissemination in sun life assurance co of canada v wh smith  son ltd in that case the defendant newspaper vendors were held to have been negligent in failing properly to supervise the display of postersat their bookstalls in scrutton lj’s formulation of the elements of the defence of innocent dissemination he referred to negligencein respect of the “publication of the libel” and when referring to the finding of the jury his lordship appears to have referredto this as meaning that the statement was found to bear “a libellous meaning” greer lj found liability established on the basis of the jury’s finding that the relevant poster “contained statements whichwere defamatory of the plaintiffs” since the stall manager “must have known its contents” neither scrutton lj nor greer lj’s judgments lend any support for the need to establish type c knowledge to defeat the defenceof innocent dissemination  thirdly there are significant practical difficulties in determining how the defence will operate these were identified by eadyj in the following terms “… it seems to me that the defence of innocent dissemination as interpreted by lord denning mr throws up more problems than itis likely to solve how could someone hoping to avail himself of the defence know that a defence of justification was bound to fail save in the simplest of cases how is heshe to approach the often controversialand uncertain question of meaning how much legal knowledge is to be attributed to himher in arriving at these conclusions whatof a possible reynolds defence” emphasis in original notwithstanding the criticism to which this passage is subjected in collins on defamation supra these practical difficulties are very real and call into question the soundness of the appellant’s contention that proof of typec knowledge is required to defeat the defence it is true as the appellant submits that the question of meaning applies whetherproof of type b or type c knowledge is required but if so that may simply be a reason for preferring to regard proof of type aknowledge where meaning does not arise as the requisite mental state for the defence  in this context the appellant’s reliance on regulation  of the electronic commerce ec directive regulations  in the unitedkingdom is overstated the appellants seek to rely on that regulation by way of example of another context in which a defence depends ona party assessing the strength or weakness of potential defences however such an assessment is in respect of various forms ofunlawfulness including crimes such as hate speech or incitement to violence where the unlawfulness may be selfevident in the contextof defamation the imposition of such an assessment may be problematic or unworkable moreover the specific and limited context of that regulation is the protection of internet service providers from liability forstorage of information on their servers and there is no reason to conclude that the policy decision underlying the regulation reflectsthe common law defence of innocent dissemination  fourthly contrary to the appellant’s submission that imposing a requirement of proof of type c knowledge to defeat the defencestrikes a proper balance between freedom of expression on the one hand and reputational protection on the other an acceptance ofthe appellant’s case would skew that balance very heavily in favour of a subordinate publisher given the practical difficultiesidentified above requiring proof of type c knowledge to defeat the defence will make it virtually impossible successfully to suea subordinate publisher such publishers will in practice have near immunity against suit for passing on defamatory statements andunlike first or main publishers who are subject to the strict publication rule will be relieved of the need to establish one ofthe traditional defences such as justification or privilege in order to avoid liability whilst it may be desirable to protect smallnewsvendors and distributors against litigation for material originated by others it must not be forgotten that it is through theacts of these newsvendors and distributors that a plaintiff’s reputation will in fact be harmed and there is no assurance thatan action against the first or main publisher will be possible or effective if such protection is required this would seem tobe more appropriately achieved by means of legislation rather than the adoption of an unprincipled or problematic test as part ofthe common law defence  fifthly in none of the following common law jurisdictions in which the defence of innocent dissemination has been put on a statutorybasis is it required to prove an absence of type c knowledge instead  in the uk s of the defamation act  provides that it is a defence for a defendant to show among other things that“c he did not know and had no reason to believe that what he did caused or contributed to the publication of a defamatorystatement”  the legislation in australia consistently provides that the defence is available where a defendant shows among other things that “b the defendant neitherknew nor ought reasonably to have known that the matter was defamatory”  in new zealand s of the defamation act  provides that the defence is available where a person shows among other things“a that that person did not know that the matter contained the material that is alleged to be defamatory” and  in ireland s of the defamation act  which expressly replaces the common law defence provides that the defence is available where the defendant proves among other things that “c he or she did not know and hadno reason to believe that what he or she did caused or contributed to the publication of a statement that would give rise to a causeof action in defamation”  although the absence of any statutory support for type c knowledge as an element of the defence of innocent dissemination is notconclusive it lends some support to the view that its adoption was seen in those jurisdictions as problematic and not striking theright balance between free speech and the right to protection of reputation it also lends support to the view that in those jurisdictionsinsofar as the statutory provision was to codify the common law defence it was not thought that the common law defence requiredproof of an absence of type c knowledge  in this context in respect of the uk defamation act  submissions were made to us as they had been to the court of appeal by reference to the parliamentary debate concerning what became s of that act it is unnecessary to explore that debate or toconsider those submissions at length the statutory defence in s of the  act was clearly intended to afford protection tothose subordinate publishers at least to whom the common law defence of innocent dissemination would be available although the  act did not expressly abolish thecommon law defence it has been held to have effectively superseded it but since it cannot be demonstrated conclusively whether the s defence codified the common law or provided for a narrower defenceas some academic commentators suggest a consideration of the parliamentary debate does not assist in answering the question posed in this appeal  similarly comments made in the context of the consideration of the bill that became the uk defamation act  do not assist mr shieh referred us for example to the views of the joint committee on the draft defamation bill and of the booksellers associationon their understanding of the ambit of the common law defence suggesting that proof of type c knowledge was required to excludethe defence these comments are not authoritative and it remains for the court to determine the true ambit of the common law defence as a matterof principle  s of the uk  act affords greater protection than the common law for subordinate publishers in that such a publisher cannot be sued unless it is notreasonably practicable to sue the author editor or publisher ie the first or main publisher in the same way as noted aboves of the  act had extended the statutory defence to printers and live broadcasters to whom the common law defence might notapply these are examples of legislation seeking to strike a particular balance between free speech and the right to protection ofreputation and there may be strong arguments for adopting such a balance in this jurisdiction but if so that is a balance thatmust be struck by the legislature since it is different to the balance struck by the operation of the common law defence of innocentdissemination e the consequence of rejecting type c knowledge  mr shieh accepted that if the court rejected his submission that proof of type c knowledge was required to defeat the defence ofinnocent dissemination it would follow that the appeal must be dismissed as demonstrated in section f below on the recorder’sfinding of negligence upheld by the court of appeal the appellant could not bring itself within the defence of innocent disseminationand thereby avoid liability to the respondent for the defamatory statements contained in the magazine e is it necessary to resolve whether the defence is excluded by type a knowledge or by type b knowledge  mr mok confirmed in answer to an inquiry from the bench that it did not matter to the respondent’s case in this appeal whetherit was proof of type a knowledge that was required in order to defeat the defence of innocent dissemination or proof of type b knowledge this must be correct as shown in section f below the courts below held that the appellant’s negligence consisted in not inspectingthe magazine at all they held that had the appellant done so it would have discovered the libellous material about the plaintiff this must at least equate to an absence of proof of type b knowledge and so whether the true basis of the defence is an absenceof proof of type a knowledge as opposed to type b knowledge is immaterial to the outcome of this case  whether the correct mental state for the defence is absence of proof of type a knowledge or type b knowledge is not an easy question it involves the difficult balance between freedom of speech and the right to protection of reputation as such it may engage adebate about the constitutionality of the defence of innocent dissemination an issue which has not been raised in this appeal butwhich could be raised in a case where the distinction between type a and type b knowledge were material to the outcome of the case in the circumstances it is preferable not to answer that question in the context of this appeal but instead to leave the issueopen to await determination in a suitable case f applying the law to the facts  in view of mr shieh’s correct acceptance that the appeal must be dismissed if he lost on the point of law raised in the appealit is not strictly necessary to analyse the facts of the case and to apply the law to those facts however there is some valuein doing so in order to demonstrate how the defence of innocent dissemination works  here it will be recalled in seeking to bring itself within the defence the appellant accepted that it bore the burden of showingthat there was no negligence on its part in not knowing that the relevant issue of the magazine contained statements defamatory ofthe respondent as shown in section a above in particular in paragraph  the appellant’s employees in hong kong did not actuallysee the magazine until after it was distributed by them via chan sun kee and the courier and there was no evidence of any employeeof the appellant elsewhere having seen it it may be thought that a denial of the defence of innocent dissemination in these circumstancesis harsh however for the reasons given by the recorder and developed by the court of appeal the banner heading on the cover ofthe relevant issue of the magazine was clearly such as to put any reader of it on notice to the possibility that the related articlesin the magazine might contain defamatory statements in these circumstances even a cursory inspection of the issue in questionwould have put the appellant distributor on notice of the possibility or likelihood that the magazine about to be disseminated containeddefamatory material the respondent and court of appeal were entitled to find that to adopt a system which eliminated even a cursoryinspection was negligent that finding of negligence is not challenged by the appellant quite realistically since it is a concurrentfinding by the courts below  on the basis of that finding the common law defence of innocent dissemination is not available to the appellant since it cannotshow that its lack of knowledge of the defamatory statements in the magazine was not due to its negligence accordingly no otherdefence being asserted it is liable to the respondent for damages for the tort of libel  that is not to say however that an omission to look at a publication before distribution in every case will be sufficient to establishthe necessary degree of negligence to defeat the defence of innocent dissemination this is a question that is fact and contextsensitive and will depend on all the circumstances of the particular publication what will be negligent in the case of a distributorof a print publication with features putting any reader on alert as to the possible defamatory content will not necessarily be negligentin the very different context of an internet web host which receives many thousands of posts from different sources to a web forum as ribeiro pj pointed out in fevaworks there is a qualitative difference between the “onetomany” publications of the more traditional print and broadcast publicationsand the “manytomany” communications that are involved in internet publications and what is needed to satisfy the standard of reasonable care will vary according to the circumstances in the latter context there are strong reasons of principle and policy to set the relevant negligence standard at a level thatonly exposes the distributor to liability when there has been a failure to respond appropriately after defamatory material is drawnto its attention whether that also applies to a distributor of a newspaper or magazine will depend on the facts of the given case the present appealis not such a case g conclusion  for these reasons i would dismiss this appeal with costs lord collins of mapesbury npj  i
