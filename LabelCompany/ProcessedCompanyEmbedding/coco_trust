message you can also call us on     or select live chat to chat with one of our advisors cocacola  empowering consumers to cut their own environmental impact cocacola teams up with the carbon trust to establish how consumers can be empowered to cut their personal environmental impact this groundbreaking project tested whether providing environmental information to consumers can help encourage sustainable consumption habits the results of the work are available in the personal carbon allowances white paper the conclusions and recommendations from our work indicate context is critical  providing the environmental context for typical consumer lifestyle choices can help inform their decision making process behaviour change is a challenge  the intense emotional attachment to certain high carbon lifestyle choices are difficult to change in order to influence change brands need to stress the secondary or tertiary direct benefits to consumers health wealth and quality of life simple measures can add up  brands have a clear role to play to help motivate consumers to make changes by illustrating that event small changes when combined contribute to a significant impact convincing people to change their daily habits  in terms of the food and drink they consume and the travel and leisure activities  is an emotive issue  for a more sustainable world to be created however consumers  as well as big business  must alter their daytoday behaviour to cut carbon emissions about the cocacola company the cocacola company is the worlds largest beverage company refreshing consumers with more than  sparkling and still brands led by cocacola the most valuable brand in the world its product portfolio features  billion dollar brands including diet coke fanta sprite cocacola zero vitaminwater powerade minute maid simply georgia and del valle globally it is the no  provider of sparkling beverages readytodrink coffees and juices and juice drinks through the worlds largest beverage distribution system consumers in more than  countries consume its drinks at a rate of  billion servings a day together with its bottling partners  including cocacola european partners  it ranks among the top  private employers in the world   icons like cocacola  the worlds most valuable brand and leading provider of bottled drinks  have the power to galvanise consumers into action and trigger meaningful shifts in behaviour for a challenge of this magnitude and complexity to be tackled effectively the strategic input thoughtleadership skills and resources of a recognised expert in carbon reduction issues and solutions were required  thats why the cocacola company chose to work with the carbon trust a global authority in carbon reduction management and technical author of pas  the international standard for measuring embodied greenhouse gas ghg emissions of products and services  the behaviour change challenge the ultimate goal how to stimulate behavioural change among global consumers in terms of the products and services they consume in order to minimise the carbon emissions these emit and reduce their personal and collective contribution to climate change   providing information in a credible relevant and understandable way is the key to success only then will people consider the impact of the products and services they consume and the options available to them in terms of altering their everyday behaviour context therefore is critical displaying the carbon reduction label on pack may quantify the carbon emissions of the product in question and the makers determination to reduce those emissions however to trigger a change in behaviour people must understand how this fits with the other products and services they consume on a daily basis only then can they decide what changes  if any  they are willing to make to reduce their personal carbon footprint to meet cocacolas brief we needed a fresh approach with the power to educate consumers about the consequences of their actions and isolate the trigger points for behavioural change in terms of their everyday consumption of products and services tom cumberlege consultant business advice the carbon trust actions taken    together we considered the concepts and public education campaigns that have been understood and embraced by consumers nutritional guideline daily amounts gda  the system which sets an ideal standard for daily calorie and nutrient consumption  provided us with a possible blueprint for action we agreed that by calculating a personal carbon allowance for individual consumers on a daily basis we could establish a meaningful target then we needed to develop and test the best ways of communicating this concept in order to trigger behavioural change ulrike sapiro environmental sustainability director of the cocacola company   based on this premise a threephase feasibility study was mapped out by the carbon trust  phase  develop the concept of a carbon gda  guideline daily allowance gda using existing national consumption data sets for uk consumers to calculate the daily amounts used for everyday events then assess an appropriate reduction factor to encourage reductions in  on a trajectory towards the uks  reduction target by  phase  test the personal carbon allowance concept as a carbon gda with consumers assess whether the carbon gda concept helps consumers make more informed decisions collect qualitative data from consumers experience living with carbon gdas develop and test options for communicating the carbon gda phase  review the findings and develop a series of recommendations for shaping related policy decisions in future   after extensive analysis eight lifestyle segments were identified where consumers had the influence to alter their habits these were commuting personal daily travel electricity gas food and drink consumption holidays and emissions from leisure and lifestyle activities further analysis by the carbon trust revealed that the average consumer is responsible for kg of embodied coe emissions per day from these lifestyle segments  next the carbon trust needed to establish what degree of carbon reduction was needed to ensure consumers were on a reduction trajectory in  to deliver the uks reduction target by   this would enable a target guideline daily allowance to be calculated for each lifestyle segment a host of complex issues were considered as part of this process such as the merits of a global versus countryspecific allowance the need for carbon emissions to be gradually reduced over time and the fact that the reduction rate necessary varies depending on the consumers individual life style as well as their stage of life after crunching the numbers a daily pca of kg coe was agreed now we were ready to test the idea tom cumberlege consultant business advice the carbon trust the carbon trust worked with rdsi an independent market research consultancy to test attitudes to climate change the pca concept and personal triggers for behavioural change amongst men and women of various ages and stages of life  singles families and empty nesters with suburban and urban lifestyles  all participants were light greens defined as people with an interest in green issues but not yet fully informed or committed to a particular behaviour at a glance what cocacola wanted to doestablish how to harness the power of the cocacola brand to inform educate and empower individual consumer to reduce their personal carbon footprint what cocacola didteamed up with the carbon trust to develop a robust concept and methodology for a personal carbon allowance and identify the ingredients for success what cocacola accomplisheddeveloped a robust methodology identified the opportunities and challenges of this approach and created the evidence needed for the cocacola company to move forward with confidence and credibility recruit other brand leaders to support this ambitious new drive towards global sustainability and develop a coherent communications strategy   participants were given a customised carbon footprint tool  developed by the carbon trust  to record and calculate the emissions associated with their weekly energy usage food and drink consumption travel details leisure and lifestyle activities   the study confirmed that  while most consumers are willing to reduce their personal carbon footprint and have a good understanding of the impact of domestic energy consumption transport and recycling they are confused about the relative impact of their daily activities in terms of the carbon emissions embodied in the products and services they use i think the idea of having a carbon gda would be very beneficial on the whole and i believe that the majority of people would appreciate the guidance so they have the choice to alter their lifestyles a little more importantly it also revealed that most people view climate change as an issue of such magnitude and complexity that it is beyond their personal sphere of influence they simply do not see how altering their own every day habits can have a significant impact on a challenge of this scale to trigger a widespread shift in behaviour therefore communications must focus on the immediate tangible benefits to the individual that have the power to improve their health wealth and overall quality of life with carbon savings promoted as a valueadded bonus tom cumberlege consultant business advice the carbon trust i love my cheese and i will always buy it even if you tell me its bad for my carbon footprint it makes me happy dieting eating carefully watching my weight is more important to me than thinking about my carbon consumption tom cumberlege consultant business advice the carbon trust the qualitative feedback from participants suggests they were far more willing to make tangible changes to their behaviour because they knew fellow participants also shared a similar information and communications reducing food waste is one area where participants were both surprised at the relative carbon footprint and keen to share experiences of reducing their impacts in this area the results of the trial also provide interesting insight for future research namely that there was a noticeable gap in the attitudes and behaviours relating to food waste between age groups benefits the project confirmed that a real opportunity exists for an iconic brand such as cocacola to take the lead by helping consumers understand how altering their everyday behaviour can make a meaningful contribution to protecting the environment consumers will positively embrace the brands who help them understand how to do their bit for the environment so long as the information they provide is clear simple and easy to understand as consumers are unaware of the impacts from food and drink and their leisure and lifestyle activities a much wider education campaign is needed to educate people about the relative carbon emissions embodied in everything they consume importantly the project has also shown that while consumers are willing to make changes to their daily lifestyle to reduce their carbon footprint carbonsaving in itself is a secondary issue consumers are far more likely to make changes where there are tangible direct dual benefits   encouraging consumerled sustainable consumption is a big challenge for businesses together weve explored the potential that environmental information can play and uncovered valuable insights into the attitudes and behaviours of consumers cocacola does have a powerful brand and we recognise we can help consumers make a difference and influence behaviours its clear that to have a larger global impact to encourage sustainable consumption we need to work in partnership with other pioneering organisations the carbon trusts independence and credibility can help provide a noncompetitive basis for crossbusiness collaboration and were excited at the potential this can have not only for accelerating consumer behaviour change but also for the valuable lessons for our work has to inform policy makers ulrike sapiro
