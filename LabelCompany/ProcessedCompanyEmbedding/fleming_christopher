christopher hitchens on fleming and bond   august   the late christopher hitchens was one of britain’s most revered influential antagonistic polarizing brilliant erudite eloquent intelligent and entertaining writers if you have not read any of his books and articles or watched him speak interviews and discussions then it’s time you started much like his comrade the late great kingsley amis hitchens was a bond fan of the literary variety of course ian fleming had always struggled in some circles to be taken seriously as a writer and various writers have come to his defense throughout the years including kingsley amis raymond chandler and christopher hitchens to name but a few enjoy these quotes from hitch of which many were taken from hitchen’s article ‘bottoms up’ for the atlantic in april  on ian fleming by some latent intuition fleming was able to peer beyond the cold war limitations of mere spy fiction and to anticipate the emerging milieu of the colombian cartels osama bin laden and indeed the russian mafia if fleming had not been quite a heavy sadist and narcissist and allaround repressed pervert we might never have got to know rosa klebb or auric goldfinger or ernst stavro blofeld and having said that bond was originally a figure designed to hold up the british end of the “special relationship” i ought to add that the cleverness of the series lay partly in how it saw past the confines of the cold war on the james bond novels licence to hitchslap it was fleming who first conjured it and who reached beyond the kgb into our world of the colombian cartel the russian mafia and other “nonstate actors” like alqaeda “spectre” i noticed recently is an anagram of “respect” the name of a small british party led by a powerdrunk micromegalomaniac called george galloway a man with a friendly connection to saddam hussein” “fleming once confessed that he hoped to “take the story along so fast that nobody would notice the idiosyncrasies” fat chance his “idiosyncrasies” jut out like tatiana romanova’s ass what he ought to have said was that he hoped to pile on the pace and thereby hustle the reader past the point where belief has to be suspended the smaller details of products and appurtenances and accessories fulfill the function of the conjuror’s other hand they distract attention from the glaring lacunae in the plots the amazing stupidity of the supposedly mastermind villains and the reckless disregard for his own safety that this supposedly icecold agent displays by falling for every lure on bond’s drinking what is james bond really doing when he specifies the kind of martini he wants and how he wants it he is telling the bartender that he knows what he is talking about and is not to be messed around on ‘from russia with love’ james bond does not make an appearance until part two of what is perhaps his most polished adventure from russia with love and when he has been briefed by ‘m’ and outfitted by ‘q’ and told what is expected of him he suffers a midlife crisis what he asks as the plane takes him towards the golden horn would his younger self think of the man now so ‘tarnished with years of treachery and ruthlessness and fear’ sent off ‘to pimp for england’” eventually dismissing this as an idle of feeble mood he reflects further on bond and britain when fleming started to publish his stories britain was only just emerging from a long period of postwar austerity and uniformity and it was beginning to be possible to emphasize luxury and style again without having a bad conscience this development was somewhat identified with the return of the british conservatives to power and helped enable fleming to be more frankly churchillian and proimperial than would have been possible a few years previously on james bond and america  the central paradox of the classic bond stories is that although superficially devoted to the angloamerican war against communism they are full of contempt and resentment for america and americans today however i can be virtually certain that most americans below a certain age know of fleming solely or chiefly through the movies it is under this guise only that the product has been bonded for universal export the second element namely a distinctive blend of fine leather good tailoring and clubland confidence was of huge importance in appealing to american anglophilia—perhaps most especially the sort of anglophilia that had led the united states to clone the office of strategic services and later the cia from the british mi and mi the central paradox of the classic bond stories is that although superficially devoted to the angloamerican war against communism they are full of contempt and resentment for america and americans and not just political contempt or the penis envy of a declining power for a burgeoning one but cultural contempt as well and not just with cultural contempt in general but more specifically disgust about america’s plebeian interest in sex and consumerism the two bond staples “baseball amusement arcades hot dogs hideously large bosoms neon lighting” is how tiger tanaka mouths the antiamerican trope in you only live twice on sebastian faulks’ ‘devil may care’ this potboiler takes several times as long as most bond classics there is almost no sex until the very last pages there is almost no torture – an absolute staple of a bond narrative – until the very last pages those who have a canonical attitude to fleming will be able to collect their share of injokes and crossreferences wispy fragments of vesper lynd and honey ryder drift in and out of shot and memory in much the same way” shaky not stirring… fleming himself used to claim that he marched the plot along fast enough to silence all the doubts about its credibility – a guileless yet brilliant tactic but faulks’ takes fatally too long to smuggle his own effort past the customs except for absurd coincidences that really do stretch one’s credulity such as bond running into the monkeypawed villain just before being briefed about him everything is laboriously spelled out only inattention after all not haste could make a writer of this stature describe a telephone call as having been put through ‘without demur’ incidental intelligence listen to a short clip of christopher hitchens discussing kingsley amis’ ‘book of

bing ads to get started product – chris fleming skip to content chris fleming product policy data capability menu tag product intranet iterations we’ve been doing some more work on our intranet here’s a rundown of our latest release and some final thoughts on what i’ve learnt working on this product why take a digital approach to an intranet i’ve said in previous posts that intranets can be the scorn of digital purists “why not just have a wiki and a blog – it’s totally free” they cry well maybe but as this is my last intranet sprint sprintranet i wanted to make the case for taking a digital approach to this ever present departmental tool i think there are  compelling reasons improved experience for users the obvious one civil servants are users too and saving them time and effort with products that work is better for them and better for taxpayers it’s a means of spreading digital culture and techniques widely across the department talking to lots of teams in the department about their intranet content or involving them in user research has enabled me to introduce principles of agile and usercentred design to lots of people who otherwise would never have encountered these techniques a good thing in the wider scheme of digital transformation getting content design more widely understood i’m increasingly convinced that content design training should join information security and unconscious bias as mandatory for policy civil servants until that happens working with teams on their intranet content is a decent alternative it’s a good training ground a staff intranet is a reasonably low stakes environment which makes it ideal for practising agile techniques user testing and the like particularly as uses are on your door step four different fast streamers have now participated in running guerrilla testing or pop up labs in the department and done brilliantly at it on to the highlights of our latest release as ever if anyone is interested in playing around with the intranet wordpress theme it’s available on github all comments and thoughts welcomed homepage in our last intranet post we talked about the changes to the homepage design the changes have attracted a lot of great comments but more importantly our ongoing testing is showing users are completing popular tasks more easily of course not everything is working perfectly so we are continuing to tweak and improve for instance we found users were not noticing when new content was being posted in the campaign box so we introduced a ‘new’ banner to signal this event information architecture our ongoing user research has repeatedly surfaced pain points for users navigating the site users did not always understand the main section headings or what topics might be listed underneath to test further we ran several card sorting sessions to try and come up with better labels and a more intuitive architecture despite plenty of hard work it turned out we couldn’t naming and sorting things into categories is just one of those timeless problems we ended up agreeing that what we had was probably the least worst option to attack the problem from another angle we introduced some new functionality we implemented the brilliantly named accessible mega menu this now provides a drop down of topics that appears underneath a section heading to help users see what is available and help them answer their questions more quickly events the department puts on a wide range of events  by making use of theeventbrite api our intranet administrators are able to create and manage events using all the functionality of eventbrite once published the event details are pulled automatically into the relevant intranet pages along with some design tweaks we’ve made an already excellent events booking process even better our next sprint will be later in the year look out for further updates from a new product manager then  and a final word of good luck and thanks to the brilliant team my laptop will continue to wear our mission patch with pride this post was originally published on the digital health blog  things policy can learn from product six months ago i made a career pivot from policy making to product management the roles require a similar mix of empathy and politics so i feel i’ve taken to it reasonably well alongside a deep understanding of internetenabled technologies a notable difference is how much and how effectively product management makes use of specific tools and methodologies to solve problems so here are ten techniques i would bring into a policy team if i went back if any of the terms don’t make sense ben stevens from the home office has posted a handy glossary work in sprints choose a time period of  or  weeks to help give structure to the team’s work get everyone together at the start of the sprint and agree the things you are going to focus on completing in that time remembering that new tasks will come in too this is called sprint planning hold ‘standups’ over the course of the sprint and ‘retrospectives’ and ‘show and tells’ at the end of it don’t be spooked by the language these are just meetings so not exactly an alien concept to policy makers there’s no need for me to repeat better guidance elsewhere on this except to endorse how useful they are as an ensemble get a wall every team needs a wall i managed a major house renovation last year and even had a wall this is not a joke at its simplest this is expressing a task on a postit note fixing it to a nice flat surface that people can gather around and moving the tasks through columns labelled ‘doing next’ ‘doing now’ and ‘done’ do this and then feel the energy and sense of achievement coursing through the team as they deposit card after card in the done column at each standup create genuinely multidisciplinary teams i spent some time shadowing my mentor who works on nhsuk alpha a few weeks ago it’s a fullblown agile team replete with product manager delivery manger content writers designers and developers having such expertise around a table enabled them to do magical things like designing the key features of a gp lookup service in record time my experience of policy is usually hierarchical group of something akin to project managers other experts tend to be in a box somewhere wheeled out for special occasions it also now seems amazing to me that design thinking in policy is still seen as the cutting edge while it’s de rigeur in digital make it someone’s explicit responsibility to knit the team the mantra goes “the unit of delivery is the team” and commensurate effort is placed in getting that team working brilliantly together my experience working in policy teams is that if they are working great then great but if they are not the response is usually a shrug and sporadic suggestions for ‘more social events’ digital methodology encourages constant communication between the team using standups it celebrates successes through showtells and does a thorough job of learning from failures through retrospectives the result is a team completely aligned around an objective with everyone feeling they are part of something important and fantastic pace of delivery tasks fall to the team not individuals this reduces risk of single point of failure separate responsibility for daytoday delivery with big picture and vision in digital there are overlapping and complementary roles called product manager and delivery manager the former focusses on macro issues vision roadmap stakeholder management the other focusses on micro issues unblocking the obstacles the team faces daytoday and doing the team coaching i describe above this structure recognises something important about our minds being poor at doing two things at the same time it’s very effective try out some new collaborative tools digital teams more naturally have their fingers on the pulse of internetenabled tools to facilitate team communication prioritisation or collaboration i know it systems can create barriers to this but in an age where everyone has a smart phone it’s not hard to find workarounds if you had to pick any for me it is slack there’s a bit of a backlash against slack at the moment slacklash but frankly i’m still at the crest of the wave of appreciation that sees how much more efficient than email is at enabling team interaction prioritise properly product recognises you can’t do everything so have a plethora of techniques for deciding what comes next do a few things well rather than lots of things mediocrely and be rigorous in your approach to choosing which those things should be clap more digital teams religiously clap their teammate’s or others’ presentations this is not only courteous but sends the presenter away with those few extra endorphins that make it all seem worth it be agile note the small ‘a’ my simplest interpretation of this is understanding that for almost everything your first answer could well be wrong doing something and then testing it is better than trying to get it perfect first time as long as it is labelled as such it is fine to say something is a prototype or early version and will be iterated improved or even binned none of these suggestions are especially complicated but they can be tough to implement in teams unfamiliar with the language and culture digital teams should help with this where they can as forming good habits should not solely be the preserve of digital they should be for everyone i’d be delighted to give my novice advice to any policy makers so do get in touch if it would help hat tips to lisa matt and kylie for product coaching andbenji for delivery management advice   an agile intranet we designed our intranet to be continuously improved and over recent weeks have been doing just that since the intranet’s launch last year we have gathered data and done extensive research to deepen our insights into our users’ behaviour this is enabling us to flex our product to meet our users’ changing needs – in line with digital best practice in our most recent development sprint we focussed on the homepage the intranet homepage is the first thing most people in the department see when they log on in the morning so it’s not surprising that  of user journeys begin there that’s not true of all websites – govuk pages are often reached via a search engine – but our default makes the homepage a prime piece of digital real estate it deserves excellent design and only the most important content or features from looking at site traffic we could see the content users visited most over the past year for instance guidance on performance management expenses claims booking video conferencing and a few specific  forms over the last month or so content about the dh change programme has also been very popular this data informed our qualitative research we interviewed twentyone individuals asking them about their use of the intranet we also observed them using the homepage to try and perform particular tasks as well as interviews we ran card sorting exercises and a codesign workshop where users drew sketches of their ideal homepages or voted on features they liked from other government intranets the range of ideas generated ranged from the pragmatic to the extravagant but the discussion was invaluable in helping our suppliers understand the needs of dh staff over two weeks our experts translated those insights into some of the changes you can now see bringing in common design patterns by integrating the menu search and login into the header to help users find them developing prominent areas for links to popular services and pages these are customisable by our content team so can change as needs change introducing a campaign box to highlight the most important ‘needtoknow’ information of the moment increasing the number of news stories further down the page as the large number of users felt the stories dropped off the homepage too quickly retaining a clean design that users responded to well but binning the bits that users did not need or want anymore communicating via slack across several uk locations the team deployed the changes early last tuesday morning thanks to the brilliant work of the developers we encountered almost no bugs and by the time we got into the office some fantastic feedback had started to come in launching is the start of a process not the end we’re moving straight into more user testing including those using assistive technologies to ensure our changes are performing as we want an ‘agile intranet’ is something the department should be proud of internal services and tools are rarely built in this way it has only been possible for us to effect improvements to this product quickly cheaply and securely thanks to our predecessors they left us a site built on open source software to open standards with no contract lockin and with the precedent set for relentless focus on user needs long may that continue originally posted to digital health blog search for search recent posts intranet iterations bridging the digital language
