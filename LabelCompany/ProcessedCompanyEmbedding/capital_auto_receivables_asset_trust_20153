rating driversstable collateral characteristics the  pool is representative of nonprime collateral with a  weighted average wa fair isaac corp fico score  wa apr and  wa loantovalue ltv ratio of the pool  consists of new vehicle contracts while extendedterm contracts total  all relatively consistent with recent securitized pools oneyear revolving period risk the revolving structure introduces risk of collateral migrating to a weaker pool before the start of the amortization period although eligibility criteria pertaining to the additional receivables may mitigate some of this risk fitch accounts for collateral migration in its derivation of the base case loss proxy for  adequate credit enhancement initial hard credit enhancement ce for class a notes totals  the nondeclining reserve

demonstrates solid capabilities as an originator underwriter and servicer as evidenced by its historical prime and nonprime portfolios and securitization performance legal structure integrity the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of afin would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivitiesunanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case this in turn could result in fitch taking negative rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to capital auto receivables asset trust  to increased credit losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses this shows a potential downgrade of one or two categories under fitchs moderate x base case loss scenario especially for the subordinate bonds the notes could experience downgrades of three or more rating categories potentially leading to distressed ratings below bsf or possibly default under fitchs severe x base case loss scenario due diligence usagefitch was provided with thirdparty due diligence information from deloitte  touche llp the thirdparty due diligence focused on comparing or recomputing certain information
