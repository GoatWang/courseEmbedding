destroying pappy van winkle bourbona sad day for bourbon fans most popular getty by aaron goldfarb jan   bourbon brands arent usually trending topics on twitter and facebook nor do they often make the nightly news but such was the case back in  when  cases of the legendary pappy van winkle were stolen the kentuckybased company was trending again last year when authorities took down a softballplayin guntotin steroidtraffickin organized crime ring and retrieved some of that stolen hooch and here we find ourselves this week talking about pappy van winkle once moreadvertisement  continue reading belowfirst came the news that the franklin county sheriffs office would be auctioning off  of the recovered bottles everyone celebrated now comes the sad news that the van winkle family has asked a judge to have those bottles destroyed and everyone cried whyyet i cant help thinking all this talk over  measly bottlesof course this is no ordinary bourbon pappy van winkle has become the most famous whiskey in america a unicorn unseen on store shelves for years untasted by the vast majority of humans and sold for astronomical sums on the secondary market those  bottles have a retail value of around  and a secondary value of perhaps  depending on age that may sound like a lot but its not i wouldnt be surprised if buffalo trace—the distiller of the van winkle line—washes that much whiskey down the drain every week most popularso whats the big dealthe whiskey lovers boo and the conspiracy theorists say the van winkles are loving the attention…again explained acclaimed bourbon writer fred minnickthe van winkles are if anything masters at getting and then keeping their name and their eponymous bourbons name in the headlines im not claiming julian van winkle iii—grandson of pappy and president of the old rip van winkle distillery note not an actual distillery—orchestrated this theft but the outspoken man and his famed family have yet again taken a minor story and managed to keep it in the news cycle all week longas always these pappy tales have absolutely nothing to do with the actual taste of the products my reviews pappy  year is as worldclass as bourbon comes while the  and  years suffer from an overwoodiness instead the story once again is about how rare this product is—though really not that rare with about  bottles produced per year—and how every bottle lost is yet another bottle you will likely never tasteof course we cant ignore the fact that no one knows what the hell happened to those  bottles while they were out of buffalo traces controlwhere is the precedent for a sheriffs department auctioning alcohol or a controlled substance minnick added believing the bourbon should be destroyed how do we know the steroidslinging child pornhaving criminals didnt tamper with the whiskeyits a valid point still destroy it or not i would bet the van winkles dont really care what happens to these  bottles it wont affect their bottom line nor the perceived quality of their product but ultimately it will have more people writing about their bourbon and arguing about it and wondering just how good it truly is and ultimately coveting it even more than they

products which are difficult to come by said jack rose’s katie williams “we know the right people” marvin josephthe washington post by karen heller by karen heller october   follow kheller hunting season nears not only for wild game but the rarer prey of domestic smallbatch whiskey in a matter of weeks the frenzied search for that most american of spirits and elusive of brands will begin anew only  cases of aged van winkle bourbon will ship from a warehouse in frankfort ky to distributors before arriving at select liquor stores and watering holes fortunate to score a few bottles with a pronounced emphasis on a few the search for van winkle has inspired a song a blog an app and a delirious secondary market where a bottle has fetched as much as  also theft from now until the bourbon arrives at schneider’s of capitol hill most likely in november “we’ll get  to  calls a day asking for pappy” said general manager joseph prebble referring to the most coveted older   and  year expressions of the wheated whiskey the calls are useless pappy which ships just once a year will never grace the shelves there or at many other stores as supply is limited and top customers get priority many enthusiasts who would gladly pay the  that the yearold should sell for will never get their hands on a bottle the drought is all the more confounding because only six years ago it was possible for anyone to score a couple of bottles even at a charmless pennsylvania state store now the whiskey has vanished — poof — like a bourbon brigadoon president julian van winkle iii spent much of his  years trying to get the world to notice the whiskey that bears his grandfather’s name and cigarpuffing likeness “bourbon was really nothing back then when i started it was perceived as something just the good old boys were drinking down south” he said “it’s basically been the same recipe for  years more or less with a few tweaks” said preston van winkle julian’s son the bourbon didn’t change it was consumers’ tastes driving an international market mad for american whiskey and pappy in particular preston has less than half a bottle in his louisville home the reason for pappy hysteria is older than the bourbon extraordinary demand and limited supply that could not have been predicted when the whiskey was first barreled during the final gasps of the th century the bourbon revival is part of a craving for luxury goods all things american especially from the south along with a diy appreciation for craft businesses and a desire for richertasting liquor — smallbatch gin rye and bourbon contrary to myth bourbon can be distilled anywhere in the nation not just kentucky “bourbon is the hottest spirit in the world the top category in spirits from london to japan for the past five years” said tom fischer who runs bourbonblogcom unlike many elusive objects of desire there is little dispute about the bourbon’s quality even critics confounded by the chase concede that van winkle makes very very good whiskey in  the yearold pappy received an unprecedented  whiskey rating from the venerable beverage tasting institute but all six expressions — the three pappy productions old rip van winkle  year van winkle special reserve  year and family reserve rye  year — have collected superb ratings and multiple awards today there are other bourbons as highly ranked four roses limited edition buffalo trace antique collection but pappy continues to be the most difficult to find the holy grail of a luxurymad cocktail market that has migrated to such preprohibition whiskey drinks as the oldfashioned the manhattan and the sazerac the unquenchable quest for pappy already difficult became criminal last october when almost  bottles of the yearold pappy van winkle and  of the yearold van winkle family reserve rye were purloined from the warehouse an inside job was suspected and the bottles have not been recovered said julian van winkle iii “we got  million worth of free advertising we didn’t need at the time” however it is possible to purchase a  bottle of yearold pappy on ebay the bottle is empty there’s no secret what the van winkles think of the secondary market they hate it “it’s horrible it infuriates me because it shows just a complete and utter disrespect for the customer and for us” said preston van winkle “there’s plenty of money to be made off our products just take a fair markup but sellers do it because they can” many stores such as the four wine and cheese place locations around st louis sell at the suggested price but conduct a lottery which the van winkles believe is the fairest approach last year  people entered the missouri lottery for a score of bottles in the double digits kyle buza’s pappy tracker app posts sightings like paparazzi stalking celebrity prey though once a bottle has been photographed chances are it has long been sold or drained to the last caramelcolored drops “every year it gets worse because every store knows how valuable it is” said buza a menlo park calif software engineer who recently drove to a secret location six hours by car to score another bottle there have been van winkles in whiskey since  beginning with the original julian van winkle known as pappy a consummate salesman and character the van winkle label was launched after the family was forced by stockholder pressure in  to sell the famed stitzelweller distillery producer of the wl weller old fitzgerald rebel yell and cabin still labels for the past dozen years van winkle whiskey has been produced as a joint venture with the sazerac co at the buffalo trace distillery in the s and s the family was basically in the gewgaw business pushing fancy decanters as retirement gifts and collectors items that just happened to hold the whiskey bourbon had lost its buzz when julian van winkle iii first entered the business his father told him “if this doesn’t work out you might want to talk to some bankers or insurance companies about a job” the son poured more than phone calls and whiskey into the business “it took a lot of my money to keep this thing going” he continues to adhere to his grandfather pappy’s motto “we make fine bourbon at a profit if we can at a loss if we must but always fine bourbon” today the thirdgeneration van winkle sits in the louisville office that he shares with his son the firm’s two sole employees turning down ardent buyers from all over the globe no to brazil no to korea no to russia there are  states where you cannot score a bottle which gives the third julian van winkle no pleasure “it took a lot of time to get here i’m the kind of guy who likes to please people not make them angry” among those people who dream of van winkle bourbon is chris brantley of savannah ga two years ago he launched the pursuit of pappy blog which has  monthly visitors he composes paeans to pappy “it’s the character the taste” he said “the scarcity of it that drives the interest” he should know brantley hasn’t had a sip of pappy since february of last year “possibly that is the charm in pappy van winkle” brantley observed on his blog in an uber culture of instant gratification ondemand clicks and sameday delivery pappy fans have to wait the rise of pappy occurred when that scarcity mashed up against increased demand in a global quest for specialty goods with a multiyear even multidecade production the van winkles can anticipate market demand only so far in advance said preston van winkle “we could double production and still sell out” as a reflection of evolving taste schneider’s last year transferred its selection of american whiskey to the front of the store a fifth of the spirits inventory and pushed to the back the vodka its moment so over chefs have certainly played a part in driving the pappy mystique david chang anthony bourdain and sean brock of charleston sc the south’s most celebrated cook and arguably pappy’s greatest crusader who begged julian to adopt him and dubbed the bourbon “america’s finest product” professional hunters like the pappy tracker’s buza have amassed large stashes buza has  bottles jack rose dining saloon in adams morgan with  types of bourbon and  different whiskeys still has plenty the year pappy goes for  an ounce how does the place have so much so close to the next release season said jack rose’s katie williams “we know the right people” last month julian van winkle iii discovered two bottles of yearold pappy in a bar in milan a city known more for design than for whiskey “i paid dearly for them probably  a piece” a steal and plans to auction them for charity his three yearold daughters — yes there are van winkle triplets — decided that there was more money to be distilled from the family elixir last year the sisters launched pappy  company pappycocom promoting the whiskey lifestyle belt buckles needlepoint coasters shirts ties bourbon balls as well as a limited edition van winkle signature gift

bourbon” was one man’s drive and has lived through four generations heritage a letter from the van winkle family we are frequently asked why our whiskey is so hard to find it’s difficult to put a finger on just one or two particular reasons but here are a few things that have led to the popularity and scarcity of our whiskey first the whiskey is very good when something is good you naturally tell others about it word of mouth is priceless in the early nineties we received a very high rating from the chicago beverage testing institute that led to receiving many awards from tasting competitions by beverage magazines both here and abroad even celebrity chefs have touted our whiskey as being their favorite that type of advertising is something we could never afford but it has certainly contributed to our brand becoming a cult phenomenon for that we are grateful another contributing factor was joining the sazeracbuffalo trace family this merger spread knowledge of our brand way beyond kentucky and into other major markets one last thing to know is that unfortunately some retailers choose to use this demand as a reason to increase their pricing we know it’s often sold for far beyond our suggested retail prices which you can find on the product pages of this site we greatly appreciate all of our fans and your support we hope that you have the chance to try some of our fine whiskey for yourself best of luck to you the van winkles find meet the rest of our family each of our whiskeys tells its own story some long some short but all fine stories our whiskeys van

newsletters food  drink julian p van winkle iii the arbiter of taste go into the tasting room with a thirdgeneration whiskey man by wells tower augustseptember  photo joe pugliese lots of people are mad at julian p van winkle iii van winkle is the president of the old rip van winkle distillery whose aged bourbons a growing body of aficionados believe to be the finest whiskeys on earth the trouble is that demand for his pappy van winkle’s family reserve bourbons has lately swollen in exasperating proportion to supply he releases between  and  cases per year “about what jim beam puts out in ten minutes” van winkle says “we’re the opposite of the walmart business model high profit and almost no volume at all” the scarcity is making bourbon lovers desperate cranky and poor on ebay van winkle bourbons routinely command upwards of  a bottle pappy turns up on bar menus in van winkle’s hometown of louisville kentucky for as much as  usually alongside the caveat “when available” the bourbons are distributed to liquor stores only twice a year—in spring and fall—and a half dozen give or take bottles not cases is the average allocation the bottles rarely touch the shelves instead going straight to customers whose names have been on waiting lists for months or years photo joe pugliese tastemaker julian van winkle prepares to sample some of the latest pappy to emerge from the barrels so much bother for a sip of whiskey does not endear van winkle to the drinking public or to shopkeepers one of whom not long ago bodily attacked van winkle’s sales agent for showing up with too meager a delivery “it can get dangerous” says van winkle “in michigan a guy physically ran our sales rep out of a store because he didn’t get but two or three bottles he was so damn angry about it threatened him with a shoe or a gun or something i’ve never had to deal with that kind of thing face to face but i’m sure it’s coming someday” one does not want to imagine what rashnesses pappy fans might be moved to if they could see what julian van winkle is doing with his bourbon this morning he is spitting it out pints upon pints pinging into the spittoon in a practiced laminar stream a visiting journalist is frankly appalled to see greatness treated so brusquely it’s like watching someone ride a moped through the louvre “hard work but someone’s gotta do it” says van winkle sixtythree whose clear blue eyes and relatively uncreased complexion do not betray a lifelong career of concerted bourbon use the desecration is taking place in the tasting room at the buffalo trace distillery in frankfort kentucky a decade ago buffalo trace which also makes such venerable labels as blanton’s and w l weller began distilling the pappy van winkle recipe in partnership with van winkle today the first batches of buffalo trace pappy are reaching bottling maturity and van winkle has made the fortyfiveminute drive from louisville to undertake what is in fact momentous spittoon duty to assay whether buffalo trace’s handiwork deserves the family name photo joe pugliese aging gracefully barrels at buffalo trace a flotilla of fortyseven partially filled graduated goblets and halfpint bottles—each drawn from a separate barrel—are arrayed before van winkle on a lazy susan each barrel requires individual sampling because barrel aging is not an exact science but an ineluctable chaotic passage through which the whiskey grows a soul seasoned in a charred oak barrel bourbon acquires its dark complexion and as it picks up oak sugars in the caramelized wood much of its sweetness too the ratio of barrel staves made from sapwood to those made from heartwood affects the bourbon’s flavor as do seemingly trifling considerations such as proximity to a window and altitude “whiskey on the top floors ages faster” van winkle explains “we don’t keep our barrels any higher than the middle floors because it’s going to be there so long it would pick up too much oak” as the whiskey ages it evaporates volume through the wood— percent the first year and  to  percent each subsequent year an attrition known as the angels’ share on a twentythreeyearold barrel the angels’ share is about fifty gallons out of the original fiftythree which partly explains van winkle ’s heartstopping expense “when it comes to our bourbon the angels are very greedy” van winkle observes julian van winkle’s palate is the ultimate arbiter as to whether a barrel ends up in a van winkle bottle but he is decidedly not a notesofpencilshavingsandasphalt sort of taster “mm nice and mild” “man that’s so sweet” “a little bite to this one a little rough” are the comments he makes as the table revolves “i don’t have a schooled palate” he says “for me it’s ‘this is what i like and if it tastes like this it’s all right with me’” van winkle’s humble manner with a whiskey that critics herniate themselves describing is rooted in an abiding family aversion to high science and cold connoisseurship his grandfather julian p “pappy” van winkle he appears lipping a stogie on the labels that bear his name “had a sign at the old distillery that said ‘no chemists allowed’” julian says “he didn’t have a lab just some litmus paper and a hydrometer to get the proof right he believed all you need to make fine bourbon are mother nature and father time” in  at the age of eighteen pappy van winkle entered the whiskey business as a traveling salesman for w l weller the product he sold in those days was not strictly speaking bourbon according to federal law straight bourbon whiskey must be distilled in the united states but not necessarily kentucky from a mash of at least  percent corn it must be aged in new charred oak barrels and it may not be adulterated with any additives other than water the early weller whiskeys were “rectified” with flavoring and coloring agents and proof was often corrected with grain alcohol years later as president of the stitzelweller distillery after pappy had become a vehement exacting crusader for traditionally manufactured bourbon he was asked about his early perfidies in the rectifying trade “there’s no one purer than a reformed prostitute” was his reply photo joe pugliese the tasting lab through the sixties stitzelweller bottled respected bourbons under such labels as old fitzgerald w l weller and rebel yell a different product from the downmarket frat house libation it is today van winkle’s bourbons owed their excellence in part to the vast substrate of limestone that filters the local groundwater to uncommon purity and to pappy’s recipe in addition to corn bourbon generally uses rye as a secondary grain pappy’s mash bill called for wheat a milder sweeter grain that picks up less barrel char and is gentler to the tongue in  seven years after pappy’s death stockholders forced the distillery’s sale julian had recently returned to louisville after attending virginia’s randolphmacon college where he studied economics and psychology after a stint as a clothing salesman he joined his father julian jr salvaging what could be salvaged of the family whiskey business barrels of pappy’s recipe were quiescently marking time in stitzelweller’s warehouses father and son kept the company alive buying back their own bourbon and bottling it independently under the old rip van winkle label when cancer took julian’s father in  julian at the age of thirtytwo with four children to support made the notostensiblywise decision to continue in the whiskey business bottling van winkle bourbons with his own hands in a floodprone ruin of a facility he purchased south of louisville the s were dark years for bourbon and largely profitless years for julian the spirits market had so bafflingly and resolutely forsaken bourbon for scotch vodka and gin that the drinking public could be induced to pay good money for bourbon only if it was bottled in a novelty crock resembling a coal miner or a football or a dog julian was reduced to trafficking in these gimcracks for about a decade and a half then in  a van winkle sales rep submitted bottles of van winkle year to the beverage testing institute a prestigious chicagobased wine authority the pappy van winkle yearold got a rating of  an unprecedented number for any whiskey scotch or bourbon an avalanche of demand and acclaim followed concluding most recently with a james beard foundation award in  photo joe pugliese good grain a handful of the ground corn that’s used to make pappy do the pappy whiskeys deserve the fervent hype and covetousness i put the question to bourbon enthusiast and fellow james beard winner sean brock chef at the celebrated charleston south carolina restaurants mccrady’s and husk “what i should say is it’s the worst bourbon in the entire world it’s a ripoff don’t buy it but no for me it’s an obsession you can taste the patience the care the craft you know you’re tasting something that’s been aged properly without cutting corners their motto says it all” adds brock citing a creed stamped on a plaque that pappy hung at the entrance of the stitzelweller distillery “‘at a profit if we can at a loss if we must but always fine bourbon’ if more people looked at their business models that way america would be a much cooler place to hang out” when julian van winkle has sipped his way through the morning’s fortyseven barrels i prevail on him to share a splash or two from some bottled vintages a tempting selection of which—a year a  and a —stand on a nearby shelf in the tasting room he passes me a glass with a modest amber dose of the  “it’s too oaky for some but i like it” he says i put my snoot into the glass it is not too oaky it is supple warm and suffused with an intelligent sweetness it tastes like the realization of an ideal all other bourbons i’ve had aspire to with incomplete success i can say that i pick up notes of vanilla butterscotch and assorted citrus fruit but i don’t write about citrus notes in my little notebook what i jot are some raptures too fatuously sentimental and foolish to reprint and which are anyway irrelevant to the matter at hand i mention the goofy mawkishness good bourbon inspires only to note that good bourbon is a weird thing—a fluid that thrills us and rouses the soul by means defiant of connoisseurship and not wholly related to alcoholic intoxication the late louisiana novelist walker percy made a brilliant study of this phenomenon in a short essay a copy of which i’ve brought along in my pocket there in the tasting room i read a few lines aloud to mr van winkle “the joy of bourbon drinking is not the pharmacological effect of the choh on the cortex but rather the instant of the whiskey being knocked back and the little explosion of kentucky usa sunshine in the cavity of the nasopharynx and the hot bosky bite of tennessee summertime—aesthetic considerations to which the effect of the alcohol is if not dispensable at least secondary… bourbon does for me what the piece of cake did for proust” “a bourbon and what” the passage carries van winkle into memories of his childhood sickbed when his parents plied him with honeyed bourbon “good frickin’ bourbon old stitzelweller probably made in the forties” and of young parenthood when he would serve straight  proof to his sick children—a son and a triplet litter of daughters “we had to knock those kids out or
