central fund seeks capital appreciation principal investment strategies fmr co inc fmrc normally invests the funds assets primarily in nonus securities including securities of issuers located in emerging markets fmrc normally invests at least  of the funds assets in equity securities fmr normally invests the funds assets primarily in common stocks fmrc allocates the funds assets to provide exposure to different sectors of the international market at present these sectors include consumer discretionary consumer staples energy financials health care industrials information technology materials telecom services and utilities fmrc expects the funds investments in each sector will approximate the sector weightings of the morgan stanley capital internationalsm� europe australasia far east msci� eafe� index a market capitalizationweighted index of equity securities of companies domiciled in various countries the index is designed to represent the performance of developed stock markets outside the united states and canada and excludes certain market segments unavailable to us based investors while fmrc may overweight or underweight one or more sectors from time to time fmrc expects the returns of the fund to be driven primarily by security selection fmrc is not constrained by any particular investment style for the fund at any given time the fund may buy growth stocks or value stocks or a combination of both additionally the fund is not limited to investing in securities of a specific market capitalization and may hold securities of large medium andor small capitalization companies fmrc normally diversifies the funds investments across different countries and regions in buying and selling securities for the fund fmrc relies on fundamental analysis of each issuer and its potential for success in light of its current financial condition its industry position and economic and market conditions factors considered include growth potential earnings estimates and management in addition to the principal investment strategies discussed above fmrc may lend the funds securities to brokerdealers or other institutions to earn income for the fund fmrc may also use various techniques such as buying and selling futures contracts and exchange traded funds to increase or decrease the funds exposure to changing security prices or other factors that affect security values if fmrcs strategies do not work as intended the fund may not achieve its objective description of principal security types equity securities represent an ownership interest or the right to acquire an ownership interest in an issuer different types of equity securities provide different voting and dividend rights and priority in the event of the bankruptcy of the issuer equity securities include common stocks preferred stocks convertible securities and warrants principal investment risks many factors affect the funds performance the funds share price changes daily based on changes in market conditions and interest rates and in response to other economic political or financial developments the funds reaction to these events will be affected by the types of securities in which the fund invests the financial condition industry and economic sector geographic location of an issuer and the funds level of investment in the securities of that issuer because fmrc may concentrate the funds investments in a particular industry or group of related industries the funds performance could depend heavily on the performance of that industry or group of industries and could be more volatile than the performance of less concentrated funds when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you paid for them which means that you could lose money prospectus fund basics  continued the following factors can significantly affect the funds performance stock market volatility the value of equity securities fluctuates in response to issuer political market and economic developments in the short term equity prices can fluctuate dramatically in response to these developments different parts of the market and different types of equity securities can react differently to these developments for example large cap stocks can react differently from small cap stocks and growth stocks can react differently from value stocks issuer political or economic developments can affect a single issuer issuers within an industry or economic sector or geographic region or the market as a whole terrorism and related geopolitical risks have led and may in the future lead to increased shortterm market volatility and may have adverse longterm effects on world economies and markets generally foreign exposure foreign securities foreign currencies and securities issued by us entities with substantial foreign operations can involve additional risks relating to political economic or regulatory conditions in foreign countries these risks include fluctuations in foreign currencies withholding or other taxes trading settlement custodial and other operational risks and the less stringent investor protection and disclosure standards of some foreign markets all of these factors can make foreign investments especially those in emerging markets more volatile and potentially less liquid than us investments in addition foreign markets can perform differently from the us market investing in emerging markets can involve risks in addition to and greater than those generally associated with investing in more developed foreign markets the extent of economic development political stability market depth infrastructure and capitalization and regulatory oversight can be less than in more developed markets emerging market economies can be subject to greater social economic regulatory and political uncertainties all of these factors can make emerging market securities more volatile and potentially less liquid than securities issued in more developed markets industry concentration market conditions interest rates and economic regulatory or financial developments could significantly affect a single industry or a group of related industries and the securities of companies in that industry or group of industries could react similarly to these or other developments the consumer discretionary industries can be significantly affected by the performance of the overall economy interest rates competition and consumer confidence success can depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for and success of consumer products the industrials industries can be significantly affected by general economic trends including employment economic growth and interest rates changes in consumer sentiment and spending commodity prices legislation government regulation and spending import controls and worldwide competition for example commodity price declines and unit volume reductions resulting from an oversupply of materials used in cyclical industries can adversely affect those industries furthermore a company in the cyclical industries can be subject to liability for environmental damage depletion of resources and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control the energy industry can be significantly affected by fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand of energy fuels caused by events relating to international politics energy conservation the success of exploration projects weather or meteorological events and tax and other government regulations the financials industries are subject to extensive government regulation which can limit both the amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments they can make and the interest rates and fees they can charge profitability can be largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and the rate of corporate and consumer debt defaults and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change credit losses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers can negatively affect the financial services industries insurance companies can be subject to severe price competition the financial services industries are currently undergoing relatively rapid change as existing distinctions between financial service segments become less clear for example recent business combinations have included insurance finance and securities brokerage under single ownership some primarily retail corporations have expanded into securities and insurance industries prospectus the consumer staples industry can be significantly affected by demographic and product trends competitive pricing food fads marketing campaigns and environmental factors in the united states the agricultural products industry is subject to regulation by numerous federal and state government agencies the health care industries are subject to government regulation and reimbursement rates as well as government approval of products and services which could have a significant effect on price and availability furthermore the types of products or services produced or provided by health care companies quickly can become obsolete in addition pharmaceutical companies and other companies in the health care industries can be significantly affected by patent expirations the materials industry can be significantly affected by the level and volatility of commodity prices the exchange value of the dollar import controls and worldwide competition at times worldwide production of industrial materials has exceeded demand as a result of overbuilding or economic downturns which has led to commodity price declines and unit price reductions companies in the industry can also be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage depletion of resources and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control the information technology industries can be significantly affected by obsolescence of existing technology short product cycles falling prices and profits competition from new market entrants and general economic conditions the telecom services industry particularly telephone operating companies is subject to both federal and state government regulations of rates of return and services that may be offered many telecommunications companies fiercely compete for market share the utilities industries can be significantly affected by government regulation financing difficulties supply and demand of services or fuel changes in taxation and natural resource conservation issuerspecific changes changes in the financial condition of an issuer or counterparty changes in specific economic or political conditions that affect a particular type of security or issuer and changes in general economic or political conditions can affect a securitys or instruments value the value of securities of smaller less wellknown issuers can be more volatile than that of larger issuers smaller issuers can have more limited product lines markets or financial resources in response to market economic political or other conditions fmrc may temporarily use a different investment strategy for defensive purposes if fmrc does so different factors could affect the funds performance and the fund may not achieve its investment objective fundamental investment policies the policy discussed below is fundamental that is subject to change only by shareholder approval international equity central fund seeks capital appreciation shareholder notice the following policy is subject to change only upon  days prior notice to shareholders international equity central fund normally invests at least  of its assets in equity securities valuing shares the fund is open for business each day the new york stock exchange nyse is open the funds net asset value per share nav is the value of a single share fidelity normally calculates the funds nav as of the close of business of the nyse normally  pm eastern time the funds assets normally are valued as of this time for the purpose of computing the funds nav to the extent that the funds assets are traded in other markets on days when the fund is not open for business the value of the funds assets may be affected on those days in addition trading in some of the funds assets may not occur on days when the fund is open for business prospectus fund basics  continued the funds assets are valued primarily on the basis of market quotations or official closing prices certain shortterm securities are valued on the basis of amortized cost if market quotations or official closing prices are not readily available or does not accurately reflect fair value for a security or if a securitys value has been materially affected by events occurring before the funds pricing time but after the close of the exchange or market on which the security is principally traded that security will be valued by another method that the board of directors board of trustees believes accurately reflects fair value in accordance with the boards fair value pricing policies for example arbitrage opportunities may exist when trading in a portfolio security or securities is halted and does not resume before the fund calculates its nav these arbitrage opportunities may enable shortterm traders to dilute the nav of longterm investors securities trading in overseas markets present time zone arbitrage opportunities when events affecting portfolio security values occur after the close of the overseas market but prior to the close of the us market fair value pricing will be used for high yield debt and floating rate loans when available pricing information is determined to be stale or for other reasons not to accurately reflect fair value to the extent the fund invests in other openend funds the fund will calculate its nav using the nav of the underlying funds in which it invests as described in the underlying funds prospectuses the fund may invest in other fidelity funds that use the same fair value pricing policies as the fund or in fidelity money market funds a securitys valuation may differ depending on the method used for determining value fair valuation of a funds portfolio securities can serve to reduce arbitrage opportunities available to shortterm traders but there is no assurance that fair value pricing policies will prevent dilution of the funds nav by shortterm traders prospectus shareholder information buying and selling shares the fund may reject for any reason or cancel as permitted or required by law any purchase orders including transactions deemed to represent excessive trading at any time excessive trading of fund

banks shortterm obligations of and repurchase agreements with the  largest us banks measured by deposits municipal securities us government securities with affiliated financial institutions that are primary dealers in these securities shortterm currency transactions and shortterm borrowings in accordance with exemptive orders issued by the securities and exchange commission sec the board of trustees has established and periodically reviews procedures applicable to transactions involving affiliated financial institutions assetbacked securities represent interests in pools of mortgages loans receivables or other assets payment of interest and repayment of principal may be largely dependent upon the cash flows generated by the assets backing the securities and in certain cases supported by letters of credit surety bonds or other credit enhancements assetbacked security values may also be affected by other factors including changes in interest rates the availability of information concerning the pool and its structure the creditworthiness of the servicing agent for the pool the originator of the loans or receivables or the entities providing the credit enhancement in addition these securities may be subject to prepayment risk borrowing the fund may borrow from banks or from other funds advised by fidelity management  research company fmr or its affiliates or through reverse repurchase agreements if the fund borrows money its share price may be subject to greater fluctuation until the borrowing is paid off if the fund makes additional investments while borrowings are outstanding this may be considered a form of leverage cash management a fund can hold uninvested cash or can invest it in cash equivalents such as money market securities repurchase agreements or shares of money market or shortterm bond funds generally these securities offer less potential for gains than other types of securities central funds are special types of investment vehicles created by fidelity for use by the fidelity funds and other advisory clients fmr uses central funds to invest in particular security types or investment disciplines or for cash management central funds incur certain costs related to their investment activity such as custodial fees and expenses but do not pay additional management fees to fidelity the investment results of the portions of the funds assets invested in the central funds will be based upon the investment results of those funds common stock represents an equity or ownership interest in an issuer in the event an issuer is liquidated or declares bankruptcy the claims of owners of bonds and preferred stock take precedence over the claims of those who own common stock convertible securities are bonds debentures notes or other securities that may be converted or exchanged by the holder or by the issuer into shares of the underlying common stock or cash or securities of equivalent value at a stated exchange ratio a convertible security may also be called for redemption or conversion by the issuer after a particular date and under certain circumstances including a specified price established upon issue if a convertible security held by a fund is called for redemption or conversion the fund could be required to tender it for redemption convert it into the underlying common stock or sell it to a third party convertible securities generally have less potential for gain or loss than common stocks convertible securities generally provide yields higher than the underlying common stocks but generally lower than comparable nonconvertible securities because of this higher yield convertible securities generally sell at prices above their conversion value which is the current market value of the stock to be received upon conversion the difference between this conversion value and the price of convertible securities will vary over time depending on changes in the value of the underlying common stocks and interest rates when the underlying common stocks decline in value convertible securities will tend not to decline to the same extent because of the interest or dividend payments and the repayment of principal at maturity for certain types of convertible securities however securities that are convertible other than at the option of the holder generally do not limit the potential for loss to the same extent as securities convertible at the option of the holder when the underlying common stocks rise in value the value of convertible securities may also be expected to increase at the same time however the difference between the market value of convertible securities and their conversion value will narrow which means that the value of convertible securities will generally not increase to the same extent as the value of the underlying common stocks because convertible securities may also be interestrate sensitive their value may increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise convertible securities are also subject to credit risk and are often lowerquality securities country or geographic region fmr considers a number of factors to determine whether an investment is tied economically to a particular country or region including whether the investment is issued or guaranteed by a particular government or any of its agencies political subdivisions or instrumentalities whether the investment has its primary trading market in a particular country or region whether the issuer is organized under the laws of derives at least  of its revenues from or has at least  of its assets in a particular country or region whether the investment is included in an index representative of a particular country or region and whether the investment is exposed to the economic fortunes and risks of a particular country or region debt securities are used by issuers to borrow money the issuer usually pays a fixed variable or floating rate of interest and must repay the amount borrowed usually at the maturity of the security some debt securities such as zero coupon bonds do not pay interest but are sold at a deep discount from their face values debt securities include corporate bonds government securities repurchase agreements and mortgage and other assetbacked securities exposure to foreign markets foreign securities foreign currencies and securities issued by us entities with substantial foreign operations may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in us investments foreign investments involve risks relating to local political economic regulatory or social instability military action or unrest or adverse diplomatic developments and may be affected by actions of foreign governments adverse to the interests of us investors such actions may include expropriation or nationalization of assets confiscatory taxation restrictions on us investment or on the ability to repatriate assets or convert currency into us dollars or other government intervention additionally governmental issuers of foreign debt securities may be unwilling to pay interest and repay principal when due and may require that the conditions for payment be renegotiated there is no assurance that fmrc will be able to anticipate these potential events or counter their effects in addition the value of securities denominated in foreign currencies and of dividends and interest paid with respect to such securities will fluctuate based on the relative strength of the us dollar it is anticipated that in most cases the best available market for foreign securities will be on an exchange or in overthecounter otc markets located outside of the united states foreign stock markets while growing in volume and sophistication are generally not as developed as those in the united states and securities of some foreign issuers may be less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable us issuers foreign security trading settlement and custodial practices including those involving securities settlement where fund assets may be released prior to receipt of payment are often less developed than those in us markets and may result in increased risk or substantial delays in the event of a failed trade or the insolvency of or breach of duty by a foreign brokerdealer securities depository or foreign subcustodian in addition the costs associated with foreign investments including withholding taxes brokerage commissions and custodial costs are generally higher than with us investments foreign markets may offer less protection to investors than us markets foreign issuers are generally not bound by uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting requirements and standards of practice comparable to those applicable to us issuers adequate public information on foreign issuers may not be available and it may be difficult to secure dividends and information regarding corporate actions on a timely basis in general there is less overall governmental supervision and regulation of securities exchanges brokers and listed companies than in the united states otc markets tend to be less regulated than stock exchange markets and in certain countries may be totally unregulated regulatory enforcement may be influenced by economic or political concerns and investors may have difficulty enforcing their legal rights in foreign countries some foreign securities impose restrictions on transfer within the united states or to us persons although securities subject to such transfer restrictions may be marketable abroad they may be less liquid than foreign securities of the same class that are not subject to such restrictions american depositary receipts adrs as well as other hybrid forms of adrs including european depositary receipts edrs and global depositary receipts gdrs are certificates evidencing ownership of shares of a foreign issuer these certificates are issued by depository banks and generally trade on an established market in the united states or elsewhere the underlying shares are held in trust by a custodian bank or similar financial institution in the issuers home country the depository bank may not have physical custody of the underlying securities at all times and may charge fees for various services including forwarding dividends and interest and corporate actions adrs are alternatives to directly purchasing the underlying foreign securities in their national markets and currencies however adrs continue to be subject to many of the risks associated with investing directly in foreign securities these risks include foreign exchange risk as well as the political and economic risks of the underlying issuers country the risks of foreign investing may be magnified for investments in emerging markets security prices in emerging markets can be significantly more volatile than those in more developed markets reflecting the greater uncertainties of investing in less established markets and economies in particular countries with emerging markets may have relatively unstable governments may present the risks of nationalization of businesses restrictions on foreign ownership and prohibitions on the repatriation of assets and may have less protection of property rights than more developed countries the economies of countries with emerging markets may be based on only a few industries may be highly vulnerable to changes in local or global trade conditions and may suffer from extreme and volatile debt burdens or inflation rates local securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to increases in trading volume potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times foreign currency transactions a fund may conduct foreign currency transactions on a spot ie cash or forward basis ie by entering into forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies although foreign exchange dealers generally do not charge a fee for such conversions they do realize a profit based on the difference between the prices at which they are buying and selling various currencies thus a dealer may offer to sell a foreign currency at one rate while offering a lesser rate of exchange should the counterparty desire to resell that currency to the dealer forward contracts are customized transactions that require a specific amount of a currency to be delivered at a specific exchange rate on a specific date or range of dates in the future forward contracts are generally traded in an interbank market directly between currency traders usually large commercial banks and their customers the parties to a forward contract may agree to offset or terminate the contract before its maturity or may hold the contract to maturity and complete the contemplated currency exchange the following discussion summarizes the principal currency management strategies involving forward contracts that could be used by a fund a fund may also use swap agreements indexed securities and options and futures contracts relating to foreign currencies for the same purposes a settlement hedge or transaction hedge is designed to protect a fund against an adverse change in foreign currency values between the date a security is purchased or sold and the date on which payment is made or received entering into a forward contract for the purchase or sale of the amount of foreign currency involved in an underlying security transaction for a fixed amount of us dollars locks in the us dollar price of the security forward contracts to purchase or sell a foreign currency may also be used by a fund in anticipation of future purchases or sales of securities denominated in foreign currency even if the specific investments have not yet been selected by fmrc a fund may also use forward contracts to hedge against a decline in the value of existing investments denominated in foreign currency for example if a fund owned securities denominated in pounds sterling it could enter into a forward contract to sell pounds sterling in return for us dollars to hedge against possible declines in the pounds value such a hedge sometimes referred to as a position hedge would tend to offset both positive and negative currency fluctuations but would not offset changes in security values caused by other factors a fund could also hedge the position by selling another currency expected to perform similarly to the pound sterling this type of hedge sometimes referred to as a proxy hedge could offer advantages in terms of cost yield or efficiency but generally would not hedge currency exposure as effectively as a direct hedge into us dollars proxy hedges may result in losses if the currency used to hedge does not perform similarly to the currency in which the hedged securities are denominated a fund may enter into forward contracts to shift its investment exposure from one currency into another this may include shifting exposure from us dollars to a foreign currency or from one foreign currency to another foreign currency this type of strategy sometimes known as a crosshedge will tend to reduce or eliminate exposure to the currency that is sold and increase exposure to the currency that is purchased much as if a fund had sold a security denominated in one currency and purchased an equivalent security denominated in another a fund may crosshedge its us dollar exposure in order to achieve a representative weighted mix of the major currencies in its benchmark index andor to cover an underweight country or region exposure in its portfolio crosshedges protect against losses resulting from a decline in the hedged currency but will cause a fund to assume the risk of fluctuations in the value of the currency it purchases successful use of currency management strategies will depend on fmrcs skill in analyzing currency values currency management strategies may substantially change a funds investment exposure to changes in currency exchange rates and could result in losses to a fund if currencies do not perform as fmrc anticipates for example if a currencys value rose at a time when fmrc had hedged a fund by selling that currency in exchange for dollars a fund would not participate in the currencys appreciation if fmrc hedges currency exposure through proxy hedges a fund could realize currency losses from both the hedge and the security position if the two currencies do not move in tandem similarly if fmrc increases a funds exposure to a foreign currency and that currencys value declines a fund will realize a loss a fund may be required to limit its hedging transactions in foreign currency forwards futures and options in order to maintain its classification as a regulated investment company under the internal revenue code code hedging transactions could result in the application of the marktomarket provisions of the code which may cause an increase or decrease in the amount of taxable dividends paid by a fund and could affect whether dividends paid by a fund are classified as capital gains or ordinary income there is no assurance that fmrcs use of currency management strategies will be advantageous to a fund or that it will employ currency management strategies at appropriate times options and futures relating to foreign currencies currency futures contracts are similar to forward currency exchange contracts except that they are traded on exchanges and have margin requirements and are standardized as to contract size and delivery date most currency futures contracts call for payment or delivery in us dollars the underlying instrument of a currency option may be a foreign currency which generally is purchased or delivered in exchange for us dollars or may be a futures contract the purchaser of a currency call obtains the right to purchase the underlying currency and the purchaser of a currency put obtains the right to sell the underlying currency the uses and risks of currency options and futures are similar to options and futures relating to securities or indices as discussed above a fund may purchase and sell currency futures and may purchase and write currency options to increase or decrease its exposure to different foreign currencies currency options may also be purchased or written in conjunction with each other or with currency futures or forward contracts currency futures and options values can be expected to correlate with exchange rates but may not reflect other factors that affect the value of a funds investments a currency hedge for example should protect a yendenominated security from a decline in the yen but will not protect a fund against a price decline resulting from deterioration in the issuers creditworthiness because the value of a funds foreigndenominated investments changes in response to many factors other than exchange rates it may not be possible to match the amount of currency options and futures to the value of the funds investments exactly over time foreign repurchase agreements foreign repurchase agreements involve an agreement to purchase a foreign security and to sell that security back to the original seller at an agreedupon price in either us dollars or foreign currency unlike typical us repurchase agreements foreign repurchase agreements may not be fully collateralized at all times the value of a security purchased by a fund may be more or less than the price at which the counterparty has agreed to repurchase the security in the event of default by the counterparty the fund may suffer a loss if the value of the security purchased is less than the agreedupon repurchase price or if the fund is unable to successfully assert a claim to the collateral under foreign laws as a result foreign repurchase agreements may involve higher credit risks than repurchase agreements in us markets as well as risks associated with currency fluctuations in addition as with other emerging market investments repurchase agreements with counterparties located in emerging markets or relating to emerging markets may involve issuers or counterparties with lower credit ratings than typical us repurchase agreements funds rights as an investor the fund does not intend to direct or administer the daytoday operations of any company a fund however may exercise its rights as a shareholder or lender and may communicate its views on important matters of policy to management the board of directors shareholders of a company and holders of other securities of the company when fmrc determines that such matters could have a significant effect on the value of the funds investment in the company the activities in which a fund may engage either individually or in conjunction with others may include among others supporting or opposing proposed changes in a companys corporate structure or business activities seeking changes in a companys directors or management seeking changes in a companys direction or policies seeking the sale or reorganization of the company or a portion of its assets supporting or opposing thirdparty takeover efforts supporting the filing of a bankruptcy petition or foreclosing on collateral securing a security this area of corporate activity is increasingly prone to litigation and it is possible that a fund could be involved in lawsuits related to such activities fmrc will monitor such activities with a view to mitigating to the extent possible the risk of litigation against a fund and the risk of actual liability if a fund is involved in litigation no guarantee can be made however that litigation against a fund will not be undertaken or liabilities incurred the funds proxy voting guidelines are included in this sai futures options and swaps the success of any strategy involving futures options and swaps depends on an advisers analysis of many economic and mathematical factors and a funds return may be higher if it never invested in such instruments additionally some of the contracts discussed below are new instruments without a trading history and there can be no assurance that a market for the instruments will continue to exist futures contracts in purchasing a futures contract the buyer agrees to purchase a specified underlying instrument at a specified future date in selling a futures contract the seller agrees to sell a specified underlying instrument at a specified future date the price at which the purchase and sale will take place is fixed when the buyer and seller enter into the contract some currently available futures contracts are based on specific securities and some are based on indices of securities prices futures can be held until their delivery dates or can be closed out before then if a liquid market is available futures may be based on foreign indexes such as the compagnie des agents de change  index cac  in france the deutscher aktienindex dax  in germany the financial times stock exchange eurotop  index ftse eurotop  in europe the ibex  index ibex  in spain the financial times stock exchange  index ftse  in the united kingdom the australian stock exchange all ordinaries index asx all ordinaries in australia the hang seng index in hong kong and the nikkei stock average nikkei  the nikkei stock index  nikkei  and the tokyo stock exchange stock price index topix in japan the value of a futures contract tends to increase and decrease in tandem with the value of its underlying instrument therefore purchasing futures contracts will tend to increase a funds exposure to positive and negative price fluctuations in the underlying instrument much as if it had purchased the underlying instrument directly when a fund sells a futures contract by contrast the value of its futures position will tend to move in a direction contrary to the market selling futures contracts therefore will tend to offset both positive and negative market price changes much as if the underlying instrument had been sold the purchaser or seller of a futures contract or an option for a futures contract is not required to deliver or pay for the underlying instrument unless the contract is held until the delivery date however both the purchaser and seller are required to deposit initial margin with a futures broker known as a futures commission merchant fcm when the contract is entered into if the value of either partys position declines that party will be required to make additional variation margin payments to settle the change in value on a daily basis this process of marking to market will be reflected in the daily calculation of open positions computed in a funds nav the party that has a gain is entitled to receive all or a portion of this amount initial and variation margin payments do not constitute purchasing securities on margin for purposes of a funds investment limitations in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of an fcm that holds margin on behalf of a fund the fund may be entitled to return of margin owed to it only in proportion to the amount received by the fcms other customers potentially resulting in losses to the fund a fund is required to segregate liquid assets equivalent to the funds outstanding obligations under the contract in excess of the initial margin and variation margin if any although futures exchanges generally operate similarly in the united states and abroad foreign futures exchanges may follow trading settlement and margin procedures that are different from those for us exchanges futures contracts traded outside the united states may involve greater risk of loss than ustraded contracts including potentially greater risk of losses due to insolvency of a futures broker exchange member or other party that may owe initial or variation margin to a fund because initial and variation margin payments may be measured in foreign currency a futures contract traded outside the united states may also involve the risk of foreign currency fluctuation the fund will not a sell futures contracts purchase put options or write call options if as a result more than  of the funds total assets would be hedged with futures and options under normal conditions b purchase futures contracts or write put options if as a result the funds total obligations upon settlement or exercise of purchased futures contracts and written put options would exceed  of its total assets under normal conditions or c purchase call options if as a result the current value of option premiums for call options purchased by the fund would exceed  of the funds total assets these limitations do not apply to options attached to or acquired or traded together with their underlying securities and do not apply to structured notes the requirements for qualification as a regulated investment company also may limit the extent to which a fund may enter into futures options on futures and forward contracts see distributions and taxes the above limitations on the funds investments in futures contracts options and swaps and the funds policies regarding futures contracts options and swaps discussed elsewhere herein this sai may be changed as regulatory agencies permit there is no assurance a liquid market will exist for any particular futures contract at any particular time exchanges may establish daily price fluctuation limits for futures contracts and may halt trading if a contracts price moves upward or downward more than the limit in a given day on volatile trading days when the price fluctuation limit is reached or a trading halt is imposed it may be impossible to enter into new positions or close out existing positions if the market for a contract is not liquid because of price fluctuation limits or other market conditions it could prevent prompt liquidation of unfavorable positions and potentially could require a fund to continue to hold a position until delivery or expiration regardless of changes in its value as a result a funds access to other assets held to cover its futures positions could also be impaired because there are a limited number of types of exchangetraded futures contracts it is likely that the standardized contracts available will not match a funds current or anticipated investments exactly a fund may invest in futures contracts based on securities with different issuers maturities or other characteristics from the securities in which the fund typically invests which involves a risk that the futures position will not track the performance of the funds other investments futures prices can also diverge from the prices of their underlying instruments even if the underlying instruments match a funds investments well futures prices are affected by such factors as current and anticipated shortterm interest rates changes in volatility of the underlying instrument and the time remaining until expiration of the contract which may not affect security prices the same way imperfect correlation may also result from differing levels of demand in the futures markets and the securities markets from structural differences in how futures and securities are traded or from imposition of daily price fluctuation limits or trading halts a fund may purchase or sell futures contracts with a greater or lesser value than the securities it wishes to hedge or intends to purchase in order to attempt to compensate for differences in volatility between the contract and the securities although this may not be successful in all cases if price changes in a funds futures positions are poorly correlated with its other investments the positions may fail to produce anticipated gains or result in losses that are not offset by gains in other investments options by purchasing a put option the purchaser obtains the right but not the obligation to sell the options underlying instrument at a fixed strike price in return for this right the purchaser pays the current market price for the option known as the option premium options have various types of underlying instruments including specific securities indices of securities prices and futures contracts the purchaser may terminate its position in a put option by allowing it to expire or by exercising the option if the option is allowed to expire the purchaser will lose the entire premium if the option is exercised the purchaser completes the sale of the underlying instrument at the strike price a purchaser may also terminate a put option position by closing it out in the secondary market at its current price if a liquid secondary market exists the buyer of a typical put option can expect to realize a gain if security prices fall substantially however if the underlying instruments price does not fall enough to offset the cost of purchasing the option a put buyer can expect to suffer a loss limited to the amount of the premium plus related transaction costs the features of call options are essentially the same as those of put options except that the purchaser of a call option obtains the right to purchase rather than sell the underlying instrument at the options strike price a call buyer typically attempts to participate in potential price increases of the underlying instrument with risk limited to the cost of the option if security prices fall at the same time the buyer can expect to suffer a loss if security prices do not rise sufficiently to offset the cost of the option the writer of a put or call option takes the opposite side of the transaction from the options purchaser in return for receipt of the premium the writer assumes the obligation to pay or receive the strike price for the options underlying instrument if the other party to the option chooses to exercise it the writer may seek to terminate a position in a put option before exercise by closing out the option in the secondary market at its current price if the secondary market is not liquid for a put option however the writer must continue to be prepared to pay the strike price while the option is outstanding regardless of price changes when writing an option on a futures contract a fund will be required to make margin payments to an fcm as described above for futures contracts if security prices rise a put writer would generally expect to profit although its gain would be limited to the amount of the premium it received if security prices remain the same over time it is likely that the writer will also profit because it should be able to close out the option at a lower price if security prices fall the put writer would expect to suffer a loss this loss should be less than the loss from purchasing the underlying instrument directly however because the premium received for writing the option should mitigate the effects of the decline writing a call option obligates the writer to sell or deliver the options underlying instrument in return for the strike price upon exercise of the option the characteristics of writing call options are similar to those of writing put options except that writing calls generally is a profitable strategy if prices remain the same or fall through receipt of the option premium a call writer mitigates the effects of a price decline at the same time because a call writer must be prepared to deliver the underlying instrument in return for the strike price even if its current value is greater a call writer gives up some ability to participate in security price increases the fund will not a sell futures contracts purchase put options or write call options if as a result more than  of the funds total assets would be hedged with futures and options under normal conditions b purchase futures contracts or write put options if as a result the funds total obligations upon settlement or exercise of purchased futures contracts and written put options would exceed  of its total assets under normal conditions or c purchase call options if as a result the current value of option premiums for call options purchased by the fund would exceed  of the funds total assets these limitations do not apply to options attached to or acquired or traded together with their underlying securities and do not apply to structured notes the requirements for qualification as a regulated investment company also may limit the extent to which a fund may enter into futures options on futures and forward contracts see distributions and taxes the above limitations on the funds investments in futures contracts options and swaps and the funds policies regarding futures contracts options and swaps discussed elsewhere herein this sai may be changed as regulatory agencies permit there is no assurance a liquid market will exist for any particular options contract at any particular time options may have relatively low trading volume and liquidity if their strike prices are not close to the underlying instruments current price in addition exchanges may establish daily price fluctuation limits for options contracts and may halt trading if a contracts price moves upward or downward more than the limit in a given day on volatile trading days when the price fluctuation limit is reached or a trading halt is imposed it may be impossible to enter into new positions or close out existing positions if the market for a contract is not liquid because of price fluctuation limits or otherwise it could prevent prompt liquidation of unfavorable positions and potentially could require a fund to continue to hold a position until delivery or expiration regardless of changes in its value as a result a funds access to other assets held to cover its options positions could also be impaired unlike exchangetraded options which are standardized with respect to the underlying instrument expiration date contract size and strike price the terms of otc options options not traded on exchanges generally are established through negotiation with the other party to the option contract while this type of arrangement allows the purchaser or writer greater flexibility to tailor an option to its needs otc options generally are less liquid and involve greater credit risk than exchangetraded options which are backed by the clearing organization of the exchanges where they are traded combined positions involve purchasing and writing options in combination with each other or in combination with futures or forward contracts to adjust the risk and return characteristics of the overall position for example purchasing a put option and writing a call option on the same underlying instrument would construct a combined position whose risk and return characteristics are similar to selling a futures contract another possible combined position would involve writing a call option at one strike price and buying a call option at a lower price to reduce the risk of the written call option in the event of a substantial price increase because combined options positions involve multiple trades they result in higher transaction costs and may be more difficult to open and close out a fund may also buy and sell options on swaps options on interest rate swaps are known as swaptions an option on a swap gives a party the right to enter into a new swap agreement or to extend shorten cancel or modify an existing swap contract at a specific date in the future in exchange for a premium because there are a limited number of types of exchangetraded options contracts it is likely that the standardized contracts available will not match a funds current or anticipated investments exactly a fund may invest in options contracts based on securities with different issuers maturities or other characteristics from the securities in which the fund typically invests which involves a risk that the options position will not track

be successful in all cases if price changes in a funds options positions are poorly correlated with its other investments the positions may fail to produce anticipated gains or result in losses that are not offset by gains in other investments swap agreements swaps are individually negotiated and structured to include exposure to a variety of different types of investments or market factors swap agreements are two party contracts entered into primarily by institutional investors swap agreements can vary in term like other fixedincome investments most swap agreements are traded overthecounter in a standard swap transaction two parties agree to exchange the returns or differentials in rates of return earned or realized on particular predetermined investments or instruments the gross returns to be exchanged or swapped between the parties are calculated with respect to a notional amount which is the predetermined dollar principal of the trade representing the hypothetical underlying quantity upon which payment obligations are computed swap agreements can take many different forms and are known by a variety of names depending on how they are used swap agreements may increase or decrease the overall volatility of a funds investments and its share price in a credit default swap the credit default protection buyer makes periodic payments known as premiums to the credit default protection seller in return the credit default protection seller will make a payment to the credit default protection buyer upon the occurrence of a specified credit event a credit default swap can refer to a single issuer or asset a basket of issuers or assets or index of assets each known as the reference entity or underlying asset a fund may act as either the buyer or the seller of a credit default swap a fund may buy or sell credit default protection on a basket of issuers or assets even if a number of the underlying assets referenced in the basket are lowerquality debt securities in an unhedged credit default swap a fund buys credit default protection on a single issuer or asset a basket of issuers or assets or index of assets without owning the underlying asset or debt issued by the reference entity credit default swaps involve greater and different risks than investing directly in the referenced asset because in addition to market risk credit default swaps include liquidity counterparty and operational risk credit default swaps allow a fund to acquire or reduce credit exposure to a particular issuer asset or basket of assets if a swap agreement calls for payments by the fund the fund must be prepared to make such payments when due if the fund is the credit default protection seller the fund will experience a loss if a credit event occurs and the credit of the reference entity or underlying asset has deteriorated if the fund is the credit default protection buyer the fund will be required to pay premiums to the credit default protection seller if the creditworthiness of the funds swap counterparty declines the risk that the counterparty may not perform could increase potentially resulting in a loss to the fund to limit the counterparty risk involved in swap agreements the funds will only enter into swap agreements with counterparties that meet certain standards of creditworthiness swap agreements generally are entered into by eligible participants and in compliance with certain other criteria necessary to render them excluded from regulation under the commodity exchange act cea and therefore not subject to regulation as futures or commodity option transactions under the cea illiquid securities cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business at approximately the prices at which they are valued difficulty in selling securities may result in a loss or may be costly to a fund under the supervision of the board of trustees fmrc determines the liquidity of a funds investments and through reports from fmrc the board monitors investments in illiquid securities in determining the liquidity of a funds investments various factors may be considered including  the frequency and volume of trades and quotations  the number of dealers and prospective purchasers in the marketplace  dealer undertakings to make a market and  the nature of the security and the market in which it trades including any demand put or tender features the mechanics and other requirements for transfer any letters of credit or other credit enhancement features any ratings the number of holders the method of soliciting offers the time required to dispose of the security and the ability to assign or offset the rights and obligations of the security indexed securities are instruments whose prices are indexed to the prices of other securities securities indices currencies or other financial indicators indexed securities typically but not always are debt securities or deposits whose value at maturity or coupon rate is determined by reference to a specific instrument or statistic currencyindexed securities typically are shortterm to intermediateterm debt securities whose maturity values or interest rates are determined by reference to the values of one or more specified foreign currencies and may offer higher yields than us dollardenominated securities currencyindexed securities may be positively or negatively indexed that is their maturity value may increase when the specified currency value increases resulting in a security that performs similarly to a foreigndenominated instrument or their maturity value may decline when foreign currencies increase resulting in a security whose price characteristics are similar to a put on the underlying currency currencyindexed securities may also have prices that depend on the values of a number of different foreign currencies relative to each other the performance of indexed securities depends to a great extent on the performance of the security currency or other instrument to which they are indexed and may also be influenced by interest rate changes in the united states and abroad indexed securities may be more volatile than the underlying instruments indexed securities are also subject to the credit risks associated with the issuer of the security and their values may decline substantially if the issuers creditworthiness deteriorates recent issuers of indexed securities have included banks corporations and certain us government agencies interfund borrowing and lending program pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the sec a fund may lend money to and borrow money from other funds advised by fmr or its affiliates a fund will borrow through the program only when the costs are equal to or lower than the cost of bank loans and will lend through the program only when the returns are higher than those available from an investment in repurchase agreements interfund loans and borrowings normally extend overnight but can have a maximum duration of seven days loans may be called on one days notice a fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed any delay in repayment to a lending fund could result in a lost investment opportunity or additional borrowing costs investmentgrade debt securities investmentgrade debt securities include all types of debt instruments that are of medium and highquality investmentgrade debt securities include repurchase agreements collateralized by us government securities as well as repurchase agreements collateralized by equity securities noninvestmentgrade debt and all other instruments in which a fund can perfect a security interest provided the repurchase agreement counterparty has an investmentgrade rating some investmentgrade debt securities may possess speculative characteristics and may be more sensitive to economic changes and to changes in the financial conditions of issuers an investmentgrade rating means the security or issuer is rated investmentgrade by moodys� investors service standard  poors� sp� fitch inc dominion bond rating service limited or another credit rating agency designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro by the sec or is unrated but considered to be of equivalent quality by fmrc loans and other direct debt instruments direct debt instruments are interests in amounts owed by a corporate governmental or other borrower to lenders or lending syndicates loans and loan participations to suppliers of goods or services trade claims or other receivables or to other parties direct debt instruments involve a risk of loss in case of default or insolvency of the borrower and may offer less legal protection to the purchaser in the event of fraud or misrepresentation or there may be a requirement that a fund supply additional cash to a borrower on demand purchasers of loans and other forms of direct indebtedness depend primarily upon the creditworthiness of the borrower for payment of interest and repayment of principal if scheduled interest or principal payments are not made the value of the instrument may be adversely affected loans that are fully secured provide more protections than an unsecured loan in the event of failure to make scheduled interest or principal payments however there is no assurance that the liquidation of collateral from a secured loan would satisfy the borrowers obligation or that the collateral could be liquidated indebtedness of borrowers whose creditworthiness is poor involves substantially greater risks and may be highly speculative borrowers that are in bankruptcy or restructuring may never pay off their indebtedness or may pay only a small fraction of the amount owed direct indebtedness of developing countries also involves a risk that the governmental entities responsible for the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to pay interest and repay principal when due investments in loans through direct assignment of a financial institutions interests with respect to a loan may involve additional risks for example if a loan is foreclosed the purchaser could become part owner of any collateral and would bear the costs and liabilities associated with owning and disposing of the collateral in addition it is conceivable that under emerging legal theories of lender liability a purchaser could be held liable as a colender direct debt instruments may also involve a risk of insolvency of the lending bank or other intermediary a loan is often administered by a bank or other financial institution that acts as agent for all holders the agent administers the terms of the loan as specified in the loan agreement unless under the terms of the loan or other indebtedness the purchaser has direct recourse against the borrower the purchaser may have to rely on the agent to apply appropriate credit remedies against a borrower if assets held by the agent for the benefit of a purchaser were determined to be subject to the claims of the agents general creditors the purchaser might incur certain costs and delays in realizing payment on the loan or loan participation and could suffer a loss of principal or interest direct indebtedness may include letters of credit revolving credit facilities or other standby financing commitments that obligate purchasers to make additional cash payments on demand these commitments may have the effect of requiring a purchaser to increase its investment in a borrower at a time when it would not otherwise have done so even if the borrowers condition makes it unlikely that the amount will ever be repaid the fund limits the amount of total assets that it will invest in any one issuer or in issuers within the same industry see the funds investment limitations for purposes of these limitations a fund generally will treat the borrower as the issuer of indebtedness held by the fund in the case of loan participations where a bank or other lending institution serves as financial intermediary between a fund and the borrower if the participation does not shift to the fund the direct debtorcreditor relationship with the borrower sec interpretations require a fund in appropriate circumstances to treat both the lending bank or other lending institution and the borrower as issuers for these purposes treating a financial intermediary as an issuer of indebtedness may restrict a funds ability to invest in indebtedness related to a single financial intermediary or a group of intermediaries engaged in the same industry even if the underlying borrowers represent many different companies and industries lowerquality debt securities lowerquality debt securities include all types of debt instruments that have poor protection with respect to the payment of interest and repayment of principal or may be in default these securities are often considered to be speculative and involve greater risk of loss or price changes due to changes in the issuers capacity to pay the market prices of lowerquality debt securities may fluctuate more than those of higherquality debt securities and may decline significantly in periods of general economic difficulty which may follow periods of rising interest rates the market for lowerquality debt securities may be thinner and less active than that for higherquality debt securities which can adversely affect the prices at which the former are sold adverse publicity and changing investor perceptions may affect the liquidity of lowerquality debt securities and the ability of outside pricing services to value lowerquality debt securities because the risk of default is higher for lowerquality debt securities fmrcs research and credit analysis are an especially important part of managing securities of this type fmrc will attempt to identify those issuers of highyielding securities whose financial condition is adequate to meet future obligations has improved or is expected to improve in the future fmrcs analysis focuses on relative values based on such factors as interest or dividend coverage asset coverage earnings prospects and the experience and managerial strength of the issuer a fund may choose at its expense or in conjunction with others to pursue litigation or otherwise to exercise its rights as a security holder to seek to protect the interests of security holders if it determines this to be in the best interest of the funds shareholders preferred stock represents an equity or ownership interest in an issuer that pays dividends at a specified rate and that has precedence over common stock in the payment of dividends in the event an issuer is liquidated or declares bankruptcy the claims of owners of bonds take precedence over the claims of those who own preferred and common stock real estate investment trusts equity real estate investment trusts own real estate properties while mortgage real estate investment trusts make construction development and longterm mortgage loans their value may be affected by changes in the value of the underlying property of the trusts the creditworthiness of the issuer property taxes interest rates and tax and regulatory requirements such as those relating to the environment both types of trusts are dependent upon management skill are not diversified and are subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers selfliquidation and the possibility of failing to qualify for taxfree status of income under the internal revenue code and failing to maintain exemption from the  act repurchase agreements involve an agreement to purchase a security and to sell that security back to the original seller at an agreedupon price the resale price reflects the purchase price plus an agreedupon incremental amount which is unrelated to the coupon rate or maturity of the purchased security as protection against the risk that the original seller will not fulfill its obligation the securities are held in a separate account at a bank markedtomarket daily and maintained at a value at least equal to the sale price plus the accrued incremental amount the value of the security purchased may be more or less than the price at which the counterparty has agreed to purchase the security in addition delays or losses could result if the other party to the agreement defaults or becomes insolvent the fund will engage in repurchase agreement transactions with parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by fmrc restricted securities are subject to legal restrictions on their sale difficulty in selling securities may result in a loss or be costly to a fund restricted securities generally can be sold in privately negotiated transactions pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of   act or in a registered public offering where registration is required the holder of a registered security may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expense and a considerable period may elapse between the time it decides to seek registration and the time it may be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration statement if during such a period adverse market conditions were to develop the holder might obtain a less favorable price than prevailed when it decided to seek registration of the security reverse repurchase agreements in a reverse repurchase agreement a fund sells a security to another party such as a bank or brokerdealer in return for cash and agrees to repurchase that security at an agreedupon price and time the fund will enter into reverse repurchase agreements with parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by fmrc such transactions may increase fluctuations in the market value of fund assets and may be viewed as a form of leverage securities lending a fund may lend securities to parties such as brokerdealers or other institutions including fidelity brokerage services llc fbs llc fbs llc is a member of the new york stock exchange nyse and an indirect subsidiary of fmr llc securities lending allows a fund to retain ownership of the securities loaned and at the same time earn additional income the borrower provides the fund with collateral in an amount at least equal to the value of the securities loaned the fund seeks to maintain the ability to obtain the right to vote or consent on proxy proposals involving material events affecting securities loaned if the borrower defaults on its obligation to return the securities loaned because of insolvency or other reasons a fund could experience delays and costs in recovering the securities loaned or in gaining access to the collateral these delays and costs could be greater for foreign securities if a fund is not able to recover the securities loaned a fund may sell the collateral and purchase a replacement investment in the market the value of the collateral could decrease below the value of the replacement investment by the time the replacement investment is purchased loans will be made only to parties deemed by fmrc to be in good standing and when in fmrcs judgment the income earned would justify the risks cash received as collateral through loan transactions may be invested in other eligible securities including shares of a money market fund investing this cash subjects that investment as well as the securities loaned to market appreciation or depreciation securities of other investment companies including shares of closedend investment companies unit investment trusts and openend investment companies represent interests in professionally managed portfolios that may invest in any type of instrument investing in other investment companies involves substantially the same risks as investing directly in the underlying instruments but may involve additional expenses at the investment companylevel such as portfolio management fees and operating expenses certain types of investment companies such as closedend investment companies issue a fixed number of shares that trade on a stock exchange or overthecounter at a premium or a discount to their net asset value per share nav others are continuously offered at nav but may also be traded in the secondary market the extent to which a fund can invest in securities of other investment companies is limited by federal securities laws short sales against the box are short sales of securities that a fund owns or has the right to obtain equivalent in kind or amount to the securities sold short if a fund enters into a short sale against the box it will be required to set aside securities equivalent in kind and amount to the securities sold short or securities convertible or exchangeable into such securities and will be required to hold such securities while the short sale is outstanding the fund will incur transaction costs including interest expenses in connection with opening maintaining and closing short sales against the box sovereign debt obligations are issued or guaranteed by foreign governments or their agencies including debt of latin american nations or other developing countries sovereign debt may be in the form of conventional securities or other types of debt instruments such as loans or loan participations sovereign debt of developing countries may involve a high degree of risk and may be in default or present the risk of default governmental entities responsible for repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal and pay interest when due and may require renegotiation or rescheduling of debt payments in addition prospects for repayment of principal and payment of interest may depend on political as well as economic factors although some sovereign debt such as brady bonds is collateralized by us government securities repayment of principal and payment of interest is not guaranteed by the us government structured notes are derivative debt securities the interest rate or principal of which is determined by an unrelated indicator a structured note may be positively negatively or both positively and negatively indexed that is its value or interest rate may increase or decrease if the value of the reference instrument increases similarly its value may increase or decrease if the value of the reference instrument decreases further the change in the principal amount payable with respect to or the interest rate of a structured note may be a multiple of the percentage change positive or negative in the value of the underlying reference instruments structured or indexed securities may also be more volatile less liquid and more difficult to accurately price than less complex securities or more traditional debt securities temporary defensive policies the fund reserves the right to invest without limitation in preferred stocks and investmentgrade debt instruments for temporary defensive purposes warrants warrants are instruments which entitle the holder to buy an equity security at a specific price for a specific period of time changes in the value of a warrant do not necessarily correspond to changes in the value of its underlying security the price of a warrant may be more volatile than the price of its underlying security and a warrant may offer greater potential for capital appreciation as well as capital loss warrants do not entitle a holder to dividends or voting rights with respect to the underlying security and do not represent any rights in the assets of the issuing company a warrant ceases to have value if it is not exercised prior to its expiration date these factors can make warrants more speculative than other types of investments zero coupon bonds do not make interest payments instead they are sold at a discount from their face value and are redeemed at face value when they mature because zero coupon bonds do not pay current income their prices can be more volatile than other types of fixedincome securities when interest rates change in calculating a funds dividend a portion of the difference between a zero coupon bonds purchase price and its face value is considered income special considerations regarding canada political canadas parliamentary system of government is in general stable one of the provinces quebec which has a predominantly frenchspeaking population does have a separatist opposition party whose objective is to achieve sovereignty and increased selfgoverning legal and financial powers to date referendums on quebec sovereignty have been defeated but the issue remains unresolved in case a referendum about the independence of quebec were successful then the canadian federal government may be obliged to negotiate with quebec economic canada is a major producer of commodities such as forest products metals agricultural products and energy related products like oil gas and hydroelectricity accordingly changes in the supply and demand of base commodity resources and industrial and precious metals and materials both domestically and internationally can have a significant effect on canadian market performance the united states is canadas largest trading partner and developments in economic policy do have a significant impact on the canadian economy the expanding economic and financial integration of the united states canada and mexico through the nafta agreement may make the canadian economy and securities market more sensitive to north american trade patterns growth in developing nations overseas particularly china may change the composition of canadas trade and foreign investment composition in the near future special considerations regarding europe the european union eu is an intergovernmental and supranational union of most western european countries and a growing number of eastern european countries each known as a member state one of the key activities of the eu is the establishment and administration of a common single market consisting of among other things a single currency and a common trade policy in order to pursue this goal member states established among other things the european economic and monetary union emu which sets out different stages and commitments that member states need to follow to achieve greater economic policy coordination and monetary cooperation including the adoption of a single currency the euro many member states have adopted and other member states are generally expected to eventually adopt the euro as their single currency when a member state adopts the euro as its currency the member state no longer controls its own monetary policies instead the authority to direct monetary policy is exercised by the european central bank however certain countries do not qualify for the euro and thus risk being left behind while economic and monetary convergence in the eu may offer new opportunities for those investing in the region investors should be aware that the success of the eu is not wholly assured european countries can be significantly affected by the tight fiscal and monetary controls that the emu imposes on its members or requires candidates for emu membership to comply with europe must grapple with a number of challenges any one of which could threaten the survival of this monumental undertaking the countries adopting the euro must adjust to a unified monetary system the absence of exchange rate flexibility and the loss of economic sovereignty europes economies are diverse its governments are decentralized and its cultures differ widely unemployment in some european countries has historically been higher than in the united states and could pose political risk one or more member states might exit the eu placing its currency and banking system in jeopardy major issues currently facing the eu cover its membership structure procedures and policies they include the adoption abandonment or adjustment of the new constitutional treaty the eus enlargement to the south and east and resolving the eus problematic fiscal and democratic accountability efforts of the member states to continue to unify their economic and monetary policies may increase the potential for similarities in the movements of european markets and reduce the benefit of diversification within the region political the eu has been extending its influence to the east it has accepted several eastern european countries as new members and has plans to accept several more in the mediumterm it is hoped that membership for these states will help cement economic and political stability for these countries membership serves as a strong political impetus to employ tight fiscal and monetary policies nevertheless new member states which were former soviet satellites remain burdened to various extents by the inherited inefficiencies of centrally planned economies similar to what existed under the old soviet union further expansion of the eu has longterm economic benefits but certain european countries are not viewed as currently suitable for membership especially the troubled economies of countries further east also as the eu continues to enlarge the candidate countries accessions may grow more controversial some member states may repudiate certain candidate countries joining the eu upon concerns about the possible economic immigration and cultural implications that may result from such enlargement the current and future status of the eu therefore continues to be the subject of political controversy with widely differing views both within and between member states for example a large segment of the population in the united kingdom may be indifferent or opposed to the eu while other countries are generally more in favor of european integration it is possible that the gap between rich and poor within the eus member countries and particularly among new members that have not met the requirements for joining the emu may increase and that realigning traditional alliances could alter trading relationships and potentially provoke divisive socioeconomic splits in the transition to the single economic system significant political decisions will be made which may affect the market regulation subsidization and privatization across all industries from agricultural products to telecommunications economic the eu economy is expected to grow further over the next decade as more countries join the eu  especially considering that the new member states are usually poorer than the eu average and hence the expected fast gdp growth will help achieve the dynamic of the united europe the eus economic growth has been below that of the united states most years since  and the economic performance of several of its key members including germany and italy is a matter of serious concern to policy makers as economic conditions across member states vary from robust to dismal there is continued concern about nationallevel support for the euro and the accompanying coordination of fiscal and wage policy among emu member countries according to the maastricht treaty member countries must maintain tight control over inflation public debt and budget deficit in order to qualify for participation in the euro these requirements severely limit emu member countries ability to implement monetary policy to address regional economic conditions currency investing in eurodenominated securities entails risk of being exposed to a currency that may not fully reflect the strengths and weaknesses of the disparate european economies many european countries rely heavily upon exportdependent businesses and any strength in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar can have either a positive or a negative effect upon corporate profits nordic countries faced with stronger global competition the nordic countries  denmark finland norway and sweden  have had to scale down their historically generous welfare programs resulting in drops in domestic demand and increased unemployment major industries in the region such as forestry agriculture and oil are heavily resourcedependent and face pressure as a result of high labor costs pension reform union regulation and further cuts in liberal social programs will likely need to be addressed as the nordic countries face increased international competition eastern europe investing in the securities of eastern european issuers is highly speculative and involves risks not usually associated with investing in the more developed markets of western europe political and economic reforms are too recent to establish a definite trend away from centrally planned economies and stateowned industries many eastern european countries continue to move towards market economies at different paces with appropriately different characteristics most eastern european markets suffer from thin trading activity dubious investor protections and often a dearth of reliable corporate information information and transaction costs differential taxes and sometimes political or transfer risk give a comparative advantage to the domestic investor rather than the foreign investor in addition these markets are particularly sensitive to social political economic and currency events in russia and may suffer heavy losses as a result of their trading and investment links to the russian economy and currency special considerations regarding japan governmentindustry cooperation a strong work ethic mastery of high technology emphasis on education and a comparatively small defense allocation have helped japan advance with extraordinary speed to become one of the largest economic powers along with the united states and the eu despite its impressive history investors face special risks when investing in japan economic for three decades from the s through the s japans overall real economic growth had been spectacular however growth slowed markedly in the s and japans economy fell into a long recession at present the japanese economy could be recovering from this long recession although uncertainties about its recovery remain japans huge government debt the aging of the population an unstable financial sector low domestic consumption and certain corporate structural weaknesses are some of the major longterm problems overseas trade is important to japans economy japan has few natural resources and must export to pay for its imports of these basic requirements japans economic growth is significantly driven by its exports domestic or foreign trade sanctions or other protectionist measures could adversely impact japans economy japan has experienced earthquakes and tidal waves of varying degrees of severity and the risks of such phenomena and the resulting damage continue to exist a pressing need to sustain japans economic recovery and improve its economic growth is the task of overhauling the nations financial institutions and securing public support for taxpayerfunded bailouts banks in particular may have to reform themselves to become more competitive successful financial sector reform would contribute to japans economic recovery at home and would benefit other economies in asia internal conflict over the proper way to reform the banking system exists special considerations regarding asia pacific region ex japan many countries in the region have historically faced political uncertainty corruption military intervention and social unrest examples include the ethnic sectarian and separatist violence found in indonesia and the nuclear arms threats between india and pakistan to the extent that such events continue in the future they can be expected to have a negative effect on economic and securities market conditions in the region economic the economies of many countries in the region are heavily dependent on international trade and are accordingly affected by protective trade barriers and the economic conditions of their trading partners principally the us japan china and the european union korea investors should be aware that investing in korea involves risks not typically associated with investing in the us securities markets relations between north korea and south korea remain tense and the possibility of military action between two countries still exists corporate and financial sector restructuring initiated by the korean government in conjunction with the imf after the  asian financial crisis can be expected to continue but its full impact cannot be predicted yet korean economys reliance on international trade and other asian economies makes it highly sensitive to fluctuations in international commodity prices currency exchange rates and government regulation china region as with all transition economies chinas ability to develop and sustain a credible legal regulatory monetary and socioeconomic system could influence the course of outside investment hong kong is closely tied to china economically and through chinas  acquisition of the country as a special autonomous region sar hong kongs success depends in large part on its ability to retain the legal financial and monetary systems that allow economic freedom and market expansion although many taiwanese companies heavily invest in china a state of hostility continues to exist between china and taiwan which beijing has long deemed a part of china and has made a nationalist cause of recovering it taiwans political stability and ability to sustain its economic growth could be significantly affected by its political and economic relationship with china southeast asia in addition to the risks inherent in investing in the emerging markets the risks of investing in southeast asia merit special consideration indonesia has restored financial stability and pursued sober fiscal policies since the  asian financial crisis but many economic development problems remain including high unemployment a fragile banking sector endemic corruption inadequate infrastructure a poor investment climate and unequal resource distribution among regions in addition indonesia continues to be at risk of ethnic sectarian and separatist violence keys to future growth remain internal reform peaceful resolution of internal conflicts building up the confidence of international and domestic investors and strong global economic growth in late december  a major tsunami took nearly  lives left more than  people missing and nearly  people displaced and destroyed  to  billion worth of property the negative effects of the tsunami are still felt today and similar natural disasters could happen again special considerations regarding latin america as an emerging market latin america historically suffered from social political and economic instability for investors this has meant additional risk caused by periods of regional conflict political corruption totalitarianism protectionist measures nationalization hyperinflation debt crises sudden and large currency devaluation and intervention by the military in civilian and economic spheres however in some latin american countries a move to sustainable democracy and a more mature and accountable political environment is under way domestic economies have been deregulated privatization of stateowned companies is almost completed and foreign trade restrictions have been relaxed nonetheless to the extent that events such as those listed above continue in the future they could reverse favorable trends toward market and economic reform privatization and removal of trade barriers and result in significant disruption in securities markets in the region investors in the region continue to face a number of potential risks a number of latin american countries are among the largest debtors of developing countries and have a long history of foreign debt and default the majority of the regions economies have become highly dependent upon foreign credit and loans from external sources to fuel their statesponsored economic plans historically government profligacy and illconceived plans for modernization have exhausted these resources with little benefit accruing to the economy most countries have been forced to restructure their loans or risk default on their debt obligations in addition interest on the debt is subject to market conditions and may reach levels that would impair economic activity and create a difficult and costly environment for borrowers accordingly these governments may be forced to reschedule or freeze their debt repayment which could negatively affect local markets special considerations regarding emerging markets investing in companies domiciled in emerging market countries may be subject to potentially higher risks than investments in developed countries these risks include i less social political and economic stability ii greater illiquidity and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities or low or nonexistent trading volumes iii foreign exchanges and brokerdealers may be subject to less scrutiny and regulation by local authorities iv local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors andor local governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuers ability to make dividend or interest payments v local governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital profits and dividends vi capital gains may be subject to local taxation including on a retroactive basis vii issuers facing restrictions on dollar or euro payments imposed by local governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency viii investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities andor local judges may favor the interests of the issuer over those of foreign investors ix bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the local currency x limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market valuations of the securities and xi lax financial reporting on a regular basis substandard disclosure and differences in accounting standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer special considerations regarding russia investing in russian securities is highly speculative and involves significant risks and special considerations not typically associated with investing in the securities markets of the us and most other developed countries political over the past century russia has experienced political and economic turbulence and has endured decades of communist rule under which tens of millions of its citizens were collectivized into state agricultural and industrial enterprises since the collapse of the soviet union russias government has been faced with the daunting task of stabilizing its domestic economy while transforming it into a modern and efficient structure able to compete in international markets and respond to the needs of its citizens however to date many of the countrys economic reform initiatives have floundered as the proceeds of imf and other economic assistance have been squandered or stolen in this environment there is always the risk that the nations government will abandon the current program of economic reform and replace it with radically different political and economic policies that would be detrimental to the interests of foreign and private investors economic many of russias businesses have failed to mobilize the available factors of production because the countrys privatization program virtually ensured the predominance of the old management teams that are largely nonmarketoriented in their management approach poor accounting standards inept management pervasive corruption insider trading and crime and inadequate regulatory protection for the rights of investors all pose a significant risk particularly to foreign investors in addition there is the risk that the russian tax system will not be reformed to prevent inconsistent retroactive andor exorbitant taxation or in the alternative the risk that a reformed tax system may result in the inconsistent and unpredictable enforcement of the new tax laws compared to most national stock markets the russian securities market suffers from a variety of problems not encountered in more developed markets there is little longterm historical data on the russian securities market because it is relatively new and a substantial proportion of securities transactions in russia are privately negotiated outside of stock exchanges the inexperience of the russian securities market and the limited volume of trading in securities in the market may make obtaining accurate prices on portfolio securities from independent sources more difficult than in more developed markets additionally there is little solid corporate information available to investors as a result it may be difficult to assess the value or prospects of an investment in russian companies because of the recent formation of the russian securities market as well as the underdeveloped state of the banking and telecommunications systems settlement clearing and registration of securities transactions are subject to significant risks ownership of shares except where shares are held through depositories that meet the requirements of the investment company act of   act is defined according to entries in the companys share register and normally evidenced by extracts from the register or by formal share certificates however there is no central registration system for shareholders and these services are carried out by the companies themselves or by registrars located throughout russia these registrars are not necessarily subject to effective state supervision nor are they licensed with any governmental entity and it is possible for a fund to lose its registration through fraud negligence or even mere oversight while a fund will endeavor to ensure that its interest continues to be appropriately recorded either itself or through a custodian or other agent inspecting the share register and by obtaining extracts of share registers through regular confirmations these extracts have no legal enforceability and it is possible that subsequent illegal amendment or other fraudulent act may deprive a fund of its ownership rights or improperly dilute its interests in addition while applicable russian regulations impose liability on registrars for losses resulting from their errors it may be difficult for a fund to enforce any rights it may have against the registrar or issuer of the securities in the event of loss of share registration furthermore significant delays or problems may occur in registering the transfer of securities which could cause a fund to incur losses due to a counterpartys failure to pay for securities the fund has delivered or the funds inability to complete its contractual obligations because of theft or other reasons the russian economy is heavily dependent upon the export of a range of commodities including most industrial metals forestry products oil and gas accordingly it is strongly affected by international commodity prices and is particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for these products currency foreign investors also face a high degree of currency risk when investing in russian securities and a lack of available currency hedging instruments in a surprise move in august  russia devalued the ruble defaulted on shortterm domestic bonds and imposed a moratorium on the repayment of its international debt and the restructuring of the repayment terms these actions have negatively affected russian borrowers ability to access international capital markets and have had a damaging impact on the russian economy in light of these and other government actions foreign investors could face the possibility of further devaluations in addition there is the risk the government may impose capital controls on foreign portfolio investments in the event of extreme financial or political crisis such capital controls would prevent the sale of a portfolio of foreign assets and the repatriation of investment income and capital portfolio transactions all orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities are placed on behalf of the fund by fmrc pursuant to authority contained in the management contract fmrc may also be responsible for the placement of portfolio transactions for other investment companies and investment accounts for which it has or its affiliates have investment discretion purchases and sales of equity securities on a securities exchange or otc are effected through brokers who receive compensation for their services generally compensation relating to securities traded on foreign exchanges will be higher than compensation relating to securities traded on us exchanges and may not be subject to negotiation compensation may also be paid in connection with principal transactions in both otc securities and securities listed on an exchange and agency otc transactions executed with an electronic communications network ecn or an alternative trading system equity securities may be purchased from underwriters at prices that include underwriting fees purchases and sales of fixedincome securities are generally made with an issuer or a primary marketmaker acting as principal although there is no stated brokerage commission paid by the fund for any fixedincome security the price paid by the fund to an underwriter includes the disclosed underwriting fee and prices in secondary trades usually include an undisclosed dealer commission or markup reflecting the spread between the bid and ask prices of the fixedincome security the trustees of the fund periodically review fmrcs performance of its responsibilities in connection with the placement of portfolio transactions on behalf of the fund the trustees also review the compensation paid by the fund over representative periods of time to determine if it was reasonable in relation to the benefits to the fund the selection of brokers in selecting brokers or dealers including affiliates of fmrc to execute the funds portfolio transactions fmrc considers factors deemed relevant in the context of a particular trade and in regard to fmrcs overall responsibilities with respect to the fund and other investment accounts including any instructions from the funds portfolio manager which may emphasize for example speed of execution over other factors the factors considered will influence whether it is appropriate to execute an order using ecns electronic channels including algorithmic trading or by actively working an order other factors deemed relevant may include but are not limited to price the size and type of the transaction the reasonableness of compensation to be paid including spreads and commission rates the speed and certainty of trade executions including broker willingness to commit capital the nature and characteristics of the markets for the security to be purchased or sold including the degree of specialization of the broker in such markets or securities the availability of liquidity in the security including the liquidity and depth afforded by a market center or marketmaker the reliability of a market center or broker the brokers overall trading relationship with fmrc the traders assessment of whether and how closely the broker likely will follow the traders instructions to the broker the degree of anonymity that a particular broker or market can provide the potential for avoiding market impact the execution services rendered on a continuing basis the execution efficiency settlement capability and financial condition of the firm and the provision of additional brokerage and research products and services if applicable in seeking best execution fmrc may select a broker using a trading method for which the broker may charge a higher commission than its lowest available commission rate fmrc also may select a broker that charges more than the lowest available commission rate available from another broker for futures transactions the selection of an fcm is generally based on the overall quality of execution and other services provided by the fcm the acquisition of brokerage and research products and services brokers who are not affiliates of fmrc that execute transactions for the fund may receive higher compensation from the fund than other brokers might have charged the fund in recognition of the value of the brokerage or research products and services they provide to fmrc or its affiliates research products and services these products and services may include economic industry company municipal sovereign us and nonus legal or political research reports market color company meeting facilitation and investment recommendations fmrc may request that a broker provide a specific proprietary or thirdparty product or service some of these products and services supplement fmrcs own research activities in providing investment advice to the fund execution services in addition products and services may include those that assist in the execution clearing and settlement of securities transactions as well as other incidental functions including but not limited to communication services related to trade execution order routing and algorithmic trading posttrade matching exchange of messages among brokers or dealers custodians and institutions and the use of electronic confirmation and affirmation of institutional trades mixeduse products and services in addition to receiving brokerage and research products and services via written reports and computerdelivered services such reports may also be provided by telephone and in personal meetings with securities analysts corporate and industry spokespersons economists academicians and government representatives and others with relevant professional expertise fmrc and its affiliates may use commission dollars to obtain certain products or services that are not used exclusively in fmrcs or its affiliates investment decisionmaking process mixeduse products or services in those circumstances fmrc or its affiliates will make a good faith judgment to evaluate the various benefits and uses to which they intend to put the mixeduse product or service and will pay for that portion of the mixeduse product or service that does not qualify as brokerage and research products and services with their own resources referred to as hard dollars benefit to fmrc fmrcs expenses would likely be increased if it attempted to generate these additional products and services through its own efforts or if it paid for these products or services itself certain of the brokerage and research products and services fmrc receives from brokers are furnished by brokers on their own initiative either in connection with a particular transaction or as part of their overall services some of these products or services may not have an explicit cost associated with such product or service fmrcs decisionmaking process before causing the fund to pay a particular level of compensation fmrc will make a good faith determination that the compensation is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage andor research products and services provided to fmrc viewed in terms of the particular transaction for the fund or fmrcs overall responsibilities to the fund or other investment companies and investment accounts while fmrc may take into account the brokerage andor research products and services provided by a broker in determining whether compensation paid is reasonable neither fmrc nor the fund incurs an obligation to any broker dealer or third party to pay for any product or service or portion thereof by generating a specific amount of compensation or otherwise typically these products and services assist fmrc and its affiliates in terms of its overall investment responsibilities to the fund and other investment companies and investment accounts however each product or service received may not benefit the fund certain funds or investment accounts may use brokerage commissions to acquire brokerage and research products and services that may also benefit other funds or accounts managed by fmrc or its affiliates hard dollar research contracts fmrc has arrangements with certain thirdparty research providers and brokers through whom fmrc effects fund trades whereby fmrc may pay with hard dollars for all or a portion of the cost of research products and services purchased from such research providers or brokers even with such hard dollar payments fmrc may cause the fund to pay more for execution than the lowest commission rate available from the broker providing research products and services to fmrc or that may be available from another broker fmrc views its hard dollar payments for research products and services as likely to reduce the funds total commission costs even though it is expected that in such hard dollar arrangements the commissions available for recapture and to pay fund expenses as described below will decrease fmrcs determination to pay for research products and services separately rather than bundled with fund commissions is wholly voluntary on fmrcs part and may be extended to additional brokers or discontinued with any broker participating in this arrangement commission recapture fmrc may allocate brokerage transactions to brokers who are not affiliates of fmrc who have entered into arrangements with fmr under which the broker using predetermined methodology rebates a portion of the compensation paid by a fund to offset that funds expenses which may be paid to fmrc or its affiliates not all brokers with whom the fund trades have agreed to participate in brokerage commission recapture fmrc expects that brokers from whom fmrc purchases research products and services with hard dollars are unlikely to participate in commission recapture affiliated transactions fmrc may place trades with certain brokers including national financial services llc nfs with whom fmrc is under common control provided fmrc determines that these affiliates trade execution abilities and costs are comparable to those of nonaffiliated qualified brokerage firms the trustees of the fund have approved procedures whereby a fund may purchase securities that are offered in underwritings in which an affiliate of fmr participates in addition for underwritings where an fmr affiliate participates as a principal underwriter certain restrictions may apply that could among other things limit the amount of securities that the fund could purchase in the underwritings trade allocation although the trustees and officers of the fund are substantially the same as those of other funds managed by fmr or its affiliates investment decisions for the fund are made independently from those of other funds or investment accounts including proprietary accounts managed by fmr or its affiliates the same security is often held in the portfolio of more than one of these funds or investment accounts simultaneous transactions are inevitable when several funds and investment accounts are managed by the same investment adviser particularly when the same security is suitable for the investment objective of more than one fund or investment account when two or more funds or investment accounts are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or sale of the same security including a futures contract the prices and amounts are allocated in accordance with procedures believed by fmrc to be appropriate and equitable to each fund or investment account in some cases adherence to these procedures could have a detrimental effect on the price or value of the security as far as the fund is concerned in other cases however the ability of the fund to participate in volume transactions will produce better executions and prices for the fund commissions paid a fund may pay compensation including both commissions and spreads in connection with the placement of portfolio transactions the amount of brokerage commissions paid by a fund may change from year to year because of among other things changing asset levels shareholder activity andor portfolio turnover valuation the funds nav is the value of a single share the nav of the fund is computed by adding the value of the funds investments cash and other assets subtracting its liabilities and dividing the result by the number of shares outstanding portfolio securities are valued by various methods depending on the primary market or exchange on which they trade most equity securities for which the primary market is the united states are valued at the official closing price last sale price or if no sale has occurred at the closing bid price most equity securities for which the primary market is outside the united states are valued using the official closing price or the last sale price in the principal market in which they are traded if the last sale price on the local exchange is unavailable the last evaluated quote or closing bid price normally is used securities of other openend investment companies are valued at their respective navs debt securities and other assets for which market quotations are readily available may be valued at market values determined by such securities most recent bid prices sales prices if the principal market is an exchange in the principal market in which they normally are traded as furnished by recognized dealers in such securities or assets or debt securities and convertible securities may be valued on the basis of information furnished by a pricing service that uses a valuation matrix which incorporates both dealersupplied valuations and electronic data processing techniques use of pricing services has been approved by the board of trustees a number of pricing services are available and the fund may use various pricing services or discontinue the use of any pricing service futures contracts and options are valued on the basis of market quotations if available independent brokers or quotation services provide prices of foreign securities in their local currency fidelity service company inc fsc gathers all exchange rates daily at the close of the nyse using the last quoted price on the local currency and then translates the value of foreign securities from their local currencies into us dollars any changes in the value of forward contracts due to exchange rate fluctuations and days to maturity are included in the calculation of nav if an event that is expected to materially affect the value of a portfolio security occurs after the close of an exchange or market on which that security is traded then that security will be valued in good faith by a committee appointed by the board of trustees shortterm securities with remaining maturities of sixty days or less for which market quotations and information furnished by a pricing service are not readily available are valued either at amortized cost or at original cost plus accrued interest both of which approximate current value the procedures set forth above need not be used to determine the value of the securities owned by the fund if in the opinion of a committee appointed by the board of trustees some other method would more accurately reflect the fair value of such securities for example securities and other assets for which there is no readily available market value may be valued in good faith by a committee appointed by the board of trustees in making a good faith determination of the value of a security the committee may review price movements in futures contracts and adrs market and trading trends the bidask quotes of brokers and offexchange

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump
