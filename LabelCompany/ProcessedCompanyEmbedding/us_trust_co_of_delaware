alternative investments such as derivatives hedge funds private equity funds and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments before you invest in alternative investments you should consider your overall financial situation how much money you have to invest your need for liquidity and your tolerance for risk alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk  nonfinancial assets such as closelyheld businesses real estate oil gas and mineral
