is sure to be the standard undergraduatelevel introduction to world religions from the christian perspectiveintroducing world religions a christian engagement baker academic  introducing world religions begins with an excellent introduction to prepare the reader for the forthcoming journey into the religious landscape of the contemporary world this initial section the persistence of religion appropriately positions the reader and introduces the study of religion as an academic discipline first farhadian acknowledges the difficulty that arises when one seeks to definitively define religion consequently farhadian follows the eight characteristics of religion articulated by watson king encyclopedia of religion religion   traditionalism  myth and symbols  ideas of salvation  sacred objects and places  sacred actions  sacred writings  sacred community and  sacred experience second farhadian briefly explores the numerous contexts in which the study of religion is discussed psychological social cultural historical and environmental as well as the various theories of religion psychological sociological anthropological and economical articulated and affected by figures such as sigmund freud emile durkheim and karl marx introducing world religion covers eight major world religions hinduism buddhism jainism sikhism taoism and confucianism judaism christianity and islam and dedicates an entire chapter to new religious movements ie mormonism jehovahs witnesses scientology etc each chapter has four dedicated sections contemporary snapshot origins and concepts worship and practice and modern movements and closes with an annotated timeline key terms and a further reading bibliography throughout each individual chapter the reader will encounter a number of important terms that farhadian has highlighted and defined these terms are also listed at the end of each chapter and included in the glossary with a brief definition for quick reference also as the subtitle alludes the reader will encounter frequent christian reflection sections in which farhadian helps aid the reader to think through various issues from a christian worldview these sections are brief and differ in usefulness but the reader is sure to appreciate the sensitivity of their inclusion for the overall purpose of the book there are always limitations with the amount of content that can be included in an introductory work such as introducing world religions this is especially the case when an author is looking to engage with other religious systems from a specific worldview still i believe that farhadian has maintained the needed balance between introduction and reflection with precision and the reader will benefit greatly from his attention to detail furthermore consistently farhadian exhibits a clear desire to engage the landscape of world religions from a christian worldview and do so in such a way that the reader is encouraged to think critically as they interact with other religious systems near and far the content within the book is clear and well organized for this task add a whole host of fullcolor illustrations photographs tables maps and sidebar discussions and you have the recipe for a worldclass textbook if you are a teacher or professor looking for an engaging textbook that will help you students shape a christian worldview while engaging world religions then introducing word religions by charles e farhadian is certain to be a welcomed addition to your course curriculum if you are a student pastor or interested layman who is looking for a solid introduction to the religious landscape of the contemporary world then farhadian has provided a topcontender introducing world religions is clear stimulating and bursting with useful information
