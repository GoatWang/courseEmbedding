investment process of getting invested risk management boyle capital takes a fundamental researchintensive value approach to investing the research process is based on a bottoms up analysis ie company specific although boyle capital does include topdown factors in its overall analysis eg how will a company be impacted by a downturn in the economy a rise or fall in interest rates etc boyle capital generally seeks to make investments in three broad categories of opportunities  great businesses at fair prices  good businesses or assets at extraordinarily cheap prices often with a catalyst to realize value  mispriced probabilistic investments where the market price of a security under or overestimates the probability of a favorable outcome of a legal decision contract or patent award or such other event that is expected to lead to a significant change in the valuation of a security the majority of our investment ideas are internally generated through independent research news services can be a source of new ideas as well as quantitative screen searches on various databases trade shows and conferences may also yield new ideas often the best ideas will come from a bottomup review of a company its history and its industry and a reinterpretation of facts and events that other investors have not previously done new investments may also be identified from existing investments in the portfolio as we leverage lessons learned in earlier research to uncover additional opportunities once a potential investment appears sufficiently promising we delve deeply into the historical record of the potential investment and look for sources of comparable data on both public and private companies this process involves the analysis of corporate reports press releases and financial statements and reviewing documents filed with the sec or other regulatory entities court filings newspaper magazine and internet articles audio or transcripts of conference calls presentations and a variety of additional sources we may also seek to meet with management to attempt to better understand the longterm strengths and weaknesses of the industry or the conditions under which the company operates our accounts are separately managed and our focus is on absolute returns as such we invest each account individually and do not manage on a “model” managing accounts on a model means that every account is fully invested on the first day and holds the same stocks boyle capital does not manage accounts in this way because we feel that it is imperative to not just make the right investment but it is equally important to make it at the right price therefore we invest accounts one position at a time and we will only purchase when a company is trading at or below our target buy price when a company drops into our buy range it is added to each portfolio due to this strict purchase criteria each account under boyle capital’s management may not hold all of the same securities or the same weighting in each security depending on the inception date of each account while this process creates a higher dispersion between accounts we think it makes the most investment sense ultimately resulting in better performance at boyle capital we do not believe in formulaic approaches to risk management our primary risk management tool is the extensive research we complete prior to making an initial investment we define investment risk as the probability of a permanent loss of capital rather than security price volatility the factors that we take into account include i volatilitypredictability of the businesses low ii correlation with macroeconomic factors iii financial leverage minimal iv defensible market positions and v discount to intrinsic value large it is our belief that the acquisition of a portfolio of investments each of which has been acquired at a large discount to intrinsic value will provide a margin of safety that can mitigate the likelihood of an overall permanent loss of capital   boyle capital all rights reserved      office plaza drive west des moines iowa  legal privacy terms boyle capital management llc private company information
