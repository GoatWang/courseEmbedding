mission to rid the world of plastic water bottles i believed that if we made a craveworthy bottle that combined fashion with function people would stop buying disposable bottles and we could reduce singleuse plastic consumption worldwide it was an audacious goal but i believed the world needed s’well seven years later we are the fastest growing womanowned company in the country i am delighted every time i see a s’well in a purse a backpack or a stroller our fan base has been built by word of mouth one enthusiastic user to another we are making big differences by the amount of plastic we’re keeping out of landfills and our waterways i’m also incredibly proud to partner with unicef red and many other important charities not only do our bottles work great they also help accomplish great

httpdaqhkydcmycloudfrontnetwpcontentuploadsswellblackbluepng    thursday december th  s’well launched its firstever holiday film to showcase our bottles in a chic yet innovative way the spot titled “hydration magic” is full of the same kind of optimism joy fashion and magic that the product itself embodies while it features s’well as an object of desire it also shows how s’well serves as a catalyst for unexpected surprise and delight “hydration magic” was the company’s biggest production yet featuring  distinct characters and  additional extras including some of our very own s’well team members directed by john poliquin–a canadian music video commercial and feature film director–the film is set in a stuffy art gallery in need of a little inspiration a water balloon fight quickly breaks out drenching the guests and paintings with water as the paintings are hit with water the colors beneath the original blank canvases are revealed the explosions of water were shot in slow motion at  frames per second in order to capture the magic and beauty of water  take a look at our behind the scenes pictures and video and see what it was like to create the magic   back to blog home
