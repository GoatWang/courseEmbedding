is hard and the effort required to make sense of that data can require a team of data scientists a massive data center and a lot of money parkour method’s mission is to free developers from the complexity of location technology to ultimately enable more personalized user experiences we believe in the oneclick hail that your phone should tell you your pickup location not the other way around we believe you shouldn’t have to specify preferences to a ‘smart’phone we believe a phone charger should only be used once a day we believe discovery should feel organic we believe if equipped with

which sent you to the wrong side of the building on th st or request a car only to have the driver arrive across the street or around the corner from you  it’s due to poor quality address coordinate mapping address latlons have traditionally been mapped using a ‘street interpolation’ or ‘building centroid’ method which offers mapping accuracy within  –  block of an address in nyc where city blocks can be three times larger than in smaller cities address coordinates can be as much as  feet off check out your favorite map provider wherever you are right now and you’ll find business listings and residences far from their actual locations or address coordinates located in the wrong buildings or the middle of a street this can be frustrating for you and for your customers getting the right address coordinate is as important as getting the right address it’s crucial when you’re checking into a restaurant requesting a car pickup or if you’re providing directions to a store at parkour method our objective is to map our address coordinates within feet of their actual building entrances our patentpending process uses a combination of historical user location data and proprietary spatial analysis tools offering corrected address coordinates for   of metropolitan addresses and  of ruralsuburban areas each parkour address coordinate targeted for location within feet of a building entrance with few exceptions  of course maps are best presented visually — check out our latest maps washington dc area silicon valley ca san francisco ca we’ve nearly completed remapping the us residential and commercial address space and by september  we’ll have remapped key international metropolitan areas too as you’re browsing through our maps you may notice small pockets of address data which seems to be a bit off — that’s our  error rate which places addresses several meters away from their intended locations and congrats on having a detailed eye we’re

wikipedia the free encyclopedia   redirected from leparkour jump to navigation search parkour a traceur performing a speed vault also known as pk focus obstacle passing country of origin france creator david belle famous practitioners sébastien foucan david belle charles perriere descendant arts freerunning parkour french pronunciation ​paʁkuʁ is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training practitioners aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible parkour includes running climbing swinging vaulting jumping rolling quadrupedal movement and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation parkours development from military training gives it some aspects of a noncombative martial art parkour is an activity that can be practised alone or with others and is usually—but not exclusively—carried out in urban spaces parkour involves seeing ones environment in a new way and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around across through over and under its features parkour was developed in france primarily by raymond belle and further by his son david and the latters group of friends the selfstyled yamakasi during the late s the discipline was popularised in the late s and s through films documentaries and advertisements featuring the yamakasi contents  etymology  history  georges hébert  raymond and david belle  yamakasi  discipline  name and split  organisations  philosophy  competition  david belle  practice  movement  equipment  risks  trespassing  injuries and deaths  impact  entertainment  military training  derivative terminologies and disciplines  see also  references  sources etymologyedit the word parkour derives from parcours du combattant the classic obstacle course method of military training proposed by georges hébert raymond belle used the term le parcours to encompass all of his training including climbing jumping running balancing and the other methods he undertook in his personal athletic advancement his son david further developed his fathers methods and achieved success as a stuntman and one day on a film set showed his speed air man video to hubert koundé koundé suggested he change the c of parcours to a k because it was stronger and more dynamic and to remove the silent s for the same reason forming parkour a practitioner of parkour is called a traceur with the feminine form being traceuse they are nouns derived from the french verb tracer which normally means to trace as in tracing a path in reference to drawing the verb tracer used familiarly means to buck up the term traceur was originally the name of a parkour group headed by david belle which included sébastien foucan and stéphane vigroux a jam refers to a meeting of traceurs involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days often with people from different cities the first parkour jam was organised in july  by romain drouet with a dozen people including sébastien foucan and stéphane vigroux historyedit georges hébertedit in western europe a forerunner of parkour was french naval officer georges hébert who before world war i promoted athletic skill based on the models of indigenous tribes he had met in africa he noted their bodies were splendid flexible nimble skillful enduring and resistant but yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature his rescue efforts during the  eruption of mount pelée on saintpierre martinique reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism hébert became a physical education tutor at the college of reims in france hébert set up a méthode naturelle natural method session consisting of ten fundamental groups walking running jumping quadrupedal movement climbing balancing throwing lifting selfdefence swimming these were intended to develop the three main forces energetic willpower courage coolness and firmness moral benevolence assistance honour and honesty and physical muscles and breath during world war i and world war ii teaching continued to expand becoming the standard system of french military education and training inspired by hébert a swiss architect developed a parcours du combattant—military obstacle course—the first of the courses that are now standard in military training and which led to the development of civilian fitness trails and confidence courses raymond and david belleedit born in  in vietnam raymond belle was the son of a french physician and vietnamese mother during the first indochina war his father died and he was separated from his mother after which he was sent to a military orphanage in da lat at the age of  he took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never be a victim at night when everyone else was asleep he would be outside running or climbing trees he would use the military obstacle courses in secret and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance strength and flexibility doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood but also eventually to thrive after the battle of dien bien phu in  he returned to france and remained in military education until the age of  when he joined the paris fire brigade a french army unit david belle is considered the founder of parkour raymonds son david belle was born in  he experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs as he got older he started to read the newspaper clippingswhich that told of his fathers exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats through conversations with his father he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded indoor environment through conversations with his father david learned about this way of training that his father called parcours he heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things he learned that for his father training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about david realised that this was what he had been searching for and so he began training in the same way after a time he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training yamakasiedit main article yamakasi david initially trained on his own and after moving to lisses found other young men including his cousins who had similar desires and they began to train together the group eventually included david belle sébastien foucan châu belle dinh williams belle yann hnautra laurent piemontesi guylain nguba boyeke malik diouf and charles perrière disciplineedit the group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed examples included training without food or water or sleeping on the floor without a blanket to learn to endure the cold for example no one in the group was permitted to be late for training as it would hold back the whole group if any member completed a challenge everyone else had to do the same thing during their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative few excuses were allowed for instance if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump he had to do it anyway even if it meant doing the jump barefoot at the same time everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits respecting ones health and physical wellbeing was one of the foundations of the group if any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement the movement was deemed a failure a movement executed only once was not considered an achievement only with repetition was the challenge complete every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury if any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again humility was an important principle no traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement if any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again anyone who lied violated the principle of humility to join the group new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining despite the huge emphasis on the collective each traceur had to progress and develop independently — to create the means to be yourself — and there was a complete trust within the group every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour if a member violated the principles the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values name and splitedit in  david belles brother jeanfrançois invited the group to perform for the public in a firefighter show in paris for the performance the group named themselves yamakasi—congolese lingala ya makási meaning strong in ones person or strong man strong spirit sébastien foucan also invented a name for what they were doing lart du déplacement french for the art of movement the firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it such as their hard training and their values and ethics jeanfrançois also sent pictures and video of the group to a french tv programme and the popularity of parkour began to increase a series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group and they began to get more requests for performances during this time conflicting interests arose within the group sébastien foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more and david belle had the ambition to become an actor david and sébastien chose to leave the group and used the name parkour to describe their activity see § etymology above the seven remaining yamakasi members continued to use the term lart du déplacement  see § derivative terminologies and disciplines below organisationsedit national parkour organisations include apex school of movement united states fédération de parkour france jump freerun netherlands parkour uk parkour and tricking sweden australian parkour association and new zealand parkour association international parkout organisations include the mouvement international du parkour freerunning et lart du déplacement the fédération internationale des arts du déplacement and the world freerunning and parkour federation philosophyedit according to williams belle the philosophies and theories behind parkour are an integral aspect of the art one that many nonpractitioners have never been exposed to belle says he trains people because he wants it to be alive and for people to use it châu belle explains it is a type of freedom or kind of expression that parkour is only a state of mind rather than a set of actions and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers traceur dylan baker says parkour also influences ones thought processes by enhancing selfconfidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles a study by neuropsychiatrie de lenfance et de ladolescence neuropsychiatry of childhood and adolescence in france found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do academic research on parkour has tended to describe how parkour provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space metropolitan life and embodiment a newer convention of parkour philosophy has been the idea of human reclamation andy tran of urban evolution clarifies it as a means of reclaiming what it means to be a human being it teaches us to move using the natural methods that we should have learned from infancy it teaches us to touch the world and interact with it instead of being sheltered by it another traceurwho writes it is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour competitionedit a campaign was started on  may  by the parkournet portal to preserve parkours philosophy against sports competition and rivalry in the words of erwan le corre competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd andor the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of selfdevelopment if parkour becomes a sport it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a noncompetitive activity and a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour but that wont hold its philosophical essence anymore red bulls sponsored athlete for parkour ryan doyle has said sometimes people ask who is the best at parkour and it is because they dont understand what parkour is who is the best is what you would say to a sport and parkour is not a sport it is an art its a discipline thats like saying whats the best song in the world this seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks as has been popularised by youtube and most media exposurecitation needed david belleedit in his  book parkour david belle stressed that the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements but rather the practitioners mentality and understanding of its principles when young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing i just take the tape and throw it away what im interested in is what the guys got in his head if he has selfconfidence if he masters the technique if he has understood the principles of parkour i just cant deal with guys who do parkour because they saw videos on the internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better further he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations and developing in their own way when a young person asks me can you show me how to do this i simply answer no i am going to show you how i do it then youll have to learn with your own technique your own way of moving your style your abilities and your limitations you are going to learn to be yourself not someone else the philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts in an interview with the new yorker david belle acknowledges the influence theres a quote by bruce lee thats my motto there are no limits there are plateaus but you must not stay there you must go beyond them a man must constantly exceed his level if youre not better than you were the day before then what are you doing—whats the point in an interview with the press belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors so many people try to train easy come do parkour its really cool but if tomorrow i made you do real training you would end up crying thats what you need to know you are going to cry you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before in his book belle also quotes his father raymond if two roads open up before you always take the most difficult one because you know you can travel the easy one belle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour saying precision is all about being measured and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master with parkour i often say once is never in other words someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything it can be luck or chance when you make a jump you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it its an unavoidable rule do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself when you come for training you have to train even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times to its founder parkour is a method of selfrefinement used for learning to control and focus oneself practiceedit movementedit play media a practitioner climbing a wall while there is no official list of moves in parkour the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others and there are a number of movements considered fundamental some examples of common movements are vaulting over obstacles jumping and landing accurately with the feet on small or narrow obstacles jumping and landing feetfirst on a vertical surface catching the horizontal top with the hands using a rolling motion to help absorb impacts from larger drops running towards a high wall and then jumping and pushing off the wall with a foot to reach the top of the wall moving from a position hanging from a walltop or ledge to standing on the top or over to the other side equipmentedit a traceuse vaults an obstacle parkour is practiced without equipment of any kind practitioners normally train wearing light nonrestrictive casual clothing traceurs who wear gloves are very rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback light running shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged practitioners often use minimalist shoes sometimes as a progression to bare feet for better sensitivity and balance while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps barefoot training is done by some for movement competency without gear—as david belle noted bare feet are the best shoes various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and freerunning many other companies around the world have started offering clothing targeted at parkour risksedit trespassingedit traceurs in lisses repainting a wall repairing shoe scuff marks from parkour prohibition of parkour at the strasbourg museum of modern and contemporary art  parkour is not widely practiced in dedicated public facilities although efforts are being made to create places for it many traceurs do not like the idea as it is contradictory to parkours values of adaptation creativity and freedom traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms parks playgrounds offices and abandoned structures concerns have been raised regarding trespassing damage of property and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries many parkour organizations around the globe support the leave no trace initiative an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the seattle nonprofit parkour visions in  promoting safety respect for the spaces used and their other users and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found injuries and deathsedit concerns have been raised by law enforcement and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off high buildings they argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height with police forces calling for practitioners to stay off the rooftops some practitioners of parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged because parkour philosophy is about learning to control oneself in interaction with the environment leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour daniel ilabaca cofounder of the world parkour and freerunning federation said thinking youre going to fail at something gives you a higher risk of doing just that committing to something youre thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task there is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing compared to traditional sport techniques american traceur mark toorock said injuries are rare because participants rely not on what they cant control – wheels or the icy surfaces of snowboarding and skiing – but their own hands and feet but lanier johnson executive director of the american sports medicine institute noted that many of the injuries are not reported impactedit initially featured in films of french directorproducer luc besson parkour was first introduced to the british public by the bbc one station trailer rush hour it featured david belle leaping across londons rooftops from his office to home in an attempt to catch his favourite bbc programme and captured the imagination of many viewers especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used this advertisement along with others for cocacola nike and toyota had a largescale impact on public awareness of parkour the creation of parkour showreels and documentaries has always been crucial to the spread of parkour and is very common in the parkour community jump london is a  documentary explaining some of the background of parkour culminating with sébastien foucan johann vigroux and jérôme ben aoues demonstrating their parkour skills jump london changed the presence of parkour in the uk almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs it was followed by jump britain in  the australian version of  minutes broadcast a segment about parkour on  september  featuring foucan and stephane vigroux parkour is not defined by a set of rules or guidelines which has been particularly attractive to young people allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms it can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation for example in  the new york times published a short video featuring three young men from the gaza strip who were active members of the parkour community in  the bbc covered youth parkour participation in jammu and kashmir zahid shah founded the kashmir freerunning and parkour federation finding hope in the nonviolent discipline of parkour entertainmentedit parkour has become a popular element in action sequences with film directors hiring parkour practitioners as stunt performers the first director to do so was luc besson for the film taxi  in  followed by yamakasi in  featuring members of the original yamakasi group and its sequel les fils du vent in  also in  besson wrote district  another feature film involving advanced parkour chase sequences starring david belle and cyril raffaelli followed by the sequel district  ultimatum in  and remade in english as brick mansions in  in  the film casino royale featured sébastien foucan in a chase taking place early in the movie sparking renewed media interest in parkour along with the bourne ultimatum  casino royale is credited with starting a new wave of parkourinspired stunts in western film and television parkour was prominent in live free or die hard  again with stuntmanactor cyril raffaelli and prince of persia the sands of time  choreographed by david belle several films besides yamakasi are about thieves who use parkour such as breaking and entering  run  and tracers  the  film freerunner is about eight freerunners racing through a city for survival parkour also featured in dhoom   mtvs show ultimate parkour challenge premiered as a onehour special in october  starring the athletes of the world freerunning  parkour federation this was followed in may  with a sixepisode series of the same name the athletes were daniel ilabaca tim shieff ryan doyle michael turner oleg vorslav ben jenkin daniel arroyo pip andersen and king david the programme format was a twopart weekly competition in different southern california locations actor stephen amell learned parkour at tempest academy in preparation for his role as oliver queen in the television series arrow one of his costars on arrow caity lotz is also a practitioner modern video games frequently include aspects of parkour as major gameplay elements the assassins creed series makes heavy use of parkour movement called freerunning in the game the mirrors edge games are heavily inspired by parkour consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings rooftops and other obstacles brink introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic first person shooter prince of persia and dying light include a central parkour mechanic while crackdown and crackdown  include an emphasis on gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects tony hawks american wasteland allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard tron evolutions basic movements and combat were based on parkour and capoeira military trainingedit although parkour itself grew out of military obstaclecourse training it has become a separate discipline after the attention that parkour received following the  film casino royale military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from parkour into military training a physical trainer with the royal army corps trained with parkour practitioners with hopes of teaching some techniques to corps soldiers colorado parkour began a project to introduce elements from parkour into the us military and one san diego staff sergeant trained us marines in parkour derivative terminologies and disciplinesedit in september  the documentary jump london starring sébastien foucan was released in the documentary the term freerunning was used as an attempt to translate parkour in order to make it more appealing to the englishspeaking audience foucan decided to keep using the term freerunning to describe his discipline to distinguish it from david belles methods the remaining seven yamakasi members continued to use the term lart du déplacement also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour similar to sébastiens freerunning lart du déplacement was less about the hard discipline from the original yamakasi group more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible david belle kept the term parkour saying the group contributed to the development of it but that his father was the source of his motivation who had verbally communicated this method only to him both parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and selfexpression in freerunning the greater emphasis is on selfexpression although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners see alsoedit buildering dérive fell running freerunning plyometrics urban exploration

foucan david belle charles perriere descendant arts freerunning parkour french pronunciation ​paʁkuʁ is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training practitioners aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible parkour includes running climbing swinging vaulting jumping rolling quadrupedal movement and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation parkours development from military training gives it some aspects of a noncombative martial art parkour is an activity that can be practised alone or with others and is usually—but not exclusively—carried out in urban spaces parkour involves seeing ones environment in a new way and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around across through over and under its features parkour was developed in france primarily by raymond belle and further by his son david and the latters group of friends the selfstyled yamakasi during the late s the discipline was popularised in the late s and s through films documentaries and advertisements featuring the yamakasi contents  etymology  history  georges hébert  raymond and david belle  yamakasi  discipline  name and split  organisations  philosophy  competition  david belle  practice  movement  equipment  risks  trespassing  injuries and deaths  impact  entertainment  military training  derivative terminologies and disciplines  see also  references  sources etymologyedit the word parkour derives from parcours du combattant the classic obstacle course method of military training proposed by georges hébert raymond belle used the term le parcours to encompass all of his training including climbing jumping running balancing and the other methods he undertook in his personal athletic advancement his son david further developed his fathers methods and achieved success as a stuntman and one day on a film set showed his speed air man video to hubert koundé koundé suggested he change the c of parcours to a k because it was stronger and more dynamic and to remove the silent s for the same reason forming parkour a practitioner of parkour is called a traceur with the feminine form being traceuse they are nouns derived from the french verb tracer which normally means to trace as in tracing a path in reference to drawing the verb tracer used familiarly means to buck up the term traceur was originally the name of a parkour group headed by david belle which included sébastien foucan and stéphane vigroux a jam refers to a meeting of traceurs involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days often with people from different cities the first parkour jam was organised in july  by romain drouet with a dozen people including sébastien foucan and stéphane vigroux historyedit georges hébertedit in western europe a forerunner of parkour was french naval officer georges hébert who before world war i promoted athletic skill based on the models of indigenous tribes he had met in africa he noted their bodies were splendid flexible nimble skillful enduring and resistant but yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature his rescue efforts during the  eruption of mount pelée on saintpierre martinique reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism hébert became a physical education tutor at the college of reims in france hébert set up a méthode naturelle natural method session consisting of ten fundamental groups walking running jumping quadrupedal movement climbing balancing throwing lifting selfdefence swimming these were intended to develop the three main forces energetic willpower courage coolness and firmness moral benevolence assistance honour and honesty and physical muscles and breath during world war i and world war ii teaching continued to expand becoming the standard system of french military education and training inspired by hébert a swiss architect developed a parcours du combattant—military obstacle course—the first of the courses that are now standard in military training and which led to the development of civilian fitness trails and confidence courses raymond and david belleedit born in  in vietnam raymond belle was the son of a french physician and vietnamese mother during the first indochina war his father died and he was separated from his mother after which he was sent to a military orphanage in da lat at the age of  he took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never be a victim at night when everyone else was asleep he would be outside running or climbing trees he would use the military obstacle courses in secret and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance strength and flexibility doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood but also eventually to thrive after the battle of dien bien phu in  he returned to france and remained in military education until the age of  when he joined the paris fire brigade a french army unit david belle is considered the founder of parkour raymonds son david belle was born in  he experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs as he got older he started to read the newspaper clippingswhich that told of his fathers exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats through conversations with his father he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded indoor environment through conversations with his father david learned about this way of training that his father called parcours he heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things he learned that for his father training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about david realised that this was what he had been searching for and so he began training in the same way after a time he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training yamakasiedit main article yamakasi david initially trained on his own and after moving to lisses found other young men including his cousins who had similar desires and they began to train together the group eventually included david belle sébastien foucan châu belle dinh williams belle yann hnautra laurent piemontesi guylain nguba boyeke malik diouf and charles perrière disciplineedit the group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed examples included training without food or water or sleeping on the floor without a blanket to learn to endure the cold for example no one in the group was permitted to be late for training as it would hold back the whole group if any member completed a challenge everyone else had to do the same thing during their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative few excuses were allowed for instance if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump he had to do it anyway even if it meant doing the jump barefoot at the same time everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits respecting ones health and physical wellbeing was one of the foundations of the group if any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement the movement was deemed a failure a movement executed only once was not considered an achievement only with repetition was the challenge complete every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury if any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again humility was an important principle no traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement if any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again anyone who lied violated the principle of humility to join the group new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining despite the huge emphasis on the collective each traceur had to progress and develop independently — to create the means to be yourself — and there was a complete trust within the group every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour if a member violated the principles the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values name and splitedit in  david belles brother jeanfrançois invited the group to perform for the public in a firefighter show in paris for the performance the group named themselves yamakasi—congolese lingala ya makási meaning strong in ones person or strong man strong spirit sébastien foucan also invented a name for what they were doing lart du déplacement french for the art of movement the firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it such as their hard training and their values and ethics jeanfrançois also sent pictures and video of the group to a french tv programme and the popularity of parkour began to increase a series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group and they began to get more requests for performances during this time conflicting interests arose within the group sébastien foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more and david belle had the ambition to become an actor david and sébastien chose to leave the group and used the name parkour to describe their activity see § etymology above the seven remaining yamakasi members continued to use the term lart du déplacement  see § derivative terminologies and disciplines below organisationsedit national

nonpractitioners have never been exposed to belle says he trains people because he wants it to be alive and for people to use it châu belle explains it is a type of freedom or kind of expression that parkour is only a state of mind rather than a set of actions and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers traceur dylan baker says parkour also influences ones thought processes by enhancing selfconfidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles a study by neuropsychiatrie de lenfance et de ladolescence neuropsychiatry of childhood and adolescence in france found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do academic research on parkour has tended to describe how parkour provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space metropolitan life and embodiment a newer convention of parkour philosophy has been the idea of human reclamation andy tran of urban evolution clarifies it as a means of reclaiming what it means to be a human being it teaches us to move using the natural methods that we should have learned from infancy it teaches us to touch the world and interact with it instead of being sheltered by it another traceurwho writes it is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour competitionedit a campaign was started on  may  by the parkournet portal to preserve parkours philosophy against sports competition and rivalry in the words of erwan le corre competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd andor the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of selfdevelopment if parkour becomes a sport it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a noncompetitive activity and a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour but that wont hold its philosophical essence anymore red bulls sponsored athlete for parkour ryan doyle has said sometimes people ask who is the best at parkour and it is because they dont understand what parkour is who is the best is what you would say to a sport and parkour is not a sport it is an art its a discipline thats like saying whats the best song in the world this seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks as has been popularised by youtube and most media exposurecitation needed david belleedit in his  book parkour david belle stressed that the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements but rather the practitioners mentality and understanding of its principles when young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing i just take the tape and throw it away what im interested in is what the guys got in his head if he has selfconfidence if he masters the technique if he has understood the principles of parkour i just cant deal with guys who do parkour because they saw videos on the internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better further he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations and developing in their own way when a young person asks me can you show me how to do this i simply answer no i am going to show you how i do it then youll have to learn with your own technique your own way of moving your style your abilities and your limitations you are going to learn to be yourself not someone else the philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts in an interview with the new yorker david belle acknowledges the influence theres a quote by bruce lee thats my motto there are no limits there are plateaus but you must not stay there you must go beyond them a man must constantly exceed his level if youre not better than you were the day before then what are you doing—whats the point in an interview with the press belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors so many people try to train easy come do parkour its really cool but if tomorrow i made you do real training you would end up crying thats what you need to know you are going to cry you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before in his book belle also quotes his father raymond if two roads open up before you always take the most difficult one because you know you can travel the easy one belle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour saying precision is all about being measured and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master with parkour i often say once is never in other words someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything it can be luck or chance when you make a jump you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it its an unavoidable rule do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself when you come for training you have to train even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times to its founder parkour is a method of selfrefinement used for learning to control and focus oneself practiceedit movementedit play media a practitioner climbing a wall while there is no official list of moves in parkour the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others and there are a number of movements considered fundamental some examples of common movements are vaulting over obstacles jumping and landing accurately with the feet on small or narrow obstacles jumping and landing feetfirst on a vertical surface catching the horizontal top with the hands using a rolling motion to help absorb impacts from larger drops running towards a high wall and then jumping and pushing off the wall with a foot to reach the top of the wall moving from a position hanging from a walltop or ledge to standing on the top or over to the other side equipmentedit a traceuse vaults an obstacle parkour is practiced without equipment of any kind practitioners normally train wearing light nonrestrictive casual clothing traceurs who wear gloves are very rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback light running shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged practitioners often use minimalist shoes sometimes as a progression to bare feet for better sensitivity and balance while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps barefoot training is done by some for movement competency without gear—as david belle noted bare feet are the best shoes various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and freerunning many other companies around the world have started offering clothing targeted at parkour risksedit trespassingedit traceurs in lisses repainting a wall repairing shoe scuff marks from parkour prohibition of parkour at the strasbourg museum of modern and contemporary art  parkour is not widely practiced in dedicated public facilities although efforts are being made to create places for it many traceurs do not like the idea as it is contradictory to parkours values of adaptation creativity and freedom traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms parks playgrounds offices and abandoned structures concerns have been raised regarding trespassing damage of property and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries many parkour organizations around the globe support the leave no trace initiative an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the seattle nonprofit parkour visions in  promoting safety respect for the spaces used and their other users and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found injuries and deathsedit concerns have been raised by law enforcement and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off high buildings they argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height with police forces calling for practitioners to stay off the rooftops some practitioners of parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged because parkour philosophy is about learning to control oneself in interaction with the environment leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour daniel ilabaca cofounder of the world parkour and freerunning federation said thinking youre going to fail at something gives you a higher risk of doing just that committing to something youre thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task there is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing compared to traditional sport techniques american traceur mark toorock said injuries are rare because participants rely not on what they cant control – wheels or the icy surfaces of snowboarding and skiing – but their own hands and feet but lanier johnson executive director of the american sports medicine institute noted that many of the injuries are not reported impactedit initially featured in films of french directorproducer luc besson parkour was first introduced to the british public by the bbc one station trailer rush hour it featured david belle leaping across londons rooftops from his office to home in an attempt to catch his favourite bbc programme and captured the imagination of many viewers especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used this advertisement along with others for cocacola nike and toyota had a largescale impact on public awareness of parkour the creation of parkour showreels and documentaries has always been crucial to the spread of parkour and is very common in the parkour community jump london is a  documentary explaining some of the background of parkour culminating with sébastien foucan johann vigroux and jérôme ben aoues demonstrating their parkour skills jump london changed the presence of parkour in the uk almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs it was followed by jump britain in  the australian version of  minutes broadcast a segment about parkour on  september  featuring foucan and stephane vigroux parkour is not defined by a set of rules or guidelines which has been particularly attractive to young people allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms it can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation for example in  the new york times published a short video featuring three young men from the gaza strip who were active members of the parkour community in  the bbc covered youth parkour participation in jammu and kashmir zahid shah founded the kashmir freerunning and parkour federation finding hope in the nonviolent discipline of parkour entertainmentedit parkour has become a popular element in action sequences with film directors hiring parkour practitioners as stunt performers the first director to do so was luc besson for the film taxi  in  followed by yamakasi in  featuring members of the original yamakasi group and its sequel les fils du vent in  also in  besson wrote district  another feature film involving advanced parkour chase sequences starring david belle and cyril raffaelli followed by the sequel district  ultimatum in  and remade in english as brick mansions in  in  the film casino royale featured sébastien foucan in a chase taking place early in the movie sparking renewed media interest in parkour along with the bourne ultimatum  casino royale is credited with starting a new wave of parkourinspired stunts in western film and television parkour was prominent in live free or die hard  again with stuntmanactor cyril raffaelli and prince of persia the sands of time  choreographed by david belle several films besides yamakasi are about thieves who use parkour such as breaking and entering  run  and tracers  the  film freerunner is about eight freerunners racing through a city for survival parkour also featured in dhoom   mtvs show ultimate parkour challenge premiered as a onehour special in october  starring the athletes of the world freerunning  parkour federation this was followed in may  with a sixepisode series of the same name the athletes were daniel ilabaca tim shieff ryan doyle michael turner oleg vorslav ben jenkin daniel arroyo pip andersen and king david the programme format was a twopart weekly competition in different southern california locations actor stephen amell learned parkour at tempest academy in preparation for his role as oliver queen in the television series arrow one of his costars on arrow caity lotz is also a practitioner modern video games frequently include aspects of parkour as major gameplay elements the assassins creed series makes heavy use of parkour movement called freerunning in the game the mirrors edge games are heavily inspired by parkour consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings rooftops and other obstacles brink introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic first person shooter prince of persia and dying light include a central parkour mechanic while crackdown and crackdown  include an emphasis on gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects tony hawks american wasteland allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard tron evolutions basic movements and combat were based on parkour and capoeira military trainingedit although parkour itself grew out of military obstaclecourse training it has become a separate discipline after the attention that parkour received following the  film casino royale military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from parkour into military training a physical trainer with the royal army corps trained with parkour practitioners with hopes of teaching some techniques to corps soldiers colorado parkour began a project to introduce elements from parkour into the us military and one san diego staff sergeant trained us marines in parkour derivative terminologies and disciplinesedit in september  the documentary jump london starring sébastien foucan was released in the documentary the term freerunning was used as an attempt to translate parkour in order to make it more appealing to the englishspeaking audience foucan decided to keep using the term freerunning to describe his discipline to distinguish it from david belles methods the remaining seven yamakasi members continued to use the term lart du déplacement also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour similar to sébastiens freerunning lart du déplacement was less about the hard discipline from the original yamakasi group more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible david belle kept the term parkour saying the group contributed to the development of it but that his father was the source of his motivation who had verbally communicated this method only to him both parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and selfexpression in freerunning the greater emphasis is on selfexpression although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners see alsoedit buildering dérive fell running freerunning plyometrics urban exploration qinggong referencesedit  a b

foucan david belle charles perriere descendant arts freerunning parkour french pronunciation ​paʁkuʁ is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training practitioners aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible parkour includes running climbing swinging vaulting jumping rolling quadrupedal movement and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation parkours development from military training gives it some aspects of a noncombative martial art parkour is an activity that can be practised alone or with others and is usually—but not exclusively—carried out in urban spaces parkour involves seeing ones environment in a new way and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around across through over and under its features parkour was developed in france primarily by raymond belle and further by his son david and the latters group of friends the selfstyled yamakasi during the late s the discipline was popularised in the late s and s through films documentaries and advertisements featuring the yamakasi contents  etymology

and deaths  impact  entertainment  military training  derivative terminologies and disciplines  see also  references  sources etymologyedit the word parkour derives from parcours du combattant the classic obstacle course method of military training proposed by georges hébert raymond belle used the term le parcours to encompass all of his training including climbing jumping running balancing and the other methods he undertook in his personal athletic advancement his son david further developed his fathers methods and achieved success as a stuntman and one day on a film set showed his speed air man video to hubert koundé koundé suggested he change the c of parcours to a k because it was stronger and more dynamic and to remove the silent s for the same reason forming parkour a practitioner of parkour is called a traceur with the feminine form being traceuse they are nouns derived from the french verb tracer which normally means to trace as in tracing a path in reference to drawing the verb tracer used familiarly means to buck up the term traceur was originally the name of a parkour group headed by david belle which included sébastien foucan and stéphane vigroux a jam refers to a meeting of traceurs involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days often with people from different cities the first parkour jam was organised in july  by romain drouet with a dozen people including sébastien foucan and stéphane vigroux historyedit georges hébertedit in western europe a forerunner of parkour was french naval officer georges hébert who before world war i promoted athletic skill based on the models of indigenous tribes he had met in africa he noted their bodies were splendid flexible nimble skillful enduring and resistant but yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature his rescue efforts during the  eruption of mount pelée on saintpierre martinique reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism hébert became a physical education tutor at the college of reims in france hébert set up a méthode naturelle natural method session consisting of ten fundamental groups walking running jumping quadrupedal movement climbing balancing throwing lifting selfdefence swimming these were intended to develop the three main forces energetic willpower courage coolness and firmness moral benevolence assistance honour and honesty and physical muscles and breath during world war i and world war ii teaching continued to expand becoming the standard system of french military education and training inspired by hébert a swiss architect developed a parcours du combattant—military obstacle course—the first of the courses that are now standard in military training and which led to the development of civilian fitness trails and confidence courses raymond and david belleedit born in  in vietnam raymond belle was the son of a french physician and vietnamese mother during the first indochina war his father died and he was separated from his mother after which he was sent to a military orphanage in da lat at the age of  he took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never be a victim at night when everyone else was asleep he would be outside running or climbing trees he would use the military obstacle courses in secret and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance strength and flexibility doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood but also eventually to thrive after the battle of dien bien phu in  he returned to france and remained in military education until the age of  when he joined the paris fire brigade a french army unit david belle is considered the founder of parkour raymonds son david belle was born in  he experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs as he got older he started to read the newspaper clippingswhich that told of his fathers exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats through conversations with his father he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded indoor environment through conversations with his father david learned about this way of training that his father called parcours he heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things he learned that for his father training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about david realised that this was what he had been searching for and so he began training in the same way after a time he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training yamakasiedit main article yamakasi david initially trained on his own and after moving to lisses found other young men including his cousins who had similar desires and they began to train together the group eventually included david belle sébastien foucan châu belle dinh williams belle yann hnautra laurent piemontesi guylain nguba boyeke malik diouf and charles perrière disciplineedit the group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed examples included training without food or water or sleeping on the floor without a blanket to learn to endure the cold for example no one in the group was permitted to be late for training as it would hold back the whole group if any member completed a challenge everyone else had to do the same thing during their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative few excuses were allowed for instance if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump he had to do it anyway even if it meant doing the jump barefoot at the same time everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits respecting ones health and physical wellbeing was one of the foundations of the group if any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement the movement was deemed a failure a movement executed only once was not considered an achievement only with repetition was the challenge complete every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury if any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again humility was an important principle no traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement if any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again anyone who lied violated the principle of humility to join the group new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining despite the huge emphasis on the collective each traceur had to progress and develop independently — to create the means to be yourself — and there was a complete trust within the group every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour if a member violated the principles the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values name and splitedit in  david belles brother jeanfrançois invited the group to perform for the public in a firefighter show in paris for the performance the group named themselves yamakasi—congolese lingala ya makási meaning strong in ones person or strong man strong spirit sébastien foucan also invented a name for what they were doing lart du déplacement french for the art of movement the firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it such as their hard training and their values and ethics jeanfrançois also sent pictures and video of the group to a french tv programme and the popularity of parkour began to increase a series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group and they began to get more requests for performances during this time conflicting interests arose within the group sébastien foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more and david belle had the ambition to become an actor david and sébastien chose to leave the group and used the name parkour to describe their activity see § etymology above the seven remaining yamakasi members continued to use the term lart du déplacement  see § derivative terminologies and disciplines below organisationsedit national parkour organisations include apex school of movement united states fédération de parkour france jump freerun netherlands parkour uk parkour and tricking sweden australian parkour association and new zealand parkour association international parkout organisations include the mouvement international du parkour freerunning et lart du déplacement the fédération internationale des arts du déplacement and the world freerunning and parkour federation philosophyedit according to williams belle the philosophies and theories behind parkour are an integral aspect of the art one that many nonpractitioners have never been exposed to belle says he trains people because he wants it to be alive and for people to use it châu belle explains it is a type of freedom or kind of expression that parkour is only a state of mind rather than a set of actions and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers traceur dylan baker says parkour also influences ones thought processes by enhancing selfconfidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles a study by neuropsychiatrie de lenfance et de ladolescence neuropsychiatry of childhood and adolescence in france found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do academic research on parkour has tended to describe how parkour provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space metropolitan life and embodiment a newer convention of parkour philosophy has been the idea of human reclamation andy tran of urban evolution clarifies it as a means of reclaiming what it means to be a human being it teaches us to move using the natural methods that we should have learned from infancy it teaches us to touch the world and interact with it instead of being sheltered by it another traceurwho writes it is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour competitionedit a campaign was started on  may  by the parkournet portal to preserve parkours philosophy against sports competition and rivalry in the words of erwan le corre competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd andor the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of selfdevelopment if parkour becomes a sport it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a noncompetitive activity and a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour but that wont hold its philosophical essence anymore red bulls sponsored athlete for parkour ryan doyle has said sometimes people ask who is the best at parkour and it is because they dont understand what parkour is who is the best is what you would say to a sport and parkour is not a sport it is an art its a discipline thats like saying whats the best song in the world this seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks as has been popularised by youtube and most media exposurecitation needed david belleedit in his  book parkour david belle stressed that the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements but rather the practitioners mentality and understanding of its principles when young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing i just take the tape and throw it away what im interested in is what the guys got in his head if he has selfconfidence if he masters the technique if he has understood the principles of parkour i just cant deal with guys who do parkour because they saw videos on the internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better further he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations and developing in their own way when a young person asks me can you show me how to do this i simply answer no i am going to show you how i do it then youll have to learn with your own technique your own way of moving your style your abilities and your limitations you are going to learn to be yourself not someone else the philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts in an interview with the new yorker david belle acknowledges the influence theres a quote by bruce lee thats my motto there are no limits there are plateaus but you must not stay there you must go beyond them a man must constantly exceed his level if youre not better than you were the day before then what are you doing—whats the point in an interview with the press belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors so many people try to train easy come do parkour its really cool but if tomorrow i made you do real training you would end up crying thats what you need to know you are going to cry you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before in his book belle also quotes his father raymond if two roads open up before you always take the most difficult one because you know you can travel the easy one belle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour saying precision is all about being measured and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master with parkour i often say once is never in other words someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything it can be luck or chance when you make a jump you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it its an unavoidable rule do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself when you come for training you have to train even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times to its founder parkour is a method of selfrefinement used for learning to control and focus oneself practiceedit movementedit play media a practitioner climbing a wall while there is no official list of moves in parkour the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others and there are a number of movements considered fundamental some examples of common movements are vaulting over obstacles jumping and landing accurately with the feet on small or narrow obstacles jumping and landing feetfirst on a vertical surface catching the horizontal top with the hands using a rolling motion to help absorb impacts from larger drops running towards a high wall and then jumping and pushing off the wall with a foot to reach the top of the wall moving from a position hanging from a walltop or ledge to standing on the top or over to the other side equipmentedit a traceuse vaults an obstacle parkour is practiced without equipment of any kind practitioners normally train wearing light nonrestrictive casual clothing traceurs who wear gloves are very rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback light running shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged practitioners often use minimalist shoes sometimes as a progression to bare feet for better sensitivity and balance while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps barefoot training is done by some for movement competency without gear—as david belle noted bare feet are the best shoes various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and freerunning many other companies around the world have started offering clothing targeted at parkour risksedit trespassingedit traceurs in lisses repainting a wall repairing shoe scuff marks from parkour prohibition of parkour at the strasbourg museum of modern and contemporary art  parkour is not widely practiced in dedicated public facilities although efforts are being made to create places for it many traceurs do not like the idea as it is contradictory to parkours values of adaptation creativity and freedom traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms parks playgrounds offices and abandoned structures concerns have been raised regarding trespassing damage of property and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries many parkour organizations around the globe support the leave no trace initiative an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the seattle nonprofit parkour visions in  promoting safety respect for the spaces used and their other users and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found injuries and deathsedit concerns have been raised by law enforcement and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off high buildings they argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height with police forces calling for practitioners to stay off the rooftops some practitioners of parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged because parkour philosophy is about learning to control oneself in interaction with the environment leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour daniel ilabaca cofounder of the world parkour and freerunning federation said thinking youre going to fail at something gives you a higher risk of doing just that committing to something youre thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task there is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing compared to traditional sport techniques american traceur mark toorock said injuries are rare because participants rely not on what they cant control – wheels or the icy surfaces of snowboarding and skiing – but their own hands and feet but lanier johnson executive director of the american sports medicine institute noted that many of the injuries are not reported impactedit initially featured in films of french directorproducer luc besson parkour was first introduced to the british public by the bbc one station trailer rush hour it featured david belle leaping across londons rooftops from his office to home in an attempt to catch his favourite bbc programme and captured the imagination of many viewers especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used this advertisement along with others for cocacola nike and toyota had a largescale impact on public awareness of parkour the creation of parkour showreels and documentaries has always been crucial to the spread of parkour and is very common in the parkour community jump london is a  documentary explaining some of the background of parkour culminating with sébastien foucan johann vigroux and jérôme ben aoues demonstrating their parkour skills jump london changed the presence of parkour in the uk almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs it was followed by jump britain in  the australian version of  minutes broadcast a segment about parkour on  september  featuring foucan and stephane vigroux parkour is not defined by a set of rules or guidelines which has been particularly attractive to young people allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms it can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation for example in  the new york times published a short video featuring three young men from the gaza strip who were active members of the parkour community in  the bbc covered youth parkour participation in jammu and kashmir zahid shah founded the kashmir freerunning and parkour federation finding hope in the nonviolent discipline of parkour entertainmentedit parkour has become a popular element in action sequences with film directors hiring parkour practitioners as stunt performers the first director to do so was luc besson for the film taxi  in  followed by yamakasi in  featuring members of the original yamakasi group and its sequel les fils du vent in  also in  besson wrote district  another feature film involving advanced parkour chase sequences starring david belle and cyril raffaelli followed by the sequel district  ultimatum in  and remade in english as brick mansions in  in  the film casino royale featured sébastien foucan in a chase taking place early in the movie sparking renewed media interest in parkour along with the bourne ultimatum  casino royale is credited with starting a new wave of parkourinspired stunts in western film and television parkour was prominent in live free or die hard  again with stuntmanactor cyril raffaelli and prince of persia the sands of time  choreographed by david belle several films besides yamakasi are about thieves who use parkour such as breaking and entering  run  and tracers  the  film freerunner is about eight freerunners racing through a city for survival parkour also featured in dhoom   mtvs show ultimate parkour challenge premiered as a onehour special in october  starring the athletes of the world freerunning  parkour federation this was followed in may  with a sixepisode series of the same name the athletes were daniel ilabaca tim shieff ryan doyle michael turner oleg vorslav ben jenkin daniel arroyo pip andersen and king david the programme format was a twopart weekly competition in different southern california locations actor stephen amell learned parkour at tempest academy in preparation for his role as oliver queen in the television series arrow one of his costars on arrow caity lotz is also a practitioner modern video games frequently include aspects of parkour as major gameplay elements the assassins creed series makes heavy use of parkour movement called freerunning in the game the mirrors edge games are heavily inspired by parkour consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings rooftops and other obstacles brink introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic first person shooter prince of persia and dying light include a central parkour mechanic while crackdown and crackdown  include an emphasis on gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects tony hawks american wasteland allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard tron evolutions basic movements and combat were based on parkour and capoeira military trainingedit although parkour itself grew out of military obstaclecourse training it has become a separate discipline after the attention that parkour received following the  film casino royale military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from parkour into military training a physical trainer with the royal army corps trained with parkour practitioners with hopes of teaching some techniques to corps soldiers colorado parkour began a project to introduce elements from parkour into the us military and one san diego staff sergeant trained us marines in parkour derivative terminologies and disciplinesedit in september  the documentary jump london starring sébastien foucan was released in the documentary the term freerunning was used as an attempt to translate parkour in order to make it more appealing to the englishspeaking audience foucan decided to keep using the term freerunning to describe his discipline to distinguish it from david belles methods the remaining seven yamakasi members continued to use the term lart du déplacement also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour similar to sébastiens freerunning lart du déplacement was less about the hard discipline from the original yamakasi group more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible david belle kept the term parkour saying the group contributed to the development of it but that his father was the source of his motivation who had verbally communicated this method only to him both parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and selfexpression in freerunning the greater emphasis is on selfexpression although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners see alsoedit buildering dérive fell running freerunning plyometrics urban exploration qinggong referencesedit  a b

foucan david belle charles perriere descendant arts freerunning parkour french pronunciation ​paʁkuʁ is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training practitioners aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible parkour includes running climbing swinging vaulting jumping rolling quadrupedal movement and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation parkours development from military training gives it some aspects of a noncombative martial art parkour is an activity that can be practised alone or with others and is usually—but not exclusively—carried out in urban spaces parkour involves seeing ones environment in a new way and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around across through over and under its features parkour was developed in france primarily by raymond belle and further by his son david and the latters group of friends the selfstyled yamakasi during the late s the discipline was popularised in the late s and s through films documentaries and advertisements featuring the yamakasi contents  etymology

and deaths  impact  entertainment  military training  derivative terminologies and disciplines  see also  references  sources etymologyedit the word parkour derives from parcours du combattant the classic obstacle course method of military training proposed by georges hébert raymond belle used the term le parcours to encompass all of his training including climbing jumping running balancing and the other methods he undertook in his personal athletic advancement his son david further developed his fathers methods and achieved success as a stuntman and one day on a film set showed his speed air man video to hubert koundé koundé suggested he change the c of parcours to a k because it was stronger and more dynamic and to remove the silent s for the same reason forming parkour a practitioner of parkour is called a traceur with the feminine form being traceuse they are nouns derived from the french verb tracer which normally means to trace as in tracing a path in reference to drawing the verb tracer used familiarly means to buck up the term traceur was originally the name of a parkour group headed by david belle which included sébastien foucan and stéphane vigroux a jam refers to a meeting of traceurs involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days often with people from different cities the first parkour jam was organised in july  by romain drouet with a dozen people including sébastien foucan and stéphane vigroux historyedit georges hébertedit in western europe a forerunner of parkour was french naval officer georges hébert who before world war i promoted athletic skill based on the models of indigenous tribes he had met in africa he noted their bodies were splendid flexible nimble skillful enduring and resistant but yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature his rescue efforts during the  eruption of mount pelée on saintpierre martinique reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism hébert became a physical education tutor at the college of reims in france hébert set up a méthode naturelle natural method session consisting of ten fundamental groups walking running jumping quadrupedal movement climbing balancing throwing lifting selfdefence swimming these were intended to develop the three main forces energetic willpower courage coolness and firmness moral benevolence assistance honour and honesty and physical muscles and breath during world war i and world war ii teaching continued to expand becoming the standard system of french military education and training inspired by hébert a swiss architect developed a parcours du combattant—military obstacle course—the first of the courses that are now standard in military training and which led to the development of civilian fitness trails and confidence courses raymond and david belleedit born in  in vietnam raymond belle was the son of a french physician and vietnamese mother during the first indochina war his father died and he was separated from his mother after which he was sent to a military orphanage in da lat at the age of  he took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never be a victim at night when everyone else was asleep he would be outside running or climbing trees he would use the military obstacle courses in secret and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance strength and flexibility doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood but also eventually to thrive after the battle of dien bien phu in  he returned to france and remained in military education until the age of  when he joined the paris fire brigade a french army unit david belle is considered the founder of parkour raymonds son david belle was born in  he experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs as he got older he started to read the newspaper clippingswhich that told of his fathers exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats through conversations with his father he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded indoor environment through conversations with his father david learned about this way of training that his father called parcours he heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things he learned that for his father training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about david realised that this was what he had been searching for and so he began training in the same way after a time he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training yamakasiedit main article yamakasi david initially trained on his own and after moving to lisses found other young men including his cousins who had similar desires and they began to train together the group eventually included david belle sébastien foucan châu belle dinh williams belle yann hnautra laurent piemontesi guylain nguba boyeke malik diouf and charles perrière disciplineedit the group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed examples included training without food or water or sleeping on the floor without a blanket to learn to endure the cold for example no one in the group was permitted to be late for training as it would hold back the whole group if any member completed a challenge everyone else had to do the same thing during their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative few excuses were allowed for instance if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump he had to do it anyway even if it meant doing the jump barefoot at the same time everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits respecting ones health and physical wellbeing was one of the foundations of the group if any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement the movement was deemed a failure a movement executed only once was not considered an achievement only with repetition was the challenge complete every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury if any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again humility was an important principle no traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement if any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again anyone who lied violated the principle of humility to join the group new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining despite the huge emphasis on the collective each traceur had to progress and develop independently — to create the means to be yourself — and there was a complete trust within the group every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour if a member violated the principles the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values name and splitedit in  david belles brother jeanfrançois invited the group to perform for the public in a firefighter show in paris for the performance the group named themselves yamakasi—congolese lingala ya makási meaning strong in ones person or strong man strong spirit sébastien foucan also invented a name for what they were doing lart du déplacement french for the art of movement the firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it such as their hard training and their values and ethics jeanfrançois also sent pictures and video of the group to a french tv programme and the popularity of parkour began to increase a series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group and they began to get more requests for performances during this time conflicting interests arose within the group sébastien foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more and david belle had the ambition to become an actor david and sébastien chose to leave the group and used the name parkour to describe their activity see § etymology above the seven remaining yamakasi members continued to use the term lart du déplacement  see § derivative terminologies and disciplines below organisationsedit national parkour organisations include apex school of movement united states fédération de parkour france jump freerun netherlands parkour uk parkour and tricking sweden australian parkour association and new zealand parkour association international parkout organisations include the mouvement international du parkour freerunning et lart du déplacement the fédération internationale des arts du déplacement and the world freerunning and parkour federation philosophyedit according to williams belle the philosophies and theories behind parkour are an integral aspect of the art one that many nonpractitioners have never been exposed to belle says he trains people because he wants it to be alive and for people to use it châu belle explains it is a type of freedom or kind of expression that parkour is only a state of mind rather than a set of actions and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers traceur dylan baker says parkour also influences ones thought processes by enhancing selfconfidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles a study by neuropsychiatrie de lenfance et de ladolescence neuropsychiatry of childhood and adolescence in france found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do academic research on parkour has tended to describe how parkour provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space metropolitan life and embodiment a newer convention of parkour philosophy has been the idea of human reclamation andy tran of urban evolution clarifies it as a means of reclaiming what it means to be a human being it teaches us to move using the natural methods that we should have learned from infancy it teaches us to touch the world and interact with it instead of being sheltered by it another traceurwho writes it is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour competitionedit a campaign was started on  may  by the parkournet portal to preserve parkours philosophy against sports competition and rivalry in the words of erwan le corre competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd andor the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of selfdevelopment if parkour becomes a sport it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a noncompetitive activity and a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour but that wont hold its philosophical essence anymore red bulls sponsored athlete for parkour ryan doyle has said sometimes people ask who is the best at parkour and it is because they dont understand what parkour is who is the best is what you would say to a sport and parkour is not a sport it is an art its a discipline thats like saying whats the best song in the world this seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks as has been popularised by youtube and most media exposurecitation needed david belleedit in his  book parkour david belle stressed that the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements but rather the practitioners mentality and understanding of its principles when young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing i just take the tape and throw it away what im interested in is what the guys got in his head if he has selfconfidence if he masters the technique if he has understood the principles of parkour i just cant deal with guys who do parkour because they saw videos on the internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better further he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations and developing in their own way when a young person asks me can you show me how to do this i simply answer no i am going to show you how i do it then youll have to learn with your own technique your own way of moving your style your abilities and your limitations you are going to learn to be yourself not someone else the philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts in an interview with the new yorker david belle acknowledges the influence theres a quote by bruce lee thats my motto there are no limits there are plateaus but you must not stay there you must go beyond them a man must constantly exceed his level if youre not better than you were the day before then what are you doing—whats the point in an interview with the press belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors so many people try to train easy come do parkour its really cool but if tomorrow i made you do real training you would end up crying thats what you need to know you are going to cry you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before in his book belle also quotes his father raymond if two roads open up before you always take the most difficult one because you know you can travel the easy one belle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour saying precision is all about being measured and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master with parkour i often say once is never in other words someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything it can be luck or chance when you make a jump you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it its an unavoidable rule do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself when you come for training you have to train even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times to its founder parkour is a method of selfrefinement used for learning to control and focus oneself practiceedit movementedit play media a practitioner climbing a wall while there is no official list of moves in parkour the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others and there are a number of movements considered fundamental some examples of common movements are vaulting over obstacles jumping and landing accurately with the feet on small or narrow obstacles jumping and landing feetfirst on a vertical surface catching the horizontal top with the hands using a rolling motion to help absorb impacts from larger drops running towards a high wall and then jumping and pushing off the wall with a foot to reach the top of the wall moving from a position hanging from a walltop or ledge to standing on the top or over to the other side equipmentedit a traceuse vaults an obstacle parkour is practiced without equipment of any kind practitioners normally train wearing light nonrestrictive casual clothing traceurs who wear gloves are very rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback light running shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged practitioners often use minimalist shoes sometimes as a progression to bare feet for better sensitivity and balance while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps barefoot training is done by some for movement competency without gear—as david belle noted bare feet are the best shoes various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and freerunning many other companies around the world have started offering clothing targeted at parkour risksedit trespassingedit traceurs in lisses repainting a wall repairing shoe scuff marks from parkour prohibition of parkour at the strasbourg museum of modern and contemporary art  parkour is not widely practiced in dedicated public facilities although efforts are being made to create places for it many traceurs do not like the idea as it is contradictory to parkours values of adaptation creativity and freedom traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms parks playgrounds offices and abandoned structures concerns have been raised regarding trespassing damage of property and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries many parkour organizations around the globe support the leave no trace initiative an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the seattle nonprofit parkour visions in  promoting safety respect for the spaces used and their other users and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found injuries and deathsedit concerns have been raised by law enforcement and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off high buildings they argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height with police forces calling for practitioners to stay off the rooftops some practitioners of parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged because parkour philosophy is about learning to control oneself in interaction with the environment leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour daniel ilabaca cofounder of the world parkour and freerunning federation said thinking youre going to fail at something gives you a higher risk of doing just that committing to something youre thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task there is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing compared to traditional sport techniques american traceur mark toorock said injuries are rare because participants rely not on what they cant control – wheels or the icy surfaces of snowboarding and skiing – but their own hands and feet but lanier johnson executive director of the american sports medicine institute noted that many of the injuries are not reported impactedit initially featured in films of french directorproducer luc besson parkour was first introduced to the british public by the bbc one station trailer rush hour it featured david belle leaping across londons rooftops from his office to home in an attempt to catch his favourite bbc programme and captured the imagination of many viewers especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used this advertisement along with others for cocacola nike and toyota had a largescale impact on public awareness of parkour the creation of parkour showreels and documentaries has always been crucial to the spread of parkour and is very common in the parkour community jump london is a  documentary explaining some of the background of parkour culminating with sébastien foucan johann vigroux and jérôme ben aoues demonstrating their parkour skills jump london changed the presence of parkour in the uk almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs it was followed by jump britain in  the australian version of  minutes broadcast a segment about parkour on  september  featuring foucan and stephane vigroux parkour is not defined by a set of rules or guidelines which has been particularly attractive to young people allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms it can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation for example in  the new york times published a short video featuring three young men from the gaza strip who were active members of the parkour community in  the bbc covered youth parkour participation in jammu and kashmir zahid shah founded the kashmir freerunning and parkour federation finding hope in the nonviolent discipline of parkour entertainmentedit parkour has become a popular element in action sequences with film directors hiring parkour practitioners as stunt performers the first director to do so was luc besson for the film taxi  in  followed by yamakasi in  featuring members of the original yamakasi group and its sequel les fils du vent in  also in  besson wrote district  another feature film involving advanced parkour chase sequences starring david belle and cyril raffaelli followed by the sequel district  ultimatum in  and remade in english as brick mansions in  in  the film casino royale featured sébastien foucan in a chase taking place early in the movie sparking renewed media interest in parkour along with the bourne ultimatum  casino royale is credited with starting a new wave of parkourinspired stunts in western film and television parkour was prominent in live free or die hard  again with stuntmanactor cyril raffaelli and prince of persia the sands of time  choreographed by david belle several films besides yamakasi are about thieves who use parkour such as breaking and entering  run  and tracers  the  film freerunner is about eight freerunners racing through a city for survival parkour also featured in dhoom   mtvs show ultimate parkour challenge premiered as a onehour special in october  starring the athletes of the world freerunning  parkour federation this was followed in may  with a sixepisode series of the same name the athletes were daniel ilabaca tim shieff ryan doyle michael turner oleg vorslav ben jenkin daniel arroyo pip andersen and king david the programme format was a twopart weekly competition in different southern california locations actor stephen amell learned parkour at tempest academy in preparation for his role as oliver queen in the television series arrow one of his costars on arrow caity lotz is also a practitioner modern video games frequently include aspects of parkour as major gameplay elements the assassins creed series makes heavy use of parkour movement called freerunning in the game the mirrors edge games are heavily inspired by parkour consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings rooftops and other obstacles brink introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic first person shooter prince of persia and dying light include a central parkour mechanic while crackdown and crackdown  include an emphasis on gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects tony hawks american wasteland allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard tron evolutions basic movements and combat were based on parkour and capoeira military trainingedit although parkour itself grew out of military obstaclecourse training it has become a separate discipline after the attention that parkour received following the  film casino royale military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from parkour into military training a physical trainer with the royal army corps trained with parkour practitioners with hopes of teaching some techniques to corps soldiers colorado parkour began a project to introduce elements from parkour into the us military and one san diego staff sergeant trained us marines in parkour derivative terminologies and disciplinesedit in september  the documentary jump london starring sébastien foucan was released in the documentary the term freerunning was used as an attempt to translate parkour in order to make it more appealing to the englishspeaking audience foucan decided to keep using the term freerunning to describe his discipline to distinguish it from david belles methods the remaining seven yamakasi members continued to use the term lart du déplacement also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour similar to sébastiens freerunning lart du déplacement was less about the hard discipline from the original yamakasi group more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible david belle kept the term parkour saying the group contributed to the development of it but that his father was the source of his motivation who had verbally communicated this method only to him both parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and selfexpression in freerunning the greater emphasis is on selfexpression although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners see alsoedit buildering dérive fell running freerunning plyometrics urban exploration qinggong referencesedit  a b

foucan david belle charles perriere descendant arts freerunning parkour french pronunciation ​paʁkuʁ is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training practitioners aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible parkour includes running climbing swinging vaulting jumping rolling quadrupedal movement and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation parkours development from military training gives it some aspects of a noncombative martial art parkour is an activity that can be practised alone or with others and is usually—but not exclusively—carried out in urban spaces parkour involves seeing ones environment in a new way and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around across through over and under its features parkour was developed in france primarily by raymond belle and further by his son david and the latters group of friends the selfstyled yamakasi during the late s the discipline was popularised in the late s and s through films documentaries and advertisements featuring the yamakasi contents  etymology

classic obstacle course method of military training proposed by georges hébert raymond belle used the term le parcours to encompass all of his training including climbing jumping running balancing and the other methods he undertook in his personal athletic advancement his son david further developed his fathers methods and achieved success as a stuntman and one day on a film set showed his speed air man video to hubert koundé koundé suggested he change the c of parcours to a k because it was stronger and more dynamic and to remove the silent s for the same reason forming parkour a practitioner of parkour is called a traceur with the feminine form being traceuse they are nouns derived from the french verb tracer which normally means to trace as in tracing a path in reference to drawing the verb tracer used familiarly means to buck up the term traceur was originally the name of a parkour group headed by david belle which included sébastien foucan and stéphane vigroux a jam refers to a meeting of traceurs involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days often with people from different cities the first parkour jam was organised in july  by romain drouet with a dozen people including sébastien foucan and stéphane vigroux historyedit georges hébertedit in western europe a forerunner of parkour was french naval officer georges hébert who before world war i promoted athletic skill based on the models of indigenous tribes he had met in africa he noted their bodies were splendid flexible nimble skillful enduring and resistant but yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature his rescue efforts during the  eruption of mount pelée on saintpierre martinique reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism hébert became a physical education tutor at the college of reims in france hébert set up a méthode naturelle natural method session consisting of ten fundamental groups walking running jumping quadrupedal movement climbing balancing throwing lifting selfdefence swimming these were intended to develop the three main forces energetic willpower courage coolness and firmness moral benevolence assistance honour and honesty and physical muscles and breath during world war i and world war ii teaching continued to expand becoming the standard system of french military education and training inspired by hébert a swiss architect developed a parcours du combattant—military obstacle course—the first of the courses that are now standard in military training and which led to the development of civilian fitness trails and confidence courses raymond and david belleedit born in  in vietnam raymond belle was the son of a french physician and vietnamese mother during the first indochina war his father died and he was separated from his mother after which he was sent to a military orphanage in da lat at the age of  he took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never be a victim at night when everyone else was asleep he would be outside running or climbing trees he would use the military obstacle courses in secret and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance strength and flexibility doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood but also eventually to thrive after the battle of dien bien phu in  he returned to france and remained in military education until the age of  when he joined the paris fire brigade a french army unit david belle is considered the founder of parkour raymonds son david belle was born in  he experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs as he got older he started to read the newspaper clippingswhich that told of his fathers exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats through conversations with his father he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded indoor environment through conversations with his father david learned about this way of training that his father called parcours he heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things he learned that for his father training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about david realised that this was what he had been searching for and so he began training in the same way after a time he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training yamakasiedit main article yamakasi david initially trained on his own and after moving to lisses found other young men including his cousins who had similar desires and they began to train together the group eventually included david belle sébastien foucan châu belle dinh williams belle yann hnautra laurent piemontesi guylain nguba boyeke malik diouf and charles perrière disciplineedit the group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed examples included training without food or water or sleeping on the floor without a blanket to learn to endure the cold for example no one in the group was permitted to be late for training as it would hold back the whole group if any member completed a challenge everyone else had to do the same thing during their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative few excuses were allowed for instance if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump he had to do it anyway even if it meant doing the jump barefoot at the same time everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits respecting ones health and physical wellbeing was one of the foundations of the group if any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement the movement was deemed a failure a movement executed only once was not considered an achievement only with repetition was the challenge complete every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury if any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again humility was an important principle no traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement if any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again anyone who lied violated the principle of humility to join the group new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining despite the huge emphasis on the collective each traceur had to progress and develop independently — to create the means to be yourself — and there was a complete trust within the group every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour if a member violated the principles the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values name and splitedit in  david belles brother jeanfrançois invited the group to perform for the public in a firefighter show in paris for the performance the group named themselves yamakasi—congolese lingala ya makási meaning strong in ones person or strong man strong spirit sébastien foucan also invented a name for what they were doing lart du déplacement french for the art of movement the firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it such as their hard training and their values and ethics jeanfrançois also sent pictures and video of the group to a french tv programme and the popularity of parkour began to increase a series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group and they began to get more requests for performances during this time conflicting interests arose within the group sébastien foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more and david belle had the ambition to become an actor david and sébastien chose to leave the group and used the name parkour to describe their activity see § etymology above the seven remaining yamakasi members continued to use the term lart du déplacement  see § derivative terminologies and disciplines below organisationsedit national parkour organisations include apex school of movement united states fédération de parkour france jump freerun netherlands parkour uk parkour and tricking sweden australian parkour association and new zealand parkour association international parkout organisations include the mouvement international du parkour freerunning et lart du déplacement the fédération internationale des arts du déplacement and the world freerunning and parkour federation philosophyedit according to williams belle the philosophies and theories behind parkour are an integral aspect of the art one that many nonpractitioners have never been exposed to belle says he trains people because he wants it to be alive and for people to use it châu belle explains it is a type of freedom or kind of expression that parkour is only a state of mind rather than a set of actions and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers traceur dylan baker says parkour also influences ones thought processes by enhancing selfconfidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles a study by neuropsychiatrie de lenfance et de ladolescence neuropsychiatry of childhood and adolescence in france found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do academic research on parkour has tended to describe how parkour provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space metropolitan life and embodiment a newer convention of parkour philosophy has been the idea of human reclamation andy tran of urban evolution clarifies it as a means of reclaiming what it means to be a human being it teaches us to move using the natural methods that we should have learned from infancy it teaches us to touch the world and interact with it instead of being sheltered by it another traceurwho writes it is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour competitionedit a campaign was started on  may  by the parkournet portal to preserve parkours philosophy against sports competition and rivalry in the words of erwan le corre competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd andor the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of selfdevelopment if parkour becomes a sport it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a noncompetitive activity and a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour but that wont hold its philosophical essence anymore red bulls sponsored athlete for parkour ryan doyle has said sometimes people ask who is the best at parkour and it is because they dont understand what parkour is who is the best is what you would say to a sport and parkour is not a sport it is an art its a discipline thats like saying whats the best song in the world this seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks as has been popularised by youtube and most media exposurecitation needed david belleedit in his  book parkour david belle stressed that the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements but rather the practitioners mentality and understanding of its principles when young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing i just take the tape and throw it away what im interested in is what the guys got in his head if he has selfconfidence if he masters the technique if he has understood the principles of parkour i just cant deal with guys who do parkour because they saw videos on the internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better further he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations and developing in their own way when a young person asks me can you show me how to do this i simply answer no i am going to show you how i do it then youll have to learn with your own technique your own way of moving your style your abilities and your limitations you are going to learn to be yourself not someone else the philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts in an interview with the new yorker david belle acknowledges the influence theres a quote by bruce lee thats my motto there are no limits there are plateaus but you must not stay there you must go beyond them a man must constantly exceed his level if youre not better than you were the day before then what are you doing—whats the point in an interview with the press belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors so many people try to train easy come do parkour its really cool but if tomorrow i made you do real training you would end up crying thats what you need to know you are going to cry you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before in his book belle also quotes his father raymond if two roads open up before you always take the most difficult one because you know you can travel the easy one belle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour saying precision is all about being measured and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master with parkour i often say once is never in other words someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything it can be luck or chance when you make a jump you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it its an unavoidable rule do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself when you come for training you have to train even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times to its founder parkour is a method of selfrefinement used for learning to control and focus oneself practiceedit movementedit play media a practitioner climbing a wall while there is no official list of moves in parkour the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others and there are a number of movements considered fundamental some examples of common movements are vaulting over obstacles jumping and landing accurately with the feet on small or narrow obstacles jumping and landing feetfirst on a vertical surface catching the horizontal top with the hands using a rolling motion to help absorb impacts from larger drops running towards a high wall and then jumping and pushing off the wall with a foot to reach the top of the wall moving from a position hanging from a walltop or ledge to standing on the top or over to the other side equipmentedit a traceuse vaults an obstacle parkour is practiced without equipment of any kind practitioners normally train wearing light nonrestrictive casual clothing traceurs who wear gloves are very rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback light running shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged practitioners often use minimalist shoes sometimes as a progression to bare feet for better sensitivity and balance while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps barefoot training is done by some for movement competency without gear—as david belle noted bare feet are the best shoes various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and freerunning many other companies around the world have started offering clothing targeted at parkour risksedit trespassingedit traceurs in lisses repainting a wall repairing shoe scuff marks from parkour prohibition of parkour at the strasbourg museum of modern and contemporary art  parkour is not widely practiced in dedicated public facilities although efforts are being made to create places for it many traceurs do not like the idea as it is contradictory to parkours values of adaptation creativity and freedom traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms parks playgrounds offices and abandoned structures concerns have been raised regarding trespassing damage of property and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries many parkour organizations around the globe support the leave no trace initiative an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the seattle nonprofit parkour visions in  promoting safety respect for the spaces used and their other users and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found injuries and deathsedit concerns have been raised by law enforcement and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off high buildings they argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height with police forces calling for practitioners to stay off the rooftops some practitioners of parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged because parkour philosophy is about learning to control oneself in interaction with the environment leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour daniel ilabaca cofounder of the world parkour and freerunning federation said thinking youre going to fail at something gives you a higher risk of doing just that committing to something youre thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task there is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing compared to traditional sport techniques american traceur mark toorock said injuries are rare because participants rely not on what they cant control – wheels or the icy surfaces of snowboarding and skiing – but their own hands and feet but lanier johnson executive director of the american sports medicine institute noted that many of the injuries are not reported impactedit initially featured in films of french directorproducer luc besson parkour was first introduced to the british public by the bbc one station trailer rush hour it featured david belle leaping across londons rooftops from his office to home in an attempt to catch his favourite bbc programme and captured the imagination of many viewers especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used this advertisement along with others for cocacola nike and toyota had a largescale impact on public awareness of parkour the creation of parkour showreels and documentaries has always been crucial to the spread of parkour and is very common in the parkour community jump london is a  documentary explaining some of the background of parkour culminating with sébastien foucan johann vigroux and jérôme ben aoues demonstrating their parkour skills jump london changed the presence of parkour in the uk almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs it was followed by jump britain in  the australian version of  minutes broadcast a segment about parkour on  september  featuring foucan and stephane vigroux parkour is not defined by a set of rules or guidelines which has been particularly attractive to young people allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms it can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation for example in  the new york times published a short video featuring three young men from the gaza strip who were active members of the parkour community in  the bbc covered youth parkour participation in jammu and kashmir zahid shah founded the kashmir freerunning and parkour federation finding hope in the nonviolent discipline of parkour entertainmentedit parkour has become a popular element in action sequences with film directors hiring parkour practitioners as stunt performers the first director to do so was luc besson for the film taxi  in  followed by yamakasi in  featuring members of the original yamakasi group and its sequel les fils du vent in  also in  besson wrote district  another feature film involving advanced parkour chase sequences starring david belle and cyril raffaelli followed by the sequel district  ultimatum in  and remade in english as brick mansions in  in  the film casino royale featured sébastien foucan in a chase taking place early in the movie sparking renewed media interest in parkour along with the bourne ultimatum  casino royale is credited with starting a new wave of parkourinspired stunts in western film and television parkour was prominent in live free or die hard  again with stuntmanactor cyril raffaelli and prince of persia the sands of time  choreographed by david belle several films besides yamakasi are about thieves who use parkour such as breaking and entering  run  and tracers  the  film freerunner is about eight freerunners racing through a city for survival parkour also featured in dhoom   mtvs show ultimate parkour challenge premiered as a onehour special in october  starring the athletes of the world freerunning  parkour federation this was followed in may  with a sixepisode series of the same name the athletes were daniel ilabaca tim shieff ryan doyle michael turner oleg vorslav ben jenkin daniel arroyo pip andersen and king david the programme format was a twopart weekly competition in different southern california locations actor stephen amell learned parkour at tempest academy in preparation for his role as oliver queen in the television series arrow one of his costars on arrow caity lotz is also a practitioner modern video games frequently include aspects of parkour as major gameplay elements the assassins creed series makes heavy use of parkour movement called freerunning in the game the mirrors edge games are heavily inspired by parkour consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings rooftops and other obstacles brink introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic first person shooter prince of persia and dying light include a central parkour mechanic while crackdown and crackdown  include an emphasis on gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects tony hawks american wasteland allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard tron evolutions basic movements and combat were based on parkour and capoeira military trainingedit although parkour itself grew out of military obstaclecourse training it has become a separate discipline after the attention that parkour received following the  film casino royale military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from parkour into military training a physical trainer with the royal army corps trained with parkour practitioners with hopes of teaching some techniques to corps soldiers colorado parkour began a project to introduce elements from parkour into the us military and one san diego staff sergeant trained us marines in parkour derivative terminologies and disciplinesedit in september  the documentary jump london starring sébastien foucan was released in the documentary the term freerunning was used as an attempt to translate parkour in order to make it more appealing to the englishspeaking audience foucan decided to keep using the term freerunning to describe his discipline to distinguish it from david belles methods the remaining seven yamakasi members continued to use the term lart du déplacement also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour similar to sébastiens freerunning lart du déplacement was less about the hard discipline from the original yamakasi group more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible david belle kept the term parkour saying the group contributed to the development of it but that his father was the source of his motivation who had verbally communicated this method only to him both parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and selfexpression in freerunning the greater emphasis is on selfexpression although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners see alsoedit buildering dérive fell running freerunning plyometrics urban exploration qinggong referencesedit  a b

practitioners aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible parkour includes running climbing swinging vaulting jumping rolling quadrupedal movement and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation parkours development from military training gives it some aspects of a noncombative martial art parkour is an activity that can be practised alone or with others and is usually—but not exclusively—carried out in urban spaces parkour involves seeing ones environment in a new way and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around across through over and under its features parkour was developed in france primarily by raymond belle and further by his son david and the latters

practitioner of parkour is called a traceur with the feminine form being traceuse they are nouns derived from the french verb tracer which normally means to trace as in tracing a path in reference to drawing the verb tracer used familiarly means to buck up the term traceur was originally the name of a parkour group headed by david belle which included sébastien foucan and stéphane vigroux a jam refers to a meeting of traceurs involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days often with people from different cities the first parkour jam was organised in july  by romain drouet with a dozen people including sébastien foucan and stéphane vigroux historyedit georges hébertedit in western europe a forerunner of parkour was french naval officer georges hébert who before world

other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature his rescue efforts during the  eruption of mount pelée on saintpierre martinique reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism hébert became a physical education tutor at the college of reims in france hébert set up a méthode naturelle natural method session consisting of ten fundamental groups walking running jumping quadrupedal movement climbing balancing throwing lifting selfdefence swimming these were intended to develop the three main forces energetic willpower courage coolness and firmness moral benevolence assistance honour and honesty and physical muscles and breath during world war i and world war ii teaching continued to expand becoming the standard system of french military education and training inspired by hébert a swiss architect developed a parcours du combattant—military obstacle course—the first of the courses that are now standard in military training and which led to the development of civilian fitness trails and confidence courses raymond and david belleedit born in  in vietnam raymond belle was the son of a french physician and vietnamese mother during the first indochina war his father died and he was separated from his mother after which he was sent to a military orphanage in da lat at the age of  he took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never be a victim at night when everyone else was asleep he would be outside running or climbing trees he would use the military obstacle courses in secret and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance strength and flexibility doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood but also eventually to thrive after the battle of dien bien phu in  he returned to france and remained in military education until the age of  when he joined the paris fire brigade a french army unit david belle is considered the founder of parkour raymonds son david belle was born in  he experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs as he got older he started to read the newspaper clippingswhich that told of his fathers exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats through conversations with his father he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded indoor environment through conversations with his father david learned about this way of training that his father called parcours he heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things he learned that for his father training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about david realised that this was what he had been searching for and so he began training in the same way after a time he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training yamakasiedit main article yamakasi david initially trained on his own and after moving to lisses found other young men including his cousins who had similar desires and they began to train together the group eventually included david belle sébastien foucan châu belle dinh williams belle yann hnautra laurent piemontesi guylain nguba boyeke malik diouf and charles perrière disciplineedit the group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed examples included training without food or water or sleeping on the floor without a blanket to learn to endure the cold for example no one in the group was permitted to be late for training as it would hold back the whole group if any member completed a challenge everyone else had to do the same thing during their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative few excuses were allowed for instance if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump he had to do it anyway even if it meant doing the jump barefoot at the same time everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits respecting ones health and physical wellbeing was one of the foundations of the group if any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement the movement was deemed a failure a movement executed only once was not considered an achievement only with repetition was the challenge complete every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury if any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again humility was an important principle no traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement if any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again anyone who lied violated the principle of humility to join the group new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining despite the huge emphasis on the collective each traceur had to progress and develop independently — to create the means to be yourself — and there was a complete trust within the group every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour if a member violated the principles the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values name and splitedit in  david belles brother jeanfrançois invited the group to perform for the public in a firefighter show in paris for the performance the group named themselves yamakasi—congolese lingala ya makási meaning strong in ones person or strong man strong spirit sébastien foucan also invented a name for what they were doing lart du déplacement french for the art of movement the firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it such as their hard training and their values and ethics jeanfrançois also sent pictures and video of the group to a french tv programme and the popularity of parkour began to increase a series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group and they began to get more requests for performances during this time conflicting interests arose within the group sébastien foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more and david belle had the ambition to become an actor david and sébastien chose to leave the group and used the name parkour to describe their activity see § etymology above the seven remaining yamakasi members continued to use the term lart du déplacement  see § derivative terminologies and disciplines below organisationsedit national parkour organisations include apex school of movement united states fédération de parkour france jump freerun netherlands parkour uk parkour and tricking sweden australian parkour association and new zealand parkour association international parkout organisations include the mouvement international du parkour freerunning et lart du déplacement the fédération internationale des arts du déplacement and the world freerunning and parkour federation philosophyedit according to williams belle the philosophies and theories behind parkour are an integral aspect of the art one that many nonpractitioners have never been exposed to belle says he trains people because he wants it to be alive and for people to use it châu belle explains it is a type of freedom or kind of expression that parkour is only a state of mind rather than a set of actions and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers traceur dylan baker says parkour also influences ones thought processes by enhancing selfconfidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles a study by neuropsychiatrie de lenfance et de ladolescence neuropsychiatry of childhood and adolescence in france found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do academic research on parkour has tended to describe how parkour provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space metropolitan life and embodiment a newer convention of parkour philosophy has been the idea of human reclamation andy tran of urban evolution clarifies it as a means of reclaiming what it means to be a human being it teaches us to move using the natural methods that we should have learned from infancy it teaches us to touch the world and interact with it instead of being sheltered by it another traceurwho writes it is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour competitionedit a campaign was started on  may  by the parkournet portal to preserve parkours philosophy against sports competition and rivalry in the words of erwan le corre competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd andor the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of selfdevelopment if parkour becomes a sport it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a noncompetitive activity and a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour but that wont hold its philosophical essence anymore red bulls sponsored athlete for parkour ryan doyle has said sometimes people ask who is the best at parkour and it is because they dont understand what parkour is who is the best is what you would say to a sport and parkour is not a sport it is an art its a discipline thats like saying whats the best song in the world this seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks as has been popularised by youtube and most media exposurecitation needed david belleedit in his  book parkour david belle stressed that the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements but rather the practitioners mentality and understanding of its principles when young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing i just take the tape and throw it away what im interested in is what the guys got in his head if he has selfconfidence if he masters the technique if he has understood the principles of parkour i just cant deal with guys who do parkour because they saw videos on the internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better further he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations and developing in their own way when a young person asks me can you show me how to do this i simply answer no i am going to show you how i do it then youll have to learn with your own technique your own way of moving your style your abilities and your limitations you are going to learn to be yourself not someone else the philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts in an interview with the new yorker david belle acknowledges the influence theres a quote by bruce lee thats my motto there are no limits there are plateaus but you must not stay there you must go beyond them a man must constantly exceed his level if youre not better than you were the day before then what are you doing—whats the point in an interview with the press belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors so many people try to train easy come do parkour its really cool but if tomorrow i made you do real training you would end up crying thats what you need to know you are going to cry you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before in his book belle also quotes his father raymond if two roads open up before you always take the most difficult one because you know you can travel the easy one belle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour saying precision is all about being measured and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master with parkour i often say once is never in other words someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything it can be luck or chance when you make a jump you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it its an unavoidable rule do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself when you come for training you have to train even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times to its founder parkour is a method of selfrefinement used for learning to control and focus oneself practiceedit movementedit play media a practitioner climbing a wall while there is no official list of moves in parkour the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others and there are a number of movements considered fundamental some examples of common movements are vaulting over obstacles jumping and landing accurately with the feet on small or narrow obstacles jumping and landing feetfirst on a vertical surface catching the horizontal top with the hands using a rolling motion to help absorb impacts from larger drops running towards a high wall and then jumping and pushing off the wall with a foot to reach the top of the wall moving from a position hanging from a walltop or ledge to standing on the top or over to the other side equipmentedit a traceuse vaults an obstacle parkour is practiced without equipment of any kind practitioners normally train wearing light nonrestrictive casual clothing traceurs who wear gloves are very rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback light running shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged practitioners often use minimalist shoes sometimes as a progression to bare feet for better sensitivity and balance while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps barefoot training is done by some for movement competency without gear—as david belle noted bare feet are the best shoes various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and freerunning many other companies around the world have started offering clothing targeted at parkour risksedit trespassingedit traceurs in lisses repainting a wall repairing shoe scuff marks from parkour prohibition of parkour at the strasbourg museum of modern and contemporary art  parkour is not widely practiced in dedicated public facilities although efforts are being made to create places for it many traceurs do not like the idea as it is contradictory to parkours values of adaptation creativity and freedom traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms parks playgrounds offices and abandoned structures concerns have been raised regarding trespassing damage of property and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries many parkour organizations around the globe support the leave no trace initiative an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the seattle nonprofit parkour visions in  promoting safety respect for the spaces used and their other users and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found injuries and deathsedit concerns have been raised by law enforcement and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off high buildings they argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height with police forces calling for practitioners to stay off the rooftops some practitioners of parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged because parkour philosophy is about learning to control oneself in interaction with the environment leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour daniel ilabaca cofounder of the world parkour and freerunning federation said thinking youre going to fail at something gives you a higher risk of doing just that committing to something youre thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task there is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing compared to traditional sport techniques american traceur mark toorock said injuries are rare because participants rely not on what they cant control – wheels or the icy surfaces of snowboarding and skiing – but their own hands and feet but lanier johnson executive director of the american sports medicine institute noted that many of the injuries are not reported impactedit initially featured in films of french directorproducer luc besson parkour was first introduced to the british public by the bbc one station trailer rush hour it featured david belle leaping across londons rooftops from his office to home in an attempt to catch his favourite bbc programme and captured the imagination of many viewers especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used this advertisement along with others for cocacola nike and toyota had a largescale impact on public awareness of parkour the creation of parkour showreels and documentaries has always been crucial to the spread of parkour and is very common in the parkour community jump london is a  documentary explaining some of the background of parkour culminating with sébastien foucan johann vigroux and jérôme ben aoues demonstrating their parkour skills jump london changed the presence of parkour in the uk almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs it was followed by jump britain in  the australian version of  minutes broadcast a segment about parkour on  september  featuring foucan and stephane vigroux parkour is not defined by a set of rules or guidelines which has been particularly attractive to young people allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms it can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation for example in  the new york times published a short video featuring three young men from the gaza strip who were active members of the parkour community in  the bbc covered youth parkour participation in jammu and kashmir zahid shah founded the kashmir freerunning and parkour federation finding hope in the nonviolent discipline of parkour entertainmentedit parkour has become a popular element in action sequences with film directors hiring parkour practitioners as stunt performers the first director to do so was luc besson for the film taxi  in  followed by yamakasi in  featuring members of the original yamakasi group and its sequel les fils du vent in  also in  besson wrote district  another feature film involving advanced parkour chase sequences starring david belle and cyril raffaelli followed by the sequel district  ultimatum in  and remade in english as brick mansions in  in  the film casino royale featured sébastien foucan in a chase taking place early in the movie sparking renewed media interest in parkour along with the bourne ultimatum  casino royale is credited with starting a new wave of parkourinspired stunts in western film and television parkour was prominent in live free or die hard  again with stuntmanactor cyril raffaelli and prince of persia the sands of time  choreographed by david belle several films besides yamakasi are about thieves who use parkour such as breaking and entering  run  and tracers  the  film freerunner is about eight freerunners racing through a city for survival parkour also featured in dhoom   mtvs show ultimate parkour challenge premiered as a onehour special in october  starring the athletes of the world freerunning  parkour federation this was followed in may  with a sixepisode series of the same name the athletes were daniel ilabaca tim shieff ryan doyle michael turner oleg vorslav ben jenkin daniel arroyo pip andersen and king david the programme format was a twopart weekly competition in different southern california locations actor stephen amell learned parkour at tempest academy in preparation for his role as oliver queen in the television series arrow one of his costars on arrow caity lotz is also a practitioner modern video games frequently include aspects of parkour as major gameplay elements the assassins creed series makes heavy use of parkour movement called freerunning in the game the mirrors edge games are heavily inspired by parkour consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings rooftops and other obstacles brink introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic first person shooter prince of persia and dying light include a central parkour mechanic while crackdown and crackdown  include an emphasis on gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects tony hawks american wasteland allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard tron evolutions basic movements and combat were based on parkour and capoeira military trainingedit although parkour itself grew out of military obstaclecourse training it has become a separate discipline after the attention that parkour received following the  film casino royale military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from parkour into military training a physical trainer with the royal army corps trained with parkour practitioners with hopes of teaching some techniques to corps soldiers colorado parkour began a project to introduce elements from parkour into the us military and one san diego staff sergeant trained us marines in parkour derivative terminologies and disciplinesedit in september  the documentary jump london starring sébastien foucan was released in the documentary the term freerunning was used as an attempt to translate parkour in order to make it more appealing to the englishspeaking audience foucan decided to keep using the term freerunning to describe his discipline to distinguish it from david belles methods the remaining seven yamakasi members continued to use the term lart du déplacement also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour similar to sébastiens freerunning lart du déplacement was less about the hard discipline from the original yamakasi group more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible david belle kept the term parkour saying the group contributed to the development of it but that his father was the source of his motivation who had verbally communicated this method only to him both parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and selfexpression in freerunning the greater emphasis is on selfexpression although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners see alsoedit buildering dérive fell running freerunning plyometrics urban exploration qinggong referencesedit  a b

classic obstacle course method of military training proposed by georges hébert raymond belle used the term le parcours to encompass all of his training including climbing jumping running balancing and the other methods he undertook in his personal athletic advancement his son david further developed his fathers methods and achieved success as a stuntman and one day on a film set showed his speed air man video to hubert koundé koundé suggested he change the c of parcours to a k because it was stronger and more dynamic and to remove the silent s for the same reason forming parkour a practitioner of parkour is called a traceur with the feminine form being traceuse they are nouns derived from the french verb tracer which normally means to trace as in tracing a path in reference to drawing the verb tracer used familiarly means to buck up the term traceur was originally the name of a parkour group headed by david belle which included sébastien foucan and stéphane vigroux a jam refers to a meeting of traceurs involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days often with people from different cities the first parkour jam was organised in july  by romain drouet with a dozen people including sébastien foucan and stéphane vigroux historyedit georges hébertedit in western europe a forerunner of parkour was french naval officer georges hébert who before world war i promoted athletic skill based on the models of indigenous tribes he had met in africa he noted their bodies were splendid flexible nimble skillful enduring and resistant but yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature his rescue efforts during the  eruption of mount pelée on saintpierre martinique reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism hébert became a physical education tutor at the college of reims in france hébert set up a méthode naturelle natural method session consisting of ten fundamental groups walking running jumping quadrupedal movement climbing balancing throwing lifting selfdefence swimming these were intended to develop the three main forces energetic willpower courage coolness and firmness moral benevolence assistance honour and honesty and physical muscles and breath during world war i and world war ii teaching continued to expand becoming the standard system of french military education and training inspired by hébert a swiss architect developed a parcours du combattant—military obstacle course—the first of the courses that are now standard in military training and which led to the development of civilian fitness trails and confidence courses raymond and david belleedit born in  in vietnam raymond belle was the son of a french physician and vietnamese mother during the first indochina war his father died and he was separated from his mother after which he was sent to a military orphanage in da lat at the age of  he took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never be a victim at night when everyone else was asleep he would be outside running or climbing trees he would use the military obstacle courses in secret and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance strength and flexibility doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood but also eventually to thrive after the battle of dien bien phu in  he returned to france and remained in military education until the age of  when he joined the paris fire brigade a french army unit david belle is considered the founder of parkour raymonds son david belle was born in  he experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs as he got older he started to read the newspaper clippingswhich that told of his fathers exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats through conversations with his father he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded indoor environment through conversations with his father david learned about this way of training that his father called parcours he heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things he learned that for his father training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about david realised that this was what he had been searching for and so he began training in the same way after a time he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training yamakasiedit main article yamakasi david initially trained on his own and after moving to lisses found other young men including his cousins who had similar desires and they began to train together the group eventually included david belle sébastien foucan châu belle dinh williams belle yann hnautra laurent piemontesi guylain nguba boyeke malik diouf and charles perrière disciplineedit the group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed examples included training without food or water or sleeping on the floor without a blanket to learn to endure the cold for example no one in the group was permitted to be late for training as it would hold back the whole group if any member completed a challenge everyone else had to do the same thing during their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative few excuses were allowed for instance if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump he had to do it anyway even if it meant doing the jump barefoot at the same time everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits respecting ones health and physical wellbeing was one of the foundations of the group if any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement the movement was deemed a failure a movement executed only once was not considered an achievement only with repetition was the challenge complete every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury if any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again humility was an important principle no traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement if any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again anyone who lied violated the principle of humility to join the group new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining despite the huge emphasis on the collective each traceur had to progress and develop independently — to create the means to be yourself — and there was a complete trust within the group every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour if a member violated the principles the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values name and splitedit in  david belles brother jeanfrançois invited the group to perform for the public in a firefighter show in paris for the performance the group named themselves yamakasi—congolese lingala ya makási meaning strong in ones person or strong man strong spirit sébastien foucan also invented a name for what they were doing lart du déplacement french for the art of movement the firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it such as their hard training and their values and ethics jeanfrançois also sent pictures and video of the group to a french tv programme and the popularity of parkour began to increase a series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group and they began to get more requests for performances during this time conflicting interests arose within the group sébastien foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more and david belle had the ambition to become an actor david and sébastien chose to leave the group and used the name parkour to describe their activity see § etymology above the seven remaining yamakasi members continued to use the term lart du déplacement  see § derivative terminologies and disciplines below organisationsedit national parkour organisations include apex school of movement united states fédération de parkour france jump freerun netherlands parkour uk parkour and tricking sweden australian parkour association and new zealand parkour association international parkout organisations include the mouvement international du parkour freerunning et lart du déplacement the fédération internationale des arts du déplacement and the world freerunning and parkour federation philosophyedit according to williams belle the philosophies and theories behind parkour are an integral aspect of the art one that many nonpractitioners have never been exposed to belle says he trains people because he wants it to be alive and for people to use it châu belle explains it is a type of freedom or kind of expression that parkour is only a state of mind rather than a set of actions and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers traceur dylan baker says parkour also influences ones thought processes by enhancing selfconfidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles a study by neuropsychiatrie de lenfance et de ladolescence neuropsychiatry of childhood and adolescence in france found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do academic research on parkour has tended to describe how parkour provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space metropolitan life and embodiment a newer convention of parkour philosophy has been the idea of human reclamation andy tran of urban evolution clarifies it as a means of reclaiming what it means to be a human being it teaches us to move using the natural methods that we should have learned from infancy it teaches us to touch the world and interact with it instead of being sheltered by it another traceurwho writes it is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour competitionedit a campaign was started on  may  by the parkournet portal to preserve parkours philosophy against sports competition and rivalry in the words of erwan le corre competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd andor the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of selfdevelopment if parkour becomes a sport it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a noncompetitive activity and a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour but that wont hold its philosophical essence anymore red bulls sponsored athlete for parkour ryan doyle has said sometimes people ask who is the best at parkour and it is because they dont understand what parkour is who is the best is what you would say to a sport and parkour is not a sport it is an art its a discipline thats like saying whats the best song in the world this seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks as has been popularised by youtube and most media exposurecitation needed david belleedit in his  book parkour david belle stressed that the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements but rather the practitioners mentality and understanding of its principles when young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing i just take the tape and throw it away what im interested in is what the guys got in his head if he has selfconfidence if he masters the technique if he has understood the principles of parkour i just cant deal with guys who do parkour because they saw videos on the internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better further he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations and developing in their own way when a young person asks me can you show me how to do this i simply answer no i am going to show you how i do it then youll have to learn with your own technique your own way of moving your style your abilities and your limitations you are going to learn to be yourself not someone else the philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts in an interview with the new yorker david belle acknowledges the influence theres a quote by bruce lee thats my motto there are no limits there are plateaus but you must not stay there you must go beyond them a man must constantly exceed his level if youre not better than you were the day before then what are you doing—whats the point in an interview with the press belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors so many people try to train easy come do parkour its really cool but if tomorrow i made you do real training you would end up crying thats what you need to know you are going to cry you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before in his book belle also quotes his father raymond if two roads open up before you always take the most difficult one because you know you can travel the easy one belle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour saying precision is all about being measured and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master with parkour i often say once is never in other words someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything it can be luck or chance when you make a jump you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it its an unavoidable rule do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself when you come for training you have to train even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times to its founder parkour is a method of selfrefinement used for learning to control and focus oneself practiceedit movementedit play media a practitioner climbing a wall while there is no official list of moves in parkour the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others and there are a number of movements considered fundamental some examples of common movements are vaulting over obstacles jumping and landing accurately with the feet on small or narrow obstacles jumping and landing feetfirst on a vertical surface catching the horizontal top with the hands using a rolling motion to help absorb impacts from larger drops running towards a high wall and then jumping and pushing off the wall with a foot to reach the top of the wall moving from a position hanging from a walltop or ledge to standing on the top or over to the other side equipmentedit a traceuse vaults an obstacle parkour is practiced without equipment of any kind practitioners normally train wearing light nonrestrictive casual clothing traceurs who wear gloves are very rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback light running shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged practitioners often use minimalist shoes sometimes as a progression to bare feet for better sensitivity and balance while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps barefoot training is done by some for movement competency without gear—as david belle noted bare feet are the best shoes various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and freerunning many other companies around the world have started offering clothing targeted at parkour risksedit trespassingedit traceurs in lisses repainting a wall repairing shoe scuff marks from parkour prohibition of parkour at the strasbourg museum of modern and contemporary art  parkour is not widely practiced in dedicated public facilities although efforts are being made to create places for it many traceurs do not like the idea as it is contradictory to parkours values of adaptation creativity and freedom traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms parks playgrounds offices and abandoned structures concerns have been raised regarding trespassing damage of property and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries many parkour organizations around the globe support the leave no trace initiative an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the seattle nonprofit parkour visions in  promoting safety respect for the spaces used and their other users and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found injuries and deathsedit concerns have been raised by law enforcement and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off high buildings they argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height with police forces calling for practitioners to stay off the rooftops some practitioners of parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged because parkour philosophy is about learning to control oneself in interaction with the environment leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour daniel ilabaca cofounder of the world parkour and freerunning federation said thinking youre going to fail at something gives you a higher risk of doing just that committing to something youre thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task there is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing compared to traditional sport techniques american traceur mark toorock said injuries are rare because participants rely not on what they cant control – wheels or the icy surfaces of snowboarding and skiing – but their own hands and feet but lanier johnson executive director of the american sports medicine institute noted that many of the injuries are not reported impactedit initially featured in films of french directorproducer luc besson parkour was first introduced to the british public by the bbc one station trailer rush hour it featured david belle leaping across londons rooftops from his office to home in an attempt to catch his favourite bbc programme and captured the imagination of many viewers especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used this advertisement along with others for cocacola nike and toyota had a largescale impact on public awareness of parkour the creation of parkour showreels and documentaries has always been crucial to the spread of parkour and is very common in the parkour community jump london is a  documentary explaining some of the background of parkour culminating with sébastien foucan johann vigroux and jérôme ben aoues demonstrating their parkour skills jump london changed the presence of parkour in the uk almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs it was followed by jump britain in  the australian version of  minutes broadcast a segment about parkour on  september  featuring foucan and stephane vigroux parkour is not defined by a set of rules or guidelines which has been particularly attractive to young people allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms it can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation for example in  the new york times published a short video featuring three young men from the gaza strip who were active members of the parkour community in  the bbc covered youth parkour participation in jammu and kashmir zahid shah founded the kashmir freerunning and parkour federation finding hope in the nonviolent discipline of parkour entertainmentedit parkour has become a popular element in action sequences with film directors hiring parkour practitioners as stunt performers the first director to do so was luc besson for the film taxi  in  followed by yamakasi in  featuring members of the original yamakasi group and its sequel les fils du vent in  also in  besson wrote district  another feature film involving advanced parkour chase sequences starring david belle and cyril raffaelli followed by the sequel district  ultimatum in  and remade in english as brick mansions in  in  the film casino royale featured sébastien foucan in a chase taking place early in the movie sparking renewed media interest in parkour along with the bourne ultimatum  casino royale is credited with starting a new wave of parkourinspired stunts in western film and television parkour was prominent in live free or die hard  again with stuntmanactor cyril raffaelli and prince of persia the sands of time  choreographed by david belle several films besides yamakasi are about thieves who use parkour such as breaking and entering  run  and tracers  the  film freerunner is about eight freerunners racing through a city for survival parkour also featured in dhoom   mtvs show ultimate parkour challenge premiered as a onehour special in october  starring the athletes of the world freerunning  parkour federation this was followed in may  with a sixepisode series of the same name the athletes were daniel ilabaca tim shieff ryan doyle michael turner oleg vorslav ben jenkin daniel arroyo pip andersen and king david the programme format was a twopart weekly competition in different southern california locations actor stephen amell learned parkour at tempest academy in preparation for his role as oliver queen in the television series arrow one of his costars on arrow caity lotz is also a practitioner modern video games frequently include aspects of parkour as major gameplay elements the assassins creed series makes heavy use of parkour movement called freerunning in the game the mirrors edge games are heavily inspired by parkour consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings rooftops and other obstacles brink introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic first person shooter prince of persia and dying light include a central parkour mechanic while crackdown and crackdown  include an emphasis on gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects tony hawks american wasteland allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard tron evolutions basic movements and combat were based on parkour and capoeira military trainingedit although parkour itself grew out of military obstaclecourse training it has become a separate discipline after the attention that parkour received following the  film casino royale military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from parkour into military training a physical trainer with the royal army corps trained with parkour practitioners with hopes of teaching some techniques to corps soldiers colorado parkour began a project to introduce elements from parkour into the us military and one san diego staff sergeant trained us marines in parkour derivative terminologies and disciplinesedit in september  the documentary jump london starring sébastien foucan was released in the documentary the term freerunning was used as an attempt to translate parkour in order to make it more appealing to the englishspeaking audience foucan decided to keep using the term freerunning to describe his discipline to distinguish it from david belles methods the remaining seven yamakasi members continued to use the term lart du déplacement also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour similar to sébastiens freerunning lart du déplacement was less about the hard discipline from the original yamakasi group more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible david belle kept the term parkour saying the group contributed to the development of it but that his father was the source of his motivation who had verbally communicated this method only to him both parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and selfexpression in freerunning the greater emphasis is on selfexpression although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners see alsoedit buildering dérive fell running freerunning plyometrics urban exploration qinggong referencesedit  a b
