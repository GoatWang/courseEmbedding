investors with attractive yield and monthly cash flow attributable to investments in the peertopeer lending space logo httpphotosprnewswirecomprnhnylogo ranger specialty incomes portfolio will consist of investments in consumer and business loans offered by peertopeer lending platforms which enable investors to directly participate in the consumer credit markets this burgeoning asset class has a low correlation to equity and traditional fixedincome investments and returns on these investments have generally been higher than many other types of fixedincome products the creditworthiness of peertopeer loan borrowers and the growth of peertopeer lending platforms combined with low yields in the fixedincome universe make this the ideal time to launch the ranger specialty income fund said k scott canon president of ranger capital we have created an institutionally structured product that utilizes artificial intelligence technology to deliver attractive returns to investors the average peertopeer loan borrower is a homeowner with a fico score above  who uses the loan for debt consolidation purposes the popularity of peertopeer lending is rapidly increasing with the market expected to surpass  billion by the end of this year  the ranger specialty income strategy uses a proprietary artificial intelligence system known as trusight technology™ to evaluate select and invest in peertopeer loans  developed by portfolio manager gary melara exclusively for investing in peertopeer loans artificial intelligence ai algorithms generated by trusight evaluate over six years of historical data and hundreds of borrower credit fields from the peertopeer lending platforms  trusight algorithms seek to identify the important criteria of loans with the highest potential returns on investment ranger specialty incomes trusight technology and approach to peertopeer investing has been actively used for almost four years and has never had a losing month trusights ai algorithms and loanmonitoring mechanisms enable us to create a truly diversified portfolio of what we believe to be the most promising peertopeer loans said mr melara our proprietary loan evaluation technology years of peertopeer investment experience and guidance from consumer credit experts provide investors with a unique opportunity to actively capitalize on this new asset class until recently consumer credit markets were dominated by large banks and financial institutions following the financial crisis in  and the enactment of new industry regulations these institutions found it too timeconsuming and expensive to continue making consumer loans for credit card debt and other personal matters this development led to the rise of online peertopeer lending platforms that bring together investors and creditworthy borrowers our ongoing evaluations of traditional and alternative sources of investment income have convinced us that peertopeer lending presents a very attractive opportunity for investors seeking a stream of principal and interest at this time said mr canon we have an established track record of offering specialty niche products that provide a consistent repeatable approach to investing and risk management and the launch of the ranger specialty income fund is a continuation of our commitment to delivering attractive investment opportunities to institutional and high net
