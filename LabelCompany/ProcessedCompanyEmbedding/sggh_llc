nowgo»signature group holdings attractive postbankruptcy play with no analyst coveragesep  about real industry rely john leonard cfa special situations microcap contrarian cfasignature group holdings sgghpk trades at a discount to intrinsic value despite a successful restructuring hidden asset in its circuit breaker business and significant tax assets valued at a fraction of their true worth company overview sgghpk is the successor company to fremont general a financial services company that offered retail banking products as well as commercial and residential mortgages fremont filed for chapter  bankruptcy in june  and emerged in june  as signature group holdings with a new board and management team sgghpk acquired specialty industrial supply company north american breaker nabco in july  sgghpk has two primary businesses nabco supplies circuit breakers used in commercial industrial and residential structures in the us with a focus on the replacement market nabco operates seven warehouse locations and expects to open two additional distribution centers this year signature special situations acquires subperforming and nonperforming commercial and industrial loans leases mortgages corporate and structured debt typically at a discount signature also originates secured debt financing to middle market companies investment thesis although sgghpk exited from bankruptcy over three years ago it still qualifies as a postbankruptcy play given that the main value catalyst is the significant nols received after its exit before any discussion of valuation the tripling of the stock ytd should be addressed while this price appreciation certainly is based on the expectation that the nols will eventually be used it fails to properly account for the full value the successful ongoing restructuring or the strong circuit breaker business indepth discussion below investors should be less concerned with missing the previous move in the stock and more concerned with the following first the current valuation should be compared to the intrinsic value if the former is significantly smaller than the latter then an attractive value opportunity exists regardless of past price movement many investors miss out on future gains by focusing solely on past gains and placing a mental ceiling on the stock eg apple nasdaqaapl from april  to september  second the ability to manage risk should be considered more often than not stocks that have risen significantly in a short time frame do not allow for a low risk entry due to the high probability of a pullback however sgghpk recently consolidated into a tight range and provides investors with the opportunity to reduce risk by placing a tight stop loss furthermore the consolidation is a positive sign as many stocks that have gone parabolic often retrace a significant portion eg a third to a half of their gains in a short time period this is not the case with sgghpk disconnect between implied and true value for nols wont last forever sgghpk has  million of federal nols year life and begin to expire in  and  million of california nols either a  or year life and begin to expire in  sgghpk created a tax benefit preservation plan in order to preserve these nols the current valuation places a significant discount on the value of these nols due to the fact that management has not yet acquired a large and profitable company that would allow it to fully use the nols even sgghpk places a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets the implied value for the nols decreases as more time goes by without an acquisition announcement however there are five key points to consider first this delay should be viewed as a positive as management is clearly focusing on the longterm best interest of the company by not overpaying andor acquiring a small company without a sufficient level of profitability to fully use the nols merely to please shortterm oriented investors in this instance action does not equal progress moreover the new board has access to higher quality deal flow and increases the possibility of consummating a large and accretive acquisition second the disconnect between implied and true value should rapidly narrow after an acquisition is announced third the significant stock price appreciation is actually a positive even for current investors as this means the company should be able to issue fewer shares to pay for an acquisition which reduces the potential dilutive impact furthermore management intends to raise capital through a rights offering which is significantly less dilutive than traditional equity raises and preserves the right to use the nols fourth management intends to use covanta nysecva as the model for its rights offering the fact that legendary investor sam zell was a board member of cva and owns  of sgghpk is a significant positive factor another interesting parallel is that cva rose from  to  in the four months prior to emerging from bankruptcy in march  and then steadily rose to  by  fifth sgghpk intends to list on the nasdaq click on faq which should be a significant value catalyst as this will exponentially increase the potential shareholder base as many investors ignore otc listed stocks at the annual shareholder meeting shareholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares from  million to  million in september  sgghpk filed a shelf registration statement which would allow it to raise up to  million through the sale of securities successful ongoing restructuring sgghpk has made significant progress since emerging from bankruptcy the complicated nature of the ongoing restructuring results in a valuation ceiling being placed on the stock which should be raised and eventually eliminated after the market begins to price in the following improvements sale of noncore and legacy assets sgghpk intends to sell cosmed antiaging skin care subsidiary after classifying it as discontinued in q and receiving an unsolicited offer for its intellectual property and other assets sgghpk continues to take advantage of favorable market conditions to dispose of the legacy assets and liabilities of its former business fremont including subprime residential real estate mortgages as well as residential and commercial real estate in q sgghpk sold a majority of its signature special situation group assets portfolio of residential real estate loans for  million which resulted in a gain of  million subsequent to the closing of q sgghpk redeemed fhlb stock required to be held in order to maintain a borrowing relationship in july for  million at the end of q no residential real estate loans were in nonaccrual status compared to  at the end of fy sgghpk deserves a higher multiple for these disposals for two reasons first the significant balance sheet uncertainty is virtually eliminated which should not be taken for granted especially for a bank that emerged from bankruptcy second the gain on the sale of the disposals as well as the high credit quality of the remaining assets most likely exceeded expectations as a result the strong net cash position should help finance an acquisition and reduce the size of a rights offering reduced cost structure income from nabco and any future acquisition should drop straight to the bottom line given the significantly lower cost structure and elimination of multiple oneoff charges including the following reduced workforce by  in fy no more proxy contest expenses  million in q the settlement of a substantial number of legacy legal actions which should significantly reduce litigation expenses going forward no plans to renew sublease in april  for corporate headquarters as it is larger and more elaborate than present needs sgghpk will look for a smaller space reduced assets of discontinued operations from  million at the end of fy to  million at the end of the mrq sale of it systems related to fremont business reorganization expenses reduced to virtually zero  million in fy expected refinancing of  notes for significant interest savings reduced repurchase reserve liability see risks section below nabco is a hidden asset nabco is one of the largest independent suppliers of circuit breakers for the replacement market its broad geographic footprint provides just in time delivery and a significant competitive advantage the demand for this critical safety device which must be replaced immediately when damaged used in virtually every structure should only grow due to the aging electrical infrastructure according to a georgia institute of technology study the majority of equipment in the us electrical grid is at least  years old the replacement market is characterized by the following positive traits fewer large competitors less dependent on the more volatile new construction market minimal risk of product obsolescence which significantly reduces the risk of a large inventory writedown in the mrq revenue rose  driven by new customers adjusted ebitda rose  to  million net earnings rose  while the profit margin rose  basis points to  a circuit breaker will automatically shut off an electrical circuit when the flow of electricity increases above a safe level in order to prevent serious damage including fire risks nols sgghpk will need to acquire a sufficiently large and profitable company in order to use its nols potential dilution as discussed above sgghpk expects to conduct a rights offering in order to fund an acquisition which may result in dilution repurchase liabilities sgghpk maintains a reserve that represents estimated losses from repurchase claims based on breaches of certain representations and warranties provided by fremont investment  loan fil to counterparties that purchased residential real estate loans originated from q as of the mrq there were  million of total outstanding repurchase claims this risk is mitigated by several factors first the repurchase reserve liability decreased  million to  million in h and from  million at fy as no repurchase claims were received or settled during this time frame second of the outstanding claims there has been no communication or other action from the claimants for more than  months for  million in claims for more than  months but less than  months for  million in claims for more than  months but less than  months for  million in claims bankruptcy claims sgghpk has  million in remaining unpaid claims filed with the us bankruptcy court outstanding lawsuit sgghpk has a  million litigation reserve for the full amount of a judgment relating to a lawsuit brought by a former fremont employee customer concentration three industrial supply customers accounted for  of total operating revenue in fy conclusion the target price of  is based on the sum of the parts analysis this is extremely conservative given the assumptions used in the model and represents a shorterterm price target eg  months a stop should be placed no more than  below support at  a more aggressive and longerterm eg  months price target is realistic however the range for this price target is wide given the significant uncertainty regarding an expected transformative acquisition eg industry and ebitda level unknown in this instance conservative investors could enter on strength above the recent high of
