significant amount of capital for new projects the man behind crescent real estate holdings plenty of heart and gut instincts got real estate and financial wiz john goff where he is today by christine perez published in d ceo januaryfebruary  sms john goff is a visual kind of guy the chairman and ceo of crescent real estate holdings likes to see things—and put things—in writing and he appreciates the “look” of things his fort worth office sports a clean tasteful design in the conference room panels of windows showcase the view of sundance square large terraces offer an even closer look one of the conference room walls is covered in floortoceiling whiteboard and as we begin to discuss goff’s various operations he jumps out of his chair grabs a marker and starts scribbling goff  draws four boxes to illustrate the different segments of his business life goff capital inc goff capital partners goff family foundation and crescent goff capital inc handles the family money six investment pros—including former goldman sachs executive keith ohnmeis and goff’s oldest son travis—trade interests in public securities both debt and equity as well as oil and gas private equity and real estate goff capital partners launched in  handles investments for institutional partners and others it’s run by goff and two managing partners who head offices in denver and stamford conn the group has purchased  billion in real estate debt during the past two years and it just closed on a  million commitment with an offshore investor for both capital groups goff is the idea guy focusing primarily on strategy goff family foundation which goff formed in  is led by his sister jill goff it provides scholarships to students as well as significant support to como elementary school on the west side of fort worth and then there’s crescent real estate the company goff launched built took public sold at the peak of the market in  for  billion—and reacquired in late  with barclays capital for much much less leading up to the deal’s closing goff says it was hard to believe it was going to happen and once the ink dried he says “i had to pinch myself for two weeks afterward” goff runs his various operations from a building on commerce street that sits about a block away from crescent’s fort worth headquarters in his office hangs a striking painting by craig hawkins that bears the quote “it’s your heart not the dictionary that gives meaning to your words” a variation of matthew  goff has plenty of heart but it’s his gut instincts that have gotten him where he is today he grew up in lake jackson a bluecollar town off the texas gulf coast that sprung up in the mids around a new dow chemical plant goff was a “surprise” much younger than his two older sisters and brother his brother charlie is the retired chairman and ceo of houstonbased destec energy at one point the two goffs were both heading up nysetraded companies the only time two brothers are believed to have done socrescents office portfolio includes  class a buildings amond them are left to right trammell crow carter burgess plaza and the crescent photography courtesy of crescent real estate holdingsgoff started working at the age of  he loved to make money—and he saved it after earning an accounting degree at the university of texas he joined a cpa firm in houston he dove into the numbers learning as much as he could about the financial operations of a business eighteen months later he went to work for prolific houston developer kenneth schnitzer then in  the newly married goff moved to fort worth so his wife could be closer to her family goff had offers from a number of dallas real estate firms but opted to go back into public accounting and joined peat marwick now kpmg “something in my gut didn’t feel right about the real estate business at the time” he says “within a few years all of those firms i had talked with were gone” at peat marwick goff took on advisory work audit work sec work initial pulic offerings soaking up knowledge and experience he also connected with richard rainwater the financial genius who grew a fortune—first for the bass family and then for himself after rainwater left the basses goff joined him the thenyearold’s first assignment take  million and buy companies that had been hit by the october  stock market collapse “it was frightening but by this time i felt i could tear apart a financial statement as good as anybody” goff says “i worked from the ground up just trying to find companies that i liked that were being sold at what i felt were very cheap evaluations it was nirvana for me” quarterbacking staubach in the late s rainwater and goff were approached by roger staubach who was looking to focus his growing real estate firm at the time the staubach co was heavily invested in commercial properties “roger’s tenant rep business was quite small but it was profitable” goff says “we convinced him to focus exclusively on tenant rep and we invested  million for a  percent stake in the company” that  million eventually turned into more than  million through distributions and the  million sale to jones lang lasalle in “so many times the focus is on roger and football but he grew an incredible business” goff says staubach shares credit for his firm’s success with goff “john was very instrumental in some of the decisions we made through the years—richard too” staubach says “john is very smart financially and has a sense for people he helped me develop a concept to grow the company without accumulating a lot of debt” serving on the staubach co board goff saw the beginning of what would become a significant migration of companies from the coasts into north texas at the time though dallas was the most overbuilt market in the us “i went to richard and told him i wanted to take everything that was on my desk and set it aside and focus on the commercial real estate business” goff says “i thought it was a chance for me to start my own company he said ‘great you put up your entire net worth’ he then came up with what he was willing to expose to it—it was significant” reports had goff investing  million and rainwater backing it with  million “there was not one real estate professional in the area who thought it was a good idea” goff says “but i felt in my gut that it was the right time to do it as long as we could buy great assets at a discount to what they were built for” building a reit during winter months when he’s not in texas goff can often be found schussing down the slopes at beaver creek in colorado he loves to ski fast and he’s good at it having raced as part of a celebrity proam program several times when he works out he needs to be working toward something he says racing through a giant slalom course helps him do just that goff put that same drive and purpose into building crescent he began by lining up partners to invest in the various acquisitions the first was caroline rose hunt who was looking to recapitalize the crescent a  millionsquarefoot luxury office complex in uptown after that  partnership was created goff put together additional buys focusing exclusively on class a buildings he also took advantage of the real estate downturn to bring top leasing talent on board “i’d love to say it was easy but it was really hard” goff says “it took a number of years for the assets to turn around to fill them up and validate that we bought at the right price at the right time” in may  goff raised more cash by taking the company public with a  million ipo it was at this point that the venture was given a name—crescent real estate equities in honor of goff’s first buy and favorite property thirteen years later crescent which had become one of the largest real estate investment trusts in the country was sold to morgan stanley for  billion investors who got in at the ipo were rewarded with a  percent compounded internal rate of return including more than  billion in cash distributions “we were at a point where i felt prices had peaked” goff says “i’m not about to say that i was smart enough to see what was about to come it was just my gut again” crescent round two goff turned his focus to goff capital partners in  buying up more than  billion in distressed real estate debt and growing his team but by the summer of  rumors began to swirl that morgan stanley would be giving up crescent to lender barclays capital which had a  billion note coming due  goff wanted back in he tried to buy the whole thing on his own but the parties could not come to an agreement on price “what we were able to do was agree on a joint arrangement so barclays was able to stay in the deal and achieve upside along with me” he says barclays and goff capital inc formed crescent real estate holdings to acquire the crescent portfolio in november  at the helm again goff brought back five former crescent executives—including john zogg managing director of leasing—and went about stabilizing and improving the assets along with five resorts crescent owns  class a office buildings totaling  million square feet in dallas fort worth houston las vegas and denver goff scoffs at speculation that he is just repositioning the prized assets for sale “these are not workouts we are not interested in selling” he says “we are actually looking to grow the business and have already committed a significant amount of capital to new projects” goff’s gut is telling him  will be a great time to buy and he intends to listen it hasn’t let him down yet real estate most popular

 van stafford and lois stafford plaintiffs v we goff john c statler john arbuthnot and mark schmidt defendants civ a no c united states district court d colorado may    van stafford pro se l richard musatnancy lopez hall and evans denver colo rexford l mitchell mitchell  mitchell rocky ford colo for defendants  order carrigan district judge plaintiffs van and lois stafford brought this action pro se seeking damages under  usc §§   and  for alleged violations of their civil and constitutional rights although it is difficult to decipher the factual bases for the plaintiffs claims it appears that the alleged violations stem from the filing and prosecuting of a foreclosure proceeding against the plaintiffs farm under a federal land bank of wichita bank mortgage plaintiffs allege that the defendants john c statler district judge for baca county colorado willard goff sheriff of baca county john arbuthnot undersheriff of baca county and mark schmidt local counsel for the bank all conspired to deprive the plaintiffs of their civil and constitutional rights defendants have moved to dismiss on the grounds of immunity and failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted the parties have briefed the issues and oral argument would not assist in resolving them   claims under  usc §§  and  in order to state a claim under  usc §  the plaintiff must allege a racial or perhaps otherwise classbased invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirators action griffin v breckenridge  us    s ct    l ed d   there is no such allegation in the plaintiffs complaint therefore the plaintiffs §  claim must be dismissed because a claim for relief under §  is dependent upon the existence of a valid claim under §  the plaintiffs §  claim must also be dismissed brown v chaffee  fd  th cir    claims under  usc §  plaintiffs seek damages from judge statler for allegedly depriving them of property by signing several documents they also allege that judge statler knew or reasonably should have known of the fact that mark schmidt was not duly authorized to represent an instrumentality of the federal government and also knew that the federal land bank was foreclosing on a credit instrument these actions are claimed to be a conspiracy in violation of the plaintiffs civil and constitutional rights it is clear that a judge is absolutely immune from liability for damages under §  for actions arising out of the performance of his judicial functions unless he acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction stump v sparkman  us    s ct    l ed d   plaintiffs argue that judge statler was without jurisdiction to enter the orders which led to the foreclosure because the district court of baca county did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the action in support of this argument the plaintiffs  cite  usc §  which vests in the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over all actions arising under any act of congress relating to patents plaintiffs argue that a land patent which is the original source of their title is at issue and therefore that the baca county court had no jurisdiction over this matter this argument is wholly without merit the cited statute obviously does not apply judge statler and the baca county court clearly had jurisdiction to hear the foreclosure action and therefore judge statler is absolutely immune from liability for damages his motion to dismiss is therefore granted with respect to the claims against sheriff goff and undersheriff arbuthnot these defendants are protected by a qualified immunity pierson v ray  us   s ct   l ed d   in order to avoid dismissal of the claims against these two the plaintiffs must allege that they knew or reasonably should have known that the plaintiffs constitutional rights were being violated by their actions harlow v fitzgerald  us   s ct   l ed d   see also davis v sherer  us   s ct   l ed d   defendant who otherwise passes the harlow qualified immunity test regarding clearly settled constitutional law does not lose qualified immunity for violating clearly settled state law in this case the plaintiffs have not alleged that these two defendants knew or should have known that they were violating the plaintiffs rights therefore goff and arbuthnot are protected by qualified immunity the alleged violation of a state statute does not abrogate this immunity davis therefore the motion of the defendants goff and arbuthnot to dismiss is granted finally the plaintiffs claim against mark schmidt is based on allegations of conspiracy between mr schmidt and the other defendants the law requires that factual allegations supporting a claim of conspiracy under §  be pleaded with particularity although a pro se complaint must be construed as liberally as possible white v commissioner  f supp  dcolo mere conclusory assertions are insufficient in sooner products co v mcbride  fd  th cir the tenth circuit stated when a plaintiff in a §  action attempts to assert the necessary state action by implicating state officials or judges in a conspiracy with private defendants mere conclusory allegations with no supporting factual averments are insufficient the pleadings must specifically present facts tending to show agreement and concerted action clulow v oklahoma  fd   th cir the standard is even stricter where the state officials allegedly involved in the conspiracy are immune from suit as are the state court judges here shaffer v cook  fd   th cir per curiam cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   norton v liddel  fd   th cir id at  plaintiffs complaint does not satisfy this standard all claims against the defendant schmidt therefore shall be dismissed accordingly it is ordered that the complaint and action as against judge john c statler sheriff willard goff and undersheriff john arbuthnot are dismissed with prejudice the complaint and action as against the defendant mark schmidt are dismissed without prejudice search this case google scholar
