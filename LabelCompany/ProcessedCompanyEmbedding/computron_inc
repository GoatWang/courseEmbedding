zimmermann manager of the european sales division of computron inc trying to decide what price to submit on his bid to sell a computron x digital computer to konig  cie ag west germanys largest chemical company were mr zimmermann to follow computrons standard pricing policy of adding a  percent markup to factory costs and then including transportation costs and import duty the bid he would submit would amount to  mr zimmermann was afraid that a bid of this magnitude would not be low enough to win the contract for computron four other computer manufacturers had been invited by konig to submit bids for the contract mr zimmermann had received information from what he considered to be a reliable trade source which indicated that at least one of these four competitors was planning to name a price somewhere in the neighborhood of  computrons normal price of  would be  or approximately  percent higher than this price in conversations which he had had with konigs vice president in charge of purchasing mr zimmermann had been led to believe that computron would have a chance of winning the contract only if its bid were no more than  percent higher than the bid of the lowest competitor inasmuch as konig was computrons most important german customer mr zimmermann was particularly concerned about this contract and was wondering what strategy to employ in pricing his bid background on computron and its products computron inc was an american firm which had in the winter of  opened a european sales office in paris with mr zimmermann as its manager the companys main product both in the united states and in europe was the x computer a mediumsize digital computer designed specifically for process control applications in the  late  s the market for digital process control computers was growing quite rapidly these computers were substantially different from the computers used for data processing and engineering calculation they also were generally produced by companies which specialized in digital process control computers not by the manufacturers of office andor calculationoriented digital computers the companies also were different from those companies which had produced analog process control computersthe traditional units used for process control digital computers were classed as small medium or large depending on their size complexity and cost small computers sold in the price range up to  medium computers in the price range  to  and large computers in the price range  million to  million the computron iooox had been designed specifically for process control application it was used in chemical and other process industries oil refining pulp and paper food manufacture etc as well as in power plants particularly nuclear power plants in addition to its iooox computer computron manufactured a small line of accessory process control computer equipment these accessories however constituted a relatively insignificant share of the companys overall sales volume                         during the first  months after its opening the european sales office did only about  worth of business in the  fiscal year however sales increased sharply the total for the year being  million computrons total worldwide sales during that same year were roughly  million of the european countries germany was one of computrons most important markets having contributed  or  percent of the european sales total in  britain and sweden were likewise important markets having contributed  percent and  percent respectively to the  total the remaining  percent of sales was spread throughout the rest of europe             computron computers sold to european customers were manufactured and assembled in the united states and shipped to europe for installation because of their external manufacture these computers were subject to an import duty the amount of this tariff varied from country to country the german tariff on computers of this type sold by computron was   percent of the united states sales price             prompted primarily by a desire to reduce this importation duty computron was constructing a plant in frankfurt west germany this plant which would serve the entire european common market was scheduled for opening on september   initially it was to be used only for the assembly of x computers assembly in germany would lower the german importation duty from  percent to  percent ultimately the company planned to use the plant for the fabrication of component parts as well computers which were completely manufactured in germany would be entirely free from the importation duty             the new plant was to occupy  square feet and would employ  to  people in the first year the initial yearly overhead for this plant was expected to be approximately  as of july  the european sales office had no contracts on which the new plant could begin work although it was anticipated that the training of employees and the assembly and installation of a pilot model ox computer in the new plant could keep the plant busy for  or  months after it opened mr zimmermann was somewhat concerned about the possible risk that the new plant might have to sit idle after these first  or  months unless computron could win the present konig contract company pricing policy computron had always concentrated on being the quality bluechip company in its segment of the digital computer industry the company prided itself on manufacturing what it considered to be the best allaround computer of its kind in terms of precision dependability flexibility and ease of operation computron did not try to sell the ox on the basis of price the price charged by computron was very often higher than that being charged for competing equipment in spite of this fact the superior quality of computrons computers had to date enabled the company to compete successfully in boththe united states and europe the european price for the x computer was normally figured as follows   united states cost                 includes factory cost and factory overhead plus markup of  percent            to cover profit research and development on cost allowances and selling expenses transportation and installation costs plus importation duty  total european price prices calculated by the above method tended to vary slightly because of the countrytocountry difference in tariffs and the difference in components between specific computers in the case of the present konig application mr zimmermann had calculated that the normal price for the ox computer would be   exhibit  shows his calculations the   percent markup on cost used by the company was designed to provide a before tax profit margin of  percent a research and development allowance of  percent and a selling and administrative expense allowance of  percent the stated policy of top management was clearly against cutting this markup in order to obtain sales management felt that the practice of cutting prices not only reduced profits but also reflected unfavorably on the companys quality image mr zimmermann knew that computrons president was especially eager not to cut prices at this particular moment inasmuch as computrons overall profit before taxes had been only  percent of sales in  as compared with  percent in  consequently the president had stated that he not only wanted to try to maintain the   percent markup on cost he also was eager to raise it in spite of computrons policy of maintaining prices mr zimmermann was aware of a few isolated instances when the markup on cost had been dropped to the neighborhood of  percent in order to obtain important orders in the united states in fact he was aware of one instance in the united states when the markup had been cut to  percent in the european market however computron had never yet deviated from the policy of maintaining a   percent markup on cost   depending on the specific application in question the components of the x varied slightly so that each machine was somewhat different from the rest exhibit  calculated normal ppdce for the ox computer for konig factory cost                                           markup on cost                           us list price                                        import duty  of us list price        transportation and installation             total normal price                                   the customer konig  cie ag was the largest manufacturer and processor of basic chemicals and chemical products in west germany it operated a number of chemical plants located throughout the country to date it had purchased three digital computer process control systems all from computron the three systems had been bought during  and had represented  million worth of business for computron thus konig was computrons largest german customer and had alone accounted for over  percent of computrons  sales to germany mr zimmermann felt that the primary reason konig had purchased computron computer systems in the past was their proven reputation for flexibility accuracy and overall high quality so far konig officials seemed well pleased with the performance of their computron computers looking ahead mr zimmermann felt that konig in contrast to any other single german customer would continue to represent more potential future business he estimated that during the next year or two konig would have a need for another  million worth of digital computer equipment the computer on which konig was presently inviting bids was to be used in the training of operators for a new chemical plant the training program was to last approximately  to  years at the end of the program the computer would be either scrapped or converted for other uses the calculations which the computer would be called upon to perform were highly specialized and would require little machine flexablity in the specifications which had been published along with the invitation to bid konig management had stated that in buying this computer konig was primarily interested in dependability and a reasonable price machine flexibility and pinpoint accuracy were listed as being of very minor importance inasmuch as the machine was to be used primarily for training purposes and not for onfine process control   competition in west germany approximately nine companies were competing with computron in the sale of mediumpriced digital process control computers exhibit  shows a breakdown of sales among these companies for  year as can be seen from this exhibit four companies accounted for  percent of industry wide sales in  mr zimmermann was primarily concerned with the competition offered by the following companies ruhr machinenfabrik ag a very aggressive german company which was trying hard to expand its share of the market ruhr sold a exhibit   market shares for companies selling mediumpriced digital computers to the west german market                                                                                                 dollars                      computron inc                                                                                 ruhr machinenfabrik ag                                                                   elektronische datenverarbeitungsanlagen ag

                                                                                               mediumquality generalpurpose digital computer at a price which was roughly   percent lower than the price which computron charged for its x computer seventeen and onehalf percentage points of this price differential was attributable to the fact that there was no import duty on the ruhr machine inasmuch as it was manufactured entirely in germany though to date ruhr had sold only generalpurpose computers reliable trade source dictated that the company was presently developing a special computer in an effort to win the konig bid the price which ruhr was planning to place on the specialpurpose computer was reported to be in the neighborhood of  elektronische datenverarbeitungsaniagen ag a relatively new company which had recently developed a generalpurpose computer of a quality comparable to that of the computron x mr zimmermann felt that elektronische datenverarbeitungsanlagen presented a real longrange threat to computrons position as the bluechip company in the industry in order to get a foothold in the industry it had sold its first computer almost at cost since that time however it had undersold computron only by the amount of the import duty to which computrons computers were subject digitexgmbh a subsidiary of an american firm this company had complete manufacturing facilities in germany and produced a wide line of computer equipment the digitex computer which competed with the computron x was only of fair quality digitex often engaged in pricecutting tactics and the price which it charged for its computer had sometimes in the past been as much as  percent lower than that charged by computron for its x in spite of this difference computron had usually been able to compete successfully against digitex because of the technical superiority of the computron x mr zimmermann was not overly concerned about the remaining competitors inasmuch as he did not consider them significant factors in computrons segment of the computer industry   the west german market for mediumpriced digital computers the total estimated west german market for mediumpriced digital process control computers of the type manufactured by computron was presently running at about  million per year mr zimmermann thought that this market could be expected to increase at an annual rate of about  percent for the next several years for  he already had positive knowledge of about  worth of specific new business this new business was broken down as follows kdnig  cie ag frankfurt plant                                                   dusseldorf plant                                                  mannheim plant                                                  central german power commission                    deutsche autowerke                                                    the above business was in addition to the computer which konig was presently seeking for its new experimental pilot plant none of this already known business was expected to materialize until late spring or early summer     deadline for bids in the light of the various facts and considerations discussed above mr zimmermann was wondering what price to bid on the konig contract the deadline for the submission of bids to konig was august   since this was less than  weeks away he knew he would have to reach a decision sometime during the next few days   precision sheet metal shop with cnc machining precision sheet metal shop with cnc machining home about us testimonials contact us polished
