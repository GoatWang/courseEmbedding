changes its name to dynegy inc  company purchases illinova including subsidiary illinois power  company backs out of a deal to purchase troubled rival enron company history dynegy inc is one of the worlds leading energy commodity and service providers offering onestop gathering processing marketing and transportation of natural gas natural gas liquids crude oil and electricity led almost since its formation by chairman and ceo charles l chuck watson dynegy achieved its market dominance through several mergers and acquisitions in the middle and late s by the early s subsidiary dynegy midstream services had become a top producer and marketer of natural gas liquids in north america with an interest in about  miles of pipelines and more than  gas processing facilities dynegy marketing and trade was a leading producer of electricity with  megawatts mw of generating capacity and a top marketer and trader of natural gas and power dynegys subsidiary illinois power served  electricity and natural gas customers in  and dynegy global communications moved its parent company into the broadband market with a mile fiber optic network dynegys marketing arm essentially acts as an energy services middleman dynegy has arranged for the purchase of natural gas supplies from as many as  different suppliers ranging from major natural gas producers to small independents the company has purchased or negotiated for the purchase of specific volumes of natural gas through fixed shortterm and longterm contracts and arranged for their transmission or transportation through companyowned and thirdparty pipeline systems supplies purchased have been aggregated by the company and resold to the companys customers including local distribution companies energy utility companies power plants and retail and industrial endusers dynegy complements its marketing activities with the gathering processing fractionation that is separation into component parts and transmission of natural gas liquids crude oil and other petroleum and gasbased products such as butane negotiating the deregulation of the s the natural gas industry was tightly regulated until the late s with the gathering transportation and marketing of natural gas dominated by a few companies and pricing restrictions that kept gas prices below market value prior to deregulation natural gas typically was sold on a flatrate longterm contract basis gas producers sold to interstate pipeline companies which sold the gas to distributors which in turn marketed the gas to endusers the national gas policy act ngpa of  began the process of deregulation loosening restrictions on the transmission marketing and production of natural gas and establishing new pricing layers which removed price controls from new gas production over the next decade and a half the ngpa would be implemented by a series of orders promulgated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc beginning with order  introduced in  which allowed thirdparty marketers to sell gas at prices competitive with the gas producers this was followed by order  which allowed transportation of natural gas over interstate pipelines and opened the way for marketresponsive pricing the immediate effect of the ngpa was to increase drilling activities as producers sought to develop gas resources that could be sold without pricing restrictions but in  with the onset of a national recession demand for natural gas collapsed this situation opened the way for a new method of selling gas spot pricing and with the deregulation of the industry gave rise to an industry of thirdparty marketers the natural gas clearinghouse was set up in june  as a broker for negotiating spot market transactions between producers and endusers the clearinghouse itself would not take title to the gas it brokered the clearinghouse was formed as a joint venture by investment banker morgan stanley new york law firm akin gump strauss hauer  feld and transco energy company an interstate natural gas pipeline company with a mile system reaching an state market by october  the clearinghouse was in business arranging its first spot market sale of  million daily cubic feet of natural gas the company also negotiated with other pipeline systems to link up with the clearinghouse the venture struggled in its first year then transco and other pipeline companies defected believing they could negotiate better pricing on their own morgan stanley bought out transco and akin gump in  for  million and recruited chuck watson to head up the company watson then  years old had gained  years of experience in the energy industry at conoco oil born at the great lakes naval academy in illinois watson graduated with a business degree from oklahoma state university and went to work for conoco considered a rising star at the company watson received a series of promotions around the company giving him a wide range of exposure to pipeline transportation and operations and to the marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids when morgan stanley hired him as president and ceo of the natural gas clearinghouse watson set out to change the companys focus instead of merely acting as a broker watson used morgan stanleys financial backing to buy and then resell gas while also beginning to build the companys own transmission distribution and processing infrastructure through a series of acquisitions meanwhile new orders promulgated by ferc began to increase the volumes of gas the independent marketers were allowed to handle the clearinghouse quickly gained a leadership position in the gas marketing field seeing sales rise to  billion daily cubic feet by  and then top two billion daily cubic feet the following year making the clearinghouse the countrys largest independent natural gas marketer the bill gates of gas in the s watson sought further growth for the company in  he arranged to sell the clearinghouse to two oil and gas exploration and production companies apache corporation and noble affiliates inc gaining those companies financial backing to fuel expansion watson remained as president ceo and ultimately chairman of the clearinghouse at the end of  he arranged for the clearinghouse to acquire apaches nagasco inc gas gathering system boosting the clearinghouses natural gas volume to  billion daily cubic feet the following year the clearinghouse which had been developing natural gas futures began trading gas futures at the new york mercantile exchange by  the clearinghouse was posting annual revenues of  billion by the beginning of the s however margins on sales of natural gas were dropping from a high of  cents per  cubic feet to the singledigit range in the s reaching a low of two to three cents per  cubic feet in the s watson responded by expanding the clearinghouse beyond natural gas marketing into gathering processing and marketing natural gas as well as other fuel oils building the clearinghouse into a onestop energy store the company formed its ngc oil trading and transportation subsidiary and began expanding its gathering and processing capacity through acquisitions and contracts of facilities between  and early  the company spent some  million buying gathering systems and processing and storage facilities financing the companys expansion came from selling it adding dekalb energy company to the list of owners then in  the company which had revenues of nearly  billion in  with an operating profit of  million was sold to louisville gas  electric company and british gas each of which controlled a onethird share of the company management retained control of the remaining onethird in that year ferc order  took away the last of the regulatory restrictions on the natural gas industry in response the clearinghouse through a new subsidiary hub services inc joined with three gas utility companies to form enerchange llc which would own and operate three natural gas marketing hubs the hubs which were located at the intersection of interstate pipelines offered various transaction services to customers including taking deliveries from multiple suppliers and arranging sales to a range of distributors and endusers the companys revenues aided by growing sales of natural gas liquids and crude oil neared  billion in  and  billion in  the companys operating profit a key industry indicator also remained strong at  million in  and  million in  net profits for these years were  and  million respectively highlighting the tight margins available in the industry these margins were also leading to an industry shakeout as the field of marketers began to narrow and mergers and acquisitions among industry giants marked the industrys consolidation canadas nova corporation entered the us field in  paying  million for louisville gas  electrics share in the clearinghouse ownership was now split at  percent held by both nova and british gas and  percent held by clearinghouse management terms of the nova acquisition also brought the clearinghouse into canada through a  percent joint venture in novagas clearinghouse ltd based in calgary also in  the clearinghouse moved to enter the european market then beginning its own deregulation forming the accord energy joint venture with british gas watson however continued to steer the clearinghouse toward his energy store concept in  the company took an important step toward increasing its capacity in products other than natural gas when it merged with publicly held trident ngl holdings inc the deal worth more than  million in cash stock and the assumption of tridents debt more than doubled the companys natural gas liquids capacity the merger also took the company public the companys name was changed to ngc corporation reflecting the companys diversification from its natural gas marketing base by  natural gas marketing contributed only  percent of the companys  billion in revenues by then watson was already preparing to complete the companys energy store concept bringing ngc into selling electricity setting up its electric clearinghouse subsidiary in  ngc was poised to take advantage of the coming deregulation of the electricity marketing industry which at an estimated  billion per year was some three times larger than the natural gas market the energy store concept was not unique to ngc the importance of being able to offer customers a full range of energy services was recognized throughout the industry a new wave of mergers and acquisitions swept the industry with the trident merger ngcs share of the market had grown to  percent and the company began to forecast capturing as much as  percent during the second half of the decade by the end of  however the company had easily surpassed its own forecast in january  ngc entered talks with industry giant chevron corporation to merge chevrons gas gathering processing and marketing operations with ngc by june of that year the companies had reached agreement and by september  the merger was completed ngc acquired chevrons natural gas business unit and parts of its warren petroleum subsidiary chevron joined british gas and nova as owners of ngc with each controlling approximately  percent of the company ngcs trident subsidiary was renamed warren petroleum and chevrons natural gas marketing activities were merged under the natural gas clearinghouse subsidiary the chevron merger also added to the companys electricity capacity making ngc the countrys third largest independent power marketer with the merger ngc also became the industrys largest gas marketer with daily volumes of ten billion cubic feet and daily sales of some  barrels of natural gas liquids taking a  percent share of the market analysts began comparing watson who had steered ngc to become one of the top  businesses in the country with microsofts bill gates watson stepped down as president in november  but retained his chairman and ceo titles promising to continue controlling daytoday activities  further growth through acquisitions in january  the company announced its intention to spend  million on capital improvements investments and acquisitions the companys efforts to purchase more electric power plants and gas processing plants was thwarted by a lack of cash only  percent of ngc was traded publicly the rest was owned by employees and three companies watson arranged to buy out nova and british gas and float their shares on the market raising the publicly traded portion of the company to  percent the resulting funds helped ngc purchase destec energy an independent power producer ngc sold destecs foreign operations its tiger bay cogeneration plant and its lignite reserves but hung on to its us power plants also in  ngc formed several alliances with regional power companies including nicor all energy and canadas consumersfirst the company continued that strategy in  joining forces in the southeast with piedmont natural gas and agl resources to create southstar energy these joint ventures gave ngc an entrée into local retail markets that same year ngc changed its name to dynegy inc with revenues of  billion in  dynegy had more than doubled its  take of  billion although net income  million was only  percent of revenues it represented a respectable margin for a wholesaler the companys retail energy business proved unprofitable in  losing the company  million dynegy however was not willing to abandon the electricity retail market following its successful strategy in the gas market of purchasing gas processing plants and large producers dynegy sought to acquire its own electric power producer eventually settling on illinova financial difficulties at illinova helped dynegy negotiate the bargain basement price of  billion in  dynegy finalized its purchase of illinova acquiring in the process yearold illinois power five power plants and more than  retail customers focusing more resources on retail electricity meant dynegy had to pull back in other areas in  the companys midstream business sold four gas processing plants thus reducing operating expenses by  million the following year oneok bought more of dynegys natural gas assets for  million with a plan to trade bandwidth online dynegy purchased two fiberoptic network providers in  taxis in britain and extant in the united states the company also began selling electricity and natural gas online in  through dynegydirect enron angst in  having long stood in the shadow of its rival enron dynegy jumped at the chance to play the white knight when enron faced possible financial ruin in  as the preeminent energy trader in the world enron was valued at  billion early in the year several highlevel resignations and revelations about suspect accounting practices that may have inflated the companys bottom line sent enrons stock plummeting in november dynegy announced that it would save enron by purchasing it for only  billion in dynegy stock further nasty revelations about enrons financial position kept its stock falling until only two weeks after dynegys offer enrons market capitalization was  million dynegy pulled out of the deal sealing enrons fate its stock fell to below  a share and bankruptcy was inevitable the failed deal was not entirely a fiasco for dynegy however dynegy had invested  billion in enron as part of the merger terms in return for the right to acquire enrons subsidiary northern natural gas nng if the merger fell through the us natural gas pipeline was valued at  billion before the deal making it a nice consolation prize although enron fought the transfer of the subsidiary at the end of january  dynegy announced that it had completed its acquisition of nng the spectacular collapse of enron led to a closer scrutiny of its fellow energy traders who seemed tainted by association although energy trading accounted for only  percent of dynegys revenues compared with  percent at enron dynegy saw its stock drop to  a share by january  falling oil and gas prices also hurt dynegys prospects early in  ceo watson promised to improve the companys liquidity and bolster its bottom line with a  billion restructuring plan asset sales and capital expense reductions would bring in about  million and a stock offering was expected to raise another  million whether these measures would be enough to reassure nervous investors remained to be seen principal subsidiaries dynegy canada dynegy customer care dynegy europe energy dynegy europe communications
