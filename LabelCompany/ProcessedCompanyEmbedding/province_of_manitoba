founded settlements and other tribes entered the area to trade in northern manitoba quartz was mined to make arrowheads the first farming in manitoba was along the red river where corn and other seed crops were planted before contact with europeans first nations would stampede american bison over these cliffs near cartwright manitoba in  henry hudson was one of the first europeans to sail into what is now known as hudson bay where he was abandoned by his crew the first european to reach presentday central and southern manitoba was sir thomas button who travelled upstream along the nelson river to lake winnipeg in  in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue hudson when the british ship nonsuch sailed into hudson bay in – she became the first trading vessel to reach the area that voyage led to the formation of the hudsons bay company to which the british government gave absolute control of the entire hudson bay watershed this watershed was named ruperts land after prince rupert who helped to subsidize the hudsons bay company york factory was founded in  after the original fort of the hudsons bay company fort nelson built in  was destroyed by rival french traders

brought into canada as a province in  louis riel was pursued by british army officer garnet wolseley because of the rebellion and riel fled into exile the canadian government blocked the métis attempts to obtain land promised to them as part of manitobas entry into confederation facing racism from the new flood of white settlers from ontario large numbers of métis moved to what would become saskatchewan and alberta numbered treaties were signed in the late th century with the chiefs of various first nations that lived in the area these treaties made specific promises of land for every family as a result a reserve system was established under the jurisdiction of the federal government the prescribed amount of land promised to the native peoples was not always given this led aboriginal groups to assert rights to the land through aboriginal land claims many of which are still ongoing the original province of manitoba was a square oneeighteenth of its current size and was known colloquially as the postage stamp province its borders were expanded in  taking land from the northwest territories and the district of keewatin but ontario claimed a large portion of the land

turtle mountain area the ojibwe cree dene sioux mandan and assiniboine peoples founded settlements and other tribes entered the area to trade in northern manitoba quartz was mined to make arrowheads the first farming in manitoba was along the red river where corn and other seed crops were planted before contact with europeans first nations would stampede american bison over these cliffs near cartwright manitoba in  henry hudson was one of the first europeans to sail into what is now known as hudson bay where he was abandoned by his crew the first european to reach presentday central and southern manitoba was sir thomas button who travelled upstream along the nelson river to lake winnipeg in  in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue hudson when the british ship nonsuch sailed into hudson bay in – she became the first trading vessel to reach the area that voyage led to the formation of the hudsons bay company to which the british government gave absolute control of the entire hudson bay watershed this watershed was named ruperts land after prince rupert who helped to subsidize the hudsons bay company york factory was founded in  after the original fort of the hudsons bay company fort nelson built in  was destroyed by rival french traders pierre gaultier de varennes sieur de la vérendrye visited the red river valley in the s to help open the area for french

canadian house of commons the bill was given royal assent and manitoba was brought into canada as a province in  louis riel was pursued by british army officer garnet wolseley because of the rebellion and riel fled into exile the canadian government blocked the métis attempts to obtain land promised to them as part of manitobas entry into confederation facing racism from the new flood of white settlers from ontario large numbers of métis moved to what would become saskatchewan and alberta numbered treaties were signed in the late th century with the chiefs of various first nations that lived in the area these treaties made specific promises of land for every family as a result a reserve system was established under the jurisdiction of the federal government the prescribed amount of land promised to the native peoples was not always given this led aboriginal groups to assert rights to the land through aboriginal land claims many of which are still ongoing the original province of

southern manitoba was sir thomas button who travelled upstream along the nelson river to lake winnipeg in  in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue hudson when the british ship nonsuch sailed into hudson bay in – she became the first trading vessel to reach the area that voyage led to the formation of the hudsons bay company to which the british government gave absolute control of the

southern manitoba was sir thomas button who travelled upstream along the nelson river to lake winnipeg in  in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue hudson when the british ship nonsuch sailed into hudson bay in – she became the first trading vessel to reach the area that voyage led to the formation of the hudsons bay company to which the british government gave absolute control of the entire hudson bay watershed this watershed was named ruperts land after prince rupert who helped to subsidize the hudsons bay company york factory was founded in  after the original fort of the

southern manitoba was sir thomas button who travelled upstream along the nelson river to lake winnipeg in  in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue hudson when the british ship nonsuch sailed into hudson bay in – she became the first trading vessel to reach the area that voyage led to the formation of the hudsons bay company to which the british government gave absolute control of the entire hudson bay watershed this watershed was named ruperts land after prince rupert who helped to subsidize the hudsons bay company york factory was founded in  after the original fort of the

european settlementedit modernday manitoba was inhabited by the first nations people shortly after the last ice age glaciers retreated in the southwest about  years ago the first exposed land was the turtle mountain area the ojibwe cree dene sioux mandan and assiniboine peoples founded settlements and other tribes entered the area to trade in northern manitoba quartz was mined to make arrowheads the first farming in manitoba was along the red river where corn and other seed crops were planted before contact with europeans first nations would stampede american bison over these cliffs near cartwright manitoba in  henry hudson was one of the first europeans to sail into what is now known as hudson bay where he was abandoned by his crew the first european to reach presentday central and southern manitoba was sir thomas button who travelled upstream along the nelson river to lake winnipeg in  in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue hudson when the british ship nonsuch sailed into hudson bay in – she became the first trading vessel to reach the area that voyage led to the formation of the hudsons bay company to which the british government gave absolute control of the entire hudson bay watershed this watershed was named ruperts land after prince rupert who helped to subsidize the hudsons bay company york factory was founded in  after the original fort of the hudsons bay company fort nelson built in  was destroyed by rival french traders pierre gaultier de varennes sieur de la vérendrye visited the red river valley in the s to help open the area for french exploration and trade as french explorers entered the area a montrealbased company the north west company began trading with the métis both the north west company and the hudsons bay company built

confederationedit evolution of canadian provinces –present ruperts land was ceded to canada by the hudsons bay company in  and incorporated into the northwest territories a lack of attention to métis concerns caused métis leader louis riel to establish a local provisional government as part of the red river rebellion in response prime minister john a macdonald introduced the manitoba act in the canadian house of commons the bill was given royal assent and manitoba was brought into canada as a province in  louis riel was pursued by british army officer garnet wolseley because of the rebellion and riel fled into exile the canadian government blocked the métis attempts to obtain land promised to them as part of manitobas entry into confederation facing racism from the new flood of white settlers from ontario large numbers of métis moved to what would become saskatchewan and alberta numbered treaties were signed in the late th century with the chiefs of various first nations that lived in the area these treaties made specific promises of land for every family as a result a reserve system was established under the jurisdiction of the federal government the prescribed amount of land promised to the native peoples was not always given this led aboriginal groups to assert rights to the land through aboriginal land claims many of which are still ongoing the original province of manitoba was a square oneeighteenth of its current size and was known colloquially as the postage stamp province its borders were expanded in  taking land from the northwest territories and the district of keewatin but ontario claimed a large portion of the land the disputed portion was awarded to ontario in  manitoba grew to its current size in  absorbing land from the northwest territories

protestants from  to  demanded the end of french schools in  the manitoba legislature passed a law removing funding for french catholic schools the french catholic minority asked the federal government for support however the orange order and other anticatholic forces mobilized nationwide to oppose them the federal conservatives proposed remedial legislation to override manitoba but they were blocked by the liberals led by wilfrid laurier who opposed the remedial legislation because of his belief in provincial rights once elected prime minister in  laurier implemented a compromise

turtle mountain area the ojibwe cree dene sioux mandan and assiniboine peoples founded settlements and other tribes entered the area to trade in northern manitoba quartz was mined to make arrowheads the first farming in manitoba was along the red river where corn and other seed crops were planted before contact with europeans first nations would stampede american bison over these cliffs near cartwright manitoba in  henry hudson was one of the first europeans to sail into what is now known as hudson bay where he was abandoned by his crew the first european to reach presentday central and southern manitoba was sir thomas button who travelled upstream along the nelson river to lake winnipeg in  in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue hudson when the british ship nonsuch sailed into hudson bay in – she became the first trading vessel to reach the area that voyage led to the formation of the hudsons bay company to which the british government gave absolute control of the entire hudson bay watershed this watershed was named ruperts land after prince rupert who helped to subsidize the hudsons bay company york factory was founded in  after the original fort of the hudsons bay company fort nelson built in  was destroyed by rival french traders pierre gaultier de varennes sieur de la vérendrye visited the red river valley in the s to help open the area for french

canadian house of commons the bill was given royal assent and manitoba was brought into canada as a province in  louis riel was pursued by british army officer garnet wolseley because of the rebellion and riel fled into exile the canadian government blocked the métis attempts to obtain land promised to them as part of manitobas entry into confederation facing racism from the new flood of white settlers from ontario large numbers of métis moved to what would become saskatchewan and alberta numbered treaties were signed in the late th century with the chiefs of various first nations that lived in the area these treaties made specific promises of land for every family as a result a reserve system was established under the jurisdiction of the federal government the prescribed amount of land promised to the native peoples was not always given this led aboriginal groups to assert rights to the land through aboriginal land claims many of which are still ongoing the original province of manitoba was a square oneeighteenth of its current size and was known colloquially as the postage stamp province its borders were expanded in  taking land from the northwest territories and the

chipewyan indians in the north and the inuit aboriginal arctic people of canada called eskimo in the united states on the hudson bay coast the aboriginal peoples have occupied the region for thousands of years although historically there has been considerable population movement in addition their numbers were greatly reduced as a result of exposure to european diseases particularly smallpox in the early th century the métis people of mixed indian and european ancestry whom the canadian government granted legal recognition as a native group at the beginning of the st century developed a unique plains culture the early agricultural red river settlement attracted a number of scottish farmers and improvements to river and rail transportation led to the rapid growth of european settlement between  and  most early settlers were from elsewhere in canada but icelanders and germanspeaking mennonites also arrived beginning in the s after  immigration from eastern europe began in considerable numbers manitoba’s population declined during the great depression in the s and world war ii but grew steadily thereafter largely through natural increasemanitoba is noted for its ethnic diversity there are many ethnic enclaves within the city of winnipeg notably the north end of the city retains a strong eastern european character and the st boniface district has one of the largest francophone communities outside quebec francophones established a number of communities south of winnipeg germans settled in southcentral manitoba and a sizable icelandic settlement developed around gimli on the shores of lake winnipeg although more than twofifths of the current population is of british descent significant ethnic minorities include germans ukrainians french south asians italians filipinos vietnamese and poles roman catholicism and the united church of canada are the largest religious denominations although there are substantial numbers of anglicans lutherans mennonites and adherents to eastern orthodoxy and the ukrainian catholic eastern rite church plus many smaller groups winnipeg’s jewish community is the largest in the prairie provincessettlement patternsin the south manitoba’s countryside has an older more occupied look than those of the other prairie provinces the development of the red river settlement in the th century gave the early province a distinctly rural character the rapid occupation of the agricultural lands between  and  and subsequent expansion into the interlake and northwest areas maintained the rural dominance during world war ii however the ruralurban balance tipped since then the depopulation of rural manitoba has continued apace and winnipeg and the province’s network of smaller urban centres have grown accordingly by the turn of the st century nearly threefourths of the province’s population was urban over fourfifths of this urban population and about threefifths of the total population of the province resides in metropolitan winnipegother than winnipeg the province’s main towns are brandon an industrial and agricultural centre serving the southwest thompson a nickelmining and nickelprocessing town in the

dauphin a regional service town in westcentral manitoba selkirk the centre of commercial fishing and water transportation on lake winnipeg and several service towns such as steinbach and morden in the southeastern regionbrandon manmalak ottawademographic trendsmainly because manitoba’s economy faltered in the late th century at least by comparison with the economies of other western canadian provinces there has been a steady outmigration of young people and professionals to other provinces—especially the canadian west immigration to the province now comes mainly from lessdeveloped countries manitoba’s population also has become consistently older since the end of world war ii the province’s birth rate is slightly higher than the national average as a result of all of these factors manitoba’s population was barely growing at the end of the th century and the beginning of the steconomyagriculture forestry and fishingagriculture remains an important sector of the manitoban economy though climate and soil types limit agricultural production indeed some marginal areas including the interlake district have been farmed for several generations with little success a significant portion of the province lies north of the rd parallel where the canadian shield begins and has an extremely short growing season while much of the agricultural production is grain for export a sizable market gardening sector cultivation of vegetables and flowers for sale in nearby markets has developed in the lands bordering the red and assiniboine rivers in addition poultry hogs and cattle are raised throughout the southern districts of the province and the livestock sector has grown significantly wheat remains the province’s main crop others include barley rapeseed canola flaxseed oats rye sugar beets sunflowers corn maize and canning vegetables dairy products eggs and potatoes are also importantfield of sunflowers on a farm in the assiniboine river valley near

involved with resource processing meatpacking flour milling and the production of lumber pulp and paper distilling printing textile manufacture and nickel and copper ore smelting also remain important beginning in the latter part of the th century the economy was supplemented by technology industries including the manufacture of aeronautical systems computers and electrical equipment although no single industry dominates the manitoba economy many communities are dependent upon only one industry in general manitoba’s nonresourcebased industries are located in the winnipeg area while those based on resource processing are found throughout the provinceservices labour and taxationthe service sector has become the largest single part of manitoba’s economy winnipeg once the commercial centre for western canada remains a major financial centre and home to the winnipeg commodity exchange as well as other financial institutions including insurance companies the growth of government services also has contributed to the expansion of manitoba’s service sector as has tourism which increased steadily at the end of the th century although the province’s distance from the centres of north american population remains a drawback sportfishing is particularly vital to manitoba’s tourist industrygovernment revenues are derived largely from taxation and federal grants with a small portion coming from fees and royalties on hunting fishing and oil as well as from other sourcestransportation and telecommunicationsbecause of its central location manitoba has long been a focus for transportation activity the construction of transcontinental railways after manitoba joined the confederation in  stimulated much development in the region with the growth of roadways and the decline

publishing industry centred in winnipeghistorythe furtrade eraaboriginal indian first nations and inuit peoples who had lived in the manitoba region for thousands of years first came in contact with europeans through the fur trade explorers searching for the northwest passage reached hudson bay in  when henry hudson navigated the east side of the bay to which he gave his name he was followed by a number of adventurers including thomas button  jens munk  and luke fox and thomas james  as a result of the opening of the fur trade in hudson bay by french canadian adventurers pierre radisson and médard chouart des grosseilliers the hudson’s bay company was incorporated in england in  and granted a monopoly over the fur trade in an area designated as rupert’s land the hudson’s bay company established a number of posts along the bay the company faced tremendous competition from french traders who led by pierre gaultier de varennes et de la vérendrye reached the red river in the early s and established a series of posts in the area including fort rouge on the present site of winnipeg the french forced the hudson’s bay company to expand inland but the british traders were unable to compete successfully with other traders based in montreal who eventually organized as the north west company that company’s agents known as nor’westers came overland into the region and wintered with the aboriginal peoples to facilitate fur trading with them the agents also worked closely with the métis and resisted the british company’s attempts to establish an agricultural colony at red river several decades of intense competition between the british and french canadian traders ensued the bitter often violent competition culminated in the seven oaks massacre of  increasing violence and declining profits forced the two firms to merge into the hudson’s bay company in settlementthe successful settlement of the western united states in the th century encouraged expansionists in central canada to look to the western regions of british north america as canada’s natural hinterland the agricultural potential of the vast prairie lands west of red river was documented by two scientific expeditions in  the palliser expedition commissioned by the british government and led by john palliser and the henry youle hind expedition authorized by the government of canada negotiations between the hudson’s bay company the british government and the government of the new dominion of canada resulted in an agreement in  to transfer rupert’s land to canada in  under the manitoba act the territory joined the confederation as a province the remaining lands were designated the northwest territoriesthe federal government encouraged western settlement by providing land to wouldbe settlers there was an initial rush to the new province but the absence of a rail connection to markets reduced the attractiveness of the region construction of the canadian pacific railway had reached manitoba by the early s however settlement was delayed by a métis uprising in  and further slowed by the continued availability of homestead lands in the united states nevertheless some settlers did come during this period among them ontario farmers mennonite immigrants and icelandic peoples at the turn of the century immigration to manitoba boomed fueled by massive government advertising social conditions in europe and the decline in available land in the united statesmanitoba since the immigration boom ushered in an era of prosperity and growth winnipeg grew rapidly becoming the major urban centre for western canada and earning the nickname “chicago of the north” manitoba farmers aided by reduced freight rates higher world prices for wheat and improved strains of grain seed enjoyed unprecedented prosperity manitoba’s economy was transformed during the early part of the century a strong agricultural sector diversified among wheat and other grains livestock and market gardening provided the basis for a rapid increase in the commercial and industrial economy especially around winnipeg manitoba’s boundaries expanded westward in  eastward in  and northward in  mainly at the expense of the northwest territoriesthe economic boom ended just before world war i ushering in a depression that lasted through the first years of the conflict labour unrest over wages and working conditions arose during the war and peaked afterward with the winnipeg general strike of  the province was severely affected by the great depression of the s although the problem was more one of prices than of production in the agricultural sector nonpartisan or coalition governments ruled the province from  to  when dufferin roblin led the progressive conservatives into office the return to prosperity during world war ii was matched by a resolve to diversify the province’s economic base the provincial government gained control of natural resources in the s and began to encourage northern development particularly of mining and lumbering government involvement in the economy peaked during the administrations of the new democratic party ndp from  to  and  to  with major investments in infrastructure and some controversial experiments in direct ownershipindicators of the province’s future in the st century are mixed on one hand manitoba’s economy is growing stronger and more

european settlementedit modernday manitoba was inhabited by the first nations people shortly after the last ice age glaciers retreated in the southwest about  years ago the first exposed land was the turtle mountain area the ojibwe cree dene sioux mandan and assiniboine peoples founded settlements and other tribes entered the area to trade in northern manitoba quartz was mined to make arrowheads the first farming in manitoba was along the red river where corn and other seed crops were planted before contact with europeans first nations would stampede american bison over these cliffs near cartwright manitoba in  henry hudson was one of the first europeans to sail into what is now known as hudson bay where he was abandoned by his crew the first european to reach presentday central and southern manitoba was sir thomas button who travelled upstream along the nelson river to lake winnipeg in  in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue hudson when the british ship nonsuch sailed into hudson bay in – she became the first trading vessel to reach the area that voyage led to the formation of the hudsons bay company to which the british government gave absolute control of the entire hudson bay watershed this watershed was named ruperts land after prince rupert who helped to subsidize the hudsons bay company york factory was founded in  after the original fort of the hudsons bay company fort nelson built in  was destroyed by rival french traders pierre gaultier de varennes sieur de la vérendrye visited the red river valley in the s to help open the area for french exploration and trade as french explorers entered the area a montrealbased company the north west company began trading with the métis both the north west company and the hudsons bay company built furtrading forts the two companies competed in southern manitoba occasionally resulting in violence until they merged in  the hudsons bay company archives in winnipeg preserve the history of this era

colonists including the governor and one métis were killed in the battle of seven oaks in  thomas spence attempted to be president of the republic of manitobah in  that he and his council named confederationedit evolution of canadian provinces –present ruperts land was ceded to canada by the hudsons bay company in  and incorporated into the northwest territories a lack of attention to métis concerns caused métis leader louis riel to establish a local provisional government as part of the red river rebellion in response prime minister john a macdonald introduced the manitoba act in the canadian house of commons the bill was given royal assent and manitoba was brought into canada as a province in  louis riel was pursued by british army officer garnet wolseley because of the rebellion and riel fled into exile the canadian government blocked the métis attempts to obtain land promised to them as part of manitobas entry into confederation facing racism from the new flood of white settlers from ontario large numbers of métis moved to what would become saskatchewan and alberta numbered treaties were signed in the late th century with the chiefs of various first nations that lived in the area these treaties made specific promises of land for every family as a result a reserve system was established under the jurisdiction of the federal government the prescribed amount of land promised to the native peoples was not always given this led aboriginal groups to assert rights to the land through aboriginal land claims many of which are still ongoing the original province of manitoba was a square oneeighteenth of its current size and was known colloquially as the postage stamp province its borders were expanded in  taking land from the northwest territories and the district of keewatin but ontario claimed a large portion of the land the disputed portion was awarded to ontario in  manitoba grew to its current size in  absorbing land from the northwest territories to reach °n uniform with the northern reach of its western neighbours saskatchewan alberta and british columbia the manitoba schools question showed the deep divergence of cultural values in the territory the catholic francomanitobans had been guaranteed a statesupported separate school system in the original constitution of manitoba but a grassroots political movement among english protestants from  to  demanded the end of french schools in  the manitoba legislature passed a law removing funding for french catholic schools the french catholic minority asked the federal government for support however the orange order and other anticatholic forces mobilized nationwide to oppose them the federal conservatives proposed remedial legislation to override manitoba but they were blocked by the liberals led by wilfrid laurier who opposed the remedial legislation because of his belief in provincial rights once elected prime minister in  laurier implemented a compromise stating catholics in manitoba could have their own religious instruction for  minutes at the end of the day if there were enough students to warrant it implemented on a schoolbyschool basis modern

boomtown it grew quickly around the start of the th century with outside investors and immigrants contributing to its success the drop in growth in the second half of the decade was a result of the opening of the panama canal in  which reduced reliance on transcontinental railways for trade as well as a decrease in immigration due to the outbreak of the first world war over  manitoba residents enlisted in the first year of the war by the end of the war  manitobans had received the victoria cross after the first world war ended severe discontent among farmers over wheat prices and union

turtle mountain area the ojibwe cree dene sioux mandan and assiniboine peoples founded settlements and other tribes entered the area to trade in northern manitoba quartz was mined to make arrowheads the first farming in manitoba was along the red river where corn and other seed crops were planted before contact with europeans first nations would stampede american bison over these cliffs near cartwright manitoba in  henry hudson was one of the first europeans to sail into what is now known as hudson bay where he was abandoned by his crew the first european to reach presentday central and southern manitoba was sir thomas button who travelled upstream along the nelson river to lake winnipeg in  in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue hudson when the british ship nonsuch sailed into hudson bay in – she became the first trading vessel to reach the area that voyage led to the formation of the hudsons bay company to which the british government gave absolute control of the entire hudson bay watershed this watershed was named ruperts land after prince rupert who helped to subsidize the hudsons bay company york factory was founded in  after the original fort of the hudsons bay company fort nelson built in  was destroyed by rival french traders pierre gaultier de varennes sieur de la vérendrye visited the red river valley in the s to help open the area for french

canadian house of commons the bill was given royal assent and manitoba was brought into canada as a province in  louis riel was pursued by british army officer garnet wolseley because of the rebellion and riel fled into exile the canadian government blocked the métis attempts to obtain land promised to them as part of manitobas entry into confederation facing racism from the new flood of white settlers from ontario large numbers of métis moved to what would become saskatchewan and alberta numbered treaties were signed in the late th century with the chiefs of various first nations that lived in the area these treaties made specific promises of land for every family as a result a reserve system was established under the jurisdiction of the federal government the prescribed amount of land promised to the native peoples was not always given this led aboriginal groups to assert rights to the land through aboriginal land claims many of which are still ongoing the original province of manitoba was a square oneeighteenth of its current size and was known colloquially as the postage stamp province its borders were expanded in  taking land from the northwest territories and the

peoples founded settlements and other tribes entered the area to trade in northern manitoba quartz was mined to make arrowheads the first farming in manitoba was along the red river where corn and other seed crops were planted before contact with europeans first nations would stampede american bison over these cliffs near cartwright manitoba in  henry hudson was one of the first europeans to sail into what is now known as hudson bay where he was abandoned by his crew the first european to reach presentday central and southern manitoba was sir thomas button who travelled upstream along the nelson river to lake winnipeg in  in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue hudson when the british ship nonsuch sailed into hudson bay in – she became the first trading vessel to reach the area that voyage led to the formation of the hudsons bay company to which the british government gave absolute control of the entire hudson bay watershed this watershed was named ruperts land after prince rupert who helped to subsidize the hudsons bay company york factory was founded in  after the original fort of the hudsons bay company fort nelson built in  was destroyed by rival french traders

brought into canada as a province in  louis riel was pursued by british army officer garnet wolseley because of the rebellion and riel fled into exile the canadian government blocked the métis

founded settlements and other tribes entered the area to trade in northern manitoba quartz was mined to make arrowheads the first farming in manitoba was along the red river where corn and other seed crops were planted before contact with europeans first nations would stampede american bison over these cliffs near cartwright manitoba in  henry hudson was one of the first europeans to sail into what is now known as hudson bay where he was abandoned by his crew the first european to reach presentday central and southern manitoba was sir thomas button who travelled upstream along the nelson river to lake winnipeg in  in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue hudson when the british ship nonsuch sailed into hudson bay in – she became the first trading vessel to reach the area that voyage led to the formation of the hudsons bay company to which the british government gave absolute control of the entire hudson bay watershed this watershed was named ruperts land after prince rupert who helped to subsidize the hudsons bay company york factory was founded in  after the original fort of the hudsons bay company fort nelson built in  was destroyed by rival french traders

brought into canada as a province in  louis riel was pursued by british army officer garnet wolseley because of the rebellion and riel fled into exile the canadian government blocked the métis

to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
