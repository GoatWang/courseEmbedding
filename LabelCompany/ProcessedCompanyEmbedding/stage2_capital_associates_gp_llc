organizations maintain a pool of experienced operating and financial executives who can be inserted into the companies if necessary these organizations look to cut costs  increase revenues buyout organizations have welldeveloped processes for installing incentive compensation systems and management reporting systems they have experience restructuring supply chains and distribution channels buyout firms may explain the market opportunity as the potential to add value by substitution of a highly focused private governance model in which expert owners have complete control for a public governance model with dispersed ownership conflicts of interest and high regulatory compliance costs buyout funds can realize value gains through  a sale of the acquired company an ipo dividend recapitalization next slidedividend recapitalizationissuance of debt to finance a special dividend to owners sometimes refinancing existing debt in the processmay allow buyout funds to recoup all or most of the cash used to acquire a company within    years of the buyout while still retaining ownership and control of the company however dividend recapitalization has the potential to weaken the company as a going concern by over leveraging it types of private equity investment direct venture capitalstructuredirect vc investment is structured as convertible preferred stock rather than common stock the terms require that the corporation pay cash equal to some multiple eg × of preferred shareholders original investment before any cash can be paid on the common stock equity investment of the founderspreferred stock is senior to common stock also in its claims on liquidation value advantages of this structure mitigates the risk that the company will take on the vc investment and distribute it to the ownersfounders  provides an incentive to the company to meet the return goals of the outside investors subsequent rounds usually have rights to cash flows that are senior to preferred stock issued in previous financing rounds shares issued in later rounds are more valuable than shares issued in earlier rounds which in turn are more valuable than the founders common shares for convertible preferred shares issued in any round an event such as a buyout or an acquisition of the common equity at a favorable price will trigger conversion of the preferred into the common types of private equity investment indirect structureprimarily through private equity funds including vc funds and buyout fundspe funds are usually structured as llp or llcs with an expected life of yrs w option to extend another yrsthe fund managers objective is to realize the value of all portfolio investments by the funds liquidation datellp and llc forms are attractive because income and capital gains flow through to the lp for the llc the shareholders for tax purposes thus avoiding the possible double taxation that can occur in the corporate form the limited partners or shareholders do not bear any liability beyond the amount of their investmentsthe gp or the md is the venture capitalist the party selecting and advising investments the gp who may be an individual or another entity such as a corporation or partnership also commits its own capital in this way the interests of the outside investors and the fund managergpmd are closely alignedllc formthe llc form available in the us and some other countries under different names and with different requirements is a hybrid of the corporate and partnership forms provides investors w more influence on the funds operations than does a lp

these fees are on top of fees charged by the underlying fundsventure capital corporate formin contrast to the structure of pe funds in venture capital the company receiving support is organized in a

of a private equity fundthe compensation to the fund manager of a private equity fund consists of a management fee plus an incentive feethe management fee   of limited partner commitments to the fund example investor has made a capital commitment of m but actually invested only m the investor generally pays a management fee on the m committedmanagement fees are often in the  range and often scale down in the later years of a partnership to reflect a lower work loadcarried interest incentive feecarried interest share of the pe funds profits that the fund manager is due once the fund has

will thus receive  of the profits and distribute the remaining  of the profits to investorsa hurdle rate of  means that only the pe funds profits in excess of an annualized return of  are subject to  carried interestin some funds the carried interest is computed on only those profits that represent a return in excess of a hurdle rate the hurdle rate is also known as the preferred returnclaw back provisionbecause early investments by the fund may achieve high rates of return but later investments do poorly private equity funds sometimes have a clawback provision specifies that money from the fund manager be returned to investors if at the end of a funds life investors have not received back their capital contributions and contractual share of profitscompensation last pointsin distributing cf to investors  the fund manager a private equity fund first distributes to investors their invested capital and preferred return sometimes the fund manager is allowed to take a small percentage of early distributionstypically following the period in which all or most distributions go to investors there is a catchup period in which the fund manager receives all or the major share of profits after the fund manager has caught up to its specified share of profits according to the contract subsequent profits are distributed according to the carried interest percentage—for example  to investors and  to the fund manager some of the managers profits may be put in an escrow account to satisfy any clawback liability size of the private equity marketa reliable estimate of direct private equity investment worldwide is hard to obtain but as of early  approximately usb was invested in pe vc and buyout funds worldwide via approximately  private equity vehicles benchmarks and historical performanceas for many other alternative investment types events that indicate the market value of a private equity investment generally occur infrequently typical market pricerevealing events include the raising of new financing the acquisition of the company by another company the ipo or failure of the business infrequent market pricing poses a major challenge to index construction how can returns be calculated without market transactions when measuring the performance of a private equity investment investors typically calculate an irr based on cfs since inception of the investment and the ending valuation of the investment the net asset value or residual value benchmarksmajor benchmarks for us and european private equity are those provided by  cambridge associates and  thomson venture economics present an overall pe index representing two major segments  vc funds  buyout fundscustom benchmarks are also frequently used by private equity investors historical performanceprivate equity returns have exhibited a low correlation with public traded securities making them an attractive addition to a portfolio however because of a lack of observable market prices for private equity shortterm return and correlation data may be a result of stale prices interpretation issues appraisal issuesthe private equity investor thinks of returns in terms of irr calculations based generally on estimates of the values of the investors interest however the fund managers appraisals usually supplied on a quarterly basis supply estimates not a market price appraised values are often slow to adjust to new circumstances use stale data and focus only on companyspecific events so the returns may be erroneous furthermore there is no generally accepted standard for appraisals interpretation issues return issues  vintage yearin evaluating past records of returns of private equity funds investors often make comparisons with funds closed in the same year the funds vintage year this helps assure the funds are compared with other funds at a similar stage in their life cycle the effects of vintage year on returns are known as vintage year effects and include in addition to the effects of lifecycle stage the influence that economic conditions and market opportunities opportunities associated with a given vintage year may have on various funds probabilities of success private equity investment characteristics and roleslike public equity investment but to a greater degree private equity plays a growth role in investment portfolios on the one hand at the company level the highest earnings growth rates are usually achievable early when the markets for the companys products may be largely untapped and competition may be small when a promising private company comes to market its prospective growth may be capitalized at an abovemarketaverage multiple on the other hand investment in established companies via buyout funds generally involves lesrisk and earlier returns the private equity investor hopes to gauge and control the risk through appropriate due diligence processes investment characteristics the general investment characteristics of private equity investments include the following illiquidity• illiquidity private equity investments are generally highly illiquid convertible preferred stock investments do not trade in a secondary market private equity fund investors have more restricted opportunities to withdraw investments from the fund than do hedge fund investors this is natural because the underlying investments are not liquid investment characteristics the general investment characteristics of private equity investments include the following  longterm commitments required• longterm commitments required private equity investment generally requires longterm commitments for direct vc investments the time horizon also can be quite uncertain investment characteristics the general investment characteristics of private equity investments include the following higher risk than seasoned public equity investment• higher risk than seasoned public equity investment the returns to private equity investments on average show greater dispersion than seasoned public equity investments although they may be roughly comparable to those of publicly traded microcap shares9 the risk of complete loss of investment is also higher the failure rate of new and young businesses is highthe general investment characteristics of private equity investments include the following high expected irr required• high expected irr required private equity investors target high rates of returns as compensation for the risk and illiquidity of such investmentsthe general investment characteristics of private equity investments include the following limited information for vc investments only• limited information because new ventures operate in product or service markets that may break new ground in some way projections concerning cash flows are often based on limited information or make many assumptions although this is a risk factor it is also related to the potential for unusual profits however of successful venturesdiscounts for valuationsthe illiquidity of private equity affects the value of course of an investors interestthe value that is determined by using models such as the venture capital method or discounted cash flow method may be used as the estimate of the value for a marketable controlling interestif the owner has a minority interest and the equity interest does not have a ready market then discounts are applied to reflect the value for a minorityinterest holder with a nonmarketable interest the discount for lack of marketability for short marketability discount takes account of the lack of liquidity in the investment and depends on a number of factors such as the size of the interest and the level of dividends paid if the interest to be valued is a controlling interest only the marketability discount needs to be consideredvc funds and buyout funds have some expected differences in return characteristics• buyout funds are usually highly leveraged the capital raised by the fund may be  percent of capital used to purchase the equity of the target company with the balance coming from debt collateralized by the target companys assets the operating cash flows of the target company typically an established company are used to service the debt payments in contrast vc funds use no debt in obtaining their equity interests • the cash flows to buyout fund investors come earlier and are often steadier than those to vc fund investors because buyout funds purchase established companies buyout fund investors usually realize returns earlier than vc fund investors for which fund investments may still be in the cashburning stage the expected pattern of interim returns over the life of a successful venture capital fund has sometimes been described as a jcurve in which early returns eg over the first five or six years are negative as the portfolio of companies burns cash but later returns accelerate as companies are exited in general the earlier the stage in which a fund invests in companies the greater the risk and the potential • the returns to vc fund investors are subject to greater error in measurement the interim return calculations of private equity funds depend not only on cash flow transactions with the fund but also on the valuations of the portfolio companies these valuations are subject to much less uncertainty for buyout funds investing in established companies thus venture capital investing may be expected to involve more frequent losses than buyouts in return for higher upside potential when investments are successful roles in the portfolioprivate equity probably can play a moderate role as a risk diversifier however many investors look to private equity investment for longterm return enhancementgiven the capacity issues already mentioned and private equitys generally high illiquidity target allocations of  percent or less are commonplaceamong the issues that must be addressed in formulating a strategy for private equity investment are the following• ability to achieve sufficient diversification suppose an investors allocation to private equity is  percent given that institutional partnership commitments are typically not smaller than us million a reasonably diversified portfolio  investments means commitments totaling  × us million  us million to  × us million  us million these amounts imply that the assets of the institutions investing in this kind of investment typically need to exceed us million  us million ÷  for smaller investors a private equity fund of funds is a possible diversification choice although it involves a second layer of fees• liquidity of the position direct private equity investments are inherently illiquid consequently private equity funds are also illiquid investors in funds must be prepared to have the capital tied up for  years although a limited secondary market for private equity commitments exists the investments trade at highly discounted prices which makes selling the positions an unattractive proposition• provision for capital commitment an investor in a private equity fund makes a commitment of capital the cash is advanced over a period of time known as the commitment period which is typically five years therefore the investor needs to make provisions to have cash available for future capital calls• appropriate diversification strategy an investor contemplating an exposure to private equity should be clear on the standalone risk factors of an investment and also the effect on the overall risk of the portfolio each private equity fund will have a different investment focus which when combined with other funds in the portfolio modifies the overall risk diversification may be across industry sectors by stage of company development and by location o industry sector information technology biotechnology alternative energy etco stage early stage expansion buyout etco geography locally focused internationally focused etc other issuesamong the major requirements for private equity investing is careful due diligencedue diligence items for private equity can usually be placed into one of the following three bins  evaluation of prospects for market success operational review focusing on internal processes such as sales management employment contracts internal financial controls product
