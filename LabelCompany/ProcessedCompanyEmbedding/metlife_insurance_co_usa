family is not only emotionally devastating it can also take a tremendous toll on the future financial security of a family suddenly without the deceased’s income paying the mortgage or providing for a childs college education may become much more difficult    those who buy life insurance do so to help ensure their loved ones are taken care of financially life insurance is a promise by an insurance company to pay those who depend on you a sum of money upon your death in return you make periodic payments called premiums premiums can be based on factors such as age gender medical history and the dollar amount of the life insurance you purchase in the event of your passing life insurance provides money directly to the individuals you select your beneficiaries who can use the money as they see fit including replacing lost income covering basic living expenses paying household debts estate taxes and funeral expenses funding a child’s education supplementing retirement savings what kinds of life insurance can i get at work life insurance comes in two main types – term and permanent – which may both be available through your workplace term life insurance pays a specific lump sum to your loved ones for a specified period of time – usually from one to  years if you stop paying premiums the insurance stops term policies pay benefits if you die during the period covered by the policy but they do not build cash value they may also give you the option to port that is you can take the coverage with you if you leave your company generally you should consider a term life insurance policy to get valuable coverage at an affordable price help cover specific financial responsibilities like a mortgage or college expenses supplement a permanent policy permanent life insurance policies do not expire they are intended to protect your loved ones permanently as long as you pay your premiums some permanent life insurance policies accumulate cash value that means the value of the policy will grow each year taxdeferred until it matches the face value of the policy the cash can generally be accessed via loans or withdrawals and can be used for a variety of purposes this type of plan is typically portable so coverage can continue if employment terminates  consider a permanent insurance policy if you want protection for life payments that stay the same each year to put additional money into the policy on a taxfavored basis cash value you can use while you are living what are the advantages of purchasing life insurance through work getting life insurance through work can be an easy way to protect your family if your employer offers a group plan consider signing up for advantages that may include competitive group rates guaranteed issue meaning you can get a certain amount

years from now is likely to be significantly higher than today to estimate the amount of life insurance your family would need first calculate everything you now provide for your family including salary benefitshealth insurance k and retirement savings personal services you perform for your family such as child care cooking home maintenance etc then subtract your personal expenses including annual spending on personal needs such as food clothing entertainment etc how much does life insurance cost life insurance through your workplace may be more affordable than you think in fact many people can get term life insurance coverage from a quality company for a surprisingly low price premiums are typically based on factors such as age sex height and weight health status including
