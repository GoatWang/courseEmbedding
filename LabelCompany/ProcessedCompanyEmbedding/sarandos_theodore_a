subscriber growth as a reflection of revenue health over ratings especially because the adsupported model doesnt apply to netflix sarandos uses algorithms at netflix to predict what programs viewers will want to watch prior to producing them his personal algorithm focuses on  judgement as a highest priority with  focused on a base of data he also said that the focus is on the audience and that there is no programming grid – or appointment linearbased television – that is typically used by traditional tv networks barometers of success are if the audience completes watching the show the

sarandos says the model allows the viewer to be in control and to watch only the content they enjoy the more serialized the show is the longer the revenue stream sarandos sees cost per hour basis as greater the more total run time there is across the lifetime of a show as it is often not a cost savings to produce less original content once production is underway sarandos said the comparison of tv network ratings to netflix isnt meaningful as the typical netflix release model of pushing out content is full season availability at once no advertising means theres no need for typical ratings he said netflix aggregates audiences over a very long period of time where netflix can tell if a show will be successful by using a regression models that tells netflix based on first hour of viewing how successful the show will be over the life of its license sarandos has been outspoken about discarding or not holding important traditional network models of which although historically a big tv fan he describes the model as now becoming archaic sarandos sees the new model as a way to prioritize the needs and desires of the consumer part of this is the refusal to release ratings and metrics of viewership international reach and long tail niche appeal is also an important part of the business model the spend is typically a large upfront payment with no backend fees to talent and creators especially of original content that netflix owns sarandos said that he sees the netflix brand as being based on personalization that it was a deliberate choice on the part of netflix to focus on providing diverse content that would appeal to the tastes of a broad base of viewers one that would not be focused on a marquee show that netflix would be known for but quality shows that would appeal to different audiences sarandos sees netflix as a digital product where the balance between distributing physical bits of content versus streaming digital content would be cheaper as both broadband and netflix grew ie postal economics vs streaming economics this was something that sarandos said he and his team was closely analyzing at a micro fiscal level the shift away from the dvd business comes from this evaluation of new model focused on streaming and includes original programming which is one of the main responsibilities of sarandos work at netflix sarandos set up a multipicture deal with adam sandler which was met with criticism in defense sarandos said that the numbers make sense something he characterizes as datainfluenced intuition and that sandler has a global appeal sarandos characterized sandlers  film the ridiculous  as successful saying it garnered the highest number of netflix viewers streaming a film within the first  days of its release during the  television critics association presentation sarandos said he expects the amount netflix spends on original programming to rise considerably and in terms of volume for  sarandos said that netflix will be showing
