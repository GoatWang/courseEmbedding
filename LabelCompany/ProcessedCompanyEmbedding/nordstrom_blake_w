one of the  most powerful people in washington washington ceo   address nordstrom  sixth avenue seattle washington  httpwwwnordstromcom ■ when blake nordstrom took the helm of nordstrom incorporated in the summer of  he represented the fourth generation of the nordstrom family to run the seattlebased department store chain blake had grown up with the company and some employees and analysts thought that it was only natural for him to eventually lead it when he became president however nordstrom was struggling with sagging sales and lowered stock prices blake launched an aggressive new strategy that introduced newer computer technology for tracking sales and inventory while reviving the companys longstanding commitment to customer service within four years he had not only improved nordstroms profitability but had also made plans for expansion a family business blake nordstrom was the greatgrandson of john w nordstrom a swedish immigrant who invested the  hed made from a gold mine stake in a seattle shoe store that eventually grew into a nationwide chain of department stores even though blake was a member of the nordstrom family however he did not receive preferential treatment he worked in the stockroom of the shoe department in nordstroms flagship seattle store at the age of  along with several other nordstrom children blake swept the floor and restocked merchandise the nordstrom children paid their dues they worked really hard said betsy sanders a former nordstrom vice president speaking of blake and his siblings  businessweek  july   by working hard at the lower levels of the companys hierarchy blake rose quickly through the ranks from salesman and buyer to merchandise manager and store manager in  he was named vice president and general manager of nordstroms washington and alaska region four years later he shared the position of president with five other family members—a management experiment in dividing responsibilities blake then became president of the rack group—a discount store unit—in february  when nordstrom was reorganized into five separate units blake succeeded in raising the sales of the rack group by nearly  percent within the first few months of his presidency the family is back in business as the st century dawned however nordstrom was in trouble its sales had slowed down and its stock prices had declined nordstroms board of directors even considered merging with another retailer or selling the company instead the longtime chairman john whitacre resigned—or was ousted according to some analysts whitacre had been with nordstrom since  when he started out selling shoes while still a student at the university of washington he eventually rose to the chairman and ceo position although he made great strides in modernizing the company he shifted away from the traditional customerfocused philosophy and began focusing more on nordstrom shareholders when whitacre resigned as ceo blake took the position of president and his father became chairman the company left the ceo position open and has not since filled it the board hoped that reinstating the nordstrom family at the executive level would turn the company around although some managers and salespeople were pleased by the return of nordstrom family members to executive positions others wondered whether blake had sufficient experience at the age of  to handle the job of president blake and his father assured the analysts however that they were carefully reviewing every aspect of the business and were determined to make it profitable once again when blake assumed the presidency he was quoted as saying my names on the door every penny i have is in nordstrom stock  puget sound business journal  september   blake slowed the pace of new store openings in order to focus on nordstroms existing stores he also improved the companys use of technology by investing in speedier cash registers and a computerized inventory system trimmed the companys inventory and reemphasized nordstroms personalized service culture to bring back disenchanted customers we know by giving good service we sell more blake told businessweek july   its the heart and soul of our business but even while catering to nordstroms customers blake also remembered the companys shareholders he was as serious about raising the price of nordstroms stock as he was about improving service a new beginning nordstrom did experience a turnaround over the next three years its sales and stock prices had risen measurably by  which allowed blake to turn his attention once again to expanding the chain into new locations blake attributed his success to his policy of listening to and supporting his sales force rather than ordering them to perform we believe in an inverted pyramid where management is on the bottom and salespeople and customers are on the top he told womens wear daily march   in addition to blakes role in his familys company he served as
