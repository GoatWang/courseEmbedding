tetrazolium and bromochloroindolyphosphate for chromogenic blot and ihc staining with alkaline phosphatase probes the combination of nbt nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and bcip bromochloroindolyphosphate ptoluidine salt yields an intense insoluble blackpurple precipitate when reacted with alkaline phosphatase a popular enzyme conjugate for antibody probes pierce nbt and bcip powders are available individually and in two convenient readytouse solutions with and without a levamisole suppressor of endogenous phosphatase activity features • ap substrate—for detection of alkaline phosphatase alkphos activity on solid media including nitrocellulose and pvdf membranes and fixed tissue samples • chromogenic—no special equipment needed for visualization produces purpleblack precipitate that is easy to photograph • package options—choose individual nbt and bcip powders or preformulated readytouse solutions with or without levamisole suppressor highlights of
