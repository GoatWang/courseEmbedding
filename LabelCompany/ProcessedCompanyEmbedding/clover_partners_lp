finding a clover partners small bank lead could yield a pot of gold by tim melvin follow   nov     pm est tweet comment email print tweetcomment stock quotes in this article fisi bfin ltxb ibcp another bank stock fund has filed its f forms early and i want to review its buying in the third quarter i have made money over the years tracking d and f filings and the biggest returns have come from coattailing bank specialists and activists on their community bank buys clover partners is a dallasbased firm that has been around since  the firm is very much off the radar and does not appear to give interviews or seek publicity but looking at its f and d filings over the years clover appears to have had a great deal of success clover is on my gee i would really love to talk to these guys  list but i am afraid i would have to set up shop outside its office to achieve that particular goal clover was fairly active in the quarter with  new buys the firm was a buyer of shares of financial institutions fisi the parent company of five star bank in warsaw ny the bank has been working to expand its commercial and business banking presence in western new york with a focus on rochester and buffalo and it is having some success at the end of the third quarter business loans and commercial real estate lending reached record levels the shares are a little high for me at  of book value but the bank is growing at a decent pace and i could be very interested in a market decline clover was also a buyer of bankfinancial bfin during the third quarter the burr ridge illbased bank has a shareholder list that looks like a bank stock activists hall of fame the bank has been struggling to grow and ceo morgan gasior didnt sound all that upbeat on the recent conference call about the prospects for  the stock is trading at  of book value and i wont be shocked to see a merger announcement before too much longer gasior told shareholders that youre not really looking at a particularly strong growth in the united states next year gdp third quarter was  we would be happy lets put it this way we would be happy if we saw upper singledigit growth in all of our commercial segments next year given clovers dallas location i guess i shouldnt be surprised to see the firm adding to its stake in a texas bank i have been waiting for legacytexas financial ltxb to drop to a much lower multiple of book value but i assume the folks at clover know a lot more than i do about local banks and are willing to pay up for them legacytexas has been growing at very high rates with earnings growth averaging more than  over the past five years there is a good chance we see ma activity pick up in texas and with the stock trading at x book value legacy has a solid currency to acquire additional assets and earnings at a decent price the bank is looking to grow in the dallas market via acquisitions and i expect it to be very active in  and beyond clover partners also added to its position in independent bank corporation ibcp this is another bank that has strong activist and bank specialist involvement more than  of the bank is owned by these bankfocused funds so management is under a microscope from a group committed to higher shareholder value the bank has  branches in the lower michigan peninsula with about  billion in total assets management has been focusing on growing market share in its region according to the most recent fdic reports the bank gained market shares in  of the  markets it serves they have also been buying back stock and have repurchased about  of the bank and expect the current  repurchase plan completed by the end of the year the stock has been pretty strong in the past six months and is a little rich for me at x book value it does have a very attractive franchise and i think it would fetch more than the average x book value in a merger but i will wait for a decent pullback in the stock to consider following clover into the stock clover partners has been around for a long time as a smallbank stock activist and investor and i have stolen many strong ideas from its d and f filings it is worth your time to go to secgov and review
