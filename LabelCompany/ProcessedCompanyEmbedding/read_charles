business with and force them to send jobs overseas are we shopping our way straight to the unemployment line by charles fishmanlong reada gallonsized jar of whole pickles is something to behold the jar is the size of a small aquarium the fat green pickles floating in swampy juice look reptilian their shapes exaggerated by the glass it weighs  pounds too big to carry with one hand the gallon jar of pickles is a display of abundance and excess it is entrancing and also vaguely unsettling this is the product that walmart fell in love with vlasic’s gallon jar of picklesadvertisementwalmart priced it at –a year’s supply of pickles for less than  “they were using it as a ‘statement’ item” says pat hunn who calls himself the “mad scientist” of vlasic’s gallon jar “walmart was putting it before consumers saying this represents what walmart’s about you can buy a stinkin’ gallon of pickles for  and it’s the nation’s numberone brand”therein lies the basic conundrum of doing business with the world’s largest retailer by selling a gallon of kosher dills for less than most grocers sell a quart walmart may have provided a service for its customers but what did it do for vlasic the pickle maker had spent decades convincing customers that they should pay a premium for its brand now walmart was practically giving them away and the fevered buying spree that resulted distorted every aspect of vlasic’s operations from farm field to factory to financial statementindeed as vlasic discovered the real story of walmart the story that never gets told is the story of the pressure the biggest retailer relentlessly applies to its suppliers in the name of bringing us “every day low prices” it’s the story of what that pressure does to the companies walmart does business with to us manufacturing and to the economy as a whole that story can be found floating in a gallon jar of pickles at walmartwalmart is not just the world’s largest retailer it’s the world’s largest company–bigger than exxonmobil general motors and general electric the scale can be hard to absorb walmart sold  billion worth of goods last year it sells in three months whatnumbertwo retailer home depot sells in a year and in its own category of general merchandise and groceries walmart no longer has any real rivals it does more business than target sears kmart jc penney safeway and kroger combined “clearly” says edward fox head of southern methodist university’s jc penney center for retailing excellence “walmart is more powerful than any retailer has ever been” it is in fact so big and so furtively powerful as to have become an entirely different order of corporate beingwalmart wields its power for just one purpose to bring the lowest possible prices to its customers at walmart that goal is never reached the retailer has a clear policy for suppliers on basic products that don’t change the price walmart will pay and will charge shoppers must drop year after year but what almost no one outside the world of walmart and its  suppliers knows is the high cost of those low prices walmart has the power to squeeze profitkilling concessions from vendors to survive in the face of its pricing demands makers of everything from bras to bicycles to blue jeans have had to lay off employees and close us plants in favor of outsourcing products from overseasadvertisementof course us companies have been moving jobs offshore for decades long before walmart was a retailing power but there is no question that the chain is helping accelerate the loss of american jobs to lowwage countries such as china walmart which in the late s and early s trumpeted its claim to “buy american” has doubled its imports from china in the past five years alone buying some  billion in merchandise in  that’s nearly  of all chinese exports to the united statesone way to think of walmart is as a vast pipeline that gives nonus companies direct access to the american market “one of the things that limits or slows the growth of imports is the cost of establishing connections and networks” says paul krugman the princeton university economist “walmart is so big and so centralized that it can all at once hook chinese and other suppliers into its digital system so–wham–you have a large switch to overseas sourcing in a period quicker than under the old rules of retailing”steve dobbins has been bearing the brunt of that switch he’s president and ceo of carolina mills a yearold north carolina company that supplies thread yarn and textile finishing to apparel makers–half of which supply walmart carolina mills grew steadily until  but in the past three years as its customers have gone either overseas or out of business it has shrunk from  factories to  and from  employees to  dobbins’s customers have begun to face imported clothing sold so cheaply to walmart that they could not compete even if they paid their workers nothing“people ask ‘how can it be bad for things to come into the us cheaply how can it be bad to have a bargain at walmart’ sure it’s held inflation down and it’s great to have bargains” says dobbins “but you can’t buy anything if you’re not employed we are shopping ourselves out of jobs”the gallon jar of pickles at walmart became a devastating success giving vlasic strong sales and growth numbers–but slashing its profits by millions of dollarsthere is no question that walmart’s relentless drive to squeeze out costs has benefited consumers the giant retailer is at least partly responsible for the low rate of us inflation and a mckinsey  co study concluded that about  of the economy’s productivity gains in the second half of the s could be traced to walmart alonethere is also no question that doing business with walmart can give a supplier a fast heady jolt of sales and market share but that fix can come with longterm consequences for the health of a brand and a business vlasic for example wasn’t looking to build its brand on a gallon of whole pickles pickle companies make money on “the cut” slicing cucumbers into spears and hamburger chips “cucumbers in the jar you don’t make a whole lot of money there” says steve young a former vice president of grocery marketing for pickles at vlasic who has since left the companyadvertisementat some point in the late s a walmart buyer saw vlasic’s gallon jar and started talking to pat hunn about it hunn who has also since left vlasic was then head of vlasic’s walmart sales team based in dallas the gallon intrigued the buyer in sales tests priced somewhere over  “the gallon sold like crazy” says hunn “surprising us all” the walmart buyer had a brainstorm what would happen to the gallon if they offered it nationwide and got it below  hunn was skeptical but his job was to look for ways to sell pickles at walmart why notand so vlasic’s gallon jar of pickles went into every walmart some  stores at  a price so low that vlasic and walmart were making only a penny or two on a jar if that it was showcased on big pallets near the front of stores it was an abundance of abundance “it was selling  jars a week on average in every store” says young doesn’t sound like much until you do the math that’s  gallons of pickles just in gallon jars just at walmart every week whole fields of cucumbers were heading out the doorfor vlasic the gallon jar of pickles became what might be called a devastating success “quickly it started cannibalizing our nonwalmart business” says young “we saw consumers who used to buy the spears and the chips in supermarkets buying the walmart gallons they’d eat a quarter of a jar and throw the thing away when they got moldy a family can’t eat them fast enough”the gallon jar reshaped vlasic’s pickle business it chewed up the profit margin of the business with walmart and of pickles generally procurement had to scramble to find enough pickles to fill the gallons but the volume gave vlasic strong sales numbers strong growth numbers and a powerful place in the world of pickles at walmart which accounted for  of vlasic’s business but the company’s profits from pickles had shriveled  or more young says–millions of dollarsthe gallon was hoisting vlasic and hurting it at the same timeyoung remembers begging walmart for relief “they said ‘no way’ ” says young “we said we’ll increase the price”–even  would have helped tremendously–“and they said ‘if you do that all the other products of yours we buy we’ll stop buying’ it was a clear threat” hunn recalls things a little differently if just as ominously “they said ‘we want the  gallon of pickles if you don’t do it we’ll see if someone else might’ i knew our competitors were saying to walmart ‘we’ll do the  gallons if you give us your other business’ ” walmart’s business was so indispensable to vlasic and the gallon so central to the walmart relationship that decisions about the future of the gallon were made at the ceo leveladvertisementfinally walmart let vlasic up for air “the walmart guy’s response was classic” young recalls “he said ‘well we’ve done to pickles what we did to orange juice we’ve killed it we can back off’ ” vlasic got to take it down to just over half a gallon of pickles for  not long after that in january  vlasic filed for bankruptcy–although the gallon jar of pickles everyone agrees wasn’t a critical factorby now it is accepted wisdom that walmart makes the companies it does business with more efficient and focused leaner and faster walmart itself is known for continuous improvement in its ability to handle move and track merchandise it expects the same of its suppliers but the ability to operate at peak efficiency only gets you in the door at walmart then the real demands start the public image walmart projects may be as cheery as its yellow smileyface mascot but there is nothing genial about the process by which walmart gets its suppliers to provide tires and contact lenses guns and underarm deodorant at every day low prices walmart is legendary for forcing its suppliers to redesign everything from their packaging to their computer systems it is also legendary for quite straightforwardly telling them what it will pay for their goods“we are one of walmart’s biggest suppliers and they are our biggest customer by far we have a great relationship that’s all i can say are we done now”john fitzgerald a former vice president of nabisco remembers walmart’s reaction to his company’s plan to offer a cent newspaper coupon for a large bag of lifesavers in advance of halloween walmart told nabisco to add up what it would spend on the promotion–for the newspaper ads the coupons and handling–and then just take that amount off the price instead “that isn’t necessarily good for the manufacturer” fitzgerald says “they need things that draw attention”it also is not unheard of for walmart to demand to examine the private financial records of a supplier and to insist that its margins are too high and must be cut and the smaller the supplier one academic study shows the greater the likelihood that it will be forced into damaging concessions melissa berryhill a walmart spokeswoman disagrees “the fact is walmart perhaps like no other retailer seeks to establish collaborative and mutually beneficial relationships with our suppliers”for many suppliers though the only thing worse than doing business with walmart may be not doing business with walmart last year  cents of every dollar spent in any store in the united states other than autoparts stores went to the retailer that means a contract with walmart can be critical even for the largest consumergoods companies dial corp for example does  of its business with walmart if dial lost that one account it would have to double its sales to its next nine customers just to stay even “walmart is the essential retailer in a way no other retailer is” says gib carey a partner at bain  co who is leading a yearlong study of how to do business with walmart “our clients cannot grow without finding a way to be successful with walmart”many companies and their executives frankly admit that supplying walmart is like getting into the company version of basic training with an implacable army drill sergeant the process may be unpleasant but there can be some positive resultsadvertisement“everyone from the forklift driver on up to me the ceo knew we had to deliver to walmart on time not  minutes late and not  minutes early either” says robin prever who was ceo of saratoga beverage group from  to  and made privatelabel water sold at walmart “the message came through clearly you have this second delivery window either you’re there or you’re out with a customer like that it changes your organization for the better it wakes everybody up and all our customers benefited we changed our whole approach to doing business”but you won’t hear evenhanded stories like that from walmart or from its current suppliers despite being a publicly traded company walmart is intensely private it declined to talk in detail about its relationships with its suppliers for this story more strikingly dozens of companies contacted declined to talk about even the basics of their business with walmarthere for example is an executive at dial “we are one of walmart’s biggest suppliers and they are our biggest customer by far we have a great relationship that’s all i can say are we done now” goaded a bit the executive responds with an almost hysterical edge “are you meshuga why in the world would we talk about walmart ask me about anything else we’ll talk but not walmart”no one wants to end up in what is known among walmart vendors as the “penalty box”–punished or even excluded from the store shelves for saying something that makes walmart unhappy the penalty box is normally reserved for vendors who don’t meet performance benchmarks not for those who talk to the press“you won’t hear anything negative from most people” says paul kelly founder of silvermine consulting group a company that helps businesses work more effectively with retailers “it would be committing suicide if walmart takes something the wrong way it’s like saddam hussein you just don’t want to piss them off”as a result this story was reported in an unusual way by speaking with dozens of people who have spent years selling to walmart or consulting to companies that sell to walmart but who no longer work for companies that do business with walmart unless otherwise noted the companies involved in the events they described refused even to confirm or deny the basics of the eventsadvertisementto a person all those interviewed credit walmart with a fundamental integrity in its dealings that’s unusual in the world of consumer goods retailing and groceries walmart does not cheat suppliers it keeps its word it pays its bills briskly “they are tough people but very honest they treat you honestly” says peter campanella who ran the business that sold corning kitchenware products both at corning and then at world kitchen “it was a joke to do business with most of their competitors a fiasco”but walmart also clearly does not hesitate to use its power magnifying the darwinian forces already at work in modern global capitalismcaught in the walmart squeeze huffy didn’t just relinquish profits to keep its commitment to the retailer it handed those profits to the competitionwhat does the squeeze look like at walmart it is usually thoroughly rational sometimes devastatingly sojohn mariotti is a veteran of the consumerproducts world–he spent nine years as president of huffy bicycle co a division of huffy corp and is now chairman of world kitchen the company that sells oxo revere corning and ekco brand housewareshe could not be clearer on his opinion about walmart it’s a great company and a great company to do business with “walmart has done more good for america by several thousand orders of magnitude than they’ve done bad” mariotti says “they have raised the bar and raised the bar for everybody”mariotti describes one episode from huffy’s relationship with walmart it’s a tale he tells to illustrate an admiring point he makes about the retailer “they demand you do what you say you are going to do” but it’s also a classic example of the damnedifyoudo damnedifyoudon’t walmart squeeze when mariotti was at huffy throughout the s the company sold a range of bikes to walmart  or so models in a spread of prices and profitability it was a leading manufacturer of bikes in the united states in places like ponca city oklahoma celina ohio and farmington missouriadvertisementone year huffy had committed to supply walmart with an entrylevel thinmargin bike–as many as walmart needed sales of the lowend bike took off “i woke up may ”–the heart of the bike production cycle for the summer–“and i needed  bikes” he says “my factories could only run ” as it happened that same year huffy’s fancier moreprofitable bikes were doing well too at walmart and other places huffy found itself in a bindwith other retailers perhaps mariotti might have sat down renegotiated tried to talk his way out of the corner not with walmart “i made the deal up front with them” he says “i knew how high was up i was dutybound to supply my customer” so he did something extraordinary to free up production in order to make walmart’s cheap bikes he gave the designs for four of his higherend highermargin products to rival manufacturers “i conceded business to my competitors because i just ran out of capacity” he says huffy didn’t just relinquish profits to keep walmart happy–it handed those profits to its competition “walmart didn’t tell me what to do” mariotti says “they didn’t have to” the retailer he adds “is tough as nails but they give you a chance to compete if you can’t compete that’s your problem”in the years since mariotti left huffy the bike maker’s relationship with walmart has been vital though huffy corp has lost money in three out of the last five years it is the numberthree seller of bikes in the united states and walmart is the numberone retailer of bikes but here’s one last statistic about bicycles roughly  are now imported from places such as china mexico and taiwan huffy made its last bike in the united states in as mariotti says walmart is tough as nails but not every supplier agrees that the toughness is always accompanied by fairness the lovable company was founded in  by the grandfather of frank garson ii who was lovable’s last president it did business with walmart garson says from the earliest days of founder sam walton’s first store in bentonville arkansas lovable made bras and lingerie supplying retailers that also included sears and victoria’s secret at one point it was the sixthlargest maker of intimate apparel in the united states with  employees in this country and another  at eight factories in central americaeventually walmart became lovable’s biggest customer “walmart has a big pencil” says garson “they have such awesome purchasing power that they write their own ticket if they don’t like your prices they’ll go vertical and do it themselves–or they’ll find someone that will meet their terms”in the summer of  garson asserts walmart did just that “they had awarded us a contract and in their wisdom they changed the terms so dramatically that they really reneged” garson still worried about litigation won’t provide details “but when you lose a customer that size they are irreplaceable”advertisementlovable was already feeling intense cost pressure less than three years after walmart pulled its business in its nd year lovable closed “they leave a lot to be desired in the way they treat people” says garson “their actions to pulverize people are unnecessary walmart chewed us up and spit us out”believe it or not american business has been through this before the great atlantic  pacific tea co the grocerystore chain stood astride the us market in the s and s with a dominance that has likely never been duplicated at its peak ap had five times the number of stores walmart has now although much smaller ones and at one point it owned  of the supermarket business some of the antipredatorypricing laws in use today were inspired by ap’s attempts to muscle its suppliersthere is very little academic and statistical study of walmart’s impact on the health of its suppliers and virtually nothing in the last decade when walmart’s size has increased by a factor of five this while the retail industry has become much more concentrated in large part that’s because it’s nearly impossible to get meaningful data that would allow researchers to track the influence of walmart’s business on companies over time you’d need cooperation from the vendor companies or walmart or both–and neither walmart nor its suppliers are interested in sharing such intimate detailbain  co the global management consulting firm is in the midst of a project that asks how does a company have a healthy relationship with walmart how do you avoid being sucked into the vortex how do you maintain some standing some leverage of your ownthis july in a mating that had the relieved air of lovers who had too long resisted embracing levi strauss rolled blue jeans into every walmart in the united statesbain’s first insights are obvious if not easy “year after year” carey a partner at bain  co says “for any product that is the same as what you sold them last year walmart will say ‘here’s the price you gave me last year here’s what i can get a competitor’s product for here’s what i can get a privatelabel version for i want to see a better value that i can bring to my shopper this year or else i’m going to use that shelf space differently’ “carey has a friend in the umbrella business who learned that one year because of costs he went to walmart and asked for a  price increase “walmart said ‘we were expecting a  decrease we’re off by  go back and sharpen your pencil’ ” the umbrella man scrimped and came back with a  increase “they said ‘we’ll go with a chinese manufacturer’–and he was out entirely”advertisementthe walmart squeeze means vendors have to be as relentless and as microscopic as walmart is at managing their own costs they need in fact to turn themselves into shadow versions of walmart itself “walmart won’t necessarily say you have to reconfigure your distribution system” says carey “but companies recognize they are not going to maintain margins with growth in their walmart business without doing it”the way to avoid being trapped in a spiral of growing business and shrinking profits says carey is to innovate “you need to bring walmart new products–products consumers need because with those walmart doesn’t have benchmarks to drive you down in price they don’t have historical data you don’t have competitors they haven’t bid the products out to privatelabel makers that’s how you can have higher prices and higher margins”reasonable advice but not universally useful there has been an explosion of “innovation” in toothbrushes and toothpastes in the past five years for instance but a pickle is a pickle is a picklebain’s other critical discovery is that consumers are often more loyal to product companies than to walmart with strongly branded items people develop a preference for–things like toothpaste or laundry detergent–walmart rarely forces shoppers to switch to a second choice it would simply punish itself by seeing sales fall and it won’t put up with that for longbut as walmart has grown in market reach and clout even manufacturers known for nurturing premium brands may find themselves overpowered this july in a mating that had the relieved air of lovers who had too long resisted embracing levi strauss rolled blue jeans into every walmart doorway in the united states  stores walmart seeking to expand its clothing business with more fashionable brands promoted the clothes on its instore tv network and with banners slipped over the securitytag detectors at exit doorslevi’s launch into walmart came the same summer the clothes maker celebrated its th birthday for a century and a half one of the most recognizable names in american commerce had survived without walmart but in october  when levi strauss and walmart announced their engagement levi was shrinking rapidly the pressure on levi goes back  years–well before walmart was an influence between  and  levi closed  us manufacturing plants sending  of its sewing overseasadvertisementsales for levi peaked in  at  billion by last year they had spiraled down six years in a row to  billion through the first six months of  sales dropped another  this one account–selling jeans to walmart–could almost instantly revive levilast year walmart sold more clothing than any other retailer in the country it also sold more pairs of jeans than any other store walmart’s own inexpensive house brand of jeans faded glory is estimated to do  billion in sales a year a house brand nearly the size of levi strauss perhaps most revealing in terms of levi’s strategic blunders in  half the jeans sold in the united states cost less than  a pair that same year levi didn’t offer jeans for less than for much of the last decade levi couldn’t have qualified to sell to walmart its computer systems were antiquated and it was notorious for delivering clothes late to retailers levi admitted its ontime delivery rate was  when it announced the deal with walmart last year one fashionindustry analyst bluntly predicted levi would simply fail to deliver the jeansbut levi strauss has taken to the walmart way with the intensity of a neardeath religious conversion–and levi’s executives were happy to talk about their experience getting ready to sell at walmart one hundred people at levi’s headquarters are devoted to the new business another  have set up in an office in bentonville near walmart’s headquarters where the company has hired a respected veteran walmart sales account managergetting ready for walmart has been like putting levi on the atkins diet it has helped everything–customer focus inventory management speed to market it has even helped other retailers that buy levis because walmart has forced the company to replenish stores within two days instead of levi’s previous fiveday cycleand so walmart might rescue levi strauss except for one thingadvertisementlevi didn’t actually have any clothes it could sell at walmart everything was too expensive it had to develop a fresh line for mass retailers the levi strauss signature brand featuring levi strauss’s name on the back of the jeanstwo months after the launch levi basked in the honeymoon glow overall sales after falling for the first six months of  rose  in the third quarter profits in the summer quarter nearly doubled all levi’s ceo said because of signature“they are all very rational people and they had a good point everyone was willing to pay more for a master lock but how much more can they justify”but the lowend business isn’t a business levi is known for or one it had been particularly interested in it’s also a business in which levi will find itself competing with lean experienced players such as vf and faded glory levi’s makeover might so improve its performance with its nonwalmart suppliers that its established business will thrive too it is just as likely that any gains will be offset by the competitive pressures already dissolving levi’s premium brands and by the cannibalization of its own sales “it’s hard to see how this relationship will boost levi’s higherend business” says paul farris a professor at the university of virginia’s darden graduate school of business administration “it’s easy to see how this will hurt the higherend business”if levi clothing is a runaway hit at walmart that may indeed rescue levi as a business but what will have been rescued the signature line–it includes clothing for girls boys men and women–is an odd departure for a company whose brand has long been an american icon some of the jeans have the look the fingertip feel of pricier levis but much of the clothing has the look and feel it must have given its price around  for adult pants cheap cheap and disappointing to find labeled with levi strauss’s name and just five days before the cheery profit news levi had another announcement it is closing its last two us factories both in san antonio and laying off more than  workers or  of its workforce a company that  years ago had  clothing plants in the united states–and that was known as one of the most socially reponsible corporations on the planet–will by  not make any clothes at all it will just import themin the end of course it is we as shoppers who have the power and who have given that power to walmart part of walmart’s dominance part of its insight and part of its arrogance is that it presumes to speak for american shoppersif walmart doesn’t like the pricing on something says andrew whitman who helped service walmart for years when he worked at general foods and kraft they simply say “at that price we no longer think it’s a good value to our shopper therefore we don’t think we should carry it”advertisementwalmart has also lulled shoppers into ignoring the difference between the price of something and the cost its unending focus on price underscores something that americans are only starting to realize about globalization evercheaper prices have consequences says steve dobbins president of thread maker carolina mills “we want clean air clear water good living conditions the best health care in the world–yet we aren’t willing to pay for anything manufactured under those restrictions”randall larrimore a former ceo of masterbrand industries the parent company of master lock understands that contradiction too well for years he says as manufacturing costs in the united states rose master lock was able to pass them along but at some point in the s asian manufacturers started producing locks for much less “when the difference is  retailers like walmart would prefer to have the brandname padlock or faucet or hammer” larrimore says “but as the spread becomes greater when our padlock was  and the import was  then they can offer the consumer a real discount by carrying two lines ultimately they may only carry one line”in january  master lock announced that after  years making locks in milwaukee it would begin importing more products from asia not too long after master lock opened a factory of its own in nogales mexico today it makes just  to  of its locks in milwaukee–its  employees there mostly make parts that are sent to nogales where there are now  factory workerslarrimore did the first manufacturing layoffs at master lock he negotiated with master lock’s unions himself he went to bentonville “i loved dealing with walmart with home depot” he says “they are all very rational people there wasn’t a whole lot of room for negotiation and they had a good point everyone was willing to pay more for a master lock but how much more can they justify if they can buy a lock that has arguably similar quality at a cheaper price well they can get their consumers a deal”it’s walmart in the role of adam smith’s invisible hand and the milwaukee employees of master lock who shopped at walmart to save money helped that hand shove their own jobs right to nogales not consciously not directly but inevitably “do we as consumers appreciate what we’re doing” larrimore asks “i don’t think so but even if we do i think we say here’s a master lock for  here’s another lock for –let the other guy pay ”charles fishman cnfishmindspringcom is a senior writer at fast company andrew moesel provided research assistance for this

hitchhikers guide to the present — it is both a reading guide to charles taylors monumental work a secular age and philosophical guidance on how we might learn to live in our timestaylors landmark book a secular age  provides a monumental incisive analysis of what it means to live in the postchristian present — a pluralist world of competing beliefs and growing unbelief jamie smiths book is a compact field guide to taylors insightful study of the secular making that very significant but daunting work accessible to a wide array of readerseven more though smiths how not to be secular is a practical philosophical guidebook a kind of howto manual on how to live in our secular age it ultimately offers us an adventure in selfunderstanding and maps out a way to get our bearings in todays secular culture no matter who we are — whether believers or skeptics devout or doubting self assured or puzzled and confused this is a book for any thinking person to chew onread a blog post from the author on eerdword awards and recognitions christianity today  book award for christianity and culture reviews conrad grebel reviewreaders in any church tradition or none at all can benefit from smiths accessible and lively book tim keller—redeemer presbyterian church new york citycharles taylors crucial book on our secular age is inaccessible for most people including the church leaders who desperately need to learn from its insight jamie smiths book is the solution to this problem as a gateway into taylors thought this volume if read widely could have a major impact on the level of theological leadership that our contemporary church is getting it could also have a great effect on the quality of our communication and preaching i highly recommend this book t m luhrmann—stanford universitythis is a brilliant beautifully written book on the dilemma of faith in a modern secular age it introduces the reader to the material in taylors dense book of course but it does more it invites the reader on a journey through the experience of the spirit in different centuries and how our conceptions of mind and person shape belief in ways far more intimate than we usually imagine how not to be secular is a gem hans boersma—regent collegecharles taylors daunting tome a secular age has just turned a great deal less intimidating combining his usual lucid style his love for literature and his passion for the churchs future jamie smith offers a faithful guide through the pages of taylors monumental work along the way he wisely cautions his coreligionists against facile responses to the disenchantment of modernity but he also insists that the christian faith may have much more going for it than many recognize review of metaphysicsi highly recommend smiths book a short and clear introduction to taylors a secular age having slogged through taylors book i think that smiths book communicates well contra macintyre taylors analysis and extraordinary skill    illuminating and insightful christian centurythe importance of a secular age is matched by its inaccessibility it is a great woolly mammoth of a book    smiths book does great work in opening taylors tome to a wider readership his commentary is clear accurate and insightful it is also concise leading readers deep into taylors ideas in well under  pages smiths sure grasp of taylors big picture makes the details of the argument pop with fresh intelligibility religious studies reviewfor those who have been intimidated by charles taylors massive tome a secular age  smith has provided an accessible entry point to taylors work in how not to be secular    the work endeavors to distill taylors work for a wider audience and is more digestible than taylors daunting volume thanks to smiths lucid and engaging prose those desiring an accurate summary of taylors work or those looking for a more sophisticated understanding of the secular age would find this book well worth the time books  culturean altogether readable charming and short introduction to taylors behemoth first thingsthose looking for an introduction to this supremely important work taylors a secular age but reluctant to wade through its  pages can turn to this economical commentary choicesmith offers a readers guide to taylors lengthy work this book succeeds as both a summation of taylors argument    and as a light critique   a sympathetic astute summation of taylors most ambitious work recommended englewood review of booksthis is philosophy with feet a thick theology that will get your heart beating because it meets you in the complicated world we all share university bookmanalready in previous books smith has proven himself adept at translating difficult philosophical and theological ideas for the broader church and culture how not to be secular continues in this trajectory it is part cultural analysis part philosophical ethnography always accessible and always with an eye toward the implications of taylors insights for the practice of christian faith cressetsplendid yet accessible and brief overview and discussion of what is arguably the most widely discussed work of philosophy of the last twenty years the presbyterian outlookif one wants to understand the roots of our current cultural condition charles taylors book is essential there is no better guide to it than james k a smith los angeles review of bookswell written clear and accessible most important it supplies a very reliable reconstruction of the essentials of taylors position smith is particularly adept at emphasizing the existential quality of taylors analysis of secularity what does it feel like to be a believer or nonbeliever in the modern western world    anyone seeking a quick but dependable overview of taylors argument in a secular age would benefit immensely from smiths book    it is a fine achievement and accomplishes just what it sets out to providing its readers with a reliable road map to charles

to the lawsuit litigants bruce and teresa badgett of arlington texas had been active and profitable marketers of advocare products for more than a dozen years before their distributorship was canceled by the company in  based upon vague and trumpedup charges the jury found that advocare engaged in false misleading or deceptive practices that damaged the badgetts and that the termination provisions of the distributor contract with advocare were unconscionable according to court documents advocare disputed the ruling and on april   filed to appeal the decision on the basis that the plaintiffs were not customers and therefore did not fit the statutory definition necessary to be covered under the texas deceptive trade practices act the appeal was dismissed on march   and the company was

appeal was dismissed on march   and the company was ordered to reimburse the badgetts for court costs related to their defense in the appeal case advocare ceased offering kickstart spark targeted to youth age  after pediatricians had expressed concerns about the product containing  mg of caffeine advocare was also the subject of criticism for its marketing at youth athletic events in  the company paid  to sponsor a high school wrestling tournament in sacramento but after negative publicity advocare officials said they would not sponsor any more school events wendy miller of the beaumont weight control center said advocares herbal cleanse is probably safe for many users but she suggested that the same results could be achieved without the products in march  advocare was the subject of a critical exposée in espn the magazine the exposée argues that the company and a small number of distributors at the top of a distribution network makes most of its money from the signingup of new distributors rather than sales of the product while exaggerating the likelihood of financial success of distributors when only a few make a significant amount of money that the company creates a cultlike atmosphere of not questioning the companys claims or the probability of financial success in new distributors to the point where distributors will shun friends and family members who do so and that the company is internally riven by divisions over the companys strong use of religious affiliation as part of its business model with more devout members of the organization using it to gain and hold power in the organization and over its members see alsoedit companies portal list of food companies referencesedit  barbara seale  sep  advocare a two decade marathon direct selling news
