were largely inline with those for the fourth quarter of  the tanker market experienced downward pressure over the course of the recent quarter primarily due to heavy refinery maintenance opec supply cuts and higher tanker fleet growth overall we anticipate the tanker market to weaken into  as a result of ongoing opec supply cuts and higher tanker fleet growth however robust global oil demand growth and changing trading patterns due to opec supply cuts are expected to provide support to midsize tanker demand as more crude oil moves longhaul from the atlantic basin to asia looking ahead to  we anticipate a renewed market upturn driven by a lack of new tanker ordering increased scrapping due to regulatory changes and a more balanced oil marketin addition to completing the sale and delivery of our older tonnage and generating strong cash flow from operations during the quarter we are continuing to focus on further strengthening our balance sheet commented mr mackay we have recently signed a term sheet on a year saleleaseback financing transaction for four of our modern suezmax tankers once finalized this transaction is expected to increase our liquidity position by

summary of recent developmentssaleleaseback financing transactionin april  teekay tankers signed a term sheet for a  million year saleleaseback financing relating to four of its modern suezmax tankers the transaction once completed is expected to further strengthen the companys balance sheet and increase the companys liquidity position by approximately  million the transaction which is subject to final lessor approval and customary closing conditions is expected to be completed in midsale of an older aframax tankerin march  teekay tankers agreed to sell a built aframax tanker the kyeema spirit to a third party for proceeds of approximately  million which is scheduled to deliver in the second quarter of secured additional fixedrate chartersince february  teekay tankers entered into a time charterout contract for one suezmax tanker at a rate of approximately  per day and a firm period of one year plus an extension option which commenced in earlyapril tanker market although the company recorded stronger average spot tanker rates for its aframax and lr product tanker fleets and rates similar for its suezmax tanker in the first quarter of  compared with rates for the fourth quarter  the tanker market experienced downward pressure over the course of the first quarter due to heavy refinery maintenance opec supply cuts and higher tanker fleet growth however changing trade patterns due to opec production cuts have provided support for midsized spot tanker rates as a decline in middle eastern oil exports resulted in an increase in tonmile intensive atlantic basin to asia oil movementsread moresince the start of  opec has implemented  million barrels per day mbd of oil production cuts in an effort to rebalance oil prices compliance with these cuts by opec members was  percent as of march  with most cuts coming from saudi arabia while opec cuts are negative for overall oil volumes available for transport the midsized segments have found some support from increased tonmile demand as asian buyers look to atlantic basin supply to replace reduced opec barrels for the first four months of  us crude exports averaged  mbd higher yearonyear and reached  mbd by midmarch  overall us crude volumes are increasingly moving to asian and european buyers which is supportive of midsized tanker demand in february  china imported  mbd of us crude overtaking canada as the largest importer of us crudein addition to these positive trade fundamentals global oil demand growth remains robust with forecast growth of approximately  mbd in  according to the iea this growth is expected to provide further support for midsized tanker rates during an otherwise challenging freight rate environmentin  the company anticipates high tanker fleet growth to present headwinds to the crude spot tanker market during the first four months of  the world tanker fleet grew by  million deadweight tons mdwt or  percent total tanker fleet growth for  is forecast to be  mdwt or approximately  percent which is slightly lower than  but consistent with the tenyear average midsize tanker fleet growth is expected to be around  mdwt or approximately  percent for  after two years of record low scrapping the company believes that scrapping has the potential to ramp up in the nearterm given the current weakness in spot tanker rates combined with an aging fleet across all segments new regulations including ballast water management may also increase scrapping in the mediumtermoverall the company expects  to be a year of softer tanker rates compared to  however growing crude oil supply in the atlantic moving longhaul to asia is expected to provide some underlying support to help offset the negative fundamentals of lower opec supply and a period of higher fleet growth the company anticipates this nearterm dip in the market cycle to be relatively shortterm in nature as a lack of new tanker ordering in the midsized segments and increased scrapping due to regulatory changes as well as a more balanced oil market is expected to lead to a renewed market upturn in operating results the following table highlights the operating performance of the companys
