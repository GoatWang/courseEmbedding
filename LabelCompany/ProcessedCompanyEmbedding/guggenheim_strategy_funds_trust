funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high low this fund scores low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics before making your investment decisionlearn more morningstar® snapshot as of  morningstar category managed

 managed futures      as of  risk low avg high average this fund scores average because morningstar has rated its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high low this fund scores low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds

of longterm capital appreciation under normal market conditions the fund will invest at least  of its net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in equity securities gpim will manage the fund utilizing a covered call strategy developed by gpim to seek to utilize efficiencies from the tax characteristics of the funds portfolio gpims covered call strategy will seek to follow a dynamic rulesbased methodology to obtain broadly diversified exposure to the equity markets either through investments that replicate the economic characteristics of broadly diversified exposure to the equity markets including exchangetraded funds or other investment funds that track equity market indices or through investments in individual common stocks along with other securities and instruments the fund will have the ability to write call options on indices andor securities which will typically be at or outofthe money gpims strategy typically targets onemonth options although options of any strike price or maturity may be utilized the fund will seek to earn income and gains through both dividends paid by on securities owned by the fund and cash premiums received from selling options although the fund will receive premiums from the options written by writing a covered call option the fund forgoes any potential increase in value of the underlying securities above the strike price specified in an option contract through the expiration date of the option to the extent gpims strategy seeks to achieve broad equity exposure through a portfolio of common stocks the fund would hold a diversified portfolio of stocks whereas to the extent gpims equity exposure strategy is implemented through investment in broadbased equity exchangetraded funds and other investment

describe the differences between closedend and openend funds an openend fund may be purchased or sold at nav an openend fund will issue new shares when an investor wants to purchases shares in the fund and will sell assets to redeem shares when an investor wants to sell shares when selling an openend fund the price the seller receives is established at the close of the market when the nav is calculated unlike the openend fund a closedend fund has a limited number of shares outstanding and trades on an exchange at the market price based on supply and demand an investor may purchase or sell shares at market price while the exchange is open the common shares may trade at a discount or premium to the nav what does the exdiv or the exdividend date refer to every quarter the fund pays dividends and those investors who purchase the fund before the exdividend date will receive the next dividend distribution investors who purchase on or after the exdividend date will not receive the next dividend distribution the value of the dividend is subtracted from the funds nav on the exdividend date each quarter so when the nav is reported with an exdiv behind it this means that the amount of the dividend has already been taken out of the nav what is the drip and how does it work drip is the dividend reinvestment plan the number of shares of common stock distributed to participants in the plan in lieu of a cash dividend is determined in the following manner whenever the market price per share of the fund’s common stock is equal to or exceeds the net asset value per share on the valuation date participants in the plan will be issued new shares valued at the higher of net asset value or  of the thencurrent market value otherwise the administrator will buy shares of the common

no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objectives the value of the fund will fluctuate with the value of the underlying securities historically closedend funds often trade at a discount to their net asset value risk is inherent in all investing including the loss of your entire principal therefore before investing you should consider the following risks carefully equity securities and related market risk the market price of common stocks and other equity securities may go up or down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities may decline in value due to factors affecting equity securities markets generally particular industries represented in those markets or the issuer itself the values of equity securities may decline due to general market conditions which are not specifically related to a particular company such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions changes in the general outlook for corporate earnings changes in interest or currency rates or adverse investor sentiment generally they may also decline due to factors which affect a particular industry or industries such as labor shortages or increased production costs and competitive conditions within an industry the value of equity securities may also decline for a number of other reasons which directly relate to the issuer such as management performance financial leverage the issuer’s historical and prospective earnings the value of its assets and reduced demand for its goods and services equity securities generally have greater price volatility than bonds and other debt securities other investment companies risk the fund may invest in securities of other openor closedend investment companies including etfs as a stockholder in an investment company the fund will bear its ratable share of that investment company’s expenses and would remain subject to payment of the fund’s investment management fees with respect to the assets so invested shareholders would therefore be subject to duplicative expenses to the extent the fund invests in other investment companies in addition these other investment companies may utilize financial leverage in which case an investment would subject the fund to additional risks associated with leverage options risk there are various risks associated with the fund’s covered call option strategy the purchaser of an index option written by the fund has the right to any appreciation in the cash value of the index over the strike price on the expiration date therefore as the writer of an index call option the fund forgoes the opportunity to profit from increases in the index over the strike price of the option however the fund has retained the risk of loss net of premiums received should the price of the fund’s portfolio securities decline similarly as the writer of a call option on an individual security held in the fund’s portfolio the fund forgoes during the option’s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike price of the call but has retained the risk of loss net of premiums received should the price of the underlying security decline the value of options written by the fund which will be priced daily will be affected by among other factors changes in the value of underlying securities including those comprising an index changes in the dividend rates of underlying securities changes in interest rates changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the stock market and underlying securities and the remaining time to an option’s expiration the value of an option also may be adversely affected if the market for the option is reduced or becomes less liquid there are significant differences between the securities and options markets that could result in an imperfect correlation between these markets causing a given transaction not to achieve its objectives a decision as to whether when and how to use options involves the exercise of skill and judgment and even a well conceived transaction may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or unexpected events in the case of index options gpim will attempt to maintain for the fund written call options positions on equity indexes whose price movements taken in the aggregate are closely correlated with the price movements of common stocks and other securities held in the fund’s equity portfolio however this strategy involves significant risk that the changes in value of the indexes underlying the fund’s written call options positions will not correlate closely with changes in the market value of securities held by the fund to the extent that there is a lack of correlation movements in the indexes underlying the options positions may result in losses to the fund which may more than offset any gains received by the fund from options premiums in these and other circumstances the fund may be required to sell portfolio securities to satisfy its obligations as the writer of an index call option when it would not otherwise choose to do so or may choose to sell portfolio securities to realize gains to supplement fund distributions such sales would involve transaction costs borne by the fund and may also result in realization of taxable capital gains including shortterm capital gains taxed at ordinary income tax rates and may adversely impact the fund’s aftertax returns there can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist when the fund seeks to close out an option position reasons for the absence of a liquid secondary market on an exchange include the following i there may be insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions may be imposed by an exchange on opening transactions or closing transactions or both iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions may be imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options iv unusual or unforeseen circumstances may interrupt normal operations on an exchange v the facilities of an exchange or the options clearing corporation the “occ” may not at all times be adequate to handle current trading volume or vi one or more exchanges could for economic or other reasons decide or be compelled at some future date to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options if trading were discontinued the secondary market on that exchange or in that class or series of options would cease to exist however outstanding options on that exchange that had been issued by the occ as a result of trades on that exchange would continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms in the event that the fund were unable to close out a call option that it had written on a portfolio security it would not be able to sell the underlying security unless the option expired without exercise to the extent that the fund owns unlisted or “overthecounter” options the fund’s ability to terminate these options may be more limited than with exchangetraded options and may involve enhanced risk that counterparties participating in such transactions will not fulfill their obligations the hours of trading for options may not conform to the hours during which the securities held by the fund are traded to the extent that the options markets close before the markets for the underlying securities significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the options markets additionally the exercise price of an option may be adjusted downward before the option’s expiration as a result of the occurrence of certain corporate events affecting underlying securities such as extraordinary dividends stock splits mergers or other extraordinary distributions or events a reduction in the exercise price of an option might reduce the fund’s capital appreciation potential on underlying securities held by the fund the fund’s use of purchased put options on equity indexes as a hedging strategy would involve certain risks similar to those of written call options including that the strategy may not work as intended due to a lack of correlation between changes in value of the index underlying the put option and changes in the market value of the fund’s portfolio securities further a put option acquired by the fund and not sold prior to expiration will expire worthless if the cash value of the index or market value of the underlying security at expiration exceeds the exercise price of the option thereby causing the fund to lose its entire investment in the option the fund’s options transactions will be subject to limitations established by each of the exchanges boards of trade or other trading facilities on which the options are traded these limitations govern the maximum number of options in each class which may be written or purchased by a single investor or group of investors acting in concert regardless of whether the options are written or purchased on the same or different exchanges boards of trade or other trading facilities or are held or written in one or more accounts or through one or more brokers thus the number of options which the fund may write or purchase may be affected by options written or purchased by other investment advisory clients of gpim an exchange board of trade or other trading facility may order the liquidation of positions found to be in excess of these limits and it may impose other sanctions other derivatives risk derivatives are subject to a number of risks such as liquidity risk equity securities risk issuer risk interest rate risk credit risk leveraging risk counterparty risk management risk and if applicable medium and smaller company risk they also involve the risk of mispricing or improper valuation the risk of ambiguous documentation and the risk that changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with an underlying asset interest rate or index suitable derivative transactions may not be available in all circumstances and there can be no assurance that the fund will engage in these transactions to reduce exposure to other risks when that would be beneficial the use of derivatives transactions may result in losses greater than if they had not been used may require the fund to sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices other than current market values may limit the amount of appreciation the fund can realize on an investment or may cause the fund to hold a security that it might otherwise sell additionally amounts paid by the fund as premiums and cash or other assets held in margin accounts with respect to derivatives  transactions are not otherwise available to the fund for investment purposes the fund may enter into derivatives transactions that may in certain circumstances produce effects similar to leverage and expose the fund to related risks see “leverage risk” below counterparty risk the fund will be subject to risk with respect to the counterparties to the derivative contracts purchased or sold by the fund if a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under a derivative contract due to financial difficulties the fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery under the derivative contract in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding the fund may obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in these circumstances medium and smaller company risk the general risks associated with the types of securities in which the fund invests are particularly pronounced for securities issued by companies with medium and smaller market capitalizations these companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources or they may depend on a few key employees as a result they may be subject to greater levels of credit market and issuer risk securities of medium and smaller companies may trade less frequently and in lesser volume than more widely held securities and their values may fluctuate more sharply than other securities financial leverage risk use of financial leverage creates an opportunity for increased income and capital appreciation but at the same time creates special risks there can be no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be utilized or will be successful financial leverage is a speculative technique that exposes the fund to greater risk and increased costs than if it were not implemented increases and decreases in the value of the fund’s portfolio will be magnified when the fund uses financial leverage as a result financial leverage may cause greater changes in the fund’s net asset value and returns than if financial leverage had not been used the fund will also have to pay interest on its indebtedness if any which may reduce the fund’s return this interest expense may be greater than the fund’s return on the underlying investment which would negatively affect the performance of the fund during the time in which the fund is utilizing financial leverage the amount of the fees paid to the adviser and the subadviser for investment advisory services will be higher than if the fund did not utilize financial leverage because the fees paid will be calculated based on the fund’s managed assets including proceeds of financial leverage this may create a conflict of interest between the adviser and the subadviser and common shareholders common shareholders bear the portion of the investment advisory fee attributable to the assets purchased with the proceeds of financial leverage which means that common shareholders effectively bear the entire advisory fee in order to manage this conflict of interest any use of financial leverage must be approved by the board of trustees and the board of trustees will receive regular reports from the adviser and the subadviser regarding the fund’s use of financial leverage and the effect of financial leverage on the management of the fund’s portfolio and the performance of the fund reverse repurchase agreements involve the risks that the interest income earned on the investment of the proceeds will be less than the interest expense and fund expenses that the market value of the securities sold by the fund may decline below the price at which the fund is obligated to repurchase such securities and that the securities may not be returned to the fund foreign investment risk the fund’s investments in adrs and other securities of foreign issuers involve special risks for example the value of these investments may decline in response to unfavorable political and legal developments unreliable or untimely information or economic and financial instability there may be less publicly available information about a foreign company than a us company foreign companies are not generally subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial standards and requirements comparable to those standards applicable to us companies similar foreign investment risks may apply to futures contracts and other derivative instruments in which the fund invests that trade on foreign exchanges the value of derivative and other instruments denominated in or that pay revenues in foreign currencies may fluctuate based on changes in the value of those currencies relative to the us dollar and a decline in applicable foreign exchange rates could reduce the value of such instruments held by the fund foreign settlement procedures also may involve additional risks inflationdeflation risk inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from the fund’s investments will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of payments at future dates as inflation increases the real value of the fund’s portfolio could decline deflation risk is the risk that prices throughout the economy decline over time deflation may have an adverse effect on the creditworthiness of issuers and may make issuer default more likely which may result in a decline in the value of the fund’s portfolio management risk the fund is subject to management risk because it has an actively managed portfolio the subadviser will apply investment techniques and risk analysis in making investment decisions for the fund but there can be no guarantee that these will produce the desired results the fund will invest in securities that the subadviser believes are undervalued or mispriced as a result of recent economic events such as market dislocations the inability of other investors to evaluate risk and forced selling if the subadviser’s perception of the value of a security is incorrect your investment in the fund may lose value portfolio turnover risk the fund’s annual portfolio turnover rate may vary greatly from year to year portfolio turnover rate is not considered a limiting factor in the execution of investment decisions for the fund a higher portfolio turnover rate results in correspondingly greater brokerage commissions and other transactional expenses that are borne by the fund high portfolio turnover may result in an increased realization of net shortterm capital gains by the fund which when distributed to shareholders will be taxable as ordinary income additionally in a declining market portfolio turnover may create realized capital losses recent market developments during the financial crisis of  global financial markets have experienced periods of severe turmoil the debt and equity capital markets in the united states were negatively impacted by significant writeoffs in the financial services sector relating to subprime mortgages and the repricing of credit risk in the broader market among other things these events along with the deterioration of the housing market the failure of major financial institutions and the resulting united states federal government actions led to worsening general economic conditions which materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial firms in particular volatile financial markets can expose the fund to greater market and liquidity risk and potential difficulty in valuing portfolio instruments held by the fund recently markets have witnessed more stabilized economic activity as expectations for an economic recovery increased however risks to a robust resumption of growth persist a us or global economic downturn could adversely impact the fund’s portfolio market and economic disruptions have affected and may in the future affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt and home prices among other factors moreover federal reserve policy including with respect to certain interest rates and the decision to end its quantitative easing policy may adversely affect the value volatility and liquidity of dividend and interestpaying securities market volatility rising interest rates andor a return to unfavorable economic conditions could impair the fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective legislation risk at any time after the date of this prospectus legislation may be enacted that could negatively affect the companies in which the fund invests changing approaches to regulation may have a negative impact companies in which the fund invests in addition legislation or regulation may also change the way in which the fund itself is regulated there can be no assurance that future legislation regulation or deregulation will not have a material adverse effect on the fund or will not impair the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objectives the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” which was signed into law in july  has resulted in a significant revision of the us financial regulatory framework the doddfrank act covers a broad range of topics including among many others a reorganization of federal financial regulators the creation of a process designed to ensure financial system stability and the resolution of potentially insolvent financial firms the enactment of new rules for derivatives trading the creation of a consumer financial protection watchdog the registration and regulation of managers of private funds the regulation of rating agencies and the enactment of new federal requirements for residential mortgage loans title vii the “derivatives title” of the doddfrank act imposes a new regulatory structure on derivatives markets with particular emphasis on swaps and securitybased swaps collectively “swaps” the adviser andor the fund may incur additional legal and compliance costs and transaction fees in connection with the trading of such swaps regulatory changes imposed as a result of the implementation of the derivatives title may jeopardize certain trades andor trading strategies that may be employed by the adviser or at least make them more costly there may be market dislocations due to uncertainty during the implementation period of any new regulation and the adviser cannot know how the derivatives market will adjust to new regulations on december   the sec published a proposed rule that if adopted would change the regulation of the use of derivative instruments and financial commitment transactions by registered investment companies the sec sought public comments on numerous aspects of the proposed rule and as a result the nature of any final regulations is uncertain at this time such regulations could limit the implementation of the fund’s use of derivatives and impose additional compliance costs on the fund which could have an adverse impact on the fund market disruption and geopolitical risk the aftermath of the war in iraq and the continuing occupation of iraq instability in the middle east and terrorist attacks in the united states and around the world have contributed to increased market volatility may have longterm effects on the us and worldwide financial markets and may cause further economic uncertainties or deterioration in the united states and worldwide the adviser and subadviser do not know how long the financial markets will continue to be affected by these events and cannot predict the effects of these or similar events in the future on the us and global economies and securities markets antitakeover provisions risk the fund’s amended and restated agreement and declaration of trust the “declaration of trust” and the fund’s amended and restated bylaws collectively the “governing documents” include provisions that could limit the ability of other entities or persons to acquire control of the fund or convert the fund to an openend fund these provisions could have the effect of depriving the common shareholders of opportunities to sell their common shares at a premium over the thencurrent market price of the common shares market discount risk shares of closedend management investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value which is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that the fund’s net asset value could decrease as a result of its investment activities although the value of the fund’s net assets is generally considered by market participants in determining whether to purchase or sell common shares whether investors will realize gains or losses upon the sale of common shares will depend entirely upon whether the market price of common shares at the time of sale is above or below the investor’s purchase price for common shares because the market price of common shares will be determined by factors such as net asset value dividend and distribution levels which are dependent in part on expenses supply of and demand for common shares stability of dividends or distributions trading volume of common shares general market and economic conditions and other factors beyond the control of the fund the fund cannot predict whether common shares will trade at below or above net asset value or at below or above the initial public offering price this risk may be greater for investors expecting to sell their common shares soon after the completion of the public offering as the net asset value of the common shares will be reduced immediately following the offering as a result of the payment of certain offering costs common shares of the fund are designed primarily for longterm investors
