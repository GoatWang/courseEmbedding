tredici wows bryn mawr with an alluring taste of the big city the town dish staff had the opportunity to be the very first table seated at the friends and family event of the main line area’s newest—and quite enthralling—enoteca tredici on wednesday june  figuring we might experience the proverbial hiccup or two from a somewhat freshman staff we were pleasantly surprised that our initial visit was a resounding success right out of the gate our team was enamored over the slick mix of the classic and urban design of enoteca tredici and owner greg dodge’s enthusiasm became evident when we asked about the new space “i like to ‘borrow’ ideas from some of my favorite restaurants and i’ve incorporated many of those elements with a personal flair into the bryn mawr design” during a brief personal tour we were shown handcrafted dramatic lighting fixtures the bustling open design kitchen secluded yet expansive private dining rooms the seat bar and in our opinion the most comfortable and unique bar stools anywhere be forewarned to sit sip and sip some more greg of zavino hospitality group opened this fourth location of his alreadyacclaimed list of restaurants located at th and sansom st and university city in philadelphia and at the st gregory hotel in washington dc he was looking to find a spot a bit closer to where he and his family live and the opportunity to join bryn mawr village with other new local favorites la colombe bryn  dane’s and turning point was too good to pass up the squarefoot almost warehouselike interior blends wellplaced curved half walls artsy openshelving reflective mirrors and windows that actually create a sense of intimacy in the sprawling space tredici continues to pull out all the stops with herringbone hardwood floors carrara marble countertops laden with wellproduced floral centerpieces more polished glass silver and serving plates and accents among a tall canopy of ’ live trees and skylights while architecturally superior we know it’s the food that drives the zavino model of success the menu here is focused yet diverse and sharable we tasted a wellpresented raw bar sampler  that included oysters crab claws and plump shrimp a inch flatbread  named the stache was hot and plentiful with pistachio pesto mozzarella and parmesan cheeses with a light lemon vinaigrette and arugula a small plate of spiced moroccan ribs were sweet and fell off the bone directly into our mouths other pasta meat and vegetarian dishes on the menu are set up to be sharable as well and we favor that line of culinary adventure the bar selections are inspired and playful with cocktails like the papi collins a tallsized summer sipper with revivalist gin thyme and prosecco the tredici daiquiri love this modern twist on a classic drink and a sharp concoction called the razor which starts with our local favorite stateside vodka a full list of reds and whites by the glass or bottle are ready to be uncorked and a craft beer list is brief but effective the staff was friendly wellgroomed wellprepared knowledgeable of both the bar and food menus and smiled in all the right places which really is a pleasure these days enoteca tredici is open from – pm tuesday through sunday – pm friday and saturday and closed on monday brunch hours will be added in the near future so stay in the know on facebook instagram and the enoteca
