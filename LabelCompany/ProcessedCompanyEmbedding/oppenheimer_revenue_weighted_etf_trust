jul    am edt new york july   prnewswire  oppenheimerfunds a leading global asset manager is expanding its beta solutions product offerings with the launch of three new revenueweighted etfs in the emerging global and international market segments the firm has introduced oppenheimer emerging markets revenue etf reem oppenheimer global revenue etf rglb and oppenheimer international revenue etf refa our newest etf solutions were created in direct response to our clients growing appetite for revenueweighted strategies in the global marketplace said sharon french head of beta solutions at oppenheimerfunds our approach offers a durable value proposition with attractive riskadjusted performance and the broad market diversification that has historically attracted investors to index strategies oppenheimer emerging markets revenue etf reem seeks to outperform the msci emerging markets index with an expense ratio of  basis points oppenheimer global revenue etf rglb seeks to outperform the msci all country world index with an expense ratio of  basis points oppenheimer international revenue etf refa seeks to outperform the msci eafe index with an expense ratio of  basis points the securities in each of the new funds are weighted by their trailing month topline revenue rather than their market capitalization with a  maximum portfolio weight for any one issuer the funds are rebalanced quarterly oppenheimers fundamentally weighted etfs offer a way for advisors wealth managers and consultants to access broad market exposure in a potentially more optimal way than traditional market capitalization strategies by weighting securities in broad market indices based on revenue rather than market capitalization the fundamentally weighted strategies offer the opportunity to reduce overexposure to potentially overpriced sectors and stocks while still providing the broad diversification of an index trending the apple ipod nano and shuffle have officially
