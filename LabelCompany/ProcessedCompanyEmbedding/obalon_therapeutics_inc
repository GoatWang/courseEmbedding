us food and drug administration fda of the obalon balloon system a novel nonsurgical fullyreversible device for weight loss the obalon balloon system is a swallowable intragastric balloon system indicated for temporary use to facilitate weight loss in adults with obesity bmi of  –  kgm who have failed to lose weight through diet and exercise the system is intended to be used as an adjunct to a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program all balloons must be removed  months after the first balloon is placed   were excited to bring this novel technology to the approximately  million adults in the united states who are struggling with obesity for physicians we believe that the obalon technology represents an important new option for both their practices and their patients who are obese and looking to lose weight commented andy rasdal chief executive officer of obalon therapeutics id also like to recognize the fda for their efficient and interactive review of our product which represents another option for physicians and patients in the battle against the obesity epidemic the obalon balloon system consists of a balloon folded inside a capsule that is swallowed by the patient with no sedation or anesthesia required  once the balloon reaches the stomach it is remotely inflated with gas via a microcatheter that is then removed leaving a lightweight buoyant balloon in the stomach over the next three months of treatment two additional balloons are swallowed and inflated at the end of the sixmonth treatment period all three balloons are removed via an outpatient endoscopy under conscious sedation   we participated in the obalon clinical trial and are excited to now have the obalon balloon system readily available for our patients who have been frustrated by not being able to lose weight through diet and exercise alone stated dr aurora pryor director of the bariatric and metabolic weight loss center at the stony brook university school of medicines department of surgery the obalon balloon is swallowable can typically be placed in less than  minutes without the use of sedation or anesthesia and was welltolerated by our patients in the clinical trial having now received fda approval we can begin treating more patients with the device in the clinical trial  patients in the united states across fifteen clinical trial sites were randomized in a doubleblind shamcontrolled study the patients in the clinical trial received either three obalon balloons or three sham placebolike devices that looked similar to the balloons but were filled with sugar the patients in both groups were given minimal diet counseling of  minutes every three weeks both coprimary weight loss endpoints were met with approximately  of patients who received the obalon balloon system experiencing clinically meaningful weight loss of at least  of their total body weight which is twice as many people than in the shamcontrol group the clinical trial data will be presented at obesity week this fall in new orleans the clinical trial design for the obalon balloon system was highly rigorous and the system demonstrated a favorable safety profile stated dr shelby sullivan director of the gastroenterology bariatric and metabolic program at the university of colorado school of medicine we were also pleased to see that patients tolerated the administrations of the obalon balloon remarkably well with no recovery time needed this is in contrast to other currently approved intragastric balloon devices where most patients cannot immediately return to normal activities     the obalon balloon system is expected to be available in early  to physicians who complete the obalon balloon system training program obalon is currently in the process of identifying hiring and training the appropriate personnel to ensure that the product can be implemented in the commercial setting with the same strong safety and efficacy profile as was demonstrated in the clinical trial a prior generation of the obalon balloon system indicated for threemonths of treatment is currently available in select international markets with more than  balloons having been sold internationally   about obalon therapeutics inc obalon therapeutics inc is a san diegobased company focused on developing and commercializing novel technologies for weight
