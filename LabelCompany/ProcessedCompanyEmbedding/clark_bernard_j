has long held a special place among works on the bible it brings together all the relevant aids to exegesis linguistic and textual archaeological historical literary and theological with a comprehensiveness and quality of scholarship unmatched by any other series the icc series has also been rather difficult to purchase in its entirety due in part to the cost of the print volumes numerous revisions of various volumes and the fact that most retailers do not offer the entire set as one purchase the logos edition contains the most recent edition of each title and provides an easy way to own every volume of this oftencited commentary set if you were to purchase all  volumes in print at suggested retail price the cost would be over  the logos edition provides a substantial discount and presents the content in a more flexible medium than print this series is under the editorship of professor j a emerton of cambridge professor c e b cranfield of durham and professor g n stanton of cambridge with logos bible software you can reap the maximum benefit from the volume icc by getting easier access to the contents of this series—helping you to use these volumes more efficiently for research and sermon preparation every word from every book has been indexed and catalogued to help you search the entire series for a particular verse or topic giving you instant access to crossreferences along with this your titles will automatically integrate into custom search reports passage guides exegetical guides and the other advanced features of logos bible software what’s more with logos every word is essentially a link scripture references are linked directly to greek and hebrew texts along with the english bible translations of your choice that gives you access to technical linguistic data along with the tools for accurate exegesis and interpretation note many of the titles in this series have gone through a number of revisions see the bibliography

epistle to the galatians with definite reference to the preparation of this commentary it was with a clear conviction that if i was to make any appreciable contribution to the understanding of the epistle it would be by confining myself to a few of the several lines of study which an interpreter might properly and profitably undertake i decided not to attempt an exhaustive study of the history of the interpretation of the epistle or of the rabbinic writings and method of exegesis convinced that despite all that had been done in the study of the vocabulary of the new testament much remained still to be done and strongly inclined to expect that such study would aid materially in the recovery of the primary elements of the thought of the apostle paul persuaded also that such lexicographical work would prepare the way for a clearer perception of the course of thought of the epistle i determined while not wholly neglecting other lines of study to give my chief attention first to a fresh historical study of the vocabulary of the letter and then to an endeavour to trace its course of thought with exactness and to state it with clearness —from the preface ernest de witt

church pastoral epistles author i howard marshall publisher tt clark publication date  pages  sample pages              i have tried to present the message of the letters as they are ostensibly meant to be understood as letters from paul to timothy and titus but i am well aware that right from the beginning of their ‘canonical’ history the letters were intended to be read for their relevance to the church and its leaders and it is therefore also on that level that they are interpreted i am conscious that only to a very limited extent has the commentary attempted to ask questions about the history of exposition or about the significance of the letters for the modern reader but i hope that the exegesis has been done in such a way that expositors will find it a helpful basis for application a recent commentator on another epistle has stated that ‘commentaries should be a resource for worship rather than a selfindulgent exploration of the biblical text’ like him i write from a selfconsciously christian set of presuppositions and it is my hope that this commentary will help readers to appropriate the message of this particular part of holy scripture —from the preface i
