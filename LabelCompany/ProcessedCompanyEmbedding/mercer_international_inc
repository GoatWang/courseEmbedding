press releases signup menu nasdaqmerc  nbsk pulp all of mercers pulp mills produce northern bleached softwood kraft nbsk  a premium pulp grade that is prized for its strength and reinforcing characteristics production processnbsk pulp is produced from slow growing and long fiber northern softwood tree species typically our wood is sourced from sawmill residuals and low grade pulp logs the latter of which is debarked and chipped before beginning the pulping process the process used to convert wood into nbsk pulp is a sulphate kraft cooking process the woodchips are chemically cooked to separate the cellulose the fibers from the hemicellulose lignin and extractives the chemical compounds that hold the fibers together once the fibers are separated they are washed bleached formed into sheets and dried the sheets are packaged and shipped to customers around the world market fundamentalstodays modern paper products are a selective mix of different types of fibers the strength characteristics of nbsk make it an essential component in a number of these products that we use in our everyday lives such as tissue printing and writing paper and specialty paper nbsks strength characteristics are valued by papermakers and as a result nbsk commands premium prices when compared to other pulp grades because it is relatively more expensive than other pulp types end product producers generally try to minimize the amount of nbsk that they use paper producers profit maximizing tactics and market fundamentals over recent history lead us to believe that nbsk substitution for lower value fibers will be more difficult in the future globally demand for nbskrequiring paper goods  especially tissue hygiene products highend printing and specialty paper  is increasing this is due to improving global living standards in emerging countries along with aging populations and growing demand for health and hygiene products we believe that the nbsk pulp market shows strong longterm demand fundamentals our performancemercer is one of the largest nbsk market pulp producers in the world we are constantly looking at ways to make our production process more efficient and as

internationals flagship product line and is our most recognized development in the field of wastewater treatment with the clean water act of the s in the us came a new set of rules the creation of oversight bodies and new benchmarks for acceptable wastewater effluent limits were long over due with these new regulations came an enforcement body that drew its cross hairs around not only the biggest offenders but those with the biggest purse strings as wellmercer international was founded as a company to remove the gray area for its clients will it work was no longer a question that was accepted without significant review it was about time a separator manufacturer brought the actual performance in parody with theoretical calculations when the traditional tank manufactures failed to address the key design changes that needed to be made mercer designed and manufactured equipment to meet the new regulations instead of designing around another status quo unit the result was piece of mind for not only major utility petrochemical and industrial companies and large transportation companies but also piece of mind for the small automotive shops and various small to medium industrial companies environmental consulting engineers often specify our oilwater separators because of its versatile design mercer builds standard units of all sizes  gpm and of various configurations and styles we sell to a wide array of clients in many industries flexibility we can do that is what we like to say or you may hear us say no we dont think you need that have you considered this    this is what we did for another client  during the project review flexibility means customization mercer has created many custom oilwater separators based on difficult wastewater applications tight space limitations and varied corrosive wastewater conditions to name a few demanding applications demand custom solutions mercer carefully listens to and on some occasions even challenges the decision makers in the selection process from ceo to engineer to maintenance professional constantly seeking out and solving these technical problems has led mercer to identify and incorporate certain design standards that are overlooked by the competitionmercer oil water separation products»the multipack design allows flexibility that is impossible to obtain with other coalescer designs for example the plate gaps within the coalescer can be varied in order to finetune the separator to maximize efficiency after the installation process flexibility means the ability to handle unforeseen wastewater conditions changes in effluent limitations or a change in the amount of solids present in the wastewater the multi pack removable plate coalescer system allows the end user to adjust to any  right angle gap in the field by simply adding or removing the smooth flat coalescer plates if a higher efficiency is required down the road just add additional plates and maximize the efficiency of the coalscer by increasing plate surface areawithout any modifications to the separator or the coalescer have an issue with solids fouling certain areas of the coalescer simply pull plates only in these areas and keep the higher efficiency throughout the rest of the pack the multipack can be finetuned in the field to meet your effluent efficiency needs as well as the maintenance requirementsanother interesting way to utilize the adjustable plate feature is to keep tighter plate gaps toward to top of the coalescer pack where there are typically fewer solids present and larger plate gaps toward the bottom where solids concentrations are frequently higher most popular related searches mobile oilwater separator coalescing oilwater separator above ground oilwater separator below ground oilwater

ability to customize in the field translated we have built a better mousetrap this is critical to end users that are committed to zero tolerance in regard to exceeding their effluent limitationsat the heart of each compliance master™ oil water separator mercer delivers to clients worldwide is themultipack removable plate coalescer system  learn more compliancethe compliance master oilwater separato compliancethe compliance master oilwater separator is mercer internationals flagship product line and is our most recognized development in the field of wastewater treatment with the clean water act of the s in the us came a new set of rules the creation of oversight bodies and new benchmarks for acceptable wastewater effluent limits were long over due with these new regulations came an enforcement body that drew its cross hairs around not only the biggest offenders but those with the biggest purse strings as wellmercer international was founded as a company to remove the gray area for its clients will it work was no longer a question that was accepted without significant review it was about time a separator manufacturer brought the actual performance in parody with theoretical calculations when the traditional tank manufactures failed to address the key design changes that needed to be made mercer designed and manufactured equipment to meet the new regulations instead of designing around another status quo unit the result was piece of mind for not only major utility petrochemical and industrial companies and large transportation companies but also piece of mind for the small automotive shops and various small to medium industrial companies environmental consulting engineers often specify our oilwater separators because of its versatile design mercer builds standard units of all sizes  gpm and of various configurations and styles we sell to a wide array of clients in many industries flexibility we can do that is what we like to say or you may hear us say no we dont think you need that have you considered this    this is what we did for another client  during the project review flexibility means customization mercer has created many custom oilwater separators based on difficult wastewater applications tight space limitations and varied corrosive wastewater conditions to name a few demanding applications demand custom solutions mercer carefully listens to and on some occasions even challenges the decision makers in the selection process from ceo to engineer to maintenance professional constantly seeking out and solving these technical problems has led mercer to identify and incorporate certain design standards that are overlooked by the competitionmercer oil water separation products»the multipack design allows flexibility that is impossible to obtain with other coalescer designs for example the plate gaps within the coalescer can be varied in order to finetune the separator to maximize efficiency after the installation process flexibility means the ability to handle unforeseen wastewater conditions changes in effluent limitations or a change in the amount of solids present in the wastewater the multi pack removable plate coalescer system allows the end user to adjust to any  right angle gap in the field by simply adding or removing the smooth flat coalescer plates if a higher efficiency is required down the road just add additional plates and maximize the efficiency of the coalscer by increasing plate surface areawithout any modifications to the separator or the coalescer have an issue with solids fouling certain areas of the coalescer simply pull plates only in these areas and keep the higher efficiency throughout the rest of the pack the multipack can be finetuned in the field to meet your effluent efficiency needs as well as the maintenance requirementsanother interesting way to utilize the adjustable plate feature is to keep tighter plate gaps toward to top of the coalescer pack where there are typically fewer solids present and larger plate gaps toward the bottom where solids concentrations are frequently higher most popular related searches mobile oilwater separator coalescing oilwater
