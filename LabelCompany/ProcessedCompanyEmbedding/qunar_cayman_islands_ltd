invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search why ctripcom and qunar cayman islands ltd both popped today a promising share swap has investors in the chinese travel sites rejoicing heres why steve symington tmfsymington oct   at pm what shares of ctripcom international nasdaqctrp and fellow chinese mobile and online travel specialist qunar cayman islands nasdaqqunr were up  and  respectively as of  pm monday after ctrip announced the completion of a share exchange with baidu nasdaqbidu shares of baidu were also up around  on the news so what specifically ctrip announced baidu has exchanged  class a shares and  class b shares of qunar cayman islands owned by baidu for  newly issued shares of ctrip that equates to a shareexchange ratio of roughly  ctrip american depositary shares ads per qunar ads consequently baidu will own shares representing roughly  of ctrips aggregate voting interest while ctrip will own shares representing around  of qunars voting interest as the technology leading player in the industry added qunar ceo cc zhuang qunar has become chinas fourthlargest ecommerce company with tremendous growth momentum we are very proud of our team and appreciate the support from our global shareholder base this milestone transaction will enable us to focus on providing the best travel products and services to our travelers stated ctrip ceo james liang we believe this will create greater value to our customers partners and shareholders in the future now what baidu and ctrip have also agreed to a business cooperation across a broad base of products and services and baidu voiced its intention to continue cooperating with qunar recall baidu was already qunars single largest shareholder and just last month the two companies moved to deepen their existing strategic alliance including the expansion of qunars board of directors to include three baidu executives arguably more interesting however is that the deal came less than six months after qunar received  and subsequently declined  an unsolicited offer from ctripcom opting instead to take a  million investment from silver lake and another unnamed investor to help expand its mobile presence grow business lines and further enhance technology capabilities but qunar also told investors it remained open to engaging in further discussions with ctrip as well as with other strategic players in our sector meanwhile ctrip stock also flew higher in may after it revealed it had acquired a strategic stake in another smaller chinabased competitor elong nasdaq long of course the exact details regarding collaboration under this latest tieup remain unclear but it does ease investors concerns over intensifying competition and rising marketing costs required for any given business to grow and maintain market share in the burgeoning chinese travel industry as a result i cant blame the market for so aggressively bidding up shares of all three companies today steve symington has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool owns shares of and recommends baidu the motley fool recommends ctripcom international try any of our

answers contact us login search search why qunar cayman islands ltd stock dropped again today the chinese online travel specialist continued its plunge with the broader market but also now faces shareholder lawsuits heres what investors need to know steve symington tmfsymington jan   at pm what after falling more than  to start this week after the company revealed significant management changes shares of qunar cayman islands ltd nasdaqqunr dropped another  thursday as the broader chinese stock market continued its precipitous decline qunar is also now facing a number of shareholder lawsuits related to its management turnover and recent decline so what similar to qunars plunge on monday the shanghai stock exchange composite index fell another  today while the shenzhen composite index declined more than  once again the decline triggered socalled circuit breakers instituted by chinese authorities to suspend trading and limit losses chinas central bank responded thursday by announcing it would inject another  billion into the financial system meanwhile ustraded chinese stocks continued to plunge especially as the moves indicated concern over the continued slowing of growth for chinas economy qunar wasnt alone today shares of ctripcom nasdaqctrp declined more than  today and chinese web giant baidu nasdaqbidu dropped more than  for perspective in october ctrip completed a share swap with baidu in exchange for shares worth roughly  of qunars voting interest then announced a longterm collaboration with qunar to strengthen the online chinese travel industry in the wake of that collaboration qunar also surprised investors monday by announcing the appointment of a new ceo a new chief operating officer and a new chief financial officer the departing management seemed to be doing so on good terms  both its former ceo and cfo are sticking around as senior advisors for another quarter  and the moves followed previous significant changes to qunars structure and board of directors now what perhaps predictably however at least two law firms stepped out today announcing shareholder suits against qunar blaming the recent shareprice declines on the abrupt management turnover and commencing investigations as to whether the company violated federal securities laws in the process whether these suits ultimately turn out to have merit remains to be seen but ill reiterate that it appears chinas broadermarket declines are the singlelargest culprit here while im personally content watching qunars progress from the sidelines i think investors would still be wise to continue focusing on the fundamentals driving its business steve symington has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool owns shares of and recommends baidu the motley fool
