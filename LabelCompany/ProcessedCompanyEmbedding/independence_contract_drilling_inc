trends and aids analytical comparisons  however this information has limitations and should not be used as an alternative to operating income loss or cash flow performance measures determined in

standbywithoutcrew days respectively  for the six months ended june   and  there were  and  operating days in which the company earned revenue on a standby basis respectively including  and

   rig utilization is calculated as rig operating days divided by the total number of days our drilling rigs are available during the applicable period during the third quarter of  we elected to remove our two  series nonwalking rigs from the marketed fleet pending completion of their planned rig conversions to  series padoptimal status  the conversion of one of the  series rig was completed

june   excluding  million of new crew training costs included in ii above and v outofpocket expenses of  million net of insurance recoveries incurred as a result of damage to one of our rigs mast during the first quarter of  nongaap financial measures adjusted net loss ebitda and adjusted ebitda are supplemental nongaap financial measures that are used by management and external users of our financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies  in addition adjusted ebitda is consistent with how ebitda is calculated under our revolving credit facility for purposes of determining our compliance with various financial covenants  we define ebitda as earnings or loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda before stockbased compensation noncash asset impairments gains or losses on disposition of assets and other nonrecurring items added back to or subtracted from net income for purposes of calculating ebitda under our revolving credit facility  neither adjusted net loss ebitda or adjusted ebitda is a measure of net income as determined by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap management believes adjusted net loss ebitda and adjusted ebitda are useful because they allow our stockholders to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compliance with various financial covenants under our revolving credit facility and compare the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure or nonrecurring noncash transactions we exclude the items listed above from net income loss in calculating adjusted net loss ebitda and adjusted ebitda because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired none of adjusted net loss ebitda or adjusted ebitda should be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than net income loss the most closely comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity certain items excluded from adjusted net loss ebitda and adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing a companys financial performance such as a companys return of assets cost of capital and tax structure our presentation of adjusted net loss ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items  our computations of adjusted net loss ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled
