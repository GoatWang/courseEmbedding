william s harley drew up plans for a small engine with a displacement of  cubic inches  cc³ and fourinch  mm flywheels the engine was designed for use in a regular pedalbicycle frame over the next two years harley and his childhood friend arthur davidson worked on their motorbicycle using the northside milwaukee machine shop at the home of their friend henry melk it was finished in  with the help of arthurs brother walter davidson upon testing their powercycle harley and the davidson brothers found it unable to climb the hills around milwaukee without pedal assistance they quickly wrote off their first motorbicycle as a valuable learning experiment work immediately began on a new and improved secondgeneration machine this first real harleydavidson motorcycle had a bigger engine of  cubic inches  cc³ with  inches  cm flywheels weighing  lb  kg the machines advanced loopframe pattern was similar to the  milwaukee merkel motorcycle designed by joseph merkel later of flying merkel fame the bigger engine and loopframe design took it out of the motorized bicycle category and marked the path to future motorcycle designs the boys also received help with their bigger engine from outboard motor pioneer ole evinrude who was then building gas engines of his own design for automotive use on milwaukees lake street prototype the prototype of the new loopframe harleydavidson was assembled in a  ft ×  ft  m ×  m shed in the davidson family backyard most of the major parts however were made elsewhere including some probably fabricated at the west milwaukee railshops where oldest brother william a davidson was then toolroom foreman this prototype machine was functional by september   when it competed in a milwaukee motorcycle race held at state fair park it was ridden by edward hildebrand and placed fourth this is the first documented appearance of a harleydavidson motorcycle in the historical record in january  small advertisements were placed in the automobile and cycle trade journal offering bare harleydavidson engines to the doityourself trade by april complete motorcycles were in production on a very limited basis that year the first harleydavidson dealer carl h lang of chicago sold three bikes from the five built in the davidson backyard shed years later the original shed was taken to the juneau avenue factory where it would stand for many decades as a tribute to the motor companys humble origins until it was accidentally destroyed by contractors cleaning the factory yard in the early s in  harley and the davidson brothers built their first factory on chestnut street later juneau avenue at the current location of harleydavidsons corporate headquarters the first juneau avenue plant was a  ft ×  ft  m ×  m singlestory wooden structure the company produced about  motorcycles that year  model harleydavidson  cc ht  in  william s harley graduated from the university of wisconsin–madison with a degree in mechanical engineering that year additional factory expansion came with a second floor and later with facings and additions of milwaukee pale yellow cream brick with the new facilities production increased to  motorcycles in  the company was officially incorporated that september they also began selling their motorcycles to police departments around this time a market that has been important to them ever since in  william a davidson brother to arthur and walter davidson quit his job as tool foreman for the milwaukee road railroad and joined the motor company production in  and  were all singlecylinder models with  cubic inch  cm³ engines in february  a prototype model with a degree vtwin engine was displayed at the chicago automobile show although shown and advertised very few vtwin models were built between  and  these first vtwins displaced  cubic inches  cm³ and produced about  horsepower  kw this gave about double the power of the first singles top speed was about  mph  kmh production jumped from  motorcycles in  to  machines in  harleydavidson works in  by  some  makes of motorcycles had already been built in the united states – although just a handful would survive the s in  an improved vtwin model was introduced the new engine had mechanically operated intake valves as opposed to the automatic intake valves used on earlier vtwins that opened by engine vacuum with a displacement of  cubic inches  cm³ the  vtwin was smaller than earlier twins but gave better performance after  the majority of bikes produced by harleydavidson would be vtwin models in  harleydavidson introduced their patented fulfloteing seat which was suspended by a coil spring inside the seat tube the spring tension could be adjusted to suit the riders weight more than  inches  mm of travel was available harleydavidson would use seats of this type until  by  the yellow brick factory had been demolished and on the site a new story structure had been built begun in  the factory with its many additions would take up two blocks along juneau avenue and around the corner on th street despite the competition harleydavidson was already pulling ahead of indian and would dominate motorcycle racing after  production that year swelled to  machines ralph hepburn on his harley racing bike in this  photo world war i in  the united states entered world war i and the military demanded motorcycles for the war effort harleys had already been used by the military in the pancho villa expedition but world war i was the first time the motorcycle had been adopted for military issue first with the british model h produced by british triumph motorcycles ltd in  after the us entry into the war the us military purchased over  motorcycles from harleydavidson bicycles harleydavidson launched a line of bicycles in  in hopes of recruiting customers for its motorcycles besides the traditional diamond frame mens bicycle models included a stepthrough frame  ladies standard and a  boy scout for youth the effort was discontinued in  because of disappointing sales the bicycles were built for harleydavidson in dayton ohio by the davis machine company from  to  when davis stopped manufacturing bicycles s harleydavidson  cc ht  by  harleydavidson was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world with  machines produced and dealers in  countries in  a harleydavidson ridden by otto walker was the first motorcycle ever to win a race at an average speed greater than  mph  kmh during the s several improvements were put in place such as a new  cubic inch   cm³ vtwin introduced in  and the teardrop gas tank in  a front brake was added in  although notably only on the jjd models in the late summer of  harleydavidson introduced its  cubic inches  cm³ flathead vtwin to compete with the indian  scout and the excelsior super x this was the d model produced from  to  riders of indian motorcycles derisively referred to this model as the three cylinder harley because the generator was upright and parallel to the front cylinder the  in  mm bore and  in  mm stroke would continue in most versions of the  engine exceptions include the xa and the xrcitation needed great depression harleydavidson  cc sv  the great depression began a few months after the introduction of their  cubic inch  cm³ model harleydavidsons sales fell from  in  to  in  despite this harleydavidson unveiled a new lineup for  which included a flathead engine and art deco styling in order to survive the remainder of the depression the company manufactured industrial powerplants based on their motorcycle engines they also designed and built a threewheeled delivery vehicle called the servicar which remained in production until  harleydavidson ul in the mids alfred rich child opened a production line in japan with the cubicinch  cm³ vl the japanese licenseholder sankyo seiyaku corporation severed its business relations with harleydavidson in  and continued manufacturing the vl under the rikuo name harleydavidson dealer in texas ca  an cubicinch  cm³ flathead engine was added to the line in  by which time the singlecylinder motorcycles had been discontinued in  the e and el models with the knucklehead ohv engines was introduced valvetrain problems in early knucklehead engines required a redesign halfway through its first year of production and retrofitting of the new valvetrain on earlier engines by  all harleydavidsons flathead engines were equipped with drysump oil recirculation systems similar to the one introduced in the knucklehead ohv engine the revised cubicinch  cm³ v and vl models were renamed u and ul the cubicinch  cc³ vh and vlh to be renamed uh and ulh and the cubicinch  cc³ r to be renamed w in  the cubicinch  cm³ knucklehead was introduced as the f and the fl the cubicinch  cc³ flathead uh and ulh models were discontinued after  while the  inch  mm u  ul flathead models were produced up to  world war ii harley copied the bmw r to produce its xa model one of only two american cycle manufacturers to survive the great depression harleydavidson again produced large numbers of motorcycles for the us army in world war ii and resumed civilian production afterwards producing a range of large vtwin motorcycles that were successful both on racetracks and for private buyers harleydavidson on the eve of world war ii was already supplying the army with a militaryspecific version of its  cubic inches  cm³ wl line called the wla the a in this case stood for army upon the outbreak of war the company along with most other manufacturing enterprises shifted to war work more than  military motorcycles mostly wlas and wlcs the canadian version were produced many to be provided to allies harleydavidson received two armynavy ‘e’ awards one in  and the other in  which were awarded for excellence in production harley produced the wlc for the canadian military shipments to the soviet union under the lendlease program numbered at least  the wlas produced during all four years of war production generally have  serial numbers production of the wla stopped at the end of world war ii but was resumed from  to  for use in the korean war the us army also asked harleydavidson to produce a new motorcycle with many of the features of bmws sidevalve and shaftdriven r harley largely copied the bmw engine and drive train and produced the shaftdriven  cc  harleydavidson xa this shared no dimensions no parts and no design concepts except side valves with any prior harleydavidson engine due to the superior cooling of the flattwin engine with the cylinders across the frame harleys xa cylinder heads ran  °f  °c cooler than its vtwins the xa never entered full production the motorcycle by that time had been eclipsed by the jeep as the armys general purpose vehicle and the wla—already in production—was sufficient for its limited police escort and courier roles only  were made and the xa never went into full production it remains the only shaftdriven harleydavidson ever made small harleys hummers and aermacchis harleydavidson hummer see also harleydavidson hummer and harleydavidson topper as part of war reparations harleydavidson

discontinued after the pacer and scat models were discontinued at the end of  the bobcat became the last of harleydavidsons americanmade twostroke motorcycles the bobcat was manufactured only in the  model year harleydavidson replaced their americanmade lightweight twostroke motorcycles with the aermacchibuilt twostroke powered m ms and rapido the m had a semistepthrough frame and tank the ms was a m with a larger tank that eliminated the stepthrough feature the rapido was a larger bike with a  cc engine the aermacchibuilt harleydavidsons became entirely twostroke powered when the  cc

the number of dealerships throughout the country at the same time its current dealers typically had waiting lists that extended up to a year for some of the most popular models harleydavidson like the auto manufacturers records a sale not when a consumer buys their product but rather when it is delivered to a dealer therefore it is possible for the manufacturer to inflate sales numbers by requiring dealers to accept more inventory than desired in a practice called channel stuffing when demand softened following the unique  model year this news led to a dramatic decline in the stock price in

 cc vtwin main article harleydavidson engine timeline the classic harleydavidson engines are vtwin engines with a ° angle between the cylinders the crankshaft has a single pin and both pistons are connected to this pin through their connecting rods this ° angle is covered under several united states patents and is an engineering tradeoff that allows a large hightorque engine in a relatively small space it causes the cylinders to fire at uneven intervals and produces the choppy potatopotato sound so strongly linked to the harleydavidson brand to simplify the engine and reduce costs the vtwin ignition was designed to operate with a single set of points and no distributor this is known as a dual fire ignition system causing both spark plugs to fire regardless of which cylinder was on its compression stroke with the other spark plug firing on its cylinders exhaust stroke effectively wasting a spark the exhaust note is basically a throaty growling sound with some popping the ° design of the engine thus creates a plug firing sequencing as such the first cylinder fires the second rear cylinder fires ° later then there is a ° gap until the first cylinder fires again giving the engine its unique sound harleydavidson has used various ignition systems throughout its history – be it the early points and condenser system big twin up to  and sportsters up to  magneto ignition system used on some  to  sportsters early electronic with centrifugal mechanical advance weights all models  and a half to  or the late electronic with transistorized ignition control module more

soundcitation needed this research resulted in the bikes that were introduced in compliance with eu standards for  on february   the company filed a sound trademark application for the distinctive sound of the harleydavidson motorcycle engine the mark consists of the exhaust sound of applicants motorcycles produced by vtwin common crankpin motorcycle engines when the goods are in use nine of
