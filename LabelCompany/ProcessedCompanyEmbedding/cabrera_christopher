the main story share this page continue reading the main story photo credit earl wilsonthe new york times this interview with christopher cabrera founder and ceo of xactly which provides employeeincentive software was conducted and condensed by adam bryantq what were your early influencesa i was the fourth of five kids and i learned that you have to fight for everything including dinner once the food was on the table if you didn’t dive in you were going to go hungrymy mom was always a stayathome mom and was the ultimate optimist about what we could be and how smart we were and how goodlooking we were and how we were always the best hearing that drumbeat in your brain for years gives you a certain confidence as you go out into the worldmy dad was a serial entrepreneur and he always bootstrapped his companies the family finances and the business finances were kind of one every single summer as i was growing up i worked at his companies continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story some of the best lessons i’ve learned came from my father in terms of the way he treated his employees on the day before thanksgiving we’d load up his station wagon with frozen turkeys and we would deliver them to each one of his employeeshow else have your parents influenced your leadership stylewhat i love about the big family i grew up in was that we could argue and fight around the dinner table debating everything you could imagine from the constellations to national politics we’d have these lively debates and people would get emotional and then we’d all go back to being normal so i’m very comfortable with my executive team being super open and communicative and apolitical as much as possiblewhat did you do after collegei started a security guard company with my dad during my senior year it gave me instant managerial experience at a time i probably didn’t deserve it i was dealing with personnel issues and hiring people and firing people it was kind of a crazy fun experience but i cringe when i think back on some of the things i did in terms of poor leadershipafter a few years i wanted to do something different and i joined silicon graphics which was the hot company in silicon valley during the ’s i spent seven years there and that’s where i became a manageri had a seasoned boss who was a wonderful mentor and he really helped me with hiring and understanding how to create diverse teams the company was growing quickly and hiring was a big part of my job advertisement continue reading the main story i needed to hire eight people for my team i was about halfway through and i had one of my normal sitdowns with my boss who was africanamerican and he said “i want to go over your last four hires with you do you realize that they’re all basically white yearold men this isn’t a fraternity”i was so embarrassed because i certainly hadn’t done that on purpose the lesson was that we often just do what we’re comfortable with the thing i learned that day and every day since was the power of diversity and the power of bringing people together from different cultural backgrounds and experiential backgrounds

you think your team meetings will be when you have  guys that are  white with the same background do you think that that’s really going to be a challenging and rich environment where you’re learning”and i just remember thinking “yeah that’s crazy why would i want that” it really stuck with meother leadership lessonsearlier in my career if somebody would come in all worked up about something with a colleague i had a tendency to want to jump in and get involved i realized that i was becoming part of the problem and almost giving credibility to the drama in most cases it was usually petty stuff and the energy we spent on it didn’t help move the ball forward in the businessi learned to stay above the drama and to address the real issue behind the problem i also think that when people realize you’re not going to go there it tends to happen lesswhat elsewe talk a lot about reinventing ourselves i’m constantly in front of the company explaining to them “the skills that i had to take this company from zero to  million are very different than the skills that are going to take this company from  million to  million every six months i’ve had to reinvent myself and so what are you doing to reinvent yourself and we’ll give you the tools you need to help you do that”we have to just keep reinventing as time goes on and part of that reinventing is constantly challenging each other about what could we do better and what could we do differentlywhat do you look for in job candidatesi’m trying to understand if you would be additive to our culture or just take away from the culture we’ve had people who come in and say “hey this is great i love this place” but then they don’t take part in a lot of the things they don’t help foster the culture and that’s the quickest way to kill it advertisement continue reading the main story what questions do you aski’ll ask for some examples of where you’ve failed i want to get a sense of whether you are a risk taker you interview people sometimes and they’ll wear it like a badge of honor — “i haven’t failed at anything” you just know right away that’s not going to worki also ask what their boss would say about them i ask them what they think they’re great at i ask them what they’re most proud of in their career so farand i ask them what irritates them i’m pretty evenkeeled and it takes a lot to get me riled up that gets back to the ability to play above the drama when you get petty responses it gives you a sense of that person’s annoyance threshold i want that threshold to be pretty high continue reading

power this post has two parts a setup then a story the setup will discuss miguel cabrera and his natural hitting ability the story is about chris colabello read the whole thing as the two parts blend together this will likely be the most important post i’ll ever make at tewkshittingcom please note there is a lot of video on this page viewing on cell phones without g will need some time before all video is loaded part  miguel cabrera is a “natural hitter” just like everybody else during sunday night’s tigersrangers game one of the announcers mentioned that jim leyland said miguel cabrera has the best opposite field power of any hitter he’s ever seen big words from a guy with a rich baseball history remember that guy named bonds that leyland coached here’s a look at the first of three homers cabrera hit that night i was fairly busy on twitter that night shamelessly plugging my may  post on cabrera – miguel cabrera is the best hitter in baseball – when a question popped into my head here was my tweet the big question… why do coaches keep pushing info that prevents what cabrera does — bobby tewksbary tewkshitting may   miguel cabrera is a special hitter but why is he so special is he the best athlete in the big leagues no does he have the best bat speed no is he the best hitter yes the perception is that cabrera is just a natural hitter and he is… just like everybody else everybody has a natural swing everybody is a natural hitter it’s just that cabrera’s “natural” happens to make him the best hitter on the planet the missing piece is that when stating that cabrera is a “natural hitter” people ignore the concept that how he swings – the pattern he uses the characteristics he creates – is an incredibly significant factor in his ability to perform they don’t differentiate between the way he swings compared to other hitters they don’t look at his swing objectively compared to other hitters who are just as good athletically are just as strong and have just as good handeye coordination if he swung differently he would perform differently built into his “natural” ability is a swing pattern that creates a mechanical advantage and this is where my issue with “traditional” swing mechanics begins instead of trying to achieve his swing pattern the vast majority of coaches opt to teach what is traditional the write off what cabrera does as impossible to teach just because cabrera happens to do it naturally here is a tweet that i got in response to the above question this was from a scout but it doesn’t matter who it came from because this is the most typical response i get tewkshitting it’s a safer bet to coach what is more traditional imo in my eyes “safe” means teaching something far inferior it means decreasing a hitter’s opportunity to be successful hitters need to learn some way to hit they need to learn and ingrain some set of mechanics after thousands of swings it will become “natural” to them it will become their normal so choosing the safe option will create a “natural” swing for those hitters too… it will just be a swing that is different than what cabrera does now let’s move on to part  part two – chris colabello’s changed his “normal” swing and you can too in light of leyland’s comment on cabrera and opposite field power i texted chris to ask him how many center or opposite field home runs he had hit in his life before the  season we started working together after his  season his answer up to that point in his career chris had been a successful player in the can am league for six years and make no mistake about it – he was a good hitter he hit over  each year had seasons of      and  homers i can’t track down the official game recaps but it is safe to say that chris has over  center field or opposite field home runs since the  season began here is a spray chart of his home runs i made up for the  season alone so a guy who had  home runs to center or the opposite field in his life before the  season now has  in just  games in   wbc  aaa regular season update chris hit another homer last night – a grand slam to right field so add another dot to right on that spray chart here’s what the rochester red wing broadcaster tweeted out last night colabello’s gs went to rf each of last  hrs have gone to cf rcf or rf hasn’t pulled one of them teams keep pitching him away — josh whetzel joshwhetzel may   now we need to take a look at his swing to understand what is allowing this change in performance to happen let’s start with the first video i have of chris chris colabello “before” –  –  january  – side  behind views same swing nice hair cc february  – behind view and here is some game video of chris from that time as well game swing –  – front and side views game swing –  – front view  season we first started talking about swing mechanics after the  season in  he had a very strong season  with  doubles  hr  rbi  ops in  games and was named the  baseball america independent player of the year this was the only video i was able to get that  season  – homer to center single to left  offseason after the  season we got back to work and starting building on his success chris starting his own hitting lessons back up and teaching the swing made him learn it more when he would come up to my facility he would report that his patterns were getting better let’s look at some clips of his swing that offseason before the  season he would go on to sign with the twins before the  season  offseason swing – front overhead  behind views  season chris had a successful  season after some early struggles adjusting to affiliated ball he really found his stride in june he went on to finish nd in mvp voting for the eastern league while finishing near or at the top of many offensive categories here are a couple clips from the  season  – double to right center – front view  – double to left center – over the shoulder view  – homer to left – front  side view after the  season he played winter ball in mexico he picked up right where he had left off the aa season in mexico he went  with  doubles  homers  rbi and an ops of  in  games he had a stretch where he hit  home runs in  games when he got back in december he came to hit with me and something was different watching him swing then actually shifted the way i view swing mechanics his “normal” swing had changed he was no longer working to try to achieve the mechanics we discussed he was simply doing them here is a swing i got video of while throwing him some bp when he had returned from mexico december  – after mexico – behind view his normal – now natural – swing created the routine result of a line drive through the middle of the field his normal swing created that direction through the middle it created that swing plane it created that timing these weren’t things he was trying to do this was simply what happened as a result of his normal swing compare that to hitters who must force the ball up the middle who must work hard to create a line drive who must work hard to let the ball get deep when you swing with the pattern that hitters like miguel cabrera use these things are normal… natural  season the  year is young but it has already been exciting first chris was invited to major league spring training with the twins then he was invited to play in the world baseball classic for team italy like his first year with the twins i helped him drive down to ft myers for spring training i took this video of him during his first bp session compared to braun because it is the only version i can find right now after being at st i was able to attend the wbc in phoenix and chris had a nice showing he had a huge game against canada going  with a home run it was pretty exciting to see chris have that game on that stage and i know it was special for him because he had a solid group of friends and former teammates there to share it with here’s a clip of that homer from the front and over the shoulder views team italy advanced to round  of the wbc in miami and chris again put his name on the map with a run homer agains the dominican republic check out that clip from the front side and over the shoulder his  regular season has gotten off to a very positive start he was just awarded his nd player of the week award for the aaa international league he is currently as of may  hitting  with a league leading  doubles league leading tied  homers he is rd in rbi with  leads the league in total bases and is second in ops at  this in the highest level of baseball he has ever played here is are two recents swings he took on home runs how are cabrera  colabello able to hit with power to the opposite field now with all this story on colabello’s swing changes and development laid out let’s look at why he is able to do things now that he wasn’t able to do before first let’s look at cabrera’s barrel movement when the pitch is approaching him i know the clip is dark but you can still see the barrel i also wanted to share this clip and a quote from the previous cabrera post i made this is one of my favorite clips i’ve ever made to show the angles and the process of creating swing characteristics you can’t see the front foot but it is working toward the ground watch how the shoulders stay closed for so long as the barrel movement happens the pitch is roughly  frames of video out of the hand when this clip starts from release point to contact took  frames so consider that these frames are starting when the ball is halfway to the plate this is what creating depth direction and plane looks like his is swinging and loading by creating these characteristics this is where cabrera’s ability to hit the ball with power to the opposite field happens he has bat speed before his bat turns to the ball he has bat speed into his deep swing he is letting the ball get deep but the barrel movement that occurs during that “let the ball get deep” part is what makes him special colabello’s swing change creates ability of oppo power now let’s look at colabello barrel movement as the ball approaches for chris’ swing we are going to look at the front side and behindover the shoulder angle to see the difference in his swing this is a huge incredibly important set of clips and before moving forward i’m not trying to say colabello is as good as cabrera i’m trying to show how the swing characteristics they both create allow them to establish a mechanical advantage and an ability to hit for power to the opposite field before current the barrel movement here is obvious as the ball is approaching chris now creates bat speed before he just held the same angle with the bat by just holding the bat he had to create all his bat speed from that spot it makes sense that he had power to the pull side because the barrel had time to get some speed and get through the ball on pitches away he had to force the barrel to the ball working hard to stay on top and stay inside he had to muscle the ball that way no oppo power before current i think this side angle is tremendous to really see the angle being created i often talk about how a hitter may have a decent angle but not a good pattern in the before you can see the decent angle being maintained but in the current he was accelerating the bat into that angle think about it… stationary barrel in loaded position has no oppo power active barrel with loading movement creates ability to hit the ball with power to opposite field also this is where depth is created this is where direction is created maybe these clip helps you understand the difference in patterns before current more of the same in the before clip you can see that barrel angle being held he doesn’t “turn the bat over” to get to the ball he kind of sets the angle then goes to the ball now the barrel is actively arcing back actively moving into a deeper position before turning to the ball and despite john smoltz saying marlins park offers “relief” to righty hitters in right center the gap there is like  this ball had room to spare this was certainly not a cheap homer closing thoughts on colabello keep in mind that this is something chris has been doing consistently now before no oppo power… now lots of oppo power and another thing – since his slow start to  chris has been getting progressively better from aa to mexico to aaa the more he owns this swing the more he engrains his process the better he gets scary to think that a  year old nonprospect who is hitting  while top  in doubles homers rbi total bases and ops in aaa could be getting better… just don’t say he came out of nowhere he has made the most of his opportunity by improving as a hitter making adjustments and working his process every day final thoughts if you want to know what tewkshittingcom and my facility ab athletic development are all about this post covers it there is tremendous opportunity across all levels of baseball for hitters to improve chris went from a strong independent league hitter to the door step of the big leagues he has put the work in he chose to see if there was more after the  season the results speak for themselves lots of more work to do

after mexico seems bigger and more pronounced than in any of the clips after was there a conscious effort to shorten his leg kick in the work done after mexico or just happened to be bigger on that particular swing reply bobby tewksbary says  at  am i think it was just a relaxed exaggeration thing as i understand it the coaching there was more relaxed than typical coaching so he was able to go bigger and feel things more what you see is just an extension of that reply ryan vanoeveren says  at  am awesome post i really enjoyed this information bobby as a baseball trainer you can never know it all and all players should be trained and tweaked a little differently than the next the commentary about “traditional mechanics” was even better watching the clips of chris addressing his technique over the  year span is why i am a member here and love the fact you are not afraid to share your expertise thank s again reply john  de la rosa says  at  pm that was awesome i’m so excited for my  year old  he is getting very comfortable with the process and can definitely see the progress on the field going to be really exciting his freshman year of high school basball reply alex trezza says  at  am baseball world pay attention……………this may be the most important article you ever readgreat swings do not happen accidentily they happen because of the process this includes the process of the swing itself the process of understanding that there needs to be a change and the process of spending countless hours working to make it your natural swing alex trezza reply tim milligan says  at  am nicely done sir thank you reply larry mckenzie says  at  pm the difference between setting the barrel angle then turning into the ball vs arcing the barrel to create that angle is a huge advantage for a hitter creating depth and direction in the swing is soooo important very nice post tewks how bout some jurickson profar analysis been watching him a lot lately and would love to hear your thoughts on him  prospect and a lot of fun to watch rake check his checks… good stuff keep up the good work man as there are a lot of people benefiting from you work reply avery kuryak
