directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

about apple inc this apple supplier offered some interesting insights into the impact that the rampup of the next iphone will have on its business ashraf eassa tmfchipfool jul   at am although skyworks solutions nasdaqswks has done a good job broadening its customer base beyond apple nasdaqaapl the fact is that apple continues to be the wireless chip suppliers largest customer that means sales of apple products and skyworks share within apples key products both affect skyworks financial performance those who follow the company then should keep close tabs on what skyworks says about its relationship with apple image source skyworks here are three items pertaining to that relationship from the companys most recent earnings call  the iphone rampup when analyst blayne curtis asked skyworks ceo liam k griffin about a possible delay in the rampup in chip shipments to apple in support of the next iphone because of the rumored delays in the new iphone models griffin seemingly ducked the question he did though offer some insight into the rampup we are seeing a predictable cycle with our largest customer and the areas that we can control are around content reach and our ability to drive technology griffin said image source apple content reach is a fancy way of referring to how much revenue per iphone skyworks can grab and ability to drive technology seems to be griffins way of indicating that the better skyworks technology is the more potential share per iphone it can grab we feel really good about that equation griffin added as far as the rampup itself griffin didnt offer specifics on timing but he did say the management team feels comfortable with companys backlog visibility and forwardlooking momentum with respect to apple what griffin appears to be saying here is that irrespective of the timing of the product rampup  which griffin might not want to give away to protect apples confidential information  skyworks has good visibility into the shape of the rampup once it begins we feel good about the product cycle griffin elaborated and we have a very broad mix across legacy new models and also a portfolio of nonmobile products within that account in other words skyworks looks set to benefit nicely from the next iphone does skyworks care about the modem vendor its well known that apple began dualsourcing its cellular modems from both intel nasdaqintc and qualcomm nasdaqqcom beginning with the iphone series and probably continuing for the foreseeable future however as barrons reports analyst timothy arcuri said in a recent investor note that skyworks had more content share in the qualcommbased phones while rival qorvo nasdaqqrvo had more content in the intelbased iphone models analyst edward snyder on skyworks most recent earnings call asked management about skyworks positioning in the various iphone models this year we expect to have a solid position with all of the basebands that our largest customers use we feel very good about that griffin began we refresh our product line in ways that make sense we have a technology reach thats expanded griffin then went on to explain that skyworks has demonstrated its ability to work with multiple baseband providers nothings different with our largest customer we will demonstrate the same level of performance he said how about content share gains as smartphones have gained increasingly robust cellular subsystems many wirelesschip vendors have enjoyed generationovergeneration dollar content increases sometimes substantially so on the call analyst chris caso asked management about the trend in dollar content per phone for the coming iphone models as well as some information about the impact of apples product mix on skyworks business to that griffin explained that the company cant get into too much detail here with its largest customer but he added that the company is confident in what it has modeled financially we understand what weve won with respect to content and we completely understand where the mix is and having all that flush through with our guidance griffin explained ashraf eassa owns shares of intel and qualcomm the motley fool

more design wins for its wireless chips diversifying its business and improving its profitability ashraf eassa tmfchipfool jul   at pm wireless chipmaker skyworks solutions nasdaqswks reported its financial results and hosted a conference call going over those results on july  we delivered revenue of  million up  year over year with gross margin of  and operating margin of  skyworks ceo liam griffin said in a prepared statement image source skyworks griffin then went on to say that the company achieved earnings per share of  up  year over year and  better than consensus estimates in this column id like to go over three things from the companys most recent earnings call that management seems to want current and potential investors to know about the state of its business more design wins more money griffin stated on the call that skyworks is aggressively expanding its design win pipeline in mobile we are broadening our reach across all premier oems griffin said specifically we supported huaweis featurerich smartphones with skyone and skylite products the executive then went on to say that the company also extended drx solutions for samsungs nasdaqothssnlf galaxy platform that wasnt all either we leveraged skyone and skylite at oppo vivo zte and sharp to name just a few griffin continued and we extended our antenna tuning wins across virtually all of the leading chinese oems an expanding customer base could help skyworks accelerate its revenue growth while simultaneously diluting its dependence on its largest customer  apple nasdaqaapl the mobilenonmobile split skyworks has traditionally generated most of its revenue from sales of chips to mobile device makers and thats not expected to change for a while yet however diversification  both in terms of customers as well as in terms of the end markets that a company serves  is a good thing as it reduces a companys dependence on a single industry while simultaneously enabling more rapid total revenue growth on the call skyworks cfo kris sennesael said that during the companys most recent quarter the revenue split between mobilederived revenue and its broad markets revenue ie nonmobile was roughly  to  griffin added some additional information saying that the company expects its broad markets revenue to cross  million in the current quarter representing a  billion annual run rate broad markets has been performing very well and we put a lot of investment around that in our portfolio around wifi around zigbee and even lte in some cases is really helping propel that momentum griffin explained progress toward gross margin target analyst toshiya hari observed on the call that skyworks gross profit margin percentage has been relatively stable over the past say four to six quarters despite revenue being weaker a year ago and now much stronger today so basically we havent seen much leverage to the upside nor the downside the analyst continued hari then asked can you remind us what the longterm goal is for skyworks in terms of gross margins sennesael said that the companys target is to get to  and that the company is making good progress toward that target the executive then pointed out that in the third quarter skyworks enjoyed a  basis point gross profit margin expansion and that the company is guiding to another  basis point gross profit margin expansion and of course in the december quarter we expect on higher revenue further improvements on the gross margin as well gross margin expansion is important because the higher a companys gross profit margin percentage the more of each dollar in revenue gets converted into gross profit and all else being equal this means more of each dollar in revenue is ultimately converted into net income  creating more value for a
