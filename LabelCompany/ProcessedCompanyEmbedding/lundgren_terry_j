critical eye children’s wear designer joan calabrese dies at  think tank is ai the future of ecommerce fraud prevention two weeks ago macy’s in the south coast plaza in costa mesa calif had a surprise visitor the company’s top executive “i don’t tell anyone i’m coming i call the store manager five minutes before i get there” terry j lundgren macy’s inc chairman and chief executive officer told wwd this story first appeared in the december   issue of wwd  subscribe today it could have been a kind of homecoming considering that as a young executive lundgren managed the store from  to  when it was a bullock’s unit he gets credit for bringing sizzle back to macy’s selling floors and restoring confidence in the sector and he likes the attention and prestige that comes with running america’s largest department store but lundgren’s objective at south coast plaza is to experience the store like any ordinary customer would without it being gussied up for his arrival and to focus on fundamentals “it’s the statement the store is making — what stands out productwise brandwise are the associates interacting with customers cleanliness what’s south coast plaza got that’s unique” he said he saw what he wanted to see beefedup accessories and dress areas and a new squarefoot skateandsurf format that flows organically into activewear they are byproducts of lundgren’s “my macy’s” localization program which tailors the merchandising to meet local needs a tactic he has long touted as critical to finessing the assortments and generating compstore sales gains still changes like the skateandsurf shop don’t come together overnight “it took a year to get it but we made it impactful it’s also in our other southern california stores  of them and in the hawaii stores with brands like quiksilver roxy and a lot of niche brands” lundgren said “it’s easily transferable to many of our stores we could do skateandsurf in a lot of places in the summer and yearround in warmweather cities” the surfandskate shops are further evidence of the continual flow of change at the  billion store macy’s chain that belies the popular perception of department stores as tired and slow to adapt even marked for extinction lundgren’s not buying that argument “we can never sit still” he said “we are always a little on edge we are always slightly unsatisfied if we have made progress it’s about how do we take it to the next level” throughout  macy’s has outpaced the competition for steering the retail behemoth through a progressive year despite the odds lundgren is wwd’s newsmaker of the year his accomplishments include fulfilling omnichannel initiatives locking in a site for macy’s first overseas store elevating a new generation of leaders and effectively managing inventories and expenses amid a tough selling environment all while raising the curtain on the dramatically renovated women’s and men’s departments at herald squaresee the top  stories from the year in fashion here  “it’s been an unusual year in terms of the changes we made to build the business to last” lundgren noted “there were so many things that fell in place or that we got in motion…‘buy online pick up in store’ is one of the best and most creative innovations we’ve ever had we began it two years ago in the washington market” now it has been rolled out to all macy’s and bloomingdale’s stores “if you are operating a specialty store it’s easy it’s not so easy in a squarefoot threelevel macy’s you have to be organized” with the stores linking up to dotcom products having to be plucked from the shelves or delivered from the distribution center associates having to adjust what they do and the stores needing to create pickup areas when customers come to the store to pick up their orders chances are they’ll buy more —  percent more than the online transaction macy’s calculates “it’s called ‘radiated’ sales that’s important” lundgren said it’s also a sign that impulse shopping despite reports to the contrary is “alive and well” he said also on the omni front macy’s rolled out beacon technology apple pay and rfid and began testing new handheld pointofsale devices and tablets for product information and faster transactions in a few markets macy’s is testing sameday deliveries and imagesearch technology which enables shoppers to photograph an item they see anywhere and then view similar items on macyscom abroad plans were revealed to open macy’s first and bloomingdale’s second international store both of which will be in abu dhabi and reports emerged that macy’s has its eye on china possibly for a store lundgren has been there several times and not too long ago brought some of his lieutenants along suggesting something was up “i have nothing to say on china” was his answer — at this point on the home front a big chunk of the fouryear  million renovation of the herald square flagship was finished with the unveiling of the women’s casual and bridge departments on the fourth floor women’s activewear on eight and men’s clothing on five as well as the lowerlevel men’s furnishings and accessories department the main floor and shoes were previously renovated leased luxury accessory shops a new restaurant a separate salad restaurant a juice press and café were added though some might disagree lundgren said the character of the flagship hasn’t been lost in the modernization process “no i think it gained” he said some would like to see those old wooden escalators removed but lundgren regards them as a charming vestige saying “as long as i am here we will never take them out our engineers wanted to because you can’t get replacement parts i let them take out one for the parts” macy’s in downtown brooklyn the former abraham  straus flagship could see a major overhaul as well executives have been narrowing down the options which include a saleleaseback and redevelopment of the site “we are taking brooklyn very seriously this is a fantastic market it’s a yearold property” lundgren said “it’s not going to be the same kind of scale asherald square but we don’t just want a paint and carpet job we want to do something special there is a lot of interest” there’s also talk about macy’s doing a deal with google or apple on a wearabletech initiative “i can’t talk about that there could be” lundgren said asked if he’s a believer in wearable tech the ceo said “it’s always going to be about what the customer finds to be important it always starts at putting the customer at the center of the decision” in other maneuvers this year ■ a smaller bloomingdale’s prototype a potential growth vehicle nationally opened in stanford calif ■ the world’s largest nfl shop a squarefoot popup opened on the fourth floor of the herald square flagship to coincide with the superbowl in new jersey last february ■ sustainability efforts gained steam with more electricvehicle charging stations and solar roofs installed and greater wastereduction efforts ■ development of a thalía sodi private brand shifted into high gear for next spring’s launch “it will be one of the most expansive launches in the history of macy’s merchandising group” lundgren said ■ macy’s millennial business which seemed to be stalled for years turned a corner “because of the product” lundgren said “it started growing particularly in the athletic business athletic footwear lids and maison jules” succession planning moved to the forefront jeffrey gennette stepped up to corporate president while continuing as chief merchandising officer and tony spring took the helm of bloomingdale’s as chairman and ceo succeeding michael gould “i’ve worked personally very hard on the subject of attracting and retaining the best talent” lundgren said “we are recruiting  college students a year and getting incredibly talented young people i can tell you i don’t think there is any retailer in america hiring  college students a year you hear about the old as training program the old bloomingdale’s training program i can guarantee you that the old days were not nearly as good as what we’ve got now” asked if he has identified backups for top executives such as karen hoguet the chief financial officer martine reardon chief marketing officer kent anderson president of macyscom and peter sachse chief stores officer lundgren replied “i can assure you i have every single position backed up with very talented people in their s s and s they’re in the pipeline” lundgren has been macy’s ceo since february  and chairman and ceo since january  earlier he was president a title he also assumed in february  he began his career in  as a trainee with bullock’s a division of federated which eventually was taken over by macy’s over the next decade he held positions of increasing responsibility in buying store management human resources and seniorlevel store management and merchandising slots he joined neiman marcus as executive vice president but soon became chairman and ceo then in april  returned to federated as chairman and ceo of its merchandising group before rising to president and ultimately ceo the yearold lundgren doesn’t appear ready to retire from macy’s and there’s no pressure as long as the numbers continue to hold up in the third quarter macy’s lifted its net earnings by  percent to  million despite a  percent drop in comparable sales including departments licensed to third parties macy’s stock has held firm recently hovering around  on the high side of the week range from  to  lundgren seems to relish his role and the benefits that come with it while restoring the store’s luster he makes no apology for macy’s promotional posture one of the industry’s most rigid “macy’s is a promotional department store that’s who we are and will always be the level of promoting this year is not dramatically different from last year or the year before and won’t be next year we are clearly doing what the customer wants” he said at  feet  inches and  pounds he keeps fit and seems slimmer in his armani suits he works out three to five days a week with a trainer in a gym doing weights aerobics and yoga then there’s that disciplined diet he noted “i’m vegan until  pm on the weekdays” with lots of protein shakes and cereal with almond milk on the menu “it works for me i’ve been the same weight for the past  years” he claimed lundgren also clearly burns energy on the job “staying up  hours straight on black friday was tough” he admits “the plus side is that i have been doing this for a while i feel i can handle any physical stress i think my instincts help me to do the job faster and effectively” he’s got those piles of paper on his desk under control “if it’s on my desk i know exactly where it is if i file it away it’s unlikely i will ever look at it again i know what’s in each pile” he said the ceo is on the road every week and he noted that the recent visit to southern california was not just for the stores there was also a dinner to honor macy’s “fivestar” suppliers to its private brands and he mentioned the chargerspatriots football game what helps him to sustain his drive are those “sight lines to the future” knowing he’ll be going to the sunday game or getting in some vacation “it’s always been a hard job the wear and tear on the mind and the body is hard” lundgren said “you have to have a certain resilience there are always obstacles complications you have to have enough resilience to get through the tough days and stay focused on the vision every day something else pops up” like on black friday when a crowd stormed the herald square flagship to protest decisions not to indict two police officers involved in the controversial deaths in ferguson miss and staten island ny “whenever there is an incident of any significance i am notified immediately it’s primarily an fyi” in the case of the recent protest “herald square security sent me a quick video” he said pretty soon afterward it was business as usual so lundgren saw no need to get involved in the highly charged situation “they weren’t protesting macy’s” he said observing that the protestors were using one of the world’s most famous retail settings as just a stage to broadcast their message regarding another unexpected situation lundgren saw last month’s worker dispute at west coast ports as a possible threat to holiday deliveries so he became “personally involved” communicating with president obama’s office to help resolve the situation on the product front one persistent challenge is women’s apparel which accounts for  percent of macy’s business and that hasn’t made his job any easier “there are pockets of apparel that are good — athletic parts of the millennial business the dress business” lundgren said “women’s sportswear is hit or miss by each brand there hasn’t been an overall growth trend for apparel in a few years i believe it will come back it will indeed turn at some point it’s cyclical at some point there will be pentup demand the business is just being eaten up there are so many options” and too much sameness as lundgren implied “unique exclusive or very limited merchandise — the key is to make that a larger and larger percent of the assortment” he said lundgren is expecting q to show more life than q with the weather outlook better than last year’s brutal cold spell a more efficient flow of merchandise receipts the benefits of “buy online pick up in stores” and macy’s spending more on digital marketing and events he’s sticking to his script which is one of optimism for the future and has refuted reports that black friday weekend was bad for the retail industry most irksome was the  percent drop reported by the national retail federation’s consumer survey it didn’t sit right with lundgren “black friday is still the biggest day of the year for us” he said so he called nrf president and ceo matt shay to disagree “i had a conversation with matt after all the reports came out he wasn’t the least bit defensive” lundgren noted “i just said it can’t be right” youre missing something subscribe now share this article reddit linkedin whatsapp email print talk

president and ceo federated department stores nationality american born  education university of arizona ba  family married nancy lundgren divorced children two career federated department stores bullocks division – bullocks wilshire  president neiman marcus – chairman and ceo federated merchandising group – head – chief merchandising officer – president  coo – ceo – chairman address federated department stores  west th street new york new york  httpwwwfederatedfdscom ■ in early  lundgren became the first executive in the year history of federated department stores to simultaneously hold the titles of chairman president and ceo previously all three positions were held by separate people lundgren earned a reputation as a visionary he was one of the first executives in the business to call attention to the department store industrys dated image citing change as a paramount strategy necessary for survival in each of his positions he made an immediate impact surprising industry insiders by early  he oversaw a  billion company that operated  stores in  states guam and puerto rico the fasttrack executive with his model good looks was in over his head learning the value of hard work tough breaks forced maturity upon lundgren during his formative years he was the only child out of six to attend college mostly because his parents did not have the money he joined a fraternity at university of arizona and became president of his pledge class but his grades were not good and one day his father called with news that he would no longer pay terry j lundgren apwide world photos  for tuition the new york times reported that his father said your life is in your hands its entirely up to you and youll figure it out december   after some initial sulking lundgren found employment cracking oysters and peeling shrimp at a local tucson restaurant he was eventually promoted to waiter then headwaiter and then head manager of the restaurant he was proud of having paid his way through college and graduating without any debt thats when i figured out what my parents were telling me and appreciated the life lesson on the fast track most of lundgrens career was tied to federated department stores he first joined the bullocks division in los angeles in  rising to become president of the bullocks wilshire specialty operations in  when macys purchased the bullocks division from federated in  lundgren jumped to neiman marcus the ceo of neiman left for federated a few years later and lundgren was thrust into the ceo position at age  it was an inopportune time to take over as lundgren was charged with the task of leading the highend chain through a recession defying the critics industry insiders wondered whether the young executive had the industry knowhow and experience to succeed stanley marcus the merchant whose grandfather was one of the founders of neiman marcus bet lundgren  that he would miss sales targets marcus lost the bet in fact neiman emerged from the recession stronger than many of its industry peers the new york times reported that stanley marcus said i had the feeling that he needed a few more years of seasoning because his only experience was at bullocks i was wrong he waded right in and didnt miss a beat november   reinventing the department store when lundgren left for federated merchandising in  he once again shocked the industry by making an immediate mark on the business shaking up the companys purchasing strategy he shifted from centralbuying teams which controlled most of the companys decisions about what was sold in stores to a more autonomous approach in which regional teams could decide what was best for their customers the goal was to improve merchandising that often seemed sorely out of sync with its customers lundgren observed for example that a china pattern that appealed to those in the midwest would flop with those on the east coast lundgrens primary objective was to reinvent the department store a business model that many saw as a dying breed key to this strategy was giving customers a product selection that they would not find anywhere else in late  only  percent of federateds inventory was proprietary including private brands joint ventures and exclusives from vendors lundgren hoped to increase the percentage of merchandise unique to federated stores to about  percent he introduced h an upscale line of mens and womens sportswear from tommy hilfiger which was sold only in federated stores he wanted to make shopping easier so he borrowed the idea of shopping carts the retail analyst jeffrey stein said in the daily news that the idea may work it may not you dont know unless you try lundgren is trying to be proactive in turning around deficiencies hes more proactive than his competitors july   as federated goes so goes the industry a lot rested on lundgrens mission to rescue the department store in  big chains like federated accounted for just  percent of the nations retail sales down from about  percent in  on wall street the departmentstore sector hovered at the bottom of the retail pecking order with companies such as federated saks and may department stores posting disappointing sales month after month lundgren understood the challenge and did not back down he said in a wall street journal report that the problem isnt that no one is in our stores we have plenty of traffic the key is having the right product at the right price point in an environment thats different and easy july   while the outcome of federateds future rested clearly in lundgrens hands rivals and skeptics understated him at their peril see also entry on federated department stores inc in international directory of company histories  sources for further information

gennette right will succeed terry lundgren second from left as chief executive of macy’s they are shown with the designer kenneth cole and jill granoff former chief of kenneth cole productions in  credit jamie mccarthywireimage for details macy’s longtime chief executive terry j lundgren will step down next year the company announced on thursday as the retailer grapples with sagging sales and broader changes in the ways people shopjeff gennette  who is the company’s president will take the top spot while mr lundgren will stay as executive chairman“i have been honored to lead this enterprise through a period of unprecedented reinvention” mr lundgren said in a statement “while our company is larger stronger and more resourceful than we were  years ago now is the time to reset our business model to thrive in a future that is being driven by rapid evolution in consumer preferences and shopping habits”the company said the leadership transition was part of its board’s succession plan but the moves come in the face of widespread turmoil at the nation’s department stores including macy’s which have struggled to recover from the recession as quickly as the rest of the retail industry shoppers are spending more but they are also hunting for bargains online and at socalled offprice stores known foremost for their discounts advertisement continue reading the main story amazon the online shopping giant as well as discount chains like t j maxx and marshalls have added to the pressure macy’s and other department stores have offered aggressive promotions to entice shoppers a move that some retail experts say has led to a race to the bottom continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story “we’re a promotional department store and we will continue to be a promotional department store” mr gennette said in an interview “we offer values every day to our customer”macy’s j c penney nordstrom and kohl’s all reported surprisingly lackluster sales last quarter that sent their stocks tumbling macy’s was particularly hardhit reporting that sales at comparable stores a measure often used by the industry fell  percent over the previous year the weakest showing since the recessionthe new chief has a “very daunting task” ahead of him said craig johnson president of customer growth partners a retail consulting and research firm“macy’s is facing some very difficult challenges” mr johnson said “i think it’s the right move at the right time”still the selection of mr gennette does not seem to suggest a swift resetting of strategy he said he expected to continue several of the initiatives begun under his predecessor to better compete with discount stores macy’s is opening outlet stores under the macy’s backstage name and plans to have  of those stores open by the end of the fourth quartermr gennette said he also wanted to continue building collaborations with other brands in some stores macy’s leases space to men’s wearhouse to run a tuxedo rental business it also has similar arrangements with finish line the athletic shoe brand and sunglass hut these brands lease the space and operate separate shops

macy’s “i do” strategy upgrading fine jewelry departments within the department stores“we believe we can be the wedding destination” he said “it starts with the ring and goes all the way to your first house and kid we believe we can be a onestop shop for that” advertisement continue reading the main story what’s not clear is how mr gennette will differ from his predecessor said neil saunders a retail analyst for conluminomr gennette began his career at macy’s in  starting as an executive trainee and working his way into management roles in the men’s and children’s divisions before his promotion to macy’s president in  he worked as the company’s chief merchandising officer since “he’s very much a macy’s insider” mr saunders said “he knows the business inside and out and he’s worked very closely with lundgren for many years in a way they’re just swapping seats”aside from its retail business macy’s is also exploring ways to raise money from its many real estate holdings last year the company sold part of its building in downtown brooklyn to tishman speyer a developer the retailer will continue to occupy the first four floors of the ninestory building while the upper floors will be reconfigured into office space for other tenantsmr gennette said macy’s was also pursuing other sales or joint ventures at its flagship stores in new york chicago and minneapolis as well as some of its mall propertiesmr lundgren  who has led macy’s since  will step down as chief executive in the first quarter of  the company said he has transformed macy’s during his tenure including with a buyout of the may department stores company in  after the merger he converted other local chains like marshall field’s in chicago and filene’s in boston into macy’s stores he also changed the company’s corporate name to macy’s from federated department stores in macy’s now operates  stores in  states up from just  stores in  those stores include the upscale department store chain bloomingdale’s and the makeup retailer bluemercury macy’s shares rose about  percent in midday trading“under lundgren lots of different initiatives were going on what macy’s needs is a finisher of those things” said mr saunders the retail analyst “we have to see what jeff gennette can do” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think
