commercial customers in north america and south america the joint venture the joint venture is an integral part of our longterm strategy we believe the joint venture will allow gvl to focus on the retail led business including the private label led business which to date has represented a significant portion of our revenues while allowing us to focus on our technology business featuring product lines such as its proprietary healthetm vividgror and freeledtm which will be operated independently from gvl the joint venture remains subject to certain closing conditions upon the closing of the joint venture we through lsg jv holdings will make an initial capital contribution of  million in cash to gvl and mls will make an initial capital contribution of  million in cash to gvl upon the determination of the board of managers of gvl each of lsg jv holdings and mls will be required to make additional capital contributions of up to  million and  million in the aggregate respectively during the first  months following the closing date lsg jv holdings will own  of the membership interests of gvl and mls will own  of the membership interests of gvl on january   and february   we

million with each series j security consisting of a one share of our series j convertible preferred stock series j preferred stock and b a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock par value  per share the common stock at an exercise price of  per share of common stock led lighting industry trends there are a number of industry factors that affect our business and results of operations including among others rate and extent of adoption of led lighting products our potential for growth will be driven by the rate and extent of adoption of led lighting within the general illumination market and our ability to affect this rate of adoption through the offering of competitive lighting solutions although led lighting is relatively new its adoption has grown in recent years innovations and advancements in led lighting technology that improve product performance and reduce product cost continue to enhance the value proposition of led lighting for general illumination and expand its potential commercial applications external legislation and subsidy programs concerning energy efficiency the united states and many countries in the european union and elsewhere have already instituted or have announced plans to institute government regulations and programs designed to encourage or mandate increased energy efficiency in lighting these actions include in certain cases banning the sale after specified dates of certain forms of incandescent lighting which is advancing the adoption of more energy efficient lighting solutions such as leds in addition the growing demand for electricity is increasingly driving utilities and governmental agencies to provide financial incentives such as rebates for energy efficient lighting technologies in an effort to mitigate the need for investments in new electrical generation capacity while this trend is generally positive for us from time to time there have been political efforts in the united states to change or limit the effectiveness of these regulations intellectual property led market participants rely on patented and nonpatented proprietary information relating to product development manufacturing capabilities and other core competencies of their business protection and licensing of intellectual property is critical therefore led lighting industry participants often take steps such as additional patent applications confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements as well as other security measures to enforce or protect intellectual property rights market participants commonly commence or threaten litigation intense and constantly evolving competitive environment competition in the led lighting market is intense many companies have made significant investments in led lighting development and production equipment traditional lighting companies and new entrants are investing in led based lighting products as led adoption has gained momentum product pricing pressures are significant and market participants often undertake pricing strategies to gain or protect market share enhance sales of their previously manufactured products and open new applications to led based lighting solutions to remain competitive market participants must continuously increase product performance and reduce costs financial results the following table sets forth our revenue cost of goods sold and gross profit for the years ended december    and  year ended december     revenue       cost of goods sold    gross profit       gaap gross profit percentage       our revenue is primarily derived from sales of our ledbased retrofit lamps and luminaires our revenue decreased by  million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   this decrease in revenue was due to a decrease in sales to the home depot inc the home depot of  million and a decrease in sales to other commercial customers of  million the home depot performed a periodic product line review in  relating to its entire private label led lighting product offering and as a result the home depot elected to purchase certain products previously supplied by us directly from overseas suppliers such products represented a significant percentage of our sales to the home depot for the three years prior to the line review and the loss of this business was the primary reason for the decline in sales to the home depot for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   the decrease in sales to other commercial customers for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to the loss of two distribution customers the sales of excess inventory at reduced prices and increased competition in the industry generally our revenue decreased  million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   this decrease in revenue was due to a  million decrease in sales to commercial customers and a  million decrease in sales to the home depot we continue to pursue new relationships with retailers and original equipment manufacturers oems to help increase and diversify our sales our gross profit is principally driven by the mix and quantity of products we sell our financial results are dependent upon the operating costs associated with our supply chain including materials labor and freight and the level of our selling distribution and administrative research and development and other operating expenses we continuously seek to improve our existing products and to bring new products to market as a result many of our products have short life cycles and therefore product life cycle planning is critical at times we may purchase excess components and other materials used in the manufacture and assembly of our products or we may manufacture finished products in excess of demand in addition components materials and products may become obsolete earlier than expected these circumstances may require us to record inventory reserves and provisions for expected losses on noncancellable purchase commitments when these circumstances are present we may also incur additional expense as we adjust our supply chain and product life cycle planning as a result of charges for inventory reserves our gross profit for the year ended december   declined as compared to the year ended december   for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   our gross profit improved due to changes in the mix of products sold more sales from higher margin inventory and lower charges for inventory reserves and for warranty expenses as well as increased use of contract manufacturing in asia resulting in lower costs of production nongaap financial measures although our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap we believe the following nongaap financial measures provide additional information that is useful to the assessment of our operating performance and trends as part of our ongoing review of financial information related to our business our management regularly uses nongaap measures particularly nongaap adjusted operating expense as a percentage of revenue these nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with nor are they a substitute for the comparable gaap financial measures and are intended to supplement our financial results that are prepared in accordance with gaap we define nongaap adjusted operating expenses as total operating expenses less noncash expenses for stockbased compensation restructuring expenses and depreciation and amortization nongaap adjusted operating expenses for the year ended december   decreased by  million or  as compared to the year ended december   while revenue decreased  compared to the year ended december   nongaap adjusted operating expenses for the year ended december   decreased by  million or  as compared to the year ended december   while revenue decreased  compared to the year ended december   nongaap adjusted operating expenses represented  and  of revenue for the year ended december   and  respectively for the year ended december   the decrease in nongaap adjusted operating expenses was due to i a reduction in stock compensation expense which resulted from the termination of employees during  that had nonvested stock option grants and the previously recognized stock compensation expense reversed for those nonvested stock option grants andii and a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense which was driven by savings resulting from not replacing property and equipment that was fully depreciated for the year ended december   the decrease in nongaap adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to significant cost cutting measures taken in  with the resulting cost savings realized in  year ended december     revenue       total operating expense    less issuance of resricted stock and stock options for directors compensation    noncash stock option and restricted stock compensation expense     restructuring expense    depreciation and amortization    total operating expenses excluding stock based compensation restructuring and depreciation and amortization       gaap operating expense as a percentage of revenue       nongaap adjusted operating expense as a percentage of revenue       over the past several years we adapted our supply chain and logistics processes to improve our ability to more efficiently meet customer needs while continuing to focus on developing innovative products during this period we improved our forecasting and finished goods inventory management transitioned our manufacturing processes to lower cost contract manufacturers in asia and enhanced our new product innovation process we believe these changes drove additional improvements in our management and manufacturing infrastructure and expanded our ability to source components and manufacture our products internationally we believe these improvements will allow us to focus more on innovative science based and creative engineering talent which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage in addition to developing products that target mainstream retail and commercial lighting we are seeking to expand our product offerings to compete across multiple industry verticals critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our actual results may differ from these estimates on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources these estimates may change as new events occur additional information is obtained and our operating environment changes we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and consist of finished lighting products inventories are valued on a firstin first out basis significant changes in our strategic plan including changes in product mix product demand slow product adoption rapid technological changes and new product introductions and enhancements could result in excess or obsolete inventory we evaluate inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis to specifically identify obsolete slowmoving or nonsalable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions the writedown of excess and obsolete inventory based on this evaluation creates a new cost basis and is included in cost of goods sold on a quarterly basis we consider the need to record a lower of cost or market adjustment for our raw materials and finished goods inventory the market value of finished goods is determined based upon current sales transactions less the cost of disposal of the respective finished goods revenue recognition product sales are generally recorded when our products are shipped and title passes to customers where sales of product are subject to certain customer acceptance terms revenue from such sales are recognized once these terms have been met income taxes we employ the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are reversed we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount which we estimate is more likely than not to be realized our ability to realize our deferred tax assets is generally dependent on the generation of taxable income during the future periods in which the temporary differences are deductible and the net operating losses can be offset against taxable income if we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount the resulting adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase net earnings in the period such a determination was made going concern we evaluate whether there are conditions or events considered in the aggregate that may raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date that our financial statements are issued or available to be issued conditions or events include expected future results of operations liquidity needs financing agreements and capital needs financial operations overview revenue our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of our ledbased retrofit lamps and luminaires for indoor and outdoor general illumination applications in the residential commercial industrial and public infrastructure markets our revenue is dependent on the continuing adoption of led lighting in our target markets which in turn are subject to improvements in led lighting performance as well as reductions in led lighting cost we expect our selling prices to continue to decline over time and believe that these declines will be offset by increases in sales volume subject to our ability to access end users of led lighting products we depend heavily on the strength of our relationships with certain retail customers primarily the home depot and oem customers which provide us with access to residential and commercial end users of led lighting products we may experience significant inflections in growth as we enter into relationships with partners such as these and we will seek to develop similar relationships with new customers conversely any deterioration in our relationships with these customers or in their activities in led lighting could negatively impact our revenue the home depot accounted for   and  of our revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively as discussed above revenue for the year ended december   was adversely affected by the loss of certain business from the home depot as well as the loss of two distribution customers due to these recent challenges the success of our direct sales efforts including our ability to effectively grow and manage the roster of distributors and independent sales agents that sell our products is increasingly critical to our business cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold includes the cost of products purchased from our contract manufacturers as well as the cost of related inbound freight manufacturing labor production overhead and warranty costs we also include provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and noncancellable purchase commitments in our cost of goods sold we source our manufactured products based on sales projections and customer orders currently purchased products from our contract manufacturers represent the largest portion of our cost of goods sold on a per unit basis these costs generally decrease as we gain purchasing scale with increases in our sales in periods of rapidly increasing demand however we may incur higher costs to ensure an adequate supply of products and components and to expedite shipping by means of premium inbound freight these costs are typically higher the more dependent we are on a limited number of suppliers for specific products and the greater the distance is between production sites and such suppliers we have historically incurred higher costs to the extent our supply chain management and production processes resulted in larger physical inventory variances or lower yields with our increased reliance on contract manufacturers we believe we will see continued improvement in our gross profit due to our increased ability to manage our inventory costs our contract manufacturers provide improved manufacturing capacity which we expect will reduce the leadtime requirements for most products and reduce the amount of inventory we will be required to carry in the future in addition our increased usage of contract manufacturers has led to a reduction in overhead and labor costs assuming that the pending joint venture with mls closes we believe this relationship will drive additional improvements in cost of goods sold and gross profit during  our cost of goods sold continued to be adversely impacted by our ability to accurately forecast product demand and manage the procurement and availability of our materials acquisition costs generally decline on a per unit basis with an increase in throughput through better execution and higher volumes of production as well as technological advances in the manufacturing process accordingly newly introduced products typically have higher per unit costs as we gain supply chain and manufacturing process efficiencies our warranty costs depend both on the quality of our manufacturing processes as well as our ability to design products for greater reliability additionally our ability to control excess inventory reserves depends on how accurately we match future purchases of inventory with future sales our gross profit is also affected by a number of other factors including the average selling price of our products and our ability to offset declining prices with lower production costs our mix of products sold and the customers to whom they are sold also impact our gross profit as certain of our products have higher levels of profitability and we may contractually price our products at lower levels for certain customers based on volume expectations contract duration and our own cost reduction roadmap to the extent we suffer temporary manufacturing or supply chain inefficiencies implementation of our cost reduction roadmap may be delayed resulting in unplanned declines in gross profit for certain products until these inefficiencies are addressed operating expenses operating expenses consist of selling distribution and administrative expenses and research and development expenses personnelrelated expenses comprise the most significant component of these expenses in any particular period the timing of additional hires or layoffs could materially affect our operating expenses both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue selling distribution and administrative expenses selling distribution and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnelrelated expenses sales commissions samples and other marketing costs for new products and customer demonstrations fees for professional services public company costs travel and other outofpocket expenses cost of marketing materials and other corporate communications customer service expenses and direct and allocated facilities and other related overhead costs professional services consist principally of    apr   c  cybernet data systems

years we have focused on expanding and optimizing our global supply chain to meet forecasted demand for our products while addressing the inefficiencies that have compressed our gross profit and overall financial performance in prior periods such as costs incurred to expedite the production or delivery of component parts we anticipate longterm gross profit improvement as we continue to execute on our initiatives we completed one of our most critical initiatives in  with the transition of the manufacturing of our high volume lamps from mexico and satellite beach to our contract manufacturing partners in asia from which we source the majority of our components in  we opened a new distribution center in seattle washington in order to reduce the transit time for products from asia and to provide us with an additional port through which we can import goods a labor dispute at the port of los angeles in  caused work slowdowns and as a result affected the timing and
