analysis of operating results the company defines operating income or loss as reconciled to net loss income under canadian gaap as net loss income before amortization financial expenses reserve for restructuring of operations impairment of assets and other special charges gain on remeasurement of exchangeable debentures loss on debt refinancing gain loss  on sales of businesses and other assets impairment of goodwill and intangible assets income taxes dividends on preferred shares of a subsidiary net of income tax noncontrolling interest and the results of discontinued operations operating income as defined above is not a measure of results that is consistent with canadian gaap it is not intended to be regarded as an alternative to other financial operating performance measures or to the statement of cash flows as a measure of liquidity it is not intended to represent funds available for debt service dividends reinvestment or other discretionary uses and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with canadian gaap management believes that operating income is a meaningful measure of performance the company considers the media and printing segments as a whole and uses operating income in order to assess the performance of its investment in quebecor world and quebecor media management and our board of directors use this measure in evaluating the company’s consolidated results as well as results of the company’s operating segments as such this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of certain intangible assets and it is unaffected by the capital structure or investment activities of the company and of its segments operating income is also relevant because it is a significant component of the company’s annual incentive compensation programs a limitation of this measure however is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the company’s segments other financial measures that take into account these costs such as free cash flows from operations are also used by the company in addition measures like operating income are commonly used by the investment community to analyze and compare the performance of companies in the industries in which the company is engaged the company’s definition of operating income may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies free cash flows from operations the company uses free cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity free cash flows from operations represent funds available for business acquisitions the payment of dividends on equity shares and the repayment of longterm debt free cash flows from operations is not a measure of liquidity that are consistent with canadian gaap it is not intended to be regarded as an alternative to other financial operating performance measures or to the statement of cash flows as a measure of liquidity free cash flows from operations is considered to be an important indicator of the company’s liquidity and is used by its management and board of directors to evaluate cash flows generated by the company’s segments’ operations the company’s definition of free cash flows from operations may not be identical to similarly titled measures reported by other companies average monthly revenue per user average monthly revenue per user or arpu is an industry metric that the company uses to measure its average cable internet and telephony revenues per month per basic cable customer arpu is not a measurement that is consistent with canadian gaap and the company’s definition and calculation of arpu may not be the same as identically titled measurements reported by other companies the company calculates arpu by dividing its combined cable television internet access and telephony revenues by the average number of its basic cable customers during the applicable period and then dividing the resulting amount by the number of months in the applicable period     top of page main menuquebecor telecommunications
