investment advisory agreement the advisory agreement for the year  the advisory agreement the form of which is attached to this proxy statement as exhibit a is identical to the current advisory agreement except as to its effective date and termination date the advisory agreement is to become effective upon its approval by the shareholders of the fund terms of the advisory agreement under the advisory agreement as under the current advisory agreement the investment adviser serves as the discretionary portfolio manager of the fund subject to the supervision of the board of trustees the advisory agreement like the current advisory agreement requires the investment adviser to give primary consideration to securing the most favorable price and efficient execution in the selection of brokers and dealers to execute portfolio transactions for the fund the advisory agreement further provides that consistent with this policy the adviser may consider the financial responsibility research and investment information and other services provided by the broker or dealer and in particular may select brokers who also provide brokerage and research services to the fund andor the other accounts over which the investment adviser exercises investment discretion and may pay a broker who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction which is in excess of the amount of commission another broker would charge for effecting that transaction the investment adviser may select such brokers if the investment adviser determines in good faith that the amount of the commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by the executing broker however since the inception of the fund the investment adviser has not received any soft dollar research from brokers in connection with the funds portfolio transactions and the investment adviser has no current intention of doing so under the advisory agreement as under the current advisory agreement the investment adviser is responsible for the compensation of any of the funds trustees officers and employees who are interested persons of the investment adviser for the compensation of the investment advisers personnel and for other expenses incurred in connection with the provisions of portfolio management services under the advisory agreement in addition the adviser also the administrator under the administration agreement will pay the expenses of printing and distributing the funds prospectuses

of the outstanding voting securities of the fund or by the investment adviser the advisory agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined by the  act and the term and termination are the same as those in the current advisory agreement which was one year advisory fee as compensation for its investment advisory services on behalf of the fund the fund pays the investment adviser an advisory fee under the current advisory agreement equal to the annual rate of  of the funds daily net assets this fee is computed daily and paid monthly the investment adviser may at its discretion waive its fee or reimburse the fund for any amount of the fee payable to it during that fiscal year for the fiscal year that ended  the investment adviser has agreed to waive by the investment adviser for  was  the reimbursement of such fee had a material effect on the funds expense ratio and yield to the shareholders such material effect was the subsequent lowering of the funds expense ratio resulting in an increase in the yield to the shareholders the advisory fee payable to the investment adviser under the advisory agreement is identical to the annual rate of  of the funds daily net assets under the current advisory agreement factors considered by the trustees the trustees determined that the terms of the advisory agreement are fair and reasonable and that approval of the advisory agreement on behalf on the fund is in the best interests of the fund the trustees reviewed a variety of the information relating to the nature quality and scope of the services provided by the investment adviser and the reasonableness of the advisory fees for the fund among other things the trustees considered the following the shortterm and longterm performance of the fund relative to the performance of other funds with comparable objectives and policies as well as relative to standardized indices the fees charged by other managers of mutual funds with comparable objectives and policies for comparable services and the total expense ratios of such funds the profitability of the investment advisers relationship with the fund and other organizational information relating to the investment adviser its advisory personnel and its investment processes the trustees determined that the investment adviser has provided quality services with respect to the fund in particular the trustees noted that for the periods that ended  and  from the performance point of view the fund had produced a total return of  for year  it is the same as the s  p  index which is benchmark for domestic equity fund the fund had also produced a  of return as of  comparing to the  of s  p  index the fund was  greater than the benchmark from the volatility point of view the fund held an average of around  cash on hand in the period of  and  in the period ending  that means the fund beat the benchmark with plenty of cash on hand the fund has reduced the portfolios volatility by holding a lot of cash and also outperforming the benchmark from the tax efficiency point of view the fund had an  turn over rate in the year of  it is quite low and expected a turn over rate of around  in this fiscal year as of  with such a low turn over rate the fund expects to eliminate realized capital gain that usually causes shareholders to pay higher tax lower turnover rate with carefully tax selling strategy the advisor delivers a very good aftertax return to shareholders the trustees examined the effective advisory fees of the fund against comparable mutual funds under both the current advisory agreement and advisory agreement the trustees noted that the advisory fee for the fund is above the median and average of funds with comparable objectives and policies however the total operating fees are expected to be lower than other fund the trustees also concluded that the relative position of the fund was justified by its superior performance against
