forgot password recently added you have no items in your shopping cart europe automotive  aviation  july  issue  let there be light jörg buchheim ceo of inalfa roof systems a literal ray of sunshine for those in transit inalfa has been working to create more intuitive car roof systems since the s opening many new doors in search of innovation while convertibles are always fashionable with the added appeal of fresh air and sunshine sure to liven up any car journey they’re not always the most practical or affordable choice thankfully the trusty sunroof has been there to fill the void for those more practical yet freshairloving car owners – those who don’t want to feel confined by the idea of mandatory shade all year round or be blocked from overhead visibility or for those who enjoy a welcome cooling alternative to lowered side windows where the angled rush of wind creates chaos for every head of hair the benefits just keep multiplying now that technology and automation have been brought into the mix and specialist companies like inalfa roof systems are working hard with suppliers and customers worldwide to discover and respond to upcoming trends and demands  automotive veteran jörg buchheim stepped in to lead inalfa roof systems in july  bringing with him more than  years of industry experience as well as  as president and ceo of automotive electronics firm hella china jörg shares with the ceo magazine what attracted him to the new role his enthusiasm for the continuous improvement of the car roof system and he shares some strategic roadmaps and initiatives the company has in place to spur continuing innovation and collaboration the ceo magazine with more than  years of experience in the automotive industry what opportunities did you see when joining inalfa roof systems jörg it was actually the very interesting mix of a european automotive company based in the netherland with a chinese shareholder and dealing with a product that has the chance to gain significant valueadd towards the area of autonomous and electrical driving the company operates in a product field where upgrades to its technology and design are frequent with its history stemming from slider roofs to glass panels to panorama roofs in the next  to  years we will see further evolution of roofs as part of a growing trend in the automotive sector autonomous driving and evehicles will also bring opportunities in the future and innovate our experience of car interiors the roof will play an essential role in this regard  you’re coming up to  months in the role what are the key objectives you’ve implemented we have developed and kicked off a clear roadmap agreed upon by the board of management first we want to concentrate on managing our important launches this year particularly our new factories in the us china and also eastern europe autonomous driving and evehicles will also bring opportunities in the future we want to get them operating flawlessly and efficiently for our customers second we would like to strengthen the organisation with more talent by hiring experts and strong inspiring managers to broaden the experience and knowledge level and third we are sharpening and upgrading our processes to better suit new requirements of car manufacturers and global end customers we need to be prepared because people want new products faster so we need to be more innovative  finally we want our products to become the first choice for our customers when it comes to innovation quality and reliability so that it satisfies not only them but also our investors and employees that’s the roadmap we are following how has the opening of the new headquarters in the netherlands assisted in the growth of inalfa  it’s a very nice and modern building you should come to see it on the one hand it reflects what we are actually doing the panorama roof where natural light shines through a lot of glass makes the headquarters a more pleasant place to work and it mimics the appeal of these roofs in the cars it our new headquarters supports us in attracting new talent and experts by offering a nice place to go every day where people can feel inspired on the other hand it reflects an important part of our company culture with our overall aim to always practise transparency with our people and our customers finally it supports us in attracting new talent and experts by offering a nice place to go every day where people can feel inspired and that’s what we need  what challenges have you faced within the industry and how has inalfa worked to overcome these  the main challenge we face actually lies in managing the growth at inalfa companies these days are having to expand their own footprint to serve global customers and remain competitive we too are faced with this demand we must maintain a strong and profitable presence in china we must secure our home markets and we need to be innovative and agile to stay competitive and attractive that’s the requirement  inalfa is certainly a company operating in a competitive field but we have the benefit of a multifaceted cultural setup being a company in the netherlands with a chinese shareholder and major customers in germany this variety makes it a very interesting field with a lot of opportunities we must also ensure that we successfully bridge the cultural gaps between asia and europe and i think that’s what i can bring from my  years’ experience working in china besides that we need to continuously build on our offering to investors and customers to ensure the organisation continues to grow  and that our knowhow capabilities and processes grow accordingly   how does inalfa continue to be at the forefront of technology and innovation its focus on ergonomics and diversification must play a role yes we are certainly doing a lot to drive innovation we are working with a very diversified and ambitious global team on identifying new trends worldwide which provides us with a competitive edge diversification is definitely part of this and we’re working on new and clever operating systems we are also working on new glass technologies to reduce the weight of roofs because we want to make them bigger in order to provide more light into the vehicles furthermore we are considering the future integration of more electronics to increase the comfort and experience of certain functions coping with changing interior environments of automotive vehicles can be challenging but it’s all about building a new interior and a new experience we’re catering for the car of tomorrow i’m talking about autonomous driving having more time to experience the interior of your car having more ways to enjoy or operate your roof things like that  you have a  plan to achieve a € billion turnover what are the main factors you feel will enable you to achieve this plan  we are doing so well that though i don’t want to appear arrogant i’m very confident that as long as there is no general crisis inalfa will reach its goal of € billion turnover in  we’re getting very close to that i’m very confident that so long as there’s no general crisis inalfa will reach its goal of € billion turnover in  the challenge is more about achieving this to the highest satisfaction level of all parties involved – customers shareholders employees and partners that’s what i care about most therefore we’re strongly focused on doing our homework putting our heads down and doing the best we can to earn that growth it’s more about the journey rather than the target  what do you believe sets inalfa apart from its competitors  i think the additional opportunities provided to us from our strong chinese shareholder bhap arms us with a competitive advantage as it gives us great support as well as ease of access to one of the biggest markets in the world the strong commitment from our shareholder also gives us a longterm view of the market and our goals which is different to our previous owners who were more shortterm oriented and more focused on quick investment rather than longterm innovation and growth although we certainly got some tailwinds there due to providing our roofs to their own automotive brand  i also think our traditional attitude towards customer service is very much appreciated we have a high degree of flexibility and an eye for problemsolving this we want to further strengthen again how does inalfa build strong and effective relationships with suppliers in the roof business a deep value lies with your suppliers therefore we are always increasing our efforts to get them integrated as early as possible we launched a program in january called extended enterprise to focus on early involvement of suppliers in developing solutions very early on we begin discussing the possible qualitative reliable and technical solutions and then working jointly on new innovations what we are offering  them in return is successful growth alongside us and a longterm commitment that’s a simple formula that we are driving with our suppliers the extended enterprise concept is one that we are also always pursuing and maintaining with our customers we are looking for early involvement and feedback from them for the joint development of innovative products and to increase the quality and reliability of current products  what qualities do you believe make a good leader and what inspires you a good leader should lead by example that’s very important you need to set an example in all behaviours whether that’s demonstrating company cultures or acting on organisational values plus i’m very keen on providing regular feedback i’m inspired a lot by my employees and teams but also my family inspires me to think with whole new perspectives this is important because to improve your organisation you need to establish a continuous autonomous improvement culture and you can’t improve without feedback overall you need to make sure that you create a performanceoriented and positive cultural environment to provide employees happiness engagement and success with room for development  i’m inspired a lot by my employees and teams but also my family inspires me to think with whole new perspectives my wife is chinese and she approaches challenges from a different angle than i might and she sometimes advises me of solutions that i didn’t consider myself and certainly my  children are inspiring me all of the time they are careless and unpolitical but also so quick at learning and adapting to new environments   you can download the pdf version
