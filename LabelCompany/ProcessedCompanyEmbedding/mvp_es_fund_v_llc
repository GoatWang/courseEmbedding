as for winners of large cash settlements from a lawsuit or from winning the lottery defined benefit pensions and social security are two examples of lifetime guaranteed annuities that pay retirees a steady cash flow until they pass types of annuities annuities can be structured according to a wide array of details and factors such as the duration of time that payments from the annuity can be guaranteed to continue annuities can be created so that upon annuitization payments will continue so long as either the annuitant or their spouse if survivorship benefit is elected is alive alternatively annuities can be structured to pay out funds for a fixed amount of time such as 0 years regardless of how long the annuitant lives furthermore annuities can begin immediately upon deposit of a lump sum or they can be structured as deferred benefits annuities can be structured generally as either fixed or variable fixed annuities provide regular periodic payments to the annuitant variable annuities allow the owner to receive greater future cash flows if investments of the annuity fund do well and smaller payments if its investments do poorly this provides for a less stable cash flow than a fixed annuity but allows the annuitant to reap the benefits of strong returns from their funds investments one criticism of annuities is that they are illiquid deposits into annuity contracts are typically locked up for a period of time known as the surrender period where the annuitant would incur a penalty if all or part of that money were touched these surrender periods can last anywhere from  to more than 0 years depending on the particular product surrender fees can start out at 0 or more and the penalty typically declines annually over the surrender period while variable annuities carry some market risk and the potential to lose principal riders and features can be added to annuity contracts usually for some extra cost which allow them to function as hybrid fixedvariable annuities contract owners can benefit from upside portfolio potential while enjoying the protection of a guaranteed lifetime minimum withdrawal benefit if the portfolio drops in value other riders may be purchased to add a death benefit to the contract or accelerate payouts if the annuity holder is diagnosed with a terminal illness cost of living riders are common to adjust the annual base cash flows for inflation based on changes in the cpi who sells annuities life insurance companies and investment companies are the two sorts of financial institutions offering annuity products for life insurance companies annuities are a natural hedge for their insurance products life insurance is bought to deal with mortality risk – that is the risk of dying prematurely policyholders pay an annual premium to the insurance company who will pay out a lump sum upon their death if policyholders die prematurely the insurer will pay out the death benefit at a net loss to the company actuarial science and claims experience allows these insurance companies to price their policies so that on average insurance purchasers will live long enough so that the insurer earns a profit annuities on the other hand deal with longevity risk or the risk of outliving ones assets the risk to the issuer of the annuity is that annuity holders will live outlive their initial investment annuity issuers may hedge longevity risk by selling annuities to customers with a higher risk of premature death in many cases the cash value inside of permanent life insurance policies can be exchanged via a 0 exchange for an annuity product without any tax implications agents or brokers selling annuities need to hold a stateissued life insurance license and also a securities license in the case of variable annuities these agents or brokers typically earn a commission based on the notional value of the annuity contract who buys annuities annuities are appropriate financial products for individuals seeking stable guaranteed retirement income because the lump sum put into the annuity is illiquid and subject to withdrawal penalties it is not recommended for younger individuals or for those with liquidity needs annuity holders cannot outlive their income stream which hedges longevity risk so long as the purchaser understands that he or she is trading a liquid lump sum for a guaranteed series of cash flows the product is appropriate some purchasers hope to cash out an annuity in the future at a profit however this is not the intended use of the product immediate annuities are often purchased by people of any age who have received a large lump sum of money and who prefer to exchange it for cash flows in to the future the lottery winners curse is the fact that many lottery winners who take the lump sum windfall often spend all of that money in a relatively short period of time trading center valuation period cash refund annuity years certain annuity whole life annuity due mortality and expense risk charge delayed annuity deferred annuity annuity consideration immediate payment annuity next up dictionary  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
