invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise within six months of the companys creation and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe the company opened a bank the bank of the

powerful element of politics into the process and invited what today would be called corruption but then was regarded as business as usual hamiltons political enemy—and eventual murderer—aaron burr was able to create a bank by sneaking a clause into a charter for a company called the manhattan company to provide clean water to new york city the innocuouslooking clause allowed the company to invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise within six months of the companys creation and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe the company opened a bank the bank of the

powerful element of politics into the process and invited what today would be called corruption but then was regarded as business as usual hamiltons political enemy—and eventual murderer—aaron burr was able to create a bank by sneaking a clause into a charter for a company called the manhattan company to provide clean water to new york city the innocuouslooking clause allowed the company to invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise within six months of the companys creation and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe the company opened a bank the bank of the manhattan company still in existence it is today j p morgan chase the largest bank in the united states led by david rockefeller during the s and s chase manhattan emerged as one of the largest and

powerful element of politics into the process and invited what today would be called corruption but then was regarded as business as usual hamiltons political enemy—and eventual murderer—aaron burr was able to create a bank by sneaking a clause into a charter for a company called the manhattan company to provide clean water to new york city the innocuouslooking clause allowed the company to invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise within six months of the companys creation and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe the company opened a bank the bank of the
