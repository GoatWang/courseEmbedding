provide loan terms including rates and fees and can deposit your cash directly into your account payday loan help can be quick and convenient greenpayday can can get you the payday loan help you need — today sometimes it simply makes more sense to borrow money on a shortterm basis through a company that can offer payday loan help than it is to wait for your next payday have you ever been in a position where payday was just too far away you need money today to keep the lights on go to the doctor or repair your car so you can get to work and earn that much needed paycheck the cost of not getting payday loan help if you are ill you may not be able to work if you can’t work you may find yourself out of more than wages for the missed days in this economy with so many people looking for work you may find yourself out of a job the same applies if you do not have a reliable mode of transportation to get to work why wait until payday to fix your car risking that the repairs may be more costly or you may not be able to get to your job putting off payment of a bill can cost large sums of cash in the form of late fees allowing your bank account to be overdrawn can cost an incredible amount of money in overdraft fees payday loan help is available to keep these costs from spiraling out of control how payday loan help works with greenpayday greenpayday is not a lender and does not provide payday loans but refers consumers to lenders who may provide such loans when you request payday loan help at greenpayday you not requesting a loan from us instead you are taking advantage of our network of payday loan providers our online service is entirely free and works to find potential lenders in our network simply fill out and submit our encryptionsecured online form if we find a possible lender you will be presented with the next steps to complete your loan request if you are presented with a loan offer you will have the option to review the terms of the loan which you may approve or decline we encourage you to always read the terms of your loan thoroughly before accepting them no matter where you get your loan perfect credit not required greenpayday network of lenders works with all credit – including bad credit greenpayday may do a “soft pull” of your credit information which will not impact your credit score further the lender that you are connected with may run a credit check with one or more credit agencies if you have had many credit checks in a given period of time it is possible that this check may negatively affect your credit score there are minimal requirements to get payday loan help with greenpayday when you complete your request for payday loan help with greenpayday we’ll ask you a few questions to determine your eligibility for a loan with one of our provider lenders there are a few basic pieces of information needed to determine eligibility are you at least  years of age do you have a job that pays at least mo after taxes do you have a checking account in your name are you a citizen of the united states or a permanent resident do you have a valid email address can you provide work and home telephone numbers if you meet these requirements then you can qualify for payday loan help with our network of lenders find a payday loan provider that can work for you taking out a payday loan can be intimidating the first time how do you know you can work with a company you’ve only contacted over the internet one way is to use greenpayday to help find a lender that can work for you greenpayday uses advanced encryption technology to protect your personal information we make a reasonable effort to work only with reputable lenders our online service is free and works to find potential lenders in our network that can work for you the convenience of automatic payment it goes without saying that when you need an emergency cash loan you need your money right away because of this it isn’t always convenient to visit a payday loan establishment to repay your loan you weren’t planning that particular errand so it can be easy to forget rather than risking late fees which can make using a payday loan company more expensive than it needs to be greenpayday refers you to lenders who can automatically process your payment on your next payday it is important to remember to budget for what will amount to a smaller payday after your repayment amount is withdrawn from your account but the amount of money you can save by seeking payday loan help makes the entire process worth it it is important to remember to budget for repayments that will be withdrawn from your account representative apr range greenpayday is not a lender and does not provide shortterm loans but connects consumers with potential lenders who may provide such loans for this reason we are unable to supply you with an exact apr annual percentage rate that you will be charged if you are approved for a loan aprs vary according to the information supplied by you in your loan request and your lender you will be given the apr loan fees and other terms by your lender when you are redirected to your loan agreement in the loan request process the apr on a cash loan can range from  to  depending on how the apr is calculated nominal vs effective the duration of the loan loan fees incurred late payment fees nonpayment fees loan renewal actions and other factors keep in mind that the apr range is not your finance charge and your finance charge will be disclosed later on if applicable start now apr – interest rates and repayment explained the annual percentage rate apr is the annualized interest rate that you are charged on your installment loan greenpayday is not a lender but it does connect consumers with lenders that offer loans that may work for them we dont charge fees for this service greenpayday does not have the ability tell you what the exact apr that your lender will charge annual percentage rates can vary based on not only the information that you supply in your initial loan request but the information that your lender supplies to you as well your lender will give you all details on the annual percentage rate cash loan finance charges and other terms once you are redirected to the loan agreement during the process of requesting a cash advance loan if you should require help with any greenpayday–related services you can contact us at your convenience the apr associated with installment loans can generally range from  to  percent depending on how it is calculated as well as other variables including any incurred fees nonpayment late payment charges etc the term of the loan and loan renewal options example of a installment loan apr range apr amount period monthly total paid    mo      mo      mo      mo   important points to consider greenpayday makes a reasonable effort to work with reputable lenders dedicated to providing potential borrowers with sufficiently detailed information concerning loan terms and conditions prior to their accepting any installment loan offer we recommend that you closely view the terms of any loan offer you get to get more details on these considerations you can view the lending policy and rates  fees sections of our website financial implications interest and finance charges if you get approved for a loan the lender will show you the exact terms fees and interest rate associated with the loan before you formally agree to its offer as mentioned earlier greenpayday is not a lender so it therefore is unable to tell you what the exact fees and interest rate attached to your loan offer will be please know that you are never under obligation to accept the loan terms that a lender offers you representative example if you receive a  month loan at an interest rate of  with a  origination fee of  you will receive a loan amount of  and will make  monthly payments of approximately  at a  apr in the case of a  month loan at an interest rate of  with a

pay on time will negatively affect this score and make it harder for you to do things like take out a credit card or get a loan while less than perfect credit will not necessarily prevent you from being able to receive a loan all loans are subject to credit approval greenpayday may do a soft pull of your credit information which will not impact your credit score further the lender that you are matched with may run a credit check with one or more credit agency if you have had many credit checks in a given period of time it is possible that this check may negatively affect your credit score
