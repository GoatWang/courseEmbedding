the wood hotel key card nrri’s pat donahue and hill wood products’ randy rosandich discuss flooring veneers nrri helps wood products companies through the recession northern sheer veneer tim doyle couldnt have picked a worse time to start a new business venture with a unique new product  october  according to the national bureau of economic research the us recession officially started just two months later so  was an r  d year but when we were ready with products in  nobody wanted to buy anything or try anything new doyle said luckily our investors continued to believe in us and invest and we stayed alive with a skeleton crew but as northern sheer veneer in spooner wisc heads into  everythings taking off againnew orders every day and one especially promising european customer with a new product that nrri is helping to develop nrri is the natural resources research institute a part of the university of minnesota duluth the key to this has been pat donahue said doyle he put us with suppliers sourced adhesives and carrier paper for the veneer and found us the connections with logs without the assistance of nrri we would not be where were at today donahue is director of nrris market oriented wood technology group he calls sheer veneers unique ability to produce paper thin real wood veneers the last gold nugget in the wood products industry nrri scientist matt aro is kept busy testing adhesives pressing temperature and other manufacturing variables for the company to produce a sustainable green key card for a swedish company that is selling them to upscale european hotels the idea was very popular at the recent copenhagen climate change convention doyle said this is what nrri does it supports industry in many behindthescenes ways in good times and bad to improve their product and productivity… and keep people working we have an order to make  million key cards and we dont even have a press yet said doyle hes relying on nrris press to fill the order while donahue helps them find one to purchase northern contours this is what nrri does it supports industry in many behindthescenes ways in good times and bad to improve their product and productivity and keep people working with the regional wood products industry down by  percent in  simply holding steady through the recession is something many of nrris clientslike northern contoursare proud of the minnesotabased company launched successfully in  making kitchen cabinets with the help of nrri research on a new membrane press technology as they grew today employing  people in five plants they continued to use nrris expertise to help expand their product line and maintain manufacturing efficiencies through the recession we maintained and increased our customer base and created a number of new products that have expanded our footprint in the market said national sales manager lary skow we also focused on some specific markets that are generating new sales and new customers like the new flatpack cabinet northern contours developed cabinet components in custom sizes that can be assembled by the purchaser and faced to match their existing cabinets in addition to regular product testing nrri did the full battery of performance testing required by the kitchen cabinet manufacturing association we work handinglove with nrri and thats just really great for us said skow it saves us from having to think about it every time we need testing done we just go right to nrri they know us and know our products and we trust them over the years nrri technician victor krause has done countless tests for northern contours scratch and mar impact testing ultraviolet light and chemical resistance testing and this winter he developed a device to determine the critical temperature and press time to bond finicky high gloss laminates to the cabinet doors if we can shave some time off on the press cycle they can press more cabinet doors a day and make more money each day explained krause during the recession northern contours experienced some loss in sales with some large accounts and trimmed their workforce a bit but also used the slowdown to focus on new projects that were in the pipeline its early yet but were very optimistic for  said skow even with a reduction in sales we have enough diversification and our selling price is such that we remain a very profitable company hill wood products hill wood products in cook minn a third generation wood products company credits their engineered flooring product with carrying them through the recession and according to sales manager randy rosandich the key to the success of the flooring product was nrris expertise and technology for the baseline work on the floors nrri lab technician scott johnson made the prototypes and did product testing he helped hill wood understand the technicalities of adhesive performance dimensional stability and the effects of moisture on the product we didnt have the technology here to make the floor boards so we made them at nrri and learned from their expertise to help us have a product ready for market rosandich said when we were ready to make the jump into flooring we were really ready epicurean cutting surfaces duluthbased epicurean cutting surfaces started in  when business owner tony ciardelli looked for new uses for waste material from manufacturing skate board ramps the new cutting board product took off through the recession they focused on developing new products using nrris testing facilities ciardelli says consumers are attracted to their green products and appreciate that they are made completely in the usa he anticipates  to be promising nrris lean manufacturing training has really helped us with manufacturing efficiency as a first thought not an afterthought said ciardelli were committed to being made in the usa and that means we have to be as efficient as possible to compete with china with our new products nrri helps us figure out the best way to move from raw materials coming in to products going out the door loll designs their sister company loll designs actually grew over  percent in production during the recession the company makes durable outdoor furniture with recycled plastics company president greg benson relied on brian brashaw director of nrris wood materials and manufacturing group to help them set up an efficient manufacturing flow and used nrri for product performance testing which led to improved designs we started growing really fast and were running our machines  said benson our commercial sales took off and we got some really big orders it was great to be able to pick up the phone and call brian to figure out how to handle it and get the products out the door for all four companies diversified and new products that they developed with the help of nrri was key to getting through the recession and keeping people employed the development of these products not only increased our revenues but also allowed us to retain jobs and to add some new jobs as well added hill woods rosandich written by june kallestad

adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time
