of principal in addition to the normal risks associated with investing international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social economic or political instability in other nations investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility the riverpark longshort opportunity fund uses leverage if the securities decrease in value the fund may suffer a greater loss than would have resulted without the use of leverage with short sales losses are potentially unlimited and the expenses involved with the short strategy may impact the performance of the fund the value of the funds positions in index options fluctuates in response to changes in the value of the underlying index selling index call options can reduce the risk of owning stocks but it limits the opportunity to profit from an increase in the market value of stocks in exchange for upfront cash at the time of selling the call option unusual market conditions or the lack of a ready market for any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the funds option strategies and for these and other reasons the funds option strategies may not reduce the funds volatility to the extent desired accordingly the purchase of fund shares should be viewed as a longterm investment

largest peak to trough decline in an investments or index’s net asset value over a period of negative performance since inception of the investment different indices and investments will experience drawdowns over different time periods however comparing max drawdowns over a common time period among multiple investments or indices provides a common basis for comparing two or more sets of data the max drawdown for a particular index may be different than the max drawdown presented if it were to include the entire period of such index’s existence rather than the period set forth above since the fund was converted from a partnership with only historical monthly performance the max drawdown is calculated based on monthly performance information down market performance is a metric used to evaluate risk it measures the average monthly performance of the fund as compared to the average monthly performance of the fund’s benchmark the sp  for the months in which the benchmark lost money gross exposure is calculated by adding the percentage of the funds equity invested in short sales to the percentage of its equity used for long positions net exposure takes into account the benefits of offsetting long and short positions and is calculated by subtracting the percentage of the funds equity capital invested in short sales from the percentage of its equity capital used for long positions the sharpe ratio is calculated by subtracting the riskfree rate  such as that of the month us treasury bill  from the rate of return for a portfolio and dividing the result by the standard
