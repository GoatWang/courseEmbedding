story share this page continue reading the main story for managers of most smallcapitalization value funds it has been a brutal few years but rudolph k kluiber portfolio manager of the  million state street research aurora fund has had little trouble maintaining an upbeat attitude even as investors have shunned the kinds of stocks he likes and flocked to large growth equitieswe dont believe the negativity on our stocks is warranted he said from his office overlooking boston harbor or its already built into the price of the stock and we think good things will help propel the stock prices upward in the futurethen again looking at his funds performance you would expect mr kluiber pronounced kloober to fairly radiate optimism aurora returned  percent a year on average for the three years through oct  compared with  percent for its smallvalue peers according to morningstar inc the chicago financial publisher that compares with  percent for the standard  poors  index over that period

that time advertisement continue reading the main story unlike many money managers mr kluiber  doesnt rely on computer programs to identify his smallcap picks he reads a lot of quarterly qs annual reports wall street research and the usual range of business periodicals like forbes and business week and he listens to investment ideas floated by the two analysts working on the fund as well as the  stock analysts employed by state street research and management among others hes the first to admit that his selection contains no neat formulaic discipline its a constant peeling of the onion he said an iterative process continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story there are a number of ways mr kluiber said in which companies can increase shareholder value new products new management revampings mergers or acquisitions stock buybacks or paying down debt so in general he looks for inexpensive stocks he said with a number of different ways to win adding that ideally youd like to have a number of these variablesmr kluiber identifies cheap stocks using some traditional measures of value such as ratios of price to earnings and price to book in september the funds  stocks sold for an average of  times  earnings and a price to book ratio of but he pays special attention to a companys cash cash flow is king he said and free cash flow is even better strong cash flow gives management flexibility to build the business and provide good returns to company shareholders mr kluiber explained he defines free cash flow as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization minus working capital capital spending and cash taxes sometimes hell look at a companys enterprise value  the market value of a companys equity and debt  in relationship to its free cash flow theres no firm multiple that he looks for but the lower the betterthe companies he says he tends to buy are industry leaders companies that usually have more pricing power and are often the lowestcost producers that means they often weather downturns better than their rivals he saidhe recently added to an existing position in transportation technologies industries a leading chicago manufacturer of truck parts the companys enterprise value is just about four times its free cash flow an historically low ratio that resulted from a slowdown in the truck manufacturing business but the multiple is also below those of its rivals newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter
