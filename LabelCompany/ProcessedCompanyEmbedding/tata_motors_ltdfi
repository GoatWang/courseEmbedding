expected results the market price of our adss the shares and the rights could decline due to any of these risks and investors could lose all or part of their investment risk associated with our business and the automotive industry deterioration in global economic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our sales financial condition and results of operations the automotive industry and the demand for automobiles are influenced by general economic conditions including among other things rates of economic growth availability of credit disposable income of consumers interest rates environmental and tax policies safety regulations freight rates and fuel and commodity prices negative trends in any of these factors impacting the regions where we operate could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the indian automotive industry is affected materially by the general economic conditions in india and around the world muted industrial growth in india in recent years along with continuing high levels of inflation and interest rates continue to pose risks to overall growth in this market the automotive industry in general is cyclical and economic slowdowns in the recent past have affected the manufacturing sector including the automotive and related industries in india a continuation of negative economic trends or further deterioration in key economic metrics such as the growth rate interest rates and inflation as well as reduced availability of financing for vehicles at competitive rates could materially and adversely affect our automotive sales in india and results of operations in addition the indian automotive market and the indian economy are influenced by economic and market conditions in other countries although economic conditions are different in each country investors reactions to economic developments in one country can have adverse effects on the securities of companies and the economy as a whole in other countries including india a loss of investor confidence in the financial systems of other emerging markets may cause volatility in indian financial markets and indirectly in the indian economy in general any worldwide financial instability could also have a negative impact on the indian economy including the movement of exchange rates and interest rates in india in the event global economic recovery is slower than expected or if there is any significant financial disruption this could have a material adverse effect on our cost of funding portfolio of financing loans business prospects results of operations financial condition and the trading price of our shares and adss our jaguar land rover business has significant operations in the united kingdom north america continental europe and china as well as sales operations in many major countries across the globe during fiscal  the automotive market in the united kingdom and europe continued to experience challenges confidence in financial markets and general consumer confidence have been further eroded by recent political tensions in north africa the middle east and ukraine the imposition of economic sanctions against russia a possible exit by greece from the eurozone and concerns of an economic slowdown in china our strategy with respect to our jaguar land rover operations which includes new product launches and expansion in converging   s table of contents markets such as china india russia and brazil where we have experienced growth in recent years may not be sufficient to mitigate the decrease in demand for our products in established markets which may have a significant negative impact on our financial performance if automotive demand softens because of lower or negative economic growth in key markets including china and russia or other factors our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected restrictive covenants in our financing agreements may limit our operations and financial flexibility and materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and prospects some of our financing agreements and debt arrangements set limits on or require us to obtain lender consent before among other things pledging assets as security in addition certain financial covenants may limit our ability to borrow additional funds or to incur additional liens in the past we have been able to obtain required lender consent for such activities however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such consents in the future if our liquidity needs or growth plans require such consents and such consents are not obtained we may be forced to forego or alter our plans which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in the event we breach these financing agreements the outstanding amounts due thereunder could become due and payable immediately or result in increased costs a default under one of these agreements may also result in crossdefaults under other financing agreements and result in the outstanding amounts under such other financing agreements becoming due and payable immediately this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in recent years we have been in breach of financial covenants relating to our ratio of total outstanding liabilities to tangible net worth and to our debt service coverage ratio in various financing agreements we requested and obtained waivers of our obligations from our lenders and guarantors to pay additional costs as a consequence of such breaches these breaches have not resulted in an event of default in our financing agreements or the payment of penalties if we are in breach of these financials covenants in fiscal  we plan to seek consents or waivers from our lenders or guarantors however we cannot assure you that we will succeed in obtaining consents or waivers in the future from our lenders or guarantors or that our lenders and guarantors will not impose additional operating and financial restrictions on us or otherwise seek to modify the terms of our existing financing agreements in ways that are materially adverse to us in addition future noncompliance with the financial covenants of our financing agreements may lead to increased costs for any future financings see item  operating and financial review and prospectsb liquidity and capital resourcesloan covenants in the annual report for more information on the loan covenants of our financing agreements exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in countries in which we operate we import capital equipment raw materials and components from manufacture vehicles in and sell vehicles into various countries and therefore our revenue and costs have significant exposure to the relative movements of the gbp the us dollar the euro the chinese renminbi the russian ruble the japanese yen and the indian rupee in particular the indian rupee has declined significantly relative to the us dollar in recent years as of august   the value of the indian rupee against the us dollar was rs   us following a depreciation of approximately  as compared to rs  us  on may   based on the exchange rate for indian rupees in the new york city for cable transfers payable in foreign currencies as certified by the federal reserve bank of new york for customs purposes the exchange rate between indian rupees and us dollars was rs   us based on the opening exchange rate as published by bloomberg lp at  am new york city time on march     s table of contents moreover we have outstanding foreign currency denominated debt and are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have experienced and expect to continue to experience foreign exchange losses and gains on obligations denominated in foreign currencies in respect of our borrowings and foreign currency assets and liabilities due to currency fluctuations we also have interestbearing assets including cash balances and interest bearing liabilities which bear interest at variable rates and are therefore exposed to changes in interest rates in the various markets in which we borrow although we manage our interest and foreign exchange exposure through use of financial hedging instruments such as forward contracts swap agreements and option contracts higher interest rates and a weakening of the indian rupee against major foreign currencies significantly increase our cost of borrowing which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity intensifying competition could materially and adversely affect our sales financial condition and results of operations the global automotive industry is highly competitive and competition is likely to further intensify in light of continuing globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry competition is especially likely to increase in the premium automotive categories as each market participant intensifies its efforts to retain its position in established markets while also expanding in emerging markets such as china india russia brazil and parts of asia the factors affecting competition include product quality and features innovation and time to introduce new products ability to control costs pricing reliability safety fuel economy environmental impact and perception thereof customer service and financing terms there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the global automotive industry in the future we also face strong competition in the indian market from domestic as well as foreign automobile manufacturers improving infrastructure and robust growth prospects compared to other mature markets have attracted a number of international companies to india either through joint ventures with local partners or through independently owned operations in india international competitors bring with them decades of international experience global scale advanced technology and significant financial resources consequently domestic competition is likely to further intensify in the future there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement our future strategies in a way that will mitigate the effects of increased competition in the indian automotive industry designing manufacturing and selling vehicles is capital intensive and requires substantial investments in manufacturing machinery research and development product design engineering technology and marketing in order to meet both consumer preferences and regulatory requirements if our competitors consolidate or enter into other strategic agreements such as alliances they may be able to take better advantage of economies of scale we believe that competitors may be able to benefit from the cost savings offered by consolidation or alliances which could adversely affect our competitiveness with respect to those competitors competitors could use consolidation or alliances as a means of enhancing their competitiveness including through the acquisition of technology which could also materially reduce our sales as well as materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our future success depends on our ability to satisfy changing customer demands by offering innovative products in a timely manner and maintaining such products competitiveness and quality our competitors may gain significant advantages if they are able to offer products satisfying customer needs earlier than we are able to which may materially and adversely impact our sales and profitability unanticipated delays or cost overruns in implementing new product launches expansion plans or capacity enhancements could also materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations customer preferences especially in many of the developed markets appear to be moving in favor of more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles furthermore in many countries there has been significant   s table of contents pressure on the automotive industry to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in many markets these preferences are driven by increasingly stringiest government regulations rising fuel prices and customers environmental considerations our business and operations may be significantly impacted if we experience delays in developing products that reflect changing customer preferences especially in the premium automotive category in addition a deterioration in the quality of our vehicles could force us to incur substantial costs and damage our reputation there can be no assurance that the market acceptance of our future products will meet our sales expectations in which case we may be unable to realize the intended economic benefits of our investments and our revenues and profitability may decrease materially private and commercial users of transportation increasingly use modes of transportation other than the automobile especially in connection with increasing urbanization the reasons for this include the rising costs related to automotive transport of people and goods increasing traffic density in major cities and environmental awareness furthermore the increased use of car sharing concepts and other innovative mobility initiatives facilitates access to other methods of transport thereby reducing dependency on the private automobile altogether a change in consumer preferences away from private automobiles would have a material adverse effect on our general business activity and on our sales financial position and results of operations as well as prospects to stimulate demand competitors in the automotive industry have offered customers and dealers price reductions on vehicles and services which has led to increased price pressures and sharpened competition within the industry as a provider of numerous highvolume models our profitability and cash flows are significantly affected by the risk of rising competitive and price pressures special sales incentives and increased price pressures in the new car business also influence price levels in the used car market with a negative effect on vehicle resale values this may have a negative impact on the profitability of the used car business in our dealer organization we are subject to risks associated with product liability warranties and recalls we are subject to risks and costs associated with product liability warranties and recalls relating to defective products parts or aftersales services including by generating negative publicity which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these events could also require us to expend considerable resources in correcting these problems and could significantly reduce demand for our products we may also be subject to class actions or other large scale product liability or other lawsuits in various jurisdictions where we have a significant presence we are subject to risk associated with the automobile financing business we are subject to risks associated with our automobile financing business in india in the nine months ended december   the market share of our automobile financing business which supports sales of our vehicles decreased from the same period in  any default by our customers or inability to repay installments as due could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the sale of our commercial and passenger vehicles is heavily dependent on fund availability for our customers rising delinquencies and early defaults has contributed to a reduction in automobile financing which has had an adverse effect on fund availability for potential customers this reduction in available financing may continue in the future and have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations jaguar land rover has consumer finance arrangements in place with local providers in a number of key markets any reduction in the supply of available consumer financing for purchase of new vehicles could create   s table of contents additional pressures to increase marketing incentives in order to maintain demand for our vehicles which could materially reduce our sales and net income furthermore jaguar land rover also offers residual value guarantees on the leases of certain vehicles in some markets any significant declines in used car valuations could materially and adversely affect our sales financial condition and results of operations over time and particularly in the event of any credit rating downgrade market volatility market disruption regulatory changes or otherwise we may need to reduce the amount of financing receivables we originate which could severely disrupt our ability to support the sale of our vehicles underperformance of our distribution channels and supply chains may have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition and results of operations our products are sold and serviced through a network of authorized dealers and service centers across our domestic market and a network of distributors and local dealers in the international markets we monitor the performance of our dealers and distributors and provide them with support to enable them to perform to our expectations there can be no assurance however that these expectations will be met any under performance by our dealers or distributors could materially and adversely affect our sales financial condition and results of operations we rely on third parties to supply us with the raw materials parts and components used in the manufacture of our products furthermore for some of these parts and components we are dependent on a single source of supply our ability to procure supplies in a cost effective and timely manner is subject to various factors some of which are not within our control while we manage our supply chain as part of our vendor management process any significant problems with our supply chain in the future could severely disrupt our business and materially reduce our sales and net income natural disasters and manmade accidents adverse economic conditions decline in automobile demand and lack of access to sufficient financing arrangements among others could have a negative financial impact on our suppliers and distributors in turn impairing timely availability of components to us or increasing the costs of such components similarly impairments to the financial position of our distributors may adversely impact our sales in some markets in addition if one or more of the other global automotive manufacturers were to become insolvent this would severely disrupt our supply chains and may further materially reduce our sales and net income in respect of our jaguar land rover operations as part of a separation agreement from ford motor company we have entered into long term supply agreements with ford motor company and certain other third parties for critical components which require us to purchase fixed quantity of parts through take or pay contracts any disruption of such services or invocation of take or pay contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations increases in input prices may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in the nine months ended december   and  the consumption of raw materials components and aggregates and purchase of products for sale constituted approximately  and  respectively of our total revenues prices of commodity items used in manufacturing automobiles including steel aluminum copper zinc rubber platinum palladium and rhodium have become increasingly volatile in recent years further price movements would closely depend on the evolving economic scenarios across the globe while we continue to pursue cost reduction initiatives an increase in price of input materials could severely impact our profitability to the extent such increase cannot be absorbed by the market through price increases andor could have a negative impact on the demand in addition an increased price and supply risk could arise from the supply of rare and frequently soughtafter raw materials for which demand is high especially those used in vehicle electronics such as rare earths   s table of contents which are predominantly found in china rare earth metal prices and supply remain uncertain in the past china has limited the export of rare earths from time to time if we are unable to find substitutes for such raw materials or pass price increases on to customers by raising prices or to safeguard the supply of scarce raw materials our vehicle production business and results from operations could be affected due to intense price competition and our high level of fixed costs we may not be able to adequately address changes in commodity prices even if they are foreseeable increases in fuel costs also pose a significant challenge to automobile manufacturers worldwide including us especially in the commercial and premium vehicle segments where increased fuel prices have an impact on demand deterioration in the performance of any of our subsidiaries joint ventures and affiliates may materially and adversely affect our financial results we have made and may continue to make capital commitments to our subsidiaries joint ventures and affiliates and if the business or operations of any of these subsidiaries joint ventures and affiliates deteriorates the value of our investments may decline substantially we are also subject to risks associated with joint ventures and affiliates wherein we have only partial or joint control our partners may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations or may experience financial difficulties which may materially reduce the value of our investments the significant reliance of jaguar land rover on key mature markets increases the risk of negative impact of reduced customer demand in those countries jaguar land rover which contributes a large portion of our revenues generates a significant portion of its sales in the united kingdom north american and continental european markets where it derives threequarters of its revenues sales declines in the premium car or allterrain vehicle segments in which jaguar land rover operates have been particularly severe although demand in those markets remains relatively strong a decline in demand for jaguar land rover vehicles in these markets may in the future significantly impair our business financial position and results of operations in addition jaguar land rovers strategy which includes new product launches and expansion into growing markets such as china india russia and brazil may not be sufficient to mitigate a decrease in demand for jaguar land rover products in mature markets in the future which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial performance we are subject to risks associated with growing our business through mergers and acquisitions we believe that our acquisitions provide us opportunities to grow significantly in the global automobile markets by offering premium brands and products our acquisitions have provided us with access to technology and additional capabilities while also offering potential synergies however the scale scope and nature of the integration required in connection with our acquisitions present significant challenges and we may be unable to integrate the relevant subsidiaries divisions and facilities effectively within our expected schedule an acquisition may not meet our expectations and the realization of the anticipated benefits may be blocked delayed or reduced as a result of numerous factors some of which are outside our control for example we acquired the jaguar land rover business from ford motor company in june  and jaguar land rover has become a significant part of our business and accounted for approximately  of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended march   as a result of the acquisition we are responsible for among other things the obligations and liabilities associated with the legacy business of jaguar land rover we cannot assure you that any legacy issues at jaguar land rover or any other acquisition we have undertaken in the past or will undertake in the future would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our reputation and prospects we will continue to evaluate growth opportunities through suitable mergers and acquisitions in the future growth through mergers and acquisitions involves business risks including unforeseen contingent risks or latent   s table of contents business liabilities that may only become apparent after the merger or acquisition is completed the key success factors will be seamless integration and effective management of the mergedacquired entity retention of key personnel as well as generating cash flow from synergies in engineering and sourcing joint sales and marketing efforts and management of a larger business if any of these factors fails to materialize or if we are unable to manage any of the associated risks successfully our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected our business is seasonal in nature and a substantial decrease in our sales during certain quarters could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance the sales volumes and prices for our vehicles are influenced by the cyclicality and seasonality of demand for these products the automotive industry has been cyclical in the past and we expect this cyclicality to continue in the indian market demand for our vehicles generally peaks between january and march although there is a decrease in demand in february just before release of the indian fiscal budget demand is usually lean from april to july and picks up again in the festival season from september onwards with a decline in december due to yearend our jaguar land rover business is impacted by the semiannual registration of vehicles in the united kingdom where the vehicle registration number changes every six months this leads to an increase in sales following the registration period as customers seek to purchase vehicles with fresh registrations which in turn impacts the resale value of vehicles other markets such as the united states are influenced by introduction of new model year products which typically occurs in the autumn of each year the automotive market in china tends to reflect higher demand for vehicles around the chinese new year demand in the western european automotive markets tends to be reduced during the summer and winter holidays furthermore our cash flows are impacted by temporary shutdowns of three of our manufacturing plants in the united kingdom during the summer and winter holiday seasons the resulting sales and cash flow profile is reflected in our results of operations on a quarterly basis we rely on licensing arrangements with tata sons limited to use the tata brand any improper use of the associated trademarks by our licensor or any other third parties could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our rights to our trade names and trademarks are a crucial factor in marketing our products establishment of the tata word mark and logo mark in and outside india is material to our operations we have licensed the use of the tata brand from tata sons limited or tata sons if tata sons or any of their subsidiaries or affiliated entities or any third party uses the trade name tata in ways that adversely affect such trade name or trademark our reputation could suffer damage which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations inability to protect or preserve our intellectual property could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we own or otherwise have rights in respect of a number of patents relating to the products we manufacture which have been obtained over a period of years in connection with the design and engineering of new vehicles and the enhancement of existing models we seek to regularly develop new technical designs for use in our vehicles we also use technical designs which are the intellectual property of third parties with such third parties consent these patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future although we do not regard any of our businesses as being dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents an inability to protect this intellectual property generally or the illegal breach of some or a large group of our intellectual property rights would have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be affected by restrictions on the use of intellectual property rights held by third parties and we may be held legally liable for the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others in our products   s table of contents our business and operations could be severely disrupted by labor unrest all of our permanent employees in india other than officers and managers and most of our permanent employees in south korea and the united kingdom including certain officers and managers in relation to our automotive business are members of labor unions and are covered by our wage agreements where applicable with those labor unions in general we consider our labor relations with all of our employees to be good however in the future we may be subject to labor unrest which may delay or disrupt our operations in the affected regions including the acquisition of raw materials and parts the manufacture sales and distribution of products and the provision of services if work stoppages or lockouts at our facilities or at the facilities of our major vendors occur or continue for a long period of time our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected our business could be negatively affected by the actions of activist shareholders certain of our shareholders may from time to time advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over our business campaigns by shareholders to effect changes at publiclylisted companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase shortterm shareholder value by advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring increased borrowing special dividends stock repurchases or even sales of assets or the entire company or by voting against proposals put forward by the board of directors and management of the company if faced with actions by activist shareholders we may not be able to respond effectively to such actions which could be disruptive to our business the current environment of increased shareholder activism could lead to new regulations or additional disclosure obligations which could impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate as an example pursuant to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act which contains significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions the sec has adopted additional rules and regulations in areas such as say on pay similarly under applicable indian laws remuneration packages may in certain circumstances require shareholder approval our management and other personnel may be required to devote a substantial amount of time to such compliance initiatives these rules and regulations may increase our legal and financial compliance costs and could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our business and prospects could suffer if we lose one or more key personnel or if we are unable to attract and retain our employees our business and future growth depend largely on the skills of our workforce including executives and officers and automotive designers and engineers the loss of the services of one or more of our personnel could impair our ability to implement our business strategy in view of intense competition any inability to continue to attract retain and motivate our workforce could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects future pension obligations may prove more costly than currently anticipated and the market value of assets in our pension plans could decline we provide post retirement and pension benefits to our employees including defined benefit plans our pension liabilities are generally funded however lower returns on pension fund assets changes in market conditions interest rates or inflation rates and adverse changes in other critical actuarial assumptions may impact our pension liabilities or assets and consequently increase funding requirements which could materially decrease our net income and cash flows   s table of contents any inability to manage our growing international business may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our growth strategy relies on the expansion of our operations by introducing certain automotive products in markets outside india including in europe china russia brazil the united states africa and other parts of asia the costs associated with entering and establishing ourselves in new markets and expanding such operations may be higher than expected and we may face significant competition in those regions in addition our international business is subject to many actual and potential risks and challenges including language barriers cultural differences and other difficulties in staffing and managing overseas operations inherent difficulties and delays in contract enforcement and the collection of receivables under the legal systems of some foreign countries the risk of nontariff barriers other restrictions on foreign trade or investment sanctions and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws rules and regulations as a part of our global activities we may engage with third party dealers and distributors whom we do not control but who may nevertheless take actions that could have a material adverse impact on our reputation and business in addition we cannot assure you that we will not be held responsible for any activities undertaken by such dealers and distributors if we are unable to manage risks related to our expansion and growth in other parts of the world our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected we have a limited number of manufacturing design engineering and other facilities and any disruption in the operations of those facilities could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we have manufacturing facilities and design and engineering centers located in india the united kingdom china south korea thailand south africa and brazil and have established a presence in indonesia we could experience disruptions to our manufacturing design and engineering capabilities for a variety of reasons including among others extreme weather fire theft system failures natural catastrophes mechanical or equipment failures and similar events any such disruptions could affect our ability to design manufacture and sell our products and if any of these events were to occur there can be no assurance that we would be able to shift our design engineering or manufacturing operations to alternate sites in a timely manner or at all any such disruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we are exposed to operational risks including risks in connection with our use of information technology operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal systems and processes whether resulting from internal or external events such risks could stem from inadequacy or failures of controls within internal procedures violations of internal policies by employees disruptions or malfunctioning of information technology systems such as computer networks and telecommunication systems other mechanical or equipment failures human error natural disasters or malicious acts by third parties any unauthorized access to or misuse of data on our information technology systems human errors or technological or process failures of any kind could severely disrupt our operations including our manufacturing design and engineering processes and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations any failures or weaknesses in our internal controls could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as discussed in item  controls and procedures in the annual report upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls we concluded that there was a material weakness such that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as at march   although we have instituted remedial measures to address the material weakness identified and continually review and evaluate our internal control systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our internal controls we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting any such additional weaknesses or failure to adequately remediate any existing weakness could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations and our ability to accurately report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and reliable manner   s table of contents our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us against all potential losses to which we may be subject and this may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we believe that the insurance coverage that we maintain is reasonably adequate to cover all normal risks associated with the operation of our business there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient that any claim under our insurance policies will be honored fully or timely or that our insurance premiums will not increase substantially accordingly to the extent that we suffer loss or damage that is not covered by insurance or which exceeds our insurance coverage or are required to pay higher insurance premiums our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected impairment of intangible assets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations designing manufacturing and selling vehicles is capital intensive and requires substantial investments in intangible assets like research and development product design and engineering technology we review the value of our intangible assets to assess on an annual basis whether the carrying amount matches the recoverable amount for the asset concerned based on underlying cashgenerating units we may have to take an impairment loss as of a current balance sheet date or future balance sheet date if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of operations we require certain approvals or licenses in the ordinary course of business and the failure to obtain or retain them in a timely manner or at all may adversely affect our operations we require certain statutory and regulatory permits licenses and approvals to carry out our business operations and applications for their renewal need to be made within certain timeframes for some of the approvals which may have expired we may have either made or are in the process of making an application for obtaining the approval or its renewal while we have applied renewal for a few of these approvals registrations and permits we cannot assure you that we will receive these approvals and registrations in a timely manner or at all we cannot assure that the approvals licenses registrations and permits issued to us would not be suspended or revoked in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with any terms or conditions thereof or pursuant to any regulatory action further if we are unable to renew or obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals on acceptable terms in a timely manner or at all our business financial conditions and operations may be adversely affected the fund requirements in respect of the use of proceeds are based on management estimates and we have not commissioned an independent appraisal for the use of the proceeds of this rights offering furthermore while we will appoint a monitoring agency to monitor the use of the proceeds of this rights offering we have not entered into any definitive agreements to use the proceeds of this rights offering we intend to use the proceeds of this rights offering for a funding capital expenditure towards plant and machinery b funding expenditure relating to research and product development c repayment in full or part of certain longterm and shortterm borrowings availed by us and d general corporate purposes the fund requirements are based on management estimates and we have not placed orders obtained quotations or entered into definitive agreements for the substantial fund requirements mentioned in use of proceeds our actual fund requirements may be materially different from these management estimates and have not been appraised by any bank or financial institution furthermore we have not identified the general corporate purposes for which we intend to utilize a portion of the proceeds of the rights offering for further details refer to use of proceeds our use of proceeds may differ from the contemplated uses set forth in this prospectus supplement and there is no assurance that the ultimate use of proceeds would not results in a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations   s table of contents political and regulatory risks indias obligations under the world trade organization agreement could materially affect our business indias obligations under its world trade organization agreement could reduce the present level of tariffs on imports of components and vehicles reductions of import tariffs could result in increased competition which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations compliance with new and current laws rules regulations and government policies regarding increased fuel economy reduced greenhouse gas and other emissions vehicle safety taxes and pricing policies in the automotive industry may significantly increase our costs and materially decrease our net income as an automobile company we are subject to extensive governmental regulations regarding vehicle emission levels noise and safety and the levels of pollutants generated by our production facilities these regulations are likely to become more stringent and higher compliance costs may significantly impact our future results of operations in particular the united states and europe have stringent regulations relating to vehicle emissions the proposed tightening of vehicle emissions regulations by the european union will require significant costs for compliance in addition a number of further legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse emissions including national laws and the kyoto protocol are in various phases of discussions and implementation in order to comply with current and future safety and environmental norms we may have to incur additional costs to i operate and maintain our production facilities ii install new emissions controls or reduction technologies iii purchase or otherwise obtain allowances to emit greenhouse gases iv administer and manage our greenhouse gas emissions program and v invest in research and development to upgrade products and manufacturing facilities if we are unable to develop commercially viable technologies or otherwise unable to attain compliance within the time frames set by the new standards we could face significant civil penalties or be forced to restrict product offerings drastically moreover safety and environmental standards may at times impose conflicting imperatives which pose engineering challenges and would among other things increase our costs while we are pursuing the development and implementation of various technologies in order to meet the required standards in the various countries in which we sell our vehicles the costs for compliance with these required standards could be significant to our operations and may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations imposition of any additional taxes and levies designed to limit the use of automobiles could significantly reduce the demand for our products as well as our sales and net income changes in corporate and other taxation policies as well as changes in export and other incentives offered by the various governments could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for example we benefit from excise duty exemptions for manufacturing facilities in the state of uttarakhand in india and other incentives such as subsidies or loans from states where we have manufacturing operations the government of india has proposed a comprehensive national goods and services tax or gst regime that will combine taxes and levies by the central and state governments into one unified rate structure while both the government of india and other state governments of india have publicly announced that all committed incentives will be protected following the implementation of the gst given the limited availability of information in the public domain concerning the gst we are unable to provide any assurance as to this or any other aspect of the tax regime following implementation of the gst the implementation of this rationalized tax structure may be affected by any disagreement between certain state governments which could create uncertainty the timeline of the proposed transition is uncertain as of the date of this prospectus supplement regulations in the areas of investments taxes and levies may also have an impact on indian securities including our shares and adss for more information see item  information on the companyb business overviewgovernment regulationsindian taxesgoods and services tax in the annual report   s table of contents the government of india has announced the union budget for the fiscal year  and the finance bill  has been tabled before the indian parliament the impact of these on our businesses financial condition and results of operations is unclear at this point in time we cannot assure you that any such impact would not materially reduce our revenues and net income the prc antitrust regulator the bureau of price supervision and antimonopoly of the national development and reform commission or the ndrc has launched an investigation into the pricing practices of more than  chinese and international companies in the automotive industry including jaguar land rover and many of its competitors in july  the ndrc has reportedly imposed fines on certain of our international competitors as a result of anticompetitive practices pertaining to vehicle and spare part prices in response to this investigation we set up a process to review our pricing in china and announced in july  reductions in the manufacturers suggested retail price or the msrp for our  liter v and v s range rover range rover sport and jaguar ftype convertible models effective from august   we also announced reductions in the price of certain of our spare parts effective from september   these and other price reductions on our products sold in china may significantly reduce the revenues and profits generated by our operations in china and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our attempts to offset the potential decline in revenue and profits by increasing operational efficiencies and leveraging economies of scale for example through local production in china may fail or not be as successful as expected furthermore any regulatory action taken or penalties imposed by the ndrc or other authorities in china may have significant severe reputational consequences on our business as well as our profitability and prospects we may be materially and adversely impacted by political instability wars terrorism multinational conflicts natural disasters fuel shortagesprices epidemics and labor strikes our products are exported to a number of geographical markets and we plan to further expand our international operations in the future consequently we are subject to various risks associated with conducting our business outside our domestic markets and our operations may be subject to political instability in those markets wars terrorism regional or multinational conflicts natural disasters fuel shortages epidemics and labor strikes in addition conducting business internationally especially in emerging markets exposes us to additional risks including adverse changes in economic and government policies unpredictable shifts in regulation inconsistent application of existing laws rules and regulations unclear regulatory and taxation systems and divergent commercial and employment practices and procedures any significant or prolonged disruption or delay in our operations related to these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations compliance with new and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements adds uncertainty to our compliance policies and increases our costs of compliance we are subject to a complex and changing regime of laws rules regulations and standards relating to accounting corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of  and sec regulations sebi regulations nyse listing rules and indian stock market listing regulations new or changed laws rules regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing revisions to such governance standards we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure however our efforts to comply with evolving laws rules regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management resources and time the companies act  has brought into effect significant changes to the indian company law framework including to the provisions related to issue of capital corporate governance norms accounting policies and audit   s table of contents matters related party transactions the introduction of a provision allowing the initiation of class action suits in india against companies by shareholders or depositors restrictions on the use of investment subsidiaries prohibitions on loans to directors insider trading and restrictions on forward dealing by directors and key management personnel we are also required to spend in each fiscal year at least  of our average net profits during three immediately preceding fiscal years towards corporate social responsibility activities to ensure compliance with the requirements of the companies act  we may need to allocate additional resources which may increase our regulatory compliance costs and divert management attention we may face challenges in interpreting and complying with the companies act due to limited jurisprudence in the event our interpretation of such provisions of the companies act differs from or contradicts with any judicial pronouncements or clarifications issued by the government of india in the future we may face regulatory actions or we may be required to undertake remedial steps in addition sebi recently issued revised corporate governance guidelines which became effective from october   pursuant to the revised guidelines we are required to among other things ensure that there is at least one woman director on our board of directors at all times establish a vigilance mechanism for directors and employees and reconstitute certain committees in accordance with the revised guidelines the ultimate impact on us of these overlapping indian legal and regulatory reforms are uncertain any increase in our compliance requirements or in our compliance costs may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and any perceived or actual noncompliance could also result in severe reputational damage as well as penalties or sanctions compliance with the secs new rule for disclosures on conflict minerals may be time consuming and costly as well as result in reputational damage under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  the sec has adopted a rule that applies to companies that use certain minerals and metals known as conflict minerals in their products including certain products manufactured for them by third parties the new rule requires companies that use conflict minerals in the production of their products to conduct due diligence as to whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries and requires companies to file certain information with the sec about the use of these minerals the deadline for the first conflict minerals report was june   we filed our first conflict minerals report on may   we expect to incur additional costs to comply with the new due diligence and disclosure requirements in addition depending on our findings or our inability to make reliable findings about the source of any possible conflict minerals that may be used in any products manufactured for us by third parties our reputation could be harmed risks associated with investments in an indian company political changes in india could delay andor affect the further liberalization of the indian economy and materially and adversely affect economic conditions in india generally and our business in particular our business could be significantly influenced by economic policies adopted by the government of india since  successive governments have pursued policies of economic liberalization and financial sector reforms the government of india has at various times announced its general intention to continue indias current economic and financial liberalization and deregulation policies however protests against such policies which have occurred in the past could slow the pace of liberalization and deregulation the rate of economic liberalization could change and specific laws and policies affecting foreign investment currency exchange rates and other matters affecting investment in india could change as well while we expect any new government to continue the liberalization of indias economic and financial sectors and deregulation policies there can be no assurance that such policies will be continued the government of india has traditionally exercised and continues to exercise influence over many aspects of the economy our business and the market price and liquidity of our adss shares and rights may be affected   s table of contents by interest rates changes in policy taxation social and civil unrest and other political economic or other developments in or affecting india a change in the government of indias economic liberalization and deregulation policies could disrupt business and economic conditions in india generally and specifically those of our company as a substantial portion of our assets are located in india and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations terrorist attacks civil disturbances regional conflicts and other acts of violence particularly in india may disrupt or otherwise adversely affect the markets in which we operate our business and our profitability india has from time to time experienced social and civil unrest and hostilities including terrorist attacks and riots and armed conflict with neighboring countries events of this nature in the future could influence the indian economy and could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as the market for securities of indian companies including our adss shares and rights rights of shareholders under indian law may be more limited than under the laws of other jurisdictions our articles of association which include regulations applicable to our board of directors and indian law govern our corporate affairs legal principles relating to these matters and the validity of corporate procedures directors fiduciary duties and liabilities and shareholders rights may differ from those that would apply to a company incorporated in another jurisdiction shareholders rights under indian law may not be as extensive as shareholders rights under the laws of other countries or jurisdictions including the united states you may also have more difficulty in asserting your rights as a shareholder of our company than you would as a shareholder of a corporation organized in another jurisdiction the market value of your investment may fluctuate due to the volatility of the indian securities market the indian stock exchanges have in the past experienced substantial fluctuations in the prices of their listed securities the indian stock exchanges including the bse have experienced problems that if they continue or recur could affect the market price and liquidity of the securities of indian companies including the shares these problems have included temporary exchange closures broker defaults settlement delays and strikes by brokers in addition the governing bodies of the indian stock exchanges have from time to time imposed restrictions on trading in certain securities limitations on price movements and margin requirements furthermore from time to time disputes have occurred between listed companies and stock exchanges and other regulatory bodies which in some cases may have had a negative effect on market sentiment there may be a differing level of regulation and monitoring of the indian securities markets and the activities of investors brokers and other participants than in the united states sebi received statutory powers in  to assist it in carrying out its responsibility for improving disclosure and other regulatory standards for the indian securities markets subsequently sebi has prescribed regulations and guidelines in relation to disclosure requirements insider dealing and other matters relevant to the indian securities market there may however be less publicly available information about indian companies than is regularly made available by public companies in the united states investors may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us or our management we are a limited liability company incorporated in india the majority of our directors and executive officers are residents of india and substantially all of our assets and the assets of those persons are located in india as a result it may not be possible for you to effect service of process within the united states upon those persons or us in addition you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in courts of the united states against those persons outside the jurisdiction of their residence including judgments predicated solely upon us federal securities laws moreover it is unlikely that a court in india would award damages on the same basis as a   s table of contents foreign court if an action were brought in india or that an indian court would enforce foreign judgments if it viewed the amount of damages as excessive or inconsistent with public policy section a of the indian code of civil procedure  as amended or the civil code provides that where a foreign judgment has been rendered by a superior court within the meaning of the section in any country or territory outside of india which the government of india has by notification declared to be a reciprocating territory such foreign judgment may be enforced in india by proceedings in execution as if the judgment had been rendered by an appropriate court in india however the enforceability of such judgments is subject to the exceptions set forth in section  of the civil code section a of the civil code is applicable only to monetary decrees not being in the nature of amounts payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a similar nature or in respect of fines or other penalties and does not include arbitration awards if a judgment of a foreign court is not enforceable under section a of the civil code as described above it may be enforced in india only by a suit filed upon the judgment subject to section  of the civil code and not by proceedings in execution accordingly as the united states has not been declared by the government of india to be a reciprocating territory for the purposes of section a a judgment rendered by a court in the united states may not be enforced in india except by way of a suit filed upon the judgment the suit must be brought in india within three years from the date of the judgment in the same manner as any other suit filed to enforce a civil liability in india generally there are considerable delays in the disposition of suits by indian courts a party seeking to enforce a foreign judgment in india is required to obtain prior approval from the rbi under fema to repatriate any amount recovered pursuant to such enforcement any judgment in a foreign currency would be converted into indian rupees on the date of judgment and not on the date of payment see enforcement of civil liabilities in the base prospectus for further details we may be affected by competition law in india and any adverse application or interpretation of the indian competition act could adversely affect our business the indian competition act regulates practices having an appreciable adverse effect on competition in the relevant market in india under the indian competition act any formal or informal arrangement understanding or action in concert which causes or is likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition is considered void and results in imposition of substantial penalties furthermore any agreement among competitors which directly or indirectly involves determination of purchase or sale prices limits or controls production shares the market by way of geographical area or number of subscribers in the relevant market or directly or indirectly results in bidrigging or collusive bidding is presumed to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in the relevant market in india and is considered void the indian competition act also prohibits abuse of a dominant position by any enterprise on march   the government of india issued and brought into force the combination regulation merger control provisions under the indian competition act with effect from june   these provisions require acquisitions of shares voting rights assets or control or mergers or amalgamations that cross the prescribed asset and turnover based thresholds to be mandatorily notified to and preapproved by the competition commission of india in addition on may   the cci issued competition commission of india procedure for transaction of business relating to combinations regulations  as amended which sets out the mechanism for implementation of the merger control regime in india the indian competition act aims to among others prohibit all agreements and transactions which may have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in india consequently all agreements entered into by us   s table of contents could be within the purview of the indian competition act moreover the cci has extraterritorial powers and can investigate any agreements abusive conduct or combination occurring outside india if such agreement conduct or combination has an appreciable adverse effect on competition in india however the impact of the provisions of the indian competition act on the agreements entered into by us cannot be predicted with certainty at this stage the cci has initiated an inquiry against us and other car manufacturers collectively referred to hereinafter as the oems pursuant to an allegation that genuine spare parts of automobiles manufactured by the oems were not made freely available in the open market in india and accordingly anticompetitive practices were carried out by the oems the cci through its order dated august   held that the oems had violated the provisions of section  and section  of the indian competition act and imposed a penalty of  of the average turnover for three years we and other car manufacturers have filed a writ petition before the delhi high court challenging the constitutional validity of section  and b of the indian competition act under which the order was passed and penalty imposed and the matter is currently pending before the delhi high court however we cannot assure you that we will succeed in our petition if we are affected directly or indirectly by the application or interpretation of any provision of the indian competition act or any enforcement proceedings initiated by the competition commission of india or any adverse publicity that may be generated due to scrutiny or prosecution by the competition commission of india or if any prohibition or substantial penalties are levied under the indian competition act it would materially and materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition we will be required to prepare financial statements under indas which is indias convergence to ifrs the transition to indas in india is very recent and there is no clarity on the impact of such transition on our company we currently prepare annual and interim financial statements under indian gaap we will be required to prepare annual and interim financial statements under indian accounting standard  firsttime adoption of indian accounting standards or indas on january   the ministry of corporate affairs government of india the mca announced the revised roadmap for the implementation of indas and on february   released the companies indian accounting standards rules  to be published in the gazette of india which will come into effect from april  there is not yet a significant body of established practice on which to draw informing judgments regarding its implementation and application additionally indas differs in certain respects from ifrs and therefore financial statements prepared under indas may be substantially different from financial statements prepared under ifrs there can be no assurance that our financial condition results of operation cash flow or changes in shareholders equity will not be presented differently under indas than under indian gaap or ifrs when we adopt indas reporting we may encounter difficulties in the ongoing process of implementing and enhancing our management information systems there can be no assurance that the adoption of indas will not adversely affect our financial conditions or results of operations risks associated with our shares adss and the rights fluctuations in the exchange rate between the indian rupee and the us dollar may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our adss and shares fluctuations in the exchange rate between the indian rupee and the us dollar will affect among others things the us dollar equivalents of the price of the shares in indian rupees as quoted on the indian stock exchanges and as a result may affect the market price of the adss and the rights these fluctuations will also affect the us dollar equivalent of any cash dividends in indian rupees received on the shares represented by the adss and the dollar equivalent of the proceeds in indian rupee of a sale of shares in india   s table of contents in particular the indian rupee has declined significantly relative to the us dollar in recent years as of august   the value of the indian rupee against the us dollar was rs   us following a depreciation of approximately  as compared to rs  us  on may   based on the exchange rate for indian rupees

exercise those rights although ads holders have a right to receive any dividends declared in respect of the shares underlying the adss they cannot exercise voting or other direct rights as a shareholder with respect to the shares underlying the adss citibank na as depositary is the registered shareholder of the deposited shares underlying our adss and only citibank na may exercise the rights of shareholders in connection with the deposited shares the depositary will notify ads holders of upcoming votes and arrange to deliver our voting materials to ads holders only if requested by us the depositary will try in so far as practicable subject to indian laws and the provisions of our articles of association to vote or have its agents vote the deposited securities as instructed by the ads holders if the depositary receives voting instructions in time from a ads holders which fail to specify the manner in which the depositary is to vote the shares underlying such ads holders adss such ads holder will be deemed to have instructed the depositary to vote in favor of the items set forth in such voting instructions if the depositary has not received timely instructions from an ads holder such ads holder shall be deemed to have instructed the depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by us subject to the conditions set forth in the deposit agreement if requested by us the depositary is required to represent all shares underlying adss regardless whether timely instructions have been received from such ads holders for the sole purpose of establishing a quorum at a meeting of shareholders in addition in your capacity as an ads holder you will not be able to examine our accounting books and records or exercise appraisal rights registered holders of our shares withdrawn from the depositary arrangements will be entitled to vote and exercise other direct shareholder rights in accordance with indian law however a holder may not know about a meeting sufficiently in advance to withdraw the underlying shares in time furthermore an ads holder may not receive voting materials if we do not instruct the depositary to distribute such materials or may not receive such voting materials in time to instruct the depositary to vote see description of american depositary shares in the accompanying base prospectus for more information on the terms and conditions of the deposit agreement moreover pursuant to indian regulations we are required to offer our shareholders preemptive rights to subscribe for a proportionate number of shares to maintain their existing ownership percentages prior to the issue of new shares these rights may be waived by a resolution passed by at least  of our shareholders present and voting at a general meeting ads holders may be unable to exercise preemptive rights for subscribing to these new shares unless a registration statement under the securities act is effective or an exemption from the registration requirements is available to us our decision to file a registration statement would be based on the costs timing potential liabilities and the perceived benefits associated with any such registration statement and we do not commit that we would file such a registration statement if any issue of securities is made to our shareholders in the future such securities may also be issued to the depositary which may sell such securities in the indian securities market for the benefit of the holders of adss there can be no assurance as to the value if any the depositary would receive upon the sale of such rights or securities to the extent that ads holders are unable to exercise preemptive rights their proportionate interest our company would be reduced the government of indias regulation of foreign ownership could materially reduce the price of the adss foreign ownership of indian securities is regulated and is partially restricted in addition there are restrictions on the deposit of shares into our ads facilities adss issued by companies in certain emerging markets including india may trade at a discount to the underlying equity shares in part because of the restrictions on foreign ownership of the underlying equity shares and in part because adss are sometimes   s table of contents perceived to offer less liquidity than underlying shares that can be traded freely in local markets by both local and international investors see restrictions regarding foreign investment in india in the accompanying base prospectus for more information regarding restrictions on foreign investment under indian laws rules and regulations there are restrictions on daily movements in the price of the shares which may constrain a shareholders ability to sell or the price at which a shareholder can sell shares at a particular point in time the shares are subject to a daily circuit breaker imposed by stock exchanges in india on publiclylisted companies including us which does not allow transactions causing volatility in the price of the shares above a certain threshold this circuit breaker operates independently from the indexbased marketwide circuit breakers generally imposed by sebi on indian stock exchanges the percentage limit on our circuit breaker is set by the indian stock exchanges based on the historical volatility in the price and trading volume of our shares the indian stock exchanges are not required to inform us of the percentage limit of the circuit breaker from time to time and may change it without our knowledge this circuit breaker effectively acts to limit the upward and downward movements in the price of our shares as a result of this circuit breaker we cannot make any assurance regarding the ability of our shareholders to sell their shares or the price at which such shareholders may be able to sell their shares you may be subject to indian taxes arising out of capital gains on the sale of the shares capital gains arising from the sale of shares are generally taxable in india any gain realized on the sale of the shares on an indian stock exchange held for more than  months will not be subject to capital gains tax in india if the securities transaction tax has been paid on the transaction the securities transaction tax will be levied on and collected by the indian stock exchange on which the shares are sold any gain realized on the sale of shares held for more than  months on which no securities transaction tax has been paid will be subject to capital gains tax in india furthermore any gain realized on the sale of the shares held for a period of  months or less will be subject to capital gains tax in india see taxationtaxation of capital gains and lossesindian taxation in the accompanying base prospectus for more information regarding the indian taxation of capital gains arising from the sale of shares it is unclear as to whether capital gains derived from the sale of rights by a nonresident of india not entitled to exemption under a tax treaty to another nonresident of india taking place outside india will be subject to indian capital gains tax if the rights are deemed by the indian tax authorities to be situated within india the gains realized on the sale of rights will be subject to indian taxation the rights would generally be in the nature of shortterm capital assets for determining such capital gains derived from the sale of rights the cost of acquisition of the rights to acquire shares and adss shall be  risks related to the rights offering the market prices of our adss rights and shares may fluctuate significantly the market prices of the adss the rights and the shares could be subject to significant fluctuations due to a change in sentiment in the market regarding these securities andor securities of other automotive manufacturers the fluctuations could result from national and global economic and financial conditions the markets response to the rights offering market perceptions of us and various other factors and events including regulatory changes affecting out operations variations in our operating results business developments relating to our company or competitors and liquidity of financial markets stock markets experience from time to time significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the adss the ordinary shares and the a ordinary shares furthermore the operating results and prospects of our company may from time to time be below the expectations of market analysts and investors any of these events could result in a significant decline in the market price of the adss the rights and the shares   s table of contents an active trading market in the rights may not develop the ads rights are expected to be traded on the nyse while the ordinary share rights and a ordinary share rights are expected to be traded on a specialized window of the bse and the nse during the rights trading periods we do not intend to apply for admission of any of these rights to trading on any other stock exchange an active trading market in the ads rights may not develop on the nyse and an active trading market in the ordinary share rights or the a ordinary share rights may not develop on the bse and nse the ordinary share rights or a ordinary share rights can be renounced on the floor of bse and nse however the same is subject to rbi approval see the rights offeringsubscription by holders of ordinary share rights and a ordinary share rightsrenunciation there is no assurance that sufficient liquidity will be available in the relevant rights in addition because the trading price of the rights depends on the trading price of the underlying adss ordinary shares and a ordinary shares the prices of the rights may be volatile and subject to the same risks as noted in this prospectus supplement there is no certainty that the listing and admission to trading of the new ordinary shares and new a ordinary shares or that the issuance of the new adss will occur when we expect or at all we cannot assure you that the listing and admission to trading of the ordinary shares and the a ordinary shares will take place when anticipated or at all until the ordinary shares including ordinary shares underlying the new adss are admitted to trading on the bse and nse as applicable you will not be issued any new adss for which you have subscribed shareholders who do not acquire their full entitlement of new adss new ordinary shares and new a ordinary shares in the rights offering will experience dilution in their ownership of the company if you do not take up the offer of new adss new ordinary shares and new a ordinary shares in the rights offering your proportionate ownership and voting interests in our company will be reduced and the percentage that your existing shares and adss represent of our total share capital will be reduced accordingly even if an existing holder of rights elects to sell its unexercised rights or such rights are sold on its behalf the consideration it receives for them may not be sufficient to compensate such holder fully for the dilution of its percentage ownership of our share capital that may be caused as a result of the rights offering see dilution for more information holders in certain jurisdictions may not be eligible to participate in the rights offering and will experience dilution of their interest in the company due to the restrictions under the securities laws of certain countries shareholders or ads holders resident in such countries may not be able to exercise rights for registered holders of adss in these excluded jurisdictions the ads rights agent will sell the ads rights on behalf of such holders and will distribute the cash proceeds from the sale of the ads rights net of applicable fees taxes and expenses to which such holders would otherwise have been entitled there is no assurance that the ads rights agent will be able to sell the ads rights at a price which would reflect the difference between the fair market value of the adss and their subscription price in the rights offering or at all holders of ordinary share rights and a ordinary share rights in these jurisdictions will not be able to exercise their rights and their rights will lapse without receipt of any consideration or compensation holders that do not take up the offer of new adss new ordinary shares and new a ordinary shares in the rights offering will experience a reduction in their proportionate ownership and voting interests in the company see dilution for more information   s table of contents any future issues of shares will further dilute the holdings of current ads holders of the company and shareholders and could materially and adversely affect the market price of the companys adss ordinary shares and a ordinary shares we may decide to offer additional shares in the future either to raise capital or for other purposes if ads holders and shareholders were not to take up such offer of shares or were not eligible to participate in such offering their proportionate ownership and voting interests in the company would be reduced and the percentage that their adss or shares as applicable would represent of the total share capital of the company would be reduced accordingly an additional offering or significant sales of shares by major shareholders could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the adss and the shares holders of adss are subject to exchange rate risk in connection with the rights offering in the event that the us dollar weakens against the indian rupee holders of adss subscribing for new adss will be required to pay more than the estimated subscription price of us per new ads the estimated ads subscription price is us per new ads as each ads represents five ordinary shares the estimated subscription price per ads is five times the us dollar equivalent of the ordinary share subscription price using an exchange rate of rs   us the opening exchange rate as published by bloomberg lp at  am new york city time on march    a subscriber of new adss must deposit us per offered ads subscribed which represents  of the estimated ads subscription price this is to increase the likelihood that the ads rights agent will have sufficient funds to pay the actual ads subscription price in light of a possible appreciation of indian rupees against the us dollar between the date hereof and the end of the ads rights exercise period and to pay currency conversion fees as well as the ads depositary issuance fee of us per new ads issued on or about april   we expect to determine the actual us dollar ads subscription price by converting the ordinary share subscription price for the offered ordinary shares underlying the adss subscribed for from indian rupees into us dollars at a marketbased rate if the actual us dollar subscription price plus the ads issuance fee and the currency conversion fees is less than the deposit amount the ads rights agent will refund such excess amount to the subscribing ads holder without interest however if there is a deficiency as a result of such conversion the ads rights agent will not deliver the offered adss to such subscribing ads holder until it has received payment of the deficiency the ads rights agent may sell a portion of your new adss to cover the deficiency if not paid within  days from notice of deficiency furthermore the conversion of indian rupees back into us dollars if the condition of the rights offering is not satisfied and as a result the indian rupee subscription amount is returned to the ads rights agent may give rise to losses due to exchange rate fluctuation if the rights offering does not take place our credit ratings and funding costs could be materially and adversely affected and the price of our securities could drop sharply in either case the rights could become worthless the rights offering is underwritten by the underwriters based on an underwriting agreement from which the underwriters may withdraw under certain circumstances see the rights offeringsubscription by holders of ordinary share rights and a ordinary share rightswithdrawal of the offering and plan of distribution if the underwriting agreement is terminated the rights offering may be cancelled and we would not receive the net proceeds expected to be generated by the rights offering in addition if the rights offering is cancelled the rights will expire without compensation and become worthless any subscription payments received by us will be returned without interest investors who have acquired any rights on the secondary market will then bear a corresponding loss because trading in rights cannot be reversed if the rights offering is terminated moreover the value of the rights materially depends on the price of the companys existing ordinary shares a ordinary shares and adss a considerable drop in the price of these securities can therefore materially and adversely affect the value of the rights and render them worthless in such an event investors who have acquired any rights in the secondary market will bear a corresponding loss   s table of contents the price of our adss and shares may fluctuate or decline before or after the expiration of the ads rights and may fall below the ads subscription price of the new adss issued upon the exercise of the ads rights given that the trading price of the ads rights depends on the price of our adss and our shares a significant decline in the trading price of our adss or our shares would negatively affect the trading price of the ads rights the market price of our adss and our shares could be subject to significant fluctuations we cannot assure holders of ads rights that the trading price of our adss will not decline below the actual ads subscription price after such holders elect to exercise their ads rights if that occurs such holders will have committed to purchase the new adss at a price above the prevailing trading price and such holders will suffer an immediate unrealized loss as a result moreover we cannot assure holders of ads rights that following the exercise of ads rights they will be able to sell their adss at a price equal to or greater than the actual ads subscription price a delay in the listing of the new shares would affect the liquidity of such new shares and the issuance of new adss representing such new shares we will request that the new shares be admitted to trading on the bse and the nse promptly after their allotment which is expected to take place on or about may   we expect but cannot assure you that the new shares will be admitted to listing on the bse and the nse on or about may   a delay in the admission to listing of the new shares would affect the liquidity of the new shares and prevent the sale of such shares on the bse or the nse until they are allowed for listing in addition any delay in the admission to listing of the new shares will delay the issuance of the new adss representing such shares given these possible delays we cannot provide any assurance that the new adss will be issued promptly after the allotment of the new shares any delay in the allotment of the new shares and their admission to listing in the bse or the nse or in the issuance of the new adss will affect the ability of the exercising holders of rights to sell the new shares or adss to be received upon the exercise of rights   s table of contents use of proceeds assuming all of the new ordinary shares and a ordinary shares sold in the rights offering are subscribed for at the subscription price of rs per new ordinary share and rs per a ordinary share the net proceeds of the rights offering are expected to be approximately rs million approximately us million after deduction of fees and expenses of approximately rs million approximately us million the objects set out in the memorandum of association enable us to undertake our existing activities and the activities for which the funds are being raised through the rights offering requirement of funds and utilization of net proceeds the proposed utilization of the net proceeds is set forth in the table below   particulars    amount

propose to deploy the net proceeds in the manner described above in fiscal  if the net proceeds are not completely utilized for the objects stated above by the end of fiscal  due to factors such as i economic and business conditions ii increased competition iii commercial considerations iv change in business strategy and v regulatory changes such proceeds would be utilized in part or full in fiscal  or a subsequent period as may be determined by us in accordance with applicable law the funds deployment other than for repayment of certain of our borrowings described herein is based on management estimates current circumstances of our business and the prevailing market conditions the funds deployment described herein has not been appraised by any bank or financial institution we have not placed orders or obtained quotations in respect of a substantial portion of the fund requirements described in this section we may have to revise our funding requirements and deployment on account of a variety of factors such as our financial condition business and strategy including external factors which may not be within the control of our management this may entail rescheduling and revising the planned funding requirements and deployment and increasing or decreasing the funding requirements from the planned funding requirements at the discretion of our management we propose to meet the entire requirement of funds for the objects of the rights offering from the net proceeds of the rights offering funding capital expenditure towards plant and machinery we undertake investments towards capital expenditure on a continual basis to meet our business requirements and towards new product introduction sustenance increasing efficiency modernization and removing production constraints in addition to domestic suppliers and vendors we also import capital equipment raw materials and components from suppliers and vendors in various countries   s table of contents our capital expenditure typically includes expenses for purchase of plant and machinery tools and other equipments installation and commissioning expenses expenses for purchase of vehicles civil construction fitout and consultancy related expenses for our workshops and offices and expenses for purchase of computers funding expenditure relating to research and product development we intend to continue to invest in our business units in general and in research and product development in particular over the next several years in order to improve our existing product range develop new products and platforms and to build and expand our portfolio in the passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle categories we believe this would strengthen our position in the indian automotive market and help us to grow our market share internationally expenses towards research and product development consists of material costs which include cost of material used for i prototype vehicles ii pilot batch and product proving vehicles and iii benchmarking vehicles prototype vehicles are used for performing all tests such as durability fuel economy reliability endurance and crash tests that are required to assess performance of the vehicle pilot batch includes a small lot of vehicles rolled out for identifying manufacturing issues if any which uses soft tools pilot batch is followed by product proving vehicles which is a larger lot of vehicles for verifying other parameters related to production process including tact time cycle time quality and consistency rd expenses also consist of technical knowhow expenses which include costs incurred towards various external agencies who provide technical inputs and research and development support in specialized fields in addition to technical support certain agencies provide finished components to us as part of their mandate once the regular production commences technical knowhow expenses also include costs associated with such finished components provided by the external agencies in addition to the technical support in addition to the above rd expenses also consist of conversion costs which include expenses incurred towards the design engineers in the engineering research center the table below sets forth estimated expenses based on category of vehicle        amount        rs millions      us millions   commercial

availed by us we estimate that rs billion approximately us million from the net proceeds of the rights offering will be used towards repayment in full or in part of certain loans the selection and extent of loans   s table of contents proposed to be repaid while based on the applicable repayment schedule in fiscal  is also and will be based on various commercial considerations including among others interest rates outstanding amounts and the remaining tenor of the loan and applicable law governing such borrowings among the borrowings that we expect to repay are rs billion approximately us million due to the state bank of india under a working capital facility and commercial papers issued in  and an aggregate of rs billion approximately us million representing the amount outstanding under commercial papers issued by and short term loan arrangements with hdfc bank limited and hdfc trustee company private limited given the nature of these borrowings and the terms of repayment the aggregate outstanding loan amounts may vary from time to time in addition to the above we may from time to time enter into further financing arrangements and draw down funds thereunder in such cases or in case any loans are repaid or further drawndown prior to the completion of the rights offering we may utilize this component of the net proceeds towards repayment of such additional indebtedness the net proceeds may also be utilized for repayment of any such further borrowings and refinancing subject to the maximum utilization of rs billion we believe that such repayment will help reduce our outstanding indebtedness debt servicing costs and debtequity ratio thereby resulting in an enhanced equity base assisting us in maintaining a favorable debtequity ratio in the near future and enable utilization of our accruals for further investment in our business growth and expansion in addition we believe that this would improve our ability to raise further resources in the future to fund our potential business development opportunities general corporate purposes we propose to deploy the remaining net proceeds aggregating rs million towards general corporate purposes subject to such utilization not exceeding  of the net proceeds in compliance with sebi regulations including but not limited to strategic initiatives partnerships and joint ventures meeting exigencies which we may face in the ordinary course of business meeting expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business and any other purpose as may be approved by our board of directors or a duly appointed committee from time to time subject to compliance with the necessary provisions of the companies act our management in accordance with the policies of our board of directors will have flexibility in utilizing

enforcement of civil liabilities we are a limited liability company incorporated in india the majority of our directors and executive officers are residents of india and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these directors and executive officers is located in india as a result it may not be possible for you to effect service of process within the united states upon those persons or us in addition you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in courts of the united states against those persons outside the jurisdiction of their residence including judgments predicated solely upon us federal securities laws moreover it is unlikely that a court in india would award damages on the same basis as a foreign court if an action were brought in india or that an indian court would enforce foreign judgments if it viewed the amount of damages as excessive or inconsistent with public policy section a of the indian code of civil procedure  as amended or the civil code provides that where a foreign judgment has been rendered by a superior court within the meaning of the section in any country or territory outside of india which the government of india has by notification declared to be a reciprocating territory such foreign judgment may be enforced in india by proceedings in execution as if the judgment had been rendered by an appropriate court in india however the enforceability of such judgments is subject to the exceptions set forth in section  of the civil code this section which is the statutory basis for the recognition of foreign judgments states that a foreign judgment is conclusive as to any matter directly adjudicated upon except        where the judgment has not been pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction        where the judgment has not been given on the merits of the case        where the judgment appears on the face of the proceedings to be founded on an incorrect view of international law or a refusal to recognize the law of india in cases where such law is applicable        where the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained were opposed to natural justice        where the judgment has been obtained by fraud or        where the judgment sustains a claim founded on a breach of any law in force in india section a of the civil code is applicable only to monetary decrees not being in the nature of amounts payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a similar nature or in respect of fines or other penalties and does not include arbitration awards if a judgment of a foreign court is not enforceable under section a of the civil code as described above it may be enforced in india only by a suit filed upon the judgment subject to section  of the civil code and not by proceedings in execution accordingly as the united states has not been declared by the government of india to be a reciprocating territory for the purposes of section a a judgment rendered by a court in the united states may not be enforced in india except by way of a suit filed upon the judgment the suit must be brought in india within three years from the date of the judgment in the same manner as any other suit filed to enforce a civil liability in india generally there are considerable delays in the disposition of suits by indian courts a party seeking to enforce a foreign judgment in india is required to obtain prior approval from the rbi under fema to repatriate any amount recovered pursuant to such enforcement any judgment in a foreign currency would be converted into indian rupees on the date of judgment and not on the date of payment    table of contents no dealer salesperson or other person is authorized to give any information or to represent anything not contained in this prospectus you must not

change through our innovation research and development jaguar land rover will shape that change future success will be based on a continuous process of anticipating new market trends as we look ahead we are guided by our strategic plan as well as our proprietary scenariomapping tools that identify the biggest and fastestgrowing opportunities progressing the industry we will stay ahead of the market by focusing on the innovation design and creativity that our customers love complexity and uncertainty tighter fuel economy regulations around the world and the requirement for more safety related features to be included as standard on new models will increase the level of complexity for the sector the speed of adoption of new technologies will depend on the interaction between consumer demand and regulation leading to greater uncertainty what this means for us we are the leaders in lightweighting and aerodynamic dragreducing technologies as well as investing substantially in advanced innovation and alternative powertrains our latest range of vehicles all meet the highest safety standards we are also pioneering collaborative projects with partners to answer the challenges of the evolving landscape the new city segment as cities across the globe adopt their own regulation the city type will become the new indicator for mobility behaviour that will determine the speed and scope of the automotive revolution for example by  the car market in new york will likely have much more in common with the market in shanghai than with that of kansas this trend looks set to

the emergence of a market for intelligent mobility solutions customers today use their cars as allpurpose vehicles whether they are commuting alone to work or taking the family on holiday to the mountains in the future they may want the flexibility to choose the best solution for a specific purpose what this means for us the traditional business model of car sales will be complemented by a range of diverse ondemand mobility solutions especially in dense urban environments to answer this new trend we have launched inmotion an exciting new technology business that will create apps and ondemand services to provide solutions to modern travel and transport challenges customer experience alongside the demand for greater connectivity consumers are increasingly using digital sources in making their purchase decisions potential car buyers can already access a tremendous amount of information from the internet with digital only increasing in importance in the future retailers are expected to remain important in the overall purchasing journey but less so in the research comparison stages what this means for us an accessible and innovative web presence is critical alongside new retail concepts that offer a premium and personalised brand experience jaguar land rover and our retailers will offer more convenient proactive services alerting drivers to upcoming maintenance and product updates we are also increasingly aligning our processes to address new challenges like cybersecurity and data privacy customer loyalty with increased access to information and crossbrand price comparison behaviour consumers flit between brands and products in their search for value and novelty inspiring consumer loyalty is increasingly testing the impact of new challenger brands from other sectors is also putting pressure on traditional automotive players what this means for us value hunting does not necessarily mean the best price agnostic consumers are intrigued by innovation and will still pay a premium for quality personal and inspirational experiences jaguar land rovers focus on innovation technology and premium quality lifestyle experiences delivered through customer first initiatives is tackling this challenge head on new competition with new entrants into the automotive market  from mobility providers tech giants and speciality oems  the competitive market is set to further increase in complexity within the next few years the market may well expect production versions of experimental cars to be developed by new entrants such as apple and google to further challenge established automotive brands what this means for us being agile and innovative through the development of new technologies powertrains and platforms like inmotion jaguar land

compromise or enhance our ability to achieve our objectives or impact our reputation the risks identified may also present growth opportunities we recognise that risk is inherent in all business activities and must be balanced when assessing returns successful management of these risks is therefore key to accomplishing our strategic objectives and the longterm sustainable growth of our business enterprise risk management is used as a tool to identify assess control and continually monitor key risks that could affect our business objectives risk management to achieve an informed understanding of our tolerance for risk when delivering our overall business plan we must be mindful that the goal of risk management is not to eliminate risk but to ensure that the risks that we do accept remain within a predetermined level of acceptability whilst pursuing valueenhancing opportunities we also recognise that a healthy and responsible risk management framework does not encourage overspeculation but it should not default to promote excess conservatism either the ultimate goal of risk management within jaguar land rover is to build resilience against any internal or external

preserve our values and maintain resilience the erm framework helps us to identify new and evolving risks and opportunities so that we can understand and manage risks that may materially impact our business objectives the erm framework is also an effective communication tool used by senior management to monitor and gain consensus on how to manage the principal risks to the business increasing the likelihood of successful mitigation andor identifying opportunities the environment in which we operate is dynamic as are the risks we face we plan for certain known changes to the industry and

land rover may be subject to other risks not specifically outlined in this annual report risk driver potential consequences mitigating these risks strategic risks  global economic and geopolitical environment our expanding global presence increases our exposure to global economic and geopolitical risks and external factors such as the recent uk referendum to leave the eu political instability wars terrorism natural disasters fuel shortages epidemics and labour strikes which may impact our operations uncertainty from inconsistencies and ambiguity in economic and government policies as well as commercial employment practices may also impact our business we derive a significant proportion of our revenues from china north america and continental europe as well as domestic sales in the uk therefore we are exposed to potential fluctuations in the demand for our vehicles and disruption to our supply chain driven by global and geopolitical shocks which may have a direct impact on sales volumes and our financial results we aim to avoid an overreliance on any one market by continuing to expand our international presence ie manufacturing in slovakia and austria and maintain a balanced sales portfolio of circa  per cent of retail volume from each key region we recognise the risks inherent in increasing sales to new markets and we factor such risk into our business planning process we continue to closely monitor geopolitical and wider global economic developments and we will be closely monitoring developments following the uk referendum to leave the eu  brand positioning building on the strength of our two world renowned brands is imperative to current and future success brand positioning is becoming increasingly challenging as the wider automotive market and digital environment develops where new competitors are emerging and existing competitors are evolving our inability to successfully position and maintain brand strength in the future could impact customer demand for our products failing to meet customer preferences develop new products in line with market trends or suffering delayed products launches could drive existing and potential customers to choose competitor products recent successful model launches have broadened our product offering to existing and new customers in existing and new segments furthermore we also regularly monitor brand health to quickly identify risks andor opportunities that may arise as well as supporting initiatives designed to manage residual values  global expansion as our international sales and manufacturing footprint increases we become increasingly exposed to such external factors as geopolitical risks natural disasters epidemics inconsistency and ambiguity of economic and governmental policies the interpretation of local laws and regulations and taxation systems as a consequence of these external factors our sales and production operations could be subject to various forms of disruption resulting in a reduction of salesproduction volumes or losses which could materially impact our financial results and ultimately could impact on our ability to fund future investment we currently have a balanced sales profile with the five key sales regions each accounting for circa  per cent of retail volumes we continue to expand our international manufacturing base to complement our international sales profile and closely monitor geopolitical and wider global economic developments operational risks  product liability and recalls increased risk focus in fiscal  we are subject to risks associated with product liability and recalls affecting our products this may cause existing and potential customers to question the quality of jaguar land rover products the negative reputational ramifications of which could be exacerbated through social and other media operational anomalies that impact quality are likely to drive higher incidence of product recalls and an increase in related costs as well as warranty claims in addition our reputation could be adversely impacted and we could be the subject of class actions or other largescale product liability andor other lawsuits as a consequence we regularly monitor the service data of our vehicles via our global dealer network and take appropriate actions to manage recalls and minimise warranty claims the company also issues technical updates to the dealer network to provide awareness of known vehicle faults in line with general industry practices  distribution channels our products are sold and serviced through a network of authorised dealers service centres and distributors in markets around the world we maintain strong relationships with our sales network to ensure that a consistent high quality of customer service is maintained however there is a risk that our customer service could deteriorate our sales network is key to our success therefore any factors that impact those relationships or any underperformance from our sales network could impact sales volumes and our business results if customer service and customer experience falls short of expectations future sales and customer retention could be impacted we monitor the performance of our dealers and distributors and provide them with support to ensure a high quality of service is maintained in line with our and customers expectations we also maintain a customerfirst approach in conjunction with our dealers and other distribution channels table of contents click to enlarge overview ifc strategic report  governance  financial statements ibc  risk driver potential consequences mitigating these risks legal risks  environmental regulations and compliance we are subject to numerous laws regulations and policies covering environmental aspects related to our vehicles and production facilities including greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy and this regulatory environment is constantly changing exacerbating the risks we face in addition a number of our production facilities also require permits andor licences to continue to operate we may incur additional investment spending to upgrade products and manufacturing facilities as well as increased running costs to comply with policies and regulations to avoid facing significant civil penalties price pressures may also increase as various jurisdictions adopt fuel consumption or co based vehicle taxation systems and our competitors may gain a competitive advantage by adopting new emissions and fuel efficient technologies before we do we have invested substantially in lightweight architecture developed a family of efficient fourcylinder engines and we continue to develop electrification technologies with plans to deploy plugin hybrid and battery electric vehicles in future we also retain an eu derogation permitting more lenient fleet average co targets under a certain sales threshold and we also hold iso  certification the international standard for environmental management systems  patent and ip intellectual property protection increased risk focus in fiscal  new product launches and substantial investment in rd to support the development of new products has resulted in higher accumulation of intellectual property that may be desirable to other organisations and we may be vulnerable to a breach of intellectual property ie patents copyright designs  trademarks if we are unable to protect our intellectual property a material breach occurs or if we are restricted from using intellectual property obtained from others there could be an adverse effect on our operations in addition we could be held legally liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others in the development manufacture and sale of our products we own by way of patents and trademarks or otherwise the legal rights in respect of a number of patents copyrights industrial designs trademarks and other intellectual property relating to the design and manufacture furthermore we have a dedicated team of inhouse specialists that manage matters relating to intellectual property  unethical and prohibited business practices the accelerated growth of our business has resulted in the expansion of our operations overseas increasing the complexity of the legal environments under which we operate as we expand our international footprint we will become more exposed to the potential risks associated with different ethical standards and cultural norms noncompliance with ethical andor legal practices may materially impact our reputation and could result in restrictions being placed on our operations ie licences withheld as well as regulatory investigations that could cause business disruption and potentially lead to the imposition of fines to mitigate unethical and illegal behaviour we have a number of policies relating to antibriberycorruption and whistleblowing as well as sanctions and export controls our code of conduct and comprehensive training programmes support these policies and employees are required to certify their compliance on an annual basis financial risks  competitive business efficiency jaguar land rover has initiated programmes to optimise operating efficiency in response to the dynamic external environment including existing and emerging competitive challenges however there is a risk that these programmes do not deliver projected efficiencies and anticipated benefits may not accrue as expected if we are unable to deliver the desired benefits from the planned efficiency programmes our business results may be adversely impacted furthermore jaguar land rovers ability to compete successfully over the longer term and sustain profitable growth may be affected jaguar land rover has launched certain initiatives to reduce product and business complexity we have robust project management processes in place to continually track progress against set targets and to address any issues that may arise immediately complemented by external consultation as required  exchange rate fluctuations approximately  per cent of our revenue is derived from sales outside of the united kingdom and we source a significant proportion of our components from suppliers in the eurozone however our reporting currency is pounds sterling this drives significant exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency notably sales denominated in us dollars and chinese renminbi as well as costs denominated in euro generally a relatively stronger pound sterling could adversely impact earnings as the value of overseas sales is eroded longerterm strategic translation and economic currency risk exists where there is a structural misalignment in the denomination of costs and revenues which exposes the company to longerterm foreign exchange trends beyond our currency hedging programme we manage transaction risk through the use of foreign currency derivatives to hedge forecast exposures in line with the currency hedging policy approved by the board where possible we aim to align our sourcing base with our international sales profile the proportion of our debt

consider after making appropriate enquiries and taking into consideration the risks and uncertainties facing the group that the group has adequate resources to continue in operation as a going concern for the foreseeable future and is able to meet its financial covenants linked to the borrowings in place accordingly the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these

requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates it also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the groups accounting policies the areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are as follows i note   property plant and equipment  the group applies judgement in determining the estimate useful life of assets ii note   intangible assets  management applies significant judgement in establishing the applicable criteria for capitalisation of appropriate product development costs and impairment of indefinite life intangible assets the key judgements in the impairment assessment include the determination of cashgenerating units value of cash flows and appropriateness of discount rates iii note   deferred tax  management applies judgement in establishing the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets relating to historic losses assessing the recoverability of those assets and estimating taxes ultimately payable on remittance of overseas earnings iv note   provision for product warranty  it is necessary for the group to assess the provision for anticipated lifetime warranty and campaign costs the valuation of warranty and campaign provisions requires a significant amount of judgement and the requirement to form appropriate assumptions around expected future costs v note   retirement benefit obligation  it is necessary for actuarial assumptions to be made including discount and mortality rates and the longterm rate of return upon scheme assets the group engages a qualified actuary to assist with determining the assumptions to be made when evaluating these liabilities vi note   financial instruments  the group enters into complex financial instruments and therefore appropriate accounting for these requires judgement around the valuations revenue recognition revenue comprises the

transaction between market participants at the measurement date regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique in estimating the fair value of an asset or liability the group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or

assets held or quoted ask prices financial liabilities held and using valuation techniques for other instruments valuation techniques include discounted cash flow method and other valuation models derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities the group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expires or it transfers the

and continues to control the transferred asset the group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay if the group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset the group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received

loss in equity if any is transferred to the consolidated income statement impairment of financial assets the group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset other than those at fair value through profit or loss or a group of financial assets is impaired a financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset loans and receivables objective evidence of impairment includes default in payments with respect to amounts receivable from customers significant financial difficulty of the customer or bankruptcy impairment loss in respect of loans and receivables is calculated as the difference between their carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate such impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement if the amount of an impairment loss decreases in a subsequent year and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed the reversal is recognised in the consolidated income statement equity investments a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is also evidence that the assets are impaired if any such evidence exists the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value less any impairment loss on that financial

benefit schemes are administered by a trustee that is legally separated from the company the trustee of the pension schemes is required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the schemes is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the schemes and all other governance matters the board of the trustee must be composed of representatives of the company and scheme participants in accordance with each schemes regulations under the schemes the employees are entitled to postretirement benefits based on their length of service and salary through its defined benefit pension schemes the group is exposed to a number of risks the most significant of which are detailed below asset volatility the scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields if scheme assets under perform these corporate bonds this will create or increase a deficit the defined benefit schemes hold a significant proportion of equity type assets which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term although introducing volatility and risk in the short term as the schemes mature the group intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that better match the liabilities however the group believes that due to the longterm nature of the scheme liabilities and the strength of the supporting group a level of continuing equity type investments is an appropriate element of the groups longterm strategy to manage the schemes efficiently changes in bond yields a decrease in corporate bond yields will increase scheme liabilities although this is expected to be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings and interest rate hedging instruments inflation risk some of the group pension obligations are linked to infiation and higher infiation will lead to higher liabilities although in most cases caps on the level of infiationary increases are in place to protect the scheme against extreme infiation the schemes hold a significant proportion of assets in index linked gilts together with other infiation hedging instruments and also assets which are more loosely correlated with infiation however an increase in infiation will also increase the deficit to some degree life expectancy the majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the schemes liabilities this is particularly significant in the

entities do not fall within the definition of subsidiaries under indian gaap  during these periods the following significant changes were made to our accounting policies thereby affecting the financial data presented   a consequent to the accounting standard on ‘intangible assets’ as  becoming applicable expenditure on product development which was earlier classified as deferred revenue expenditure is now accounted for from april   in accordance with the said standard accordingly i product development cost including technical knowhow on new vehicle platforms variants on existing platforms and new vehicle aggregates are recognized as intangible assets and included under fixed assets there is no effect of this change on the profit for the year as the period of amortization is consistent with that followed in the previous year ii product development expenditure relating to minor product enhancement facelifts upgrades etc including cost of incomplete development amounting to rs million including rs million incurred as at march   has been charged off during the year to profit and loss account   b in fiscal  the rate of depreciation on laptop computers and cars increased from  and  to  and  respectively resulting in additional depreciation of rs million   c consequent to as  “accounting for taxes on income” issued by the institute of chartered accountants of india or icai becoming mandatory with effect from april   we have recorded the cumulative net deferred tax liability as at march   of rs million as a charge to the general reserve on april   and rs million against the accumulated profit and loss account   d in fiscal  we have with retrospective effect changed our method of accounting for finance leases in accordance with the as  “leases” issued by the icai consequent to the change the charge in fiscal  was lower by rs million including rs million in respect of previous fiscal years   e in view of the revised guidance note issued by the icai effective from the accounting period starting on or after april   which requires that provision should be made for excise duty liability in respect of bonded goods we have provided liability for excise duty and customs duty aggregating rs million payable on goods held in bond at the year end and therefore included the same in the valuation of inventories at the year end this had no effect on our profit for fiscal    f revenues in each of the years presented is net of excise duty collected from customers   g we have retroactively accounted for affiliates from april   for the purposes of this presentation  extraordinary exceptional items   a the extraordinary charge of rs million in fiscal  was comprised entirely of employee separation costs   b the extraordinary income of rs million in fiscal  represents writeback of provision for contingencies for a future trade investment made in fiscal     table of contents   c the extraordinary charge of rs million in fiscal  was comprised of provision for diminution in value of investments of rs million provision for contingencies of rs million and employee separation costs of rs million   d the extraordinary charge of rs million in fiscal  was comprised of employee separation costs of rs million and power costs relating to prior years of rs million  in fiscal  consequent to our shareholders’ approval and the order of the high court of judicature at mumbai dated may   tata motors ltd adjusted the debit balance of deferred revenue expenditure of rs million capital work in progress of rs million and diminution in the value of investment of rs million in its securities premium account the deferred tax liability of rs million created in respect thereof has been credited to its securities premium account   exchange rate

currently believe may materially affect our business the factors below should be considered in connection with any forwardlooking statements in this registration statement and the cautionary statements on page iii the risks below are not the only ones we face – some risks may be unknown to us and some risks that we do not currently believe to be material could later turn out to be material one or more of a combination of these risks could materially impact our business revenues sales net assets results of operations liquidity and capital resources   risks associated with our business   general economic conditions could significantly adversely affect our sales and results of operations   the indian automotive industry is substantially affected by general economic conditions in india in  the automotive industry witnessed a recovery in demand after declining trends for two years demand for fourwheel vehicles again declined in the period from  to late  driven by poor economic conditions in india though there has been a significant increase in demand since early  primarily due to significant growth of the gross domestic product or gdp and the construction of improved roadways in india there can be no assurance that the indian economy will not experience a downturn which may in turn significantly adversely affect our sales and results of operations one driver of demand is the level of market interest rates which impacts the cost of financing for purchasers of our products while interest rates declined steadily during the last two years there is no assurance that this trend will continue and an increase in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on demand for our products interest rates in the united states and some other countries have recently been increasing and this may lead to interest rate increases in india and other countries on the other hand decreases in market interest rates may lead to higher levels of prepayments of our loans receivable from customers as they may seek to refinance their loans elsewhere although we have not experienced significant prepayments during past periods of declining interest rates and while prepayments have not had any material adverse impact on our results of operations in the past there can be no assurance that prepayments during periods of declining interest rates will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future as we seek to expand our customer financing business   if we are unable to implement our growth strategies in a timely manner our business and results of operations could be adversely affected   we have adopted certain growth strategies including the expansion of our automotive business through upgrading of our existing products the introduction of new products and an increase in international business all these new projects involve risks and difficulties and accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete our plans on schedule or within budget if market conditions change if operations do not generate sufficient funds or for any other reason we may decide to delay modify or forego some aspects of our growth strategies our future results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to implement our growth strategies   increased competition in the indian automotive industry may adversely affect our results of operations   we face strong competition in india across our product lines from other indian and foreign automotive manufacturers competition is expected to intensify as indian automotive manufacturers obtain greater access to debt and equity financing in the international capital markets or gain access to more advanced technology through alliances foreign automotive manufacturers have increased and are expected to further increase their participation in the indian automotive market through technology transfers joint ventures and direct investments    table of contents the indian automotive industry has historically been protected against competition from imported goods through a number of import restrictions taxes and duties on automotive and related products many of those restrictions however have recently been lifted or relaxed in  all quantitative restrictions on the import of automobiles into india were removed additionally in recent years the government of india has permitted automatic approvals for foreign equity ownership of up to  in entities manufacturing vehicles and components in india these changes have led to dramatically increased competition from imported vehicles including second hand or preowned vehicles though there remain relatively high tariffs on imports of vehicles and components we expect tariffs on the import of components and cars in completely built units or cbus andor completely knocked down units or ckds to be reduced in the future in line with india’s obligations under its world trade organization agreement there can be no assurance that there will be no further reductions in import duties on automotive products or a relaxation or removal of import restrictions which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations   increases in diesel fuel prices or increased demand for gasoline fuelpowered vehicles could adversely affect the demand for our products   a significant proportion of our products are powered by diesel fuel engines retail prices for diesel fuel in india have historically been significantly lower than retail prices for gasoline however due to the elimination of some fuel price controls in india and global movements in market prices of crude oil the gap between retail prices of diesel fuel and gasoline in india has been narrowing a sudden shift in demand away from diesel fuelpowered vehicles in india which may occur if the price differential between diesel fuel and gasoline continued to decline significantly or if there is a substantial increase in diesel prices could adversely affect our sales and results of operations   delays in construction of improved roadways in india could adversely affect the demand for our existing and future products   our medium and long term business plans are based on the assumption that new large roadway projects in india undertaken by the government of india will proceed according to announced plans if these roadways are not constructed according to these plans the demand for our current and new products may not achieve the levels we anticipate and accordingly may lead to lower sales and profits   compliance with increasingly stringent safety or emissions standards relating to our products or our manufacturing facilities or other environmental regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations   in the last few years the government of india has introduced several regulations regarding emission levels noise and safety of automotive products as well as levels of pollutants generated by the plants that produce automotive vehicles these regulations are likely to become more stringent and the cost of complying with these regulations may be significant to comply with the requirements of environmental regulation we may have to incur substantial capital and product development expenditure and research and development costs to upgrade our products and our manufacturing facilities which may increase our cost of production and thereby adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to comply with these standards within the time frame provided to us our production and sales may be adversely affected   taxes and other levies imposed by the central or state governments in india on the acquisition and ownership of automotive vehicles or regulations applying to us may have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products   taxes and other levies imposed by the central or state governments in india that affect our industry include customs duties on imports of capital goods raw materials and components excise duty on the manufacture of automotive vehicles service tax central and state sales tax octroi duties value added tax currently under consideration by the government of india road and registration tax    table of contents these taxes and levies affect the cost of production and prices of our products and therefore the demand for our products in addition restrictions or levies imposed by the government on the use of automotive vehicles such as a congestion charge or other traffic control measures or on diesel vehicles in particular could affect the demand for our automotive vehicles in the future an increase in any of these taxes or levies or the imposition of new taxes or levies in the future may have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition   we are dependent on a limited number of vendors for the supply of critical components consumables and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products   we depend on external suppliers for the supply of raw materials components and some spare parts for our products we currently have an aggregate of approximately  vendors of components in india we collaborate closely with our vendors in order to secure a reliable supply of components that meet our requirements and to generate economies of scale additionally we have equity interests through shareholders agreements with some of our vendors and can significantly influence these entities as a result of this approach for some raw materials and several inputs in our manufacturing process for aggregates such as engines transmissions axles and fuel pumps we rely on a sole vendor or only a limited number of vendors including tata cummins ltd for our engines the failure by a vendor to adhere to our technical specifications quality requirements and production and delivery schedules could disrupt our manufacturing process in addition a vendor on whom we are dependent may raise its prices may experience a delay in its ability to produce or deliver products or a dispute may arise between us and the vendor if we are dependent on a sole vendor or a limited number of vendors for a critical input we may find it difficult to replace a vendor on a timely basis and at reasonable cost and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected    we are subject to risks associated with product warranty recall and product liability costs due to defects in our products or related aftersales services which could generate adverse publicity and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   defects if any in our products could require us to undertake service actions or vehicle recalls these actions could require us to expend considerable resources in correcting these problems and could adversely affect demand for our products defects in our products that arise from defective components or spare parts supplied by our vendors may be covered under warranties provided by our vendors although we obtain product liability insurance for the automotive vehicles we sell in some international markets we are not covered by insurance for product liability claims for products sold in india an unusual number or amount of warranty claims against a vendor could affect us adversely because we depend on a limited number of vendors for the supply of raw materials and components including some of our affiliates repeated warranty claims may result in a rise in our cost of obtaining insurance in addition these claims could have an impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition as some of our vendors are our subsidiaries and affiliates further if a vendor fails to meet quality standards it could be exposed to warranty and other product liability costs and expose us to the risk of product liability claims any defects in our products or aftersales services provided by us authorized dealers or third parties could also result in customer claims for damages in defending these claims we could incur substantial costs and receive adverse publicity management resources could be diverted away from our business towards defending these claims as a result our business results of operations and financial condition could suffer we cannot assure you that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts with vendors will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages    table of contents increases in the cost of raw materials and automobile components may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations   in fiscal  and  consumption of raw materials and components formed approximately  and  respectively of our cost of sales if costs of raw materials and components rise and if we are not able to recover these costs through cost saving measures elsewhere or are unable to increase the selling prices of our vehicles due to competitive pressure our margins and results of operations would be adversely affected for example prices for much of the steel we use in vehicle manufacturing have increased significantly in recent periods and we have not been able to fully pass along these increases through higher selling prices for our vehicles   potential delays in the launch of new models in the market and lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing models can cause us to lose market share and adversely affect our results of operations   in a highly competitive environment where the indian automotive industry currently has excess capacity competitors can gain a significant advantage by introducing a new model in a particular segment before we do in addition the launch of a new model requires substantial capital investment and product development expenditure and generally higher initial production costs the capital investments in plant and machinery in addition to product development costs associated with the launch of a new model may result in higher levels of depreciation and amortization our loss in fiscal  was partially attributable to these factors and similar investments by us in the future may have an adverse impact on our profitability therefore if market acceptance of any of our new models is lower than anticipated we may be unable to gain the intended economic benefits of our investments and higher cost of production and our results of operations may be adversely affected   we have made and may continue to make capital commitments to our subsidiaries and affiliates and if the business and operations of subsidiaries and affiliates to whom we make capital commitments deteriorate we may be required to write down or write off our investments in these subsidiaries or affiliates in the future   we have made and continue to make capital investments loans advances and other commitments to support our subsidiaries and affiliates these investments and commitments have included capital contributions to enhance the financial condition or liquidity position of our subsidiaries and affiliates if the business and operations of these subsidiaries and affiliates deteriorate we may suffer losses and our investments may be required to be written down or written off additionally our loans or advances may not be repaid or may need to be restructured or we may be required to outlay capital under our commitments to support these companies   fluctuations in exchange rates could result in foreign exchange losses   devaluations or depreciation of the value of the rupee can influence the cost of our borrowings denominated in currencies other than rupees and increase the cost of our imports while an appreciation of the value of the rupee which has occurred against the dollar since early  can adversely impact our exports as of march   approximately  of our borrowings were denominated in dollars and other nonrupee currencies further in fiscal  and   and  respectively of our total raw material costs were incurred in dollars and other nonrupee currencies and in fiscal  and   and  respectively of our total revenues were derived from international markets any significant fluctuation to our disadvantage in exchange rates may have an adverse effect on our financial condition although we engage in some currency hedging in order to decrease our foreign exchange exposure a weakening of the rupee against the dollar and other major foreign currencies may have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing in rupee terms and consequently may increase the cost of financing our expenditure in rupee terms in addition    table of contents we have experienced and can be expected to continue to experience foreign exchange losses and gains on obligations denominated in foreign currencies in respect of our borrowings and foreign currency assets and liabilities although the fluctuations in the value of the rupee against the dollar has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in recent periods the depreciation in the value of the rupee against the dollar in recent months may lead to adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations during the current fiscal year and in future periods in part because of the additional dollardenominated debt that we have incurred during the first quarter of the current fiscal year   we need to successfully integrate and manage our mergers or acquisitions to maintain profitability   we recently acquired daewoo commercial vehicle co ltd now named tata daewoo commercial vehicle co ltd or tdcv in south korea we also continue to evaluate other merger and acquisition opportunities and plan to make additional mergers or acquisitions in the future if suitable opportunities arise these may dilute our earnings per share as a result of the specific scope of the business or condition of the operations being merged with or acquired mergers and acquisitions involve risks including     • unforeseen contingent risks or latent liabilities relating to these businesses that may only become apparent after the merger or acquisition is finalized     • integration and management of the operations and systems     • retention of select personnel     • coordination of sales and marketing efforts     • management of a larger business and     • diversion of management’s attention from other ongoing business concerns   if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage our pending acquisition as well as any future mergers or acquisitions that we might pursue our growth plans may not be met and our profitability may decline   we may be adversely affected by labor unrest   all of our regular employees and those of our consolidated subsidiaries in india other than management are members of labor unions and are covered by our wage agreements with those labor unions that have varying terms typically three years at different locations our wage agreements for pune excluding the car plant the pune car plant jamshedpur mumbai and lucknow are valid until august   march   march   december   and march   respectively in general we consider our labor relations with all of our employees to be good however in march  we were compelled to declare a lockout in our lucknow factory which was lifted in september  on the formation of a new union though we have not experienced any other labor unrest since  we may in the future be subject to labor unrest which may delay or disrupt our operations in the affected regions including the acquisition of raw materials and parts the manufacture sales and distribution of products and the provision of services if such work stoppages or lockouts occur or continue for a long period of time our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected    table of contents risks associated with investments in an indian company   political instability or changes in the government in india could delay the further liberalization of the indian economy and adversely affect economic conditions in india generally and our business in particular   substantially all of our manufacturing and sales and distribution facilities are located in india and in fiscal  and  approximately  and  respectively of our revenues were derived from the domestic market our business and the market price and liquidity of our adss and shares may be affected by foreign exchange rates and controls interest rates changes in government policy taxation social and civil unrest and other political economic or other developments in or affecting india   since  successive indian governments have pursued policies of economic liberalization including significantly relaxing restrictions on the private sector nevertheless the roles of the indian central and state governments in the indian economy as producers consumers and regulators have remained significant in a general election that took place in india in april and may  the incumbent coalition government of the national democratic alliance formed in october  was defeated and the united progressive alliance a multiparty coalition headed by the congress party has formed the new government though the congress party has publicly indicated an intention to continue india’s program of economic reform through a program agreed to in consultation with all coalition parties the united progressive alliance consists of parties with differing agendas which could result in political instability and as such the rate of economic liberalization could change and specific laws and policies affecting automotive companies foreign investment currency exchange and other matters affecting investment in our securities could change as well uncertainty regarding possible policy changes immediately after elections has in the past resulted in significant volatility in price and trading volumes of securities of indian companies a significant change in india’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could adversely affect business and economic conditions in india generally and our business in particular if new restrictions on the private sector are introduced or if existing restrictions are increased   regional conflicts in asia and other export markets could adversely affect the indian economy and cause our business to suffer   the asian region has from time to time experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities among neighboring countries including between india and pakistan since may  military confrontations between india and pakistan have occurred in kashmir also since early  there have been military hostilities and civil unrest in afghanistan and iraq events of this nature in the future as well as social and civil unrest within other countries in asia could influence the indian economy and could have a material adverse effect on the market for securities of indian companies including our adss and shares and on the market for our vehicles   the sale of our shares by foreign investors to indian residents is subject to restrictions under indian law which may adversely impact the market price of our adss and shares   under current indian regulations and practice the approval of the rbi is required for the sale of our shares including shares withdrawn from our ads facilities by a nonresident of india to a resident of india unless the sale is made through a stock exchange under currency exchange controls that are in effect in india any approval granted by the rbi will specify a limit on the price at which our shares may be transferred based on a specified formula and a higher price per share may not be permitted additionally shareholders who seek to convert the rupee proceeds from a sale of shares in india into foreign currency and repatriate that foreign currency from india will have to obtain rbi approval for each transaction unless sold through a stock exchange we cannot assure you that any required approval from the rbi or any other government agency can be obtained on any particular terms or at all see “item d –exchange controls”    table of contents rights of shareholders under indian law may be more limited than under the laws of other jurisdictions   our articles of association which include regulations applicable to our board of directors and indian law govern our corporate affairs legal principles relating to these matters and the validity of corporate procedures directors’ fiduciary duties and liabilities and shareholders’ rights may differ from those that would apply to a company in another jurisdiction shareholders’ rights under indian law may not be as extensive as shareholders’ rights under the laws of other countries or jurisdictions including the united states you may have more difficulty in asserting your rights as a shareholder than you would as a

the laws of india almost all of our directors and executive officers named in this registration statement are residents of india further almost all of our assets and the assets of these directors and

judgment and not by proceedings in execution the suit must be brought in india within three years from the date of the judgment in the same manner as any other suit filed to enforce a civil liability in india it is unlikely that a court in india would award damages on the same basis as a foreign court if an action is brought in india furthermore it is unlikely that an indian court would enforce foreign judgments if it viewed the amount of damages awarded as excessive or inconsistent with indian practice a party seeking to enforce a foreign judgment in india is required to obtain approval from the rbi to execute such a judgment or to repatriate outside india any amount recovered    table of contents risks relating to our shares and adss   fluctuations in the exchange rate between the

some of the major aggregates are sourced from us and european component suppliers we had approximately  permanent employees including approximately  permanent employees at our consolidated subsidiaries as of march     the indian automotive market   the liberalization of the indian economy has created significant opportunities for growth in the indian automotive industry vehicle demand in india is generally affected by     • gdp     • pace of infrastructure development     • interest rates     • credit availability     • cost of fuel     • taxes and duties     • introduction of new vehicles and technologies     • competition in the market     • disposable income of consumers and     • regulations on safety and emission standards   these factors can cause demand to vary substantially from year to year for individual categories of automotive vehicles in india    table of contents a revival in economic conditions in fiscal  and  after nearly three years of low growth led to a sharp increase in sales of automotive vehicles in india to the highest ever level with total sales of  units in fiscal  we achieved a market share of  of all fourwheel vehicles sold in india in fiscal  due to the continued growth of the indian economy and available trends in fiscal  combined with increased credit availability at lower interest rates we expect that sales of automotive vehicles in categories in which our products are positioned in india will continue to grow in fiscal    the indian automotive industry is in the process of integrating itself with the rest of the world and in recent years has been affected by government regulation aimed at reducing harmful effects on the environment enhancing vehicle safety and improving fuel economy these regulations have added to the cost of vehicle production   the opening of the indian automotive market has led to increased competition as foreign global automotive industry leaders have continued to increase their presence in india in fiscal  the indian government released its proposed auto policy this policy outlines a vision to establish a globally competitive automobile industry in india and to double its contribution to the indian economy by  it also aims to promote integrated phased enduring and selfsustaining growth of the indian automotive industry the stated policy objectives are to     • promote the sector as a lever of industrial growth and employment and to achieve a high degree of value addition in the country     • promote a globally competitive automotive industry and emerge as a global source for automotive components     • establish an international hub for manufacturing small affordable passenger cars and a key center for manufacturing tractors and twowheel vehicles in the world     • ensure a balanced transition to open trade at a minimal risk to the indian economy and local industry     • promote continued modernization of the industry and facilitate indigenous design research and development     • steer india’s software industry into automotive technology     • assist development of vehicles propelled by alternative energy sources and     • develop domestic safety and environmental standards to be at par with international standards   we believe that we have the resources strategies and technologies in place to compete effectively in the industry despite the increasing competitive pressures in addition we believe that our research and development initiatives particularly the development of environmentally friendly new vehicle technologies at affordable levels for consumers provide us with a strategic advantage as a global competitor   our ability to compete in the consolidating global automotive industry will depend in part on the successful implementation of our business strategy this is subject to a number of factors some of which are not in our control for details on these factors please see “item  key information — risk factors”    table of contents our strategy   in this dynamic and competitive environment our objective is to enhance our position and emerge as india’s leading automotive manufacturer in all product categories in which we operate as well as increasing our global reach we intend to achieve this objective by leveraging our existing strengths developing expertise and continuing as a lowcost highquality manufacturer we also plan to increase our overseas sales by developing products that will be successful in international markets as well as through acquisitions in key regions   we believe that our strong position in the indian automotive industry has resulted from the following factors     • timely introduction of new products and upgrading of existing products that meet consumer demands and incorporation of superior design environmental and safety technologies     • continuing focus on high quality and lowcost manufacturing     • commitment to investment in research and development and sales and production infrastructure and     • financial strength which enables us to achieve the above objectives   our goal is to continue to be a market leader in the indian automotive industry and grow to become a global automotive player the key elements of our strategy are as follows   leveraging our broad product range we consider ourselves well positioned to compete across a broad range of products in the indian automotive market due to strong brand recognition in india our strong inhouse engineering and manufacturing capabilities extensive distribution network and good understanding of local consumer preferences our acquisition of tdcv has provided us with a complementary range of heavy vehicles which will help us accelerate our strategy of building global products   we also believe that growth opportunities exist in a number of sectors of the indian automotive market we plan to introduce new products including a low cost car and a new global truck upgrades and variants of our existing products and increase production of fullybuilt commercial vehicles while also capitalizing on the success of our recently introduced products   increasing the scale of operations we intend to further strengthen our competitive advantage build up economies of scale for us and our key vendors and simultaneously diversify our revenue profile by pursuing different markets increasing vehicle sales volumes substantially will be the key to this strategy we aim to increase our domestic market share through continuously upgrading and widening our current product range as well as expanding our distribution network and supplement this with initiatives in the international markets   inorganic growth we recently acquired the truck division of daewoo motor company in south korea this acquisition represents a major step in our corporate history we will continue to look for other acquisitions with a view towards achieving our goal of becoming a global automotive company   reducing costs and breakeven points since fiscal  we have made significant reductions in our expense base having achieved a cumulative reduction in fixed variable and financial expenses this has had a direct impact on our results of operations and contributed significantly to our return to profitability in fiscal  and  we continue to place an emphasis on reduction of production costs overhead and other general costs including by means of value engineering and cycle time reduction and more stringent    table of contents working capital controls we will continue to work with international and local operational and management consultants to achieve continued cost reductions and management efficiencies we believe that productivity improvements and operational efficiencies will help lower our breakeven levels and thus improve our results of operations   continuing focus on high quality and enhancing customer orientation our commitment to quality and customer service has been a significant competitive strength and one of our principal goals is to achieve international quality standards for our entire line of products and services our attention to quality has enabled us to offer industryleading warranties in india and competitive warranties in our overseas markets in addition we have built an extensive sales and aftersales service network which has enabled us to provide quality customer service in an effort toward further improving our responsiveness to market and customer service needs we have recently embarked on a customer relationship management or crm initiative which is an information technology support system to enable us to better understand and service our customer requirements we have also recently introduced a new product introduction or npi initiative and a quality function deployment or qfd initiative which are programs aimed at facilitating increased channels of customer feedback in order to enhance compatibility between customer preferences and our products   expanding our distribution and service reach our automotive distribution network is one of the largest distribution networks in india our total distribution network in india spreads across  cities with over  outlets and is expected to further increase in line with market expansion in south korea we have  service outlets we plan to continue to expand the reach of our network to cater to the increasing demand for our products   expanding our international business in order to counterbalance the cyclical nature of the domestic automotive industry we intend to focus more of our efforts on overseas markets in the future both through organic and inorganic growth these initiatives include focusing on key markets and select segments joint ventures and mergers and acquisitions that will help us make inroads into markets with high barriers of entry resulting from regulatory regimes or advanced stages of market development   forming alliances in december  we entered into an agreement with the mg rover group for the sale and distribution of the indica passenger car under the “rover” brand name and the safari and the telcoline pickup under the tata brand name in the uk ireland and other european markets we will consider entering into similar alliances that could offer us opportunities for growth while we design most of the parts for our products these alliances could also extend to alternative sources for technology for upgraded aggregates and components for our products if required   enhancement of nonvehicle business revenues we seek to continue to increase our after market revenue from sale of replacement parts and services and sale of engineering products such as engines for marine and industrial applications castings forgings production aids and toolings and fixtures    table of contents customer financing as financing is increasingly becoming a critical factor in vehicle purchases with the declining cost of financing and rising aspirations of the consumers in india we intend to significantly expand our vehicle financing activities to give impetus to our vehicle sales as part of our efforts to strengthen our activities in india we recently entered into a joint marketing arrangement with tata finance ltd a nonbanking finance company pursuant to which we formed a joint marketing initiative comprised of employees from our bureau of hire purchase and credit and the asset financing division of tata finance ltd to approach the market with a common marketing front under the common brand of tata motors finance this joint team oversees the sales and marketing operations of the two companies in order to align and integrate product and service offerings and business operations and reduce costs and promote operational efficiency by rationalizing distribution networks sharing information technology systems and mounting joint treasury operations   leveraging our lowcost product development capability we intend to continue to leverage our strength in low cost product development the development of our indica passenger car from greenfield to launch for an annual capacity of  cars at an estimated cost of approximately rs million has set a benchmark in low cost automobile product development our engineering research centre or erc comprises approximately  engineers who have access to cadcamcae workstations and other support such as a crash test facility a stateoftheart hemianechoic noise and vibration test chamber emission testing facilities and modern test tracks we believe these facilities will help us to upgrade the quality of our products and substantially reduce new product development costs   enhancing capabilities through adoption of the tata business excellence model or tbem the tata group of which we are a part in recognition of their values of “leadership with trust” has articulated a group purpose statement that aims at improvement in the quality of life through leadership in various sectors of national economic significance in pursuit of this goal the tata group has decided to adopt and institutionalize an approach that will enable it to drive performance and attain higher levels of efficiency both in its business and in discharging its social responsibility formulation and adoption of the tbem which is adapted from the malcolm baldrige model is being used as a tool for this purpose the model essentially aims to nurture the core values and concepts embodied in various focus areas such as leadership strategic planning customers markets and human resources to be translated to operational performance our successful adoption and implementation of this model is expected to ensure that our business in the future can be conducted through a more systematic approach and sustainable processes this should facilitate robustness in our way of doing business given the dynamic and demanding global business environment   remaining environmentally and safety conscious we are committed to sustaining what we believe to be a leading position in developing products that meet environmental and safety regulations in india earlier than statutorily mandated our vehicles are compliant with all mandated domestic regulations and also meet the more stringent emission and safety regulations in the overseas markets in which they are sold we will continue to place a strong emphasis on the utilization of clean technologies in our manufacturing processes so as to minimize waste products and environmental pollution we have introduced versions of our vehicles that run using compressed natural gas or cng as fuel to provide environment friendly solutions   continuing to invest in technology and technical skills we believe we are one of the most technologically advanced indigenous vehicle manufacturers in india over the years we have enhanced our technological strengths through cooperation with foreign research consultants as well as extensive internal research and development activities these technical skills have given us competitive advantage in product design manufacturing and quality control we consider technological leadership to be a significant factor in continued success and therefore intend to continue to devote significant resources to constantly upgrade our technological base see “— research and development”    table of contents maintaining financial strength we have generated strong cash flows since fiscal  as a result of substantial volume growth cost reduction and prudent working capital management as a result we currently maintain substantial investible surplus this will provide us with flexibility in case of shortterm fluctuations of future cash flows we have embarked on economic value added or eva driven project evaluation and capital investments to ensure that we may recover our cost of capital in a downturn and earn higher than our cost of capital in the upside years   leveraging unified tata brand equity we recognize the need for enhancing our brand recognition in highly competitive markets in which we compete with internationally recognized brands we believe the tata brand name is associated by indian customers with reliability trust and value we will continue to promote the tata brand in india as well as overseas where we plan to substantially increase our

generating and industrial applications through its indian venture cummins india ltd    table of contents production   our principal automotive production facilities are located in pune in western india jamshedpur in eastern india and lucknow in northern india which provides us with a good geographical spread to cater to every region in the country in the pune plant we make all our products the plant at jamshedpur caters to mhcvs and at lucknow we assemble commercial and utility vehicles we also have a mhcv assembly plant in gunsan south korea   we produced  and  vehicles in india in fiscal  and  respectively in addition tdcv produced  vehicles in fiscal  subsequent to our acquisition of tdcv in late march    we have been implementing kaizen techniques with the assistance of international consultants with a view to creating a significant reduction in the throughput time for the various manufacturing activities performed within our plants kaizen techniques are intended to help in optimization of work flows and rationalization of work processes thereby improving system efficiency   sales and distribution of vehicles   our automotive sales distribution network in india is comprised of our  regional offices  subregional offices and over  dealer outlets we have six companyowned dealerships including those owned by consolidated subsidiaries while the rest of the dealers are independent most of whom are exclusive dealers for our vehicles we believe that this is the largest distribution network for automobiles in india we believe that our distribution network has been a key factor in our success in the domestic market we deploy different sales channels for the distribution of our vehicles in addition to the dealer outlets we also have a strong after sales service network comprising  authorized service centers we own  of these centers   a substantial number of our vehicles are sold directly to dealers from our regional sales offices we do not extend credit to dealers however we provide cash incentives to better performing dealers we sell government and military vehicles as well as a small number of other vehicles directly to customers   enduser purchases of our vehicles from dealers are generally financed by thirdparty sources including banks development financial institutions and private finance companies although most enduser financing is provided by third parties we also provide credit through financing channels to enduser purchasers through our dealers who act as our agents for fiscal  and  approximately  and  respectively of our vehicle sales were made through hire purchase terms where we provided the credit these credit sales are made on secured terms with a cash down payment of between  to  by the purchaser followed by monthly installment payments for up to  months credit provided by us to enduser purchasers is extended on prevailing market terms which are at a margin over our marginal cost of borrowing and cost of operations until the final payment we retain title to vehicles sold on a credit basis and are entitled to repossess them in case of default in payments we actively pursue collection of overdue amounts including through repossession where necessary total finance receivables outstanding as at march   and  amounted to rs million and rs million respectively of which rs million and rs million respectively were considered doubtful we have a contractual  recourse to the relevant dealer for any uncollected amounts   we have companyowned sales and service outlets in bhubaneshwar delhi and mumbai and our consolidated subsidiary concorde motors ltd runs dealership operations in chennai hyderabad and bangalore these dealerships have been patterned to meet international benchmarks and are intended to serve as model dealerships for our other dealers we have also recently begun operating hourservice    table of contents centers and have established a maintenance plan called “sampoorna seva” meaning “complete service” pursuant to which we enter into annual maintenance contracts with vehicle owners we use a network of service centers on highways and a toll free customer assistance centre for providing hour onroad maintenance including replacement of parts to vehicle owners we believe that the reach of our service and maintenance network provides us with a significant advantage over our competitors   competition   we face competition from domestic automotive manufacturers across our product lines in addition many foreign automotive manufacturers have increased or are expected to increase their participation in the indian market through technology transfers joint ventures or subsidiaries   our vehicles are tailored specifically to the indian market catering to specific customer needs such as safety driving comfort fuel efficiency and durability they are suited to general conditions of indian roads the local climate and overloading practices and are environmentally friendly we also offer a wide range of optional configurations to meet the needs of our customers we intend to upgrade and widen our product range in order to meet the increasing customer expectation of “world class” products we believe that our extensive research and development activities have been a major contributor to the success of our newer models see “research and development” below   we believe that our extensive distribution reach and our wider product range provide us with a competitive advantage we have been able to improve our market share in the product

march although there is a dip in february just before release of the indian fiscal budget which usually recovers in march after the budget is announced demand is usually lean from april to july and picks up again in september with a dip in december due to the change of the manufacturing year   international business   substantially all of our manufacturing and sales and distribution facilities are located in india in fiscal  and  approximately  and  respectively of our revenues were derived from the domestic market in fiscal  our export sales increased significantly compared to the comparable prior periods this increase was largely as a result of our distribution agreement with mg rover sales under this distribution agreement constituted approximately  of our export sales by units and  of our total sales by units in fiscal  the proportion of our unit sales outside india during the current fiscal year that will be comprised of sales to mg rover is expected to be partially offset by sales from tdcv in addition we are continuing to pursue other opportunities for expansion of our exports   over the years we have received more than  awards from the engineering export promotion council the government of india and the state government of maharashtra for our export initiatives our exports were subdued in fiscal  but grew significantly in fiscal  our exports of vehicles manufactured in india decreased  in fiscal  to  units from  units in fiscal  and increased by  to  units in fiscal  the highest we have ever achieved   the following table shows for the

to our acquisition of tdcv on march     we have established assembly operations in bangladesh with one of our affiliates nita co ltd as well as assembly operations that are contracted to distributors in malaysia kenya and south africa in our traditional export markets of bangladesh and sri lanka our mcvs continue to enjoy a significant market share we have been concentrating our efforts on increasing our presence in the newer markets we have entered in the last few years while at the same time improving our sales in our existing overseas markets   we distribute vehicles in international markets through a network of distributors these distributors in turn appoint local dealers who are familiar with the local market conditions in their respective countries    table of contents we have also stationed overseas resident sales and service representatives in various countries to oversee our operations in their respective territories the dealers appointed in various countries are responsible for the aftersales service needs of the local customers we have recently undertaken initiatives to enhance the penetration and reach of our international business through expansion of our sales and service network in our international markets   in order to enhance our exports we entered into an agreement with the mg rover group for the sale and distribution of the indica the safari and the telcoline pickup in the united kingdom ireland and other european markets as well as for the sale and distribution of spare parts for these vehicles in these markets pursuant to this agreement we supply indicas for sale under the rover brand name cityrover in these markets and safaris and telcoline pickups marketed as tata vehicles thereby gaining access to significant new export markets and an established network of overseas dealers we have agreed not to separately export indicas or comparable vehicles safaris or telcoline pickups to the united kingdom and ireland that would compete with the vehicles to be sold and distributed by mg rover group for the duration of our agreement the agreement is expected to improve output at our plants thereby improving our efficiencies the first shipment of the cityrover commenced in october    we distribute vehicles in south korea through daewoo motor sales corporation or dmsc and the international sales of tdcv are through daewoo international daewoo construction and through our international vehicle distribution channel we also have  service centers and distribute parts through  outlets in south korea   acquisition of daewoo commercial vehicle co ltd korea   we acquired daewoo commercial vehicle co ltd or dwcv now named tata daewoo commercial vehicle co ltd or tdcv on march   dwcv the former truck unit of daewoo motor company or dmc was established in november  under a corporate reorganization plan after dmc went bankrupt tdcv currently manufactures heavy commercial vehicles with a gross combined weight ranging from  to  metric tonnes in cargo mixers dump truck and tractor applications as well as some special purpose vehicles with engines ranging from hp to hp this product range is complementary to our current product range powered by engines with a maximum of hp the total acquisition price of krw  billion approximately rs million or us million was financed equally through our equity investment in tdcv and direct lending facilities to tdcv for which we provided a letter of undertaking the price includes the perpetual and exclusive right to use daewoo trademarks in korea and overseas markets for the product range of tdcv we believe that significant synergies can be achieved with tdcv in a number of areas including marketing product range research and product development and some operational areas   research and development   our research and development activities in our automotive business segment focus on the environment vehicle safety and product development through our engineering research centre or erc which is one of the few government recognized inhouse automotive research and development centers in the country we have been able to design develop and manufacture our own range of vehicles the most significant achievement of the erc to date has been the design and development of our compact car the indica which is the country’s only indigenous offering the erc also designed our midsize car the indigo which was introduced in december  and has since retained leadership in the midsize market segment in india we enhanced our strong position in the indian commercial vehicle market through the introduction of a new improved range of ex series light medium and heavy trucks and buses as well as a newly launched pickup in fiscal  we are currently working on a global truck of the future that will enable us to achieve our objective of providing transportation solutions globally our acquisition of dwcv is expected to provide us synergies in the development of this global truck we are also working on the development of a low cost car for the indian market    table of contents some of the development facilities used by our erc are unique to the indian auto industry we are the only automotive company in asia outside of japan and korea that has a modern crash test facility where new products are thoroughly tested for ensuring enhanced passenger safety our erc also has a hemianechoic chamber testing facility to minimize noise and vibration levels in vehicles and engine emission testing facilities to develop environmentally friendly products   our erc functions in a stateoftheart computeraided design or cad manufacturing environment engineers using cad systems are able to develop new vehicle models and also bring about improvements in existing vehicles and components new tools are also designed using our cad systems and all of these design functions are electronically linked to component and tooling facilities for cutting body panel dies and making other structural components our subsidiary tata technologies limited has also developed software for various automotive and other applications which is used for our own applications and is also sold to third parties such as ibm general motors and daimlerchrysler   our erc employs about  persons over the years we have devoted considerable resources towards our research and development activities our total expenditure on research and development during fiscal years   and  was rs million rs million and rs million respectively our inhouse research and development initiative has received wide acclaim and recognition for the year  we received the national award for research and development efforts in industry in the mechanical engineering industries sector from the department of scientific and industrial research government of india which covered our achievements for the design and development of the indica for the year  we received from the technology development board of the department of science and technology government of india the national award for successful commercialization of indigenous technology by an industrial concern for the tata indica project we received the csir centre for scientific and industrial research diamond jubilee technology award for the development of the indica and the business world – nid design excellence award for the design development and production of the indica in fiscal  the icici bank and overdrive awards  voted the indigo as the “most exciting new car in ” and the indica was voted the “best diesel small car” in the voice of the customer awards by nfo automotive india    intellectual property   we have  trademarks registered in india and approximately  trademark applications which are currently pending in

aspects of intellectual property or trips india grants statutory protection to various forms of intellectual property including patents copyrights industrial designs and trademarks the trade marks act  and the copyright act  as amended which are currently in force in india are trips compliant the patents act  as amended to the extent that it relates to our business and operations provides adequate product and process patent protection in india in accordance with its obligations under trips the united states has placed india on its “priority watch list” under section  of    table of contents trips for failing to provide adequate levels of protection for intellectual property rights although we have never experienced any material difficulties in protecting our brands and other intellectual property in india the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in india has not been and may not be as effective as in the united states   we currently own two patents and have  patent applications pending registration in india these patents are mostly in relation to devices which enable efficient functioning such as energy saving devices our most significant patent which is currently in the process of being registered is a portable device for measurement of head impact points in a vehicle in addition tdcv holds  patents in south korea and  patent applications are currently pending registration   in addition to the above we also have various copyright and internet domain name registrations   although we consider our intellectual property to be important we do not consider any one or group of our trademarks brands or patents to be so important that their expiration or termination would materially affect our business   other operations   in addition to automotive operations we are involved in a number of other business activities net revenues for these activities totaled rs million and rs million in fiscal  and  respectively representing approximately  and  respectively of our total revenues the most significant of our other operations are information technology services auto components and construction equipment   construction

equipment such as cranes hydraulic excavators loaders and articulated dump trucks   information technology services   tata technologies ltd or ttl our owned subsidiary provides information technology services to several clients across india and overseas on its own as well as through its whollyowned subsidiary tata technologies usa ttl has implemented the sap enterprise resource planning or sap erp system across tata motors and several other companies   auto components   our subsidiary tata autocomp systems ltd promotes auto component joint ventures with global component manufacturers in addition our whollyowned subsidiaries hv axles ltd and hv transmissions ltd manufacture heavy axles and heavy transmissions primarily for our own requirements   components and raw materials   our vehicles manufactured in india are manufactured almost entirely from components made in india a large proportion of which are sourced from a wellestablished network of suppliers many of whom have invested in the most advanced component technologies available we import only a limited number of specialized parts and components and specialized grades of steel our koreanmanufactured vehicles at tdcv are assembled primarily from koreamanufactured aggregates and components although some of the major aggregates are also imported from us and european component suppliers    table of contents we have recently undertaken an ecommerce initiative through the development of a businesstobusiness site with the assistance of our subsidiary tata technologies limited for electronic interchange of data with our suppliers this has enabled us to have real time information exchangeprocessing through which we effectively manage our supply chain we have also engaged the services of external agencies that operate as third party logistic providers this has resulted in space and cost saving by transferring a part of our inventory to a third party   the principal raw materials and components required by us for use in our vehicles are steel sheets and plates castings forgings proprietary items such as tyres batteries electrical items and rubber and plastic parts the raw materials components and consumables that are domestically sourced include steel sheetmetal forgings and castings tyres and tubes batteries fuel injection systems airoil filters consumables paints oils thinner welding consumables chemicals adhesives and sealants and fuels we also require aggregates like axles engines gear boxes and cabs for our vehicles which are manufactured by our subsidiaries or purchased from our affiliates   as part of our strategy to become a lowcost vehicle manufacturer we have undertaken various initiatives to reduce our fixed and variable costs including an esourcing initiative started in  through which we have taken up reverse auctions we have established a procedure for ensuring quality control of outsourced components purchases that are made from approved sources undergo a comprehensive step supplier quality improvement process we also have a program for assisting vendors from whom we purchase raw materials or components to maintain quality each vendor is reviewed on a quarterly basis on parameters of quality cost and delivery preference is given to vendors with qs certification we also maintain a stringent quality assurance program that includes random testing of production samples frequent recalibration of production equipment and analysis of postproduction vehicle performance and ongoing dialogue with workers to reduce production errors further in april  we established a strategic sourcing group to consolidate strategize and monitor our supply chain activities with respect to major items of purchase as well as major inputs of technology and services the strategic sourcing group is responsible for recommending for the approval of the management committee the longterm strategy and purchase decision for these items negotiation and relationship with vendors with regard to these items formulating and overseeing our purchasing policies norms in respect of all items evolving guidelines for vendor quality improvement vendor rating and performance monitoring and undertaking companywide initiatives such as esourcing and supply chain managementpolicies with respect to vehicle spare parts we are also exploring opportunities for global sourcing of parts and components from lower cost countries and have embarked on a vendor management program that includes vendor base rationalization vendor quality improvement and vendor satisfaction surveys   domestic suppliers   we have chosen to outsource manufacturing of many components in these instances we have been actively involved in providing training to outside suppliers and we often design and manufacture the toolings and fixtures employed by those suppliers   tata autocomp systems ltd encourages the entry of internationally acclaimed auto component manufacturers into india by setting up joint ventures with them some of these joint ventures include tata johnson controls for seats knorr bremse systems for commercial vehicle air brakes tata yazaki for wiring harnesses jbm sangwoo for pressed components tata auto plastics for plastic components and tata toyo radiators for radiator assemblies these joint ventures act as our suppliers    table of contents foreign suppliers   we import some components that are either not available in the domestic market or when equivalent domesticallyavailable components do not meet our quality standards imported components include those that are required to be fitted on vehicles manufactured for export markets to meet foreign regulations such as air intake valves fog lamps and also for mpfi kitscatalytic converters to meet the euro ii norms we also import products to take advantage of lower prices in foreign markets such as special steels   the following table shows the imported and indigenous raw material and components consumed

expenditures   our total capital expenditure between april   and march   has been rs million this has been incurred primarily for investment in and sustenance of manufacturing facilities and new technology for new products and model changes on a segmental basis automotive operations accounted for rs million of this expenditure while rs million was incurred in other operations we also invested rs million in fiscal  in connection with our acquisition of dwcv in south korea   we intend to incur capital expenditures of approximately rs million between april   and march   primarily for sustenance of manufacturing facilities for new products and model changes and also for capacity expansion specifically we currently intend to incur capital expenditures of approximately rs million on capacity expansion at our indiabased automotive plants and approximately rs million for investment in new vehicle and models and upgrades the source of funding for this capital expenditure program will be mainly through internally generated cash from operations and funds raised through our july  and april  issuances of convertible notes and the conversion of warrants pursuant to our december  rights issuance of convertible and nonconvertible debentures   environmental regulation and initiatives   regulation   our vehicles comply with the fuel emission regulations in india that came into effect in  we are currently taking steps including through the use of cummins engines for our mhcvs and the development of gasoline engines that will enable our vehicles to comply with fuel emission regulations expected to be introduced in the future   new vehicles manufactured by us are required to obtain certificates of compliance with various vehicle safety regulations relating to design and the manufacturing process fuel emission levels are also    table of contents tested at this stage each of our plants has received government environmental clearances for our operations it is our policy to consider and implement environmentallyfriendly manufacturing processes and waste water and other byproducts from our plants are treated and recycled to the extent which we consider practicable   initiatives   we are fully committed to our role as a responsible corporate citizen with respect to reducing environmental pollution we treat all effluents at our plants and have made significant investments in lowering the emissions from our products we have led the indian automotive industry in introducing greener engines like the cummins engines for our commercial vehicles even before they were statutorily mandated the entire range of our mcvs manufactured in india has been configured to run on cummins engines or the upgraded version of our own engines that meet mandatory emission norms in india our lcvs are powered by our own engines that meet mandated norms in addition buses with leanburn as well as stoichiometric compressed natural gas or cng engines have been developed and supplied to delhi transport corporation and private bus operators in delhi so as to enable them to comply with the regulations there our utility vehicles and passenger cars being exported to europe meet the euro iii norms prevalent in those markets in the indian market these vehicles comply with the bharat stage ii euro ii equivalent norms the diesel version as well as the multipoint fuel injection or mpfi petrol engine version of the indica also meets the euro ii norms and other regulatory and market requirements in europe while our entire range of vehicles comfortably meets the requisite emission norms we are currently exploring various options to develop or source euro iii compliant engines for our indian operations we have also launched indicas powered by cng in delhi and mumbai primarily for the taxi segment we believe that we are fully able to meet the challenges posed by increasingly stringent emission norms   the vehicles made by tdcv comply with the emission regulatory requirements in that country the korea  equivalent to euro iii emission regulatory requirements became effective on july   and since that date the vehicles made by tdcv have conformed to those regulations   insurance coverage   the indian insurance industry is predominantly stateowned insurance tariffs are regulated by the insurance regulatory and development authority we have insurance coverage which we consider reasonably sufficient to cover all normal risks associated with our operations and which we believe is in accordance with industry standards in india we have obtained coverage for product liability for some of our vehicle models in several countries to which we export vehicles we do not at present maintain business interruption insurance or product liability insurance in india   tdcv has insurance coverage as is required and applicable to cover all normal risks in accordance with industry standards in south korea including for product liability   legal proceedings   we are involved in legal proceedings in various states in india both as plaintiff and as defendant in respect of claims against us below rs million the majority of the cases pertain to motor accident tribunal claims with respect to accidents involving our vehicles while being transferred from our plants to regional sales offices or between two regional sales offices and consumer complaints some of these cases relate to replacement of parts of vehicles andor compensation for deficiency in the services provided by us or our dealers we believe that none of these claims or actions individually or in the aggregate or any settlement amounts in respect thereof will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition    table of contents we are also defending other claims filed against us that are above rs million in asserted or claimed value but which we do not believe to be of a material nature other than those claims described below   a summary of litigation and disputes in which we are involved which may be regarded as material is as follows   income tax   we have ongoing disputes with indian tax authorities relating to the tax treatment of certain items these primarily include disallowed expenses the tax treatment of certain expenses claimed by us as deductions and the computation of or eligibility for certain tax incentives or allowances some of the disputes relate to timing and as such disallowances in one period would be claimable in subsequent periods most of these disputes and disallowances being repetitive in nature have been raised by the income tax authorities in most of our open tax years we have a right of appeal to the appellate authorities against adverse initial assessments and further to the high court or the supreme court on matters involving a question of law the income tax authorities have similar rights of appeal   as of march   income tax deductions aggregating rs million have been disallowed by the income tax authorities which are being contested by us on appeal there are further income tax liabilities amounting to rs million in respect of which we have won appeals that have been further contested by the income tax authorities before higher appellate authorities   excise duty   as of march   we were a party to pending litigation with respect to excise duty demands aggregating rs million challenging the basis of our valuation of our products and the applicability of ‘central value added tax’ or cenvat on inputs   of the rs million of excise duty demands as of march   rs million relate to demands by the excise authorities where we have prevailed on appeals that have been further contested by the excise authorities   the excise authorities have demanded rs million challenging the basis of our assessment of the value of certain vehicles the tribunal has decided the issue against the us in respect of which we have filed an appeal before the supreme court we expect this to be finally decided in our favor   the excise authorities have demanded rs million of excise duty arising from an amendment to the central excise rules in  concerning utilization of modified value added tax credit the case is pending before the tribunal we believe that we have rightfully claimed this credit   in fiscal  there was a significant decline in excise duty demands rs million of demands raised by the excise authorities challenging the basis of assessable value determined by us was decided in our favor by the central excise and service tax tribunal the time for raising further appeal by the excise authorities in the supreme court has elapsed and these no longer considered contingent liabilities   the excise authorities have denied us credit of rs million on certain accessories supplied with our vehicles we are contesting this before the appellate authorities and expect to receive a favorable response    table of contents sales tax   total sales tax demands including interest and penalty being contested by us amounted to rs million as of march   a summary of the major demands being contested by us is as follows   our affiliate tata cummins limited or tcl which manufactures internal combustion engines and sells them principally to us had claimed an exemption from the sales tax on finished products and from the purchase tax on raw materials being an incentive given by state tax authorities to new industries set up in specified area tcl had passed on this benefit to us this exemption was denied to tcl by the sales tax authorities tcl’s claim has been upheld by the high court in august  an appeal filed by the state against this decision before the supreme court is pending the amount involved is rs million if tcl ultimately does not prevail we would be liable to reimburse tcl for the benefit that was passed to us   different rates of sales tax are applicable on sales of vehicles in different states in india we are currently disputing the imposition of sales tax levies by the sales tax authorities in certain states aggregating approximately rs million which are based on claims that stock transfers of vehicles from our plants to our sales offices and transfers between two sales offices are interstate sales and therefore liable to sales tax   the sales tax authorities at patna have raised sales tax demands of rs million we have filed appeals against the order before the appellate authorities   under a notification issued by the jaipur state government vehicles having gross weight of more than  kgs are classified for a certain tax rate the jaipur sales tax authorities have raised a demand of rs million claiming that our vehicles with a bare chassis weight of less than  kgs do not fall under this tax classification   other sales tax cases where sales tax authorities have raised demands aggregating rs million mostly relate to alleged noncompliance with certain procedural requirements such as nonsubmission of declaration forms we have since collected the required forms from customers and submitted those forms to the relevant authorities   other taxes and dues   other amounts for which we may be liable contingently aggregate  million including those described below   municipal authorities in certain states levy octroi duty a local tax on goods brought inside municipal limits at rates that are based on the classification of those goods a demand of rs million is currently pending before the high court in connection with the levying of higher octroi duties claimed on account of classification disputes relating to components purchased by us for the manufacture of our vehicles   in addition to the above claims there is a pending counter claim for approximately £ million by motor vehicles industries ltd or mvi in connection with legal proceedings brought by us and tata international limited mumbai in respect of alleged breaches of a distributorship arrangement motor vehicles industries ltd is currently in administration and accordingly this litigation has been suspended recently the leeds district registry has passed an order in our favor and has initiated proceedings to wind up mvi   considering the nature of these claims we believe that none of the claims or proceedings will materially adversely affect our business or financial condition    table of contents regulation   indian automotive sector   india’s automotive industry was established in the s through various cooperation arrangements with and direct investments by a number of american and european automotive manufacturers prior to that vehicle kits were imported into and assembled in india the commercial vehicle manufacturing sector achieved a high rate of growth during india’s economic expansion in the s and s rail transport bottlenecks led to higher demand for road transport and this sector was permitted to grow with the minimum intervention of the government major domestic commercial vehicle manufacturers invested in expanding production facilities and product development which resulted in an efficient and relatively technologically advanced commercial vehicle industry albeit with restrictions on capacity expansions due to the licensing regime in operation at that time   in the passenger car sector two models produced by hindustan motors limited and premier automobiles limited respectively dominated the market until the mid s passenger cars were deemed to be luxury products and were subject to very high multiple taxation and price controls in addition industrial licensing and exchange control regulations forced domestic car manufacturers to embark on lowvolume highcost indigenous and inhouse component production programs demand for passenger cars exceeded supply but the domestic passenger car industry remained protected by the prohibition on car imports and remained technologically backward however the establishment of maruti udyog limited or maruti a joint venture between the suzuki motor company of japan and the government of india in the mids paved the way for expansion of the automobile sector in india in terms of increase in supply and improvement in product quality and design maruti has since become the leading player in the indian passenger car market it was not until the indian government deregulated and liberalized the automotive market in the early s that the country’s passenger car market showed substantial growth nonetheless india continues to have a substantially lower number of passenger vehicles per capita than most developed countries and a number of developing countries   restrictive automotive vehicle import policies and high import duties on vehicles assembled from kits as well as vehicle components have effectively protected domestic manufacturers from foreign competition although the indian government has reduced import duties on vehicles and components in recent years rates still remain relatively high see “import regulations and duties” below consequently domestic manufacturers have historically dominated the automotive industry in india although a number of domestic manufacturers have sought to improve product quality by entering into joint ventures technology transfer agreements or licensing agreements with foreign vehicle and component manufacturers   the industry has historically also been subject to high excise duty rates and even today cars and uvs are subject to the highest excise rates fluctuations in these taxes directly impact retail sales prices and consequently the level of demand sales tax in various states has been recently rationalized see “excise duty and sales tax” below   unlike more developed countries the automotive industry in india until the late ’s had not been subject to stringent emission or vehicle safety regulations but this trend is changing with bharat stage ii equivalent to euro ii emissions norms now in force in major cities see “government regulations” below   due to the absence of any laws regarding the age of vehicles except in the national capital region or ncr of delhi and the state of maharashtra automotive both commercial as well as passenger vehicles in india are typically kept in use much longer than in more developed countries commercial vehicles are also subject to overload abuse this has resulted in the development of an extensive allied industry that is dedicated to providing automotive repair and maintenance services required for maintaining old and overloaded vehicles some manufacturers including us have also developed a network of service centers for their vehicles    table of contents in the period since  india’s automotive industry has experienced rapid structural transformation and growth progressive easing of import controls reduction in governmental restrictions on product categories and the rationalization of excise duties including the introduction of modified value added tax or modvat earlier and central value added tax or cenvat from the year  together with increased foreign investment and technical assistance has helped create a wider range of products and greater competition the passenger vehicle segment has experienced the maximum growth over the last few years with almost all foreign direct investment in the automobile industry directed to this segment   according to siam indian automotive manufactures sold in the domestic and export markets approximately  vehicles mhcvs lcvs uvs and passenger cars in  this tripled to approximately  vehicles in the year ended march   and rose over twelvefold to approximately  vehicles in the year ended march     the global automotive industry has undergone radical change in recent times there has been significant consolidation both amongst vehicle manufacturers and component vendors with a view to achieving economies of scale product synergies and strong brand presence by contrast there has been little or no consolidation in either vehicle or component manufacturing in india the sizes of domestic automotive manufacturers especially for passenger vehicles are small compared to global standards consequently economies of scale manufacturing have generally eluded indian manufacturers of automotive vehicles and automotive components the component industry which until recently was to a large extent reserved for the smallscale sector continues to be fragmented with a number of enterprises starved of funds and technology though this situation has improved in recent years the indian automotive industry has therefore differed from the global model but as entry barriers in india are removed both vehicle and component manufacturers are likely to consolidate their operations to achieve the levels of competitiveness and scale economies that exist globally globally renowned branded products supported by high levels of promotional spending are likely to win a significant share of the domestic market for all vehicles particularly passenger vehicles indian manufacturers will therefore need to either offer products and services that differentiate themselves in mass markets or confine themselves to a niche market   the indian automotive industry is poised to undergo substantial change and face new challenges both from the opening of the domestic market to imports and the entry of international manufacturers to meet the needs of these changing times domestic automotive manufacturers will be forced to reduce costs improve productivity enhance quality reliability and durability increase market orientation and create a high level of customer loyalty consequently the reach and extent of dealership networks and the quality and cost of service are likely to assume paramount importance in influencing customer preferences   driving conditions in india are generally rugged due to the poor quality of road infrastructure this has hindered the expansion of the road transport sector and consequently the automotive industry the government is taking steps to improve the road infrastructure in the country the outlay of road and highway development is proceeding to plan and india is expected to have an improved road infrastructure with the feeder routes in place by  which may increase demand for automotive vehicles in india   union budget for fiscal    the government of india presented its union budget for  on july   some of the proposals that may have an impact on our operations include     a  education cess imposed on all direct and indirect taxes while the cenvat credit is allowable on the cess on indirect taxes no such credit is applicable on direct taxes which would result in an additional tax burden    table of contents   b service tax rates have been increased from  to  however the cenvat credit has now been made applicable to service taxes     c the automotive industry has been added to the list of industries wherein a  weighted deduction on expenditures on inhouse research and development is allowed     d an additional  depreciation is allowed for capacity expansion of  as compared to the previous      e the import duty on steel input has been reduced from  to  while the excise duty on steel and steel products has been increased from  to      f based on the recommendations of the state finance minister’s committee on vat implementation vat will be implemented across the country from april     due to the imposition of the education cess which became effective on july   we have passed on this increase to the end customer   excise duty and sales tax   excise duty is payable by vehicle manufacturers on the manufacture of vehicles or parts in india and is paid at the time of clearance from the manufacturing facilities excise duty rates vary according to vehicle classification and for us are levied as a percentage of the net dealer price at the time of dispatch of the vehicle from the plantdepot the rates of excise duty directly impact the retail sales price and the introduction of significant changes in rates overall or differential classifications of products can materially impact sales in general or sales of specific models that attract higher rates of excise manufacturers receive a credit for excise duties called cenvat including countervailing duties paid on imports included in the price paid for raw materials parts or components obtained from outside sources or other plants and used in manufacture of the finished product such a credit is offset against the cenvat payable on the finished product cenvat credit is also available to manufacturers on purchase of plant and machinery   the following table sets forth the excise duty classifications and rates applicable to our vehicles these

duty of rs per vehicle is applicable in certain cases for vehicles designed to carry more than  persons and to transport goods  including special excise duty of  and national calamity contingent duty or nccd of  on passenger vehicles a  education cess is also applicable on the special excise duty and nccd    table of contents no excise duty is payable with respect to vehicles imported into india however sales tax is imposed on the resale of these vehicles and import duties including countervailing duties are also levied   the sale of vehicles in india also attracts sales tax and other levies a substantial portion of which is paid to the government of the state in which the sale occurs until recently the rates varied from  to  in a majority of the states however at the instance of the indian government all the states have adopted a uniform rate of  applicable to “luxury” goods this has increased the rate of sales tax levy by  to  in most states as against the earlier prevailing rates   import regulations and duties   automobiles and automotive components can generally be imported into india without a license from the indian government automobile imports are subject to regulations requiring the importers to meet indian standards and certification by designated testing agencies and are also governed by other restrictions however all vehicles and components imported into india are subject to import duties which significantly increase the cost of imported goods while recent government liberalization policies have reduced import duties on vehicles and certain automotive parts and components duty rates remain relatively high and protect the domestic industry   the following table sets forth the currently applicable duty rates on fully builtup vehicles which became effective on july     product    basic customs duty     total dutyinclusive of countervailing dutynccd and education cess   commercial vehicles new and preowned          utility vehicles new

to certain restrictions prior to april  with effect from april   the indian government removed the restrictions regarding the import of vehicles but imposed conditions for their import the conditions provide that only right hand drive vehicles with speedometers and headlamps to suit “keep left” traffic and conforming to the motor vehicles act  can be imported and only through specified ports the conditions also stipulate that imported preowned vehicles should not exceed three years vintage   government regulations   prior to  strict government industrial licensing controls restricted the types of vehicles that manufacturers could produce and sell these restrictions were reflected in the industry’s characteristic of low product differentiation with few companies producing a wide range of vehicle types in  the indian government eased these product category restrictions thereby enabling us and other automotive manufacturers to produce any onroad vehicle having four or more wheels within each of these manufacturer’s licensed capacity and the normal flexibility allowed for expansion in addition as part of the indian government’s liberalization policies announced in industrial licensing has been replaced by the filing of an industrial entrepreneurs’ memorandum except under locational or environmental restrictions where industrial licensing continues to operate and import duties on vehicle components have been substantially reduced these measures have led to increased competition in the domestic market with the removal of these controls except in some situations as explained earlier indian automotive manufacturers are now free to manufacture and sell unrestricted numbers of any type of onroad vehicle with four or more wheels including passenger cars    table of contents since  emission standards have also been developing the ministry of environment and forests has mandated applicability of emission norms to the automotive industry these extend from the bharat stage i norms equivalent to euro i norms and the bharat stage ii norms equivalent to euro ii norms which have already been mandated to euro iii and euro iv equivalents for which notifications based on industry recommendations proposed through siam are now awaited during  passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles were required to meet bharat stage i euro i equivalent norms bharat stage ii euro ii equivalent norms have been in force since  in the four metros of delhi mumbai chennai and kolkata are now applicable to seven other cities and are expected to be extended in phases to the rest of the country by april  based on siam recommendations and the ra mashelkar committee report these eleven cities could move to euro iii emissions for all passenger and commercial vehicles from april  and to euro iv levels from april  while the rest of india would move to euro iii norms by april  the higher stage norms are less pollutive and stricter as compared to lower stage norms   the south korean automotive market has adopted the euro iii equivalent emission levels from july  south korea is expected to migrate to euro iv equivalent emission norms in  and euro v from    prior to april  the indian government used the administered price mechanism or apm to fix prices of petroleum products which resulted in the price of diesel being approximately twothirds the price of gasoline with the dismantling of the apm regime prices of petroleum products have become market driven which has narrowed the price gap between diesel and gasoline our mhcvs and lcvs have diesel engines while our passenger cars and uvs are available in both diesel and gasoline versions   automotive design and safety regulations are evolving in india front and rear seat belts are now mandatory in new passenger vehicles safety glass is required for all vehicle windows and windshields and standards for door intrusion are imposed for vehicle integrity legislation in line with european standards in respect of seats head restraints seat anchorage and electromagnetic interference is also expected to be progressively introduced legislation for provision of survival space braking systems and rear and side underrun protection devices for commercial vehicles became effective from may   advance braking system legislation in conformity with european economic community standards is being considered for progressive implementation between  and    in fiscal  the indian government released its proposed auto policy for discussion and feedback this policy outlines a vision to establish a globally competitive automobile industry in india and to double its contribution to the economy by  it also aims to promote integrated phased enduring and selfsustaining growth of the indian automotive industry the stated policy objectives are to     • promote the sector as a lever of industrial growth and employment and to achieve a high degree of value addition in the country     • promote a globally competitive automotive industry and emerge as a global source for auto components     • establish an international hub for manufacturing small affordable passenger cars and a key center for manufacturing tractors and twowheel vehicles in the world     • ensure a balanced transition to open trade at a minimal risk to the indian economy and local industry    table of contents   • promote continued modernization of the industry and facilitate indigenous design research and development     • steer india’s software industry into automotive technology     • assist development of vehicles propelled by alternative energy sources and     • develop domestic safety and environmental standards to be at par with international standards   c organizational structure   the tata group   we are the largest company in the diversified tata group in terms of fiscal  revenues and we benefit from being identified with the tata brand and the tata group of companies   the tata group is based largely in india and had combined revenues of approximately rs billion us billion for the year ended march     the tata group is highly diversified and the activities of the group are categorized under seven business sectors namely engineering materials energy chemicals consumer products services and communication and information systems these companies do not technically constitute a group under indian law   the tata group has its origins in the trading business founded by jamsetji tata in  that was developed and expanded in furtherance of his ideals by his two sons sir dorabji tata and sir ratan tata following their father’s death in  the family interests subsequently vested largely in the sir ratan tata trust the sir dorabji tata trust and related trusts these trusts were established for philanthropic and charitable purposes and together owned a substantial majority of the shares of tata sons limited the principal holding company of the tata group   by  the tata group had expanded from the trading company established in the nineteenth century to encompass a number of major industrial and commercial enterprises including the indian hotels company limited  the tata iron and steel company limited tata steel  the tata power company limited  tata chemicals limited  tata motors limited  voltas limited  and tata tea limited  the tata group also promoted india’s first airline tata airlines which later became air india india’s national carrier as well as india’s largest general insurance company new india assurance company limited both of which were subsequently taken over by the government as part of the government’s nationalization program tata consultancy services or tcs is asia’s leading software services provider and the first indian software firm to exceed sales of us billion in recent times the tata group has also invested in several telephony and telecommunication ventures including acquiring a portion of the indian government’s equity stake in the state owned videsh sanchar nigam limited or vsnl   most of the tata group companies are leaders in their respective business segments we are the leading automotive vehicle manufacturing company in india in terms of revenues tata steel another flagship company of the group is the oldest and the largest private sector integrated steel plant in operation in the country tata chemicals is one of the world’s largest producers of synthetic soda ash and tata tea is the largest integrated tea company in the country tata power is the largest power generating supplier in the private sector indian hotels runs the largest hotel chain in the country titan watches which is a relatively new entrant has emerged as the leader in the domestic watch market and is currently the sixth largest brand manufactured in the world vsnl is the leading international telecommunications service provider in india    table of contents we have for many years been a licensed user of the “tata” brand owned by tata sons limited and thus have both gained from the use of the tata brand as well as helped to sustain its brand equity since  many multinational corporations with wellestablished global brands have entered the indian market in response the tata group decided to institute a new corporate identity program in order to reposition itself to compete in a global environment the new corporate identity is licensed to tata group companies including us for use with their respective products and services a substantial ongoing investment is planned to develop and promote a strong wellrecognized and common brand equity which is intended to represent for the consumer a level of quality service and reliability associated with products and services offered by tata companies to further protect and enhance the tata brand equity a code of conduct has been adopted by some of the tata companies that have access to the larger resources and services of the tata group to implement these plans tata sons limited has undertaken a program by which consenting tata companies are required to pay a subscription fee to participate in and gain from the new tata group identity we believe that we benefit from association with the new tata group identity and accordingly have agreed to pay an annual subscription fee to tata sons limited from fiscal  which is equal to  of our annual net income defined as our net income exclusive of excise duties and other governmental taxes and nonoperating income provided that the subscription fee does not exceed  of our annual profit before tax defined as our profit after interest and depreciation but before income tax these calculations are made with reference to our nonconsolidated indian gaap financial statements see annex a – “reconciliation of net income and shareholders’ equity between us gaap and indian gaap” due to our net losses in fiscal  and  we were not required to make any payments in respect of this fee for those years pursuant to our licensing agreement with tata sons limited we have also undertaken certain obligations for the promotion and protection of the new tata group identity licensed to us under the agreement the agreement can be terminated by written agreement between the parties by tata sons limited upon our breach of the agreement and our failure to remedy the same or by tata sons limited upon providing six months notice for reasons to be recorded in writing the agreement can also be terminated by tata sons limited upon the occurrence of certain specified events including liquidation because we are the largest company in the tata group in terms of fiscal  revenues and because we believe that our growing international reputation brings benefits to the tata brand we consider it very unlikely that we would ever be unable to use the tata brand in relation to our products and services   the tata group companies have sought to continue to follow the ideals of ethics and integrity originally established by the founder of the tata group and his successors these companies have endeavored to maintain high standards of management efficiency and to promote the commercial success of indian enterprises the tata group has made a significant contribution toward national causes through promotion of public institutions in the field of science such as the indian institute of science and the tata institute of fundamental research and in the field of social services through the tata institute of social sciences the tata memorial hospital and the national center of the performing arts tata trusts are among the largest charitable foundations in the country   in addition the tata group companies have sought to formulate and follow a coherent approach to various matters of importance in indian business life these include a refusal to adopt any particular political alignment and espousal of causes that benefit society generally as well as the commercial interests of tata group companies   a large number of the tata group companies hold shares in one another and a number of our directors hold directorships on the boards of other tata group companies including tata sons limited and tata steel however there are no voting agreements material supply or purchase agreements or any other relationships or agreements that have the effect of tying us together with other tata group companies at management financial or operational levels our shareholdings in other tata group companies are generally insignificant as a percentage of their respective outstanding shares and none of our shareholdings in other tata group companies exceeds  of their respective outstanding shares    table of contents subsidiaries and affiliates   we have the following consolidated subsidiaries under us

this registration statement this discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including but not limited to those set forth in item d and elsewhere in this registration statement   a operating results   overview   business segments   our business segments are automotive operations and other operations automotive operations are our most significant segment accounting for  and  respectively of our total revenues and  and  respectively of our operating income for fiscal  and  india is the most significant market for us accounting for  and  of vehicle unit sales for fiscal  and  respectively    table of contents our automotive operations business segment includes all activities relating to development design manufacture assembly and sale of mhcvs lcvs passenger cars and uvs as well as related parts and accessories captive financing of our products is also included in our automotive business segment as an inherent part of our sales strategy the profitability of this activity is critically dependent upon interest rate movements in the economy vehicle demand and collections declining interest rates and easy availability of credit in the economy have led to an increased competition in this activity from banks public and private and nonbanking finance companies our management allocates resources to and assesses the performance of our automotive operations as a single segment the management of the automotive operations is aligned on a functional basis with managers having oversight responsibility for the major operating functions within the segment management assesses financial and nonfinancial data such as units of sale units of production market share information vehicle model plans and plant location costs to allocate resources within the automotive operations business segment   our other operations business segment is primarily comprised of activities relating to production designing and selling of automotive components construction equipment engineering solutions and software operations none of these other businesses meets the quantitative thresholds specified in sfas no  and accordingly these activities have been aggregated the automotive component business which is the major business component of our other operations business segment pertains to both captive and noncaptive markets our subsidiaries hv axles ltd and hv transmissions ltd which are in the truck aggregates business derive their revenues primarily from our vehicle business our subsidiary tata autocomp systems ltd promotes joint ventures that supply auto components to our vehicle business and others in the automotive market both in india and overseas through their joint venture partners we do not expect the “other operations” business segment to materially affect our consolidated results of operations for the next several years   we have experienced strong growth since fiscal  with total revenues increasing by  to rs million in fiscal  and further by  to rs million in fiscal  as against a loss of rs million in fiscal  we recorded net income in fiscal  of rs million and rs million in fiscal  our revenues from automotive operations were rs million and rs million for fiscal  and  respectively representing  and  of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively our revenues from other operations were rs million and rs million for fiscal  and  respectively representing  and  of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively   our vehicle sales including sales of tdcv subsequent to our acquisition in late march  increased to a record  units in fiscal  compared to  and  units in fiscal  and  respectively in fiscal  our market share in india of all fourwheel vehicles sold in india increased to  from  in fiscal  our overall sales in international markets including sales by tdcv in india subsequent to our acquisition in late march  improved to  units in fiscal  an increase of  compared to fiscal  due to expanded export sales of our passenger vehicles from india to european and other markets during these periods our focus on improving our international business has resulted in a  increase in revenues from international markets for fiscal  to rs million from rs million in fiscal  these revenues primarily vehicles but also including spare parts and other products and excluding export incentives received from the indian government accounted for approximately  and  respectively of our total revenue in fiscal  and  in addition to our automotive revenues we also derive dividend and other income from strategic and trade investments which accounted for our residual income and from other operations    table of contents geographical breakdown   the following table sets forth our revenues from external customers in our different geographical markets        year ended march                     rs millions    rs millions    rs millions india             all other markets               significant factors influencing our results of operations   our results of operations are dependent on a number of factors including     • general economic conditions we similar to the rest of the domestic automotive industry are substantially affected by general economic conditions in india economic conditions have vastly improved since fiscal  which has led to our strong growth in fiscal  and  see “item d — risk factors — risks associated with our business — general economic conditions could significantly adversely affect our sales and results of operations”     • interest rates and availability of credit for vehicle purchases interest rates have steadily declined since the beginning of fiscal  and credit finance for vehicle purchases has since become more widely available for further discussion of our credit support programs see “item b —business overview — sales and distribution of vehicles — domestic”     • levels of excise duty and sales tax for a detailed discussion regarding tax rates applicable to us please see item b — business overview — regulation — excise duty and sales tax” and     • our competitive position in the market for a detailed discussion regarding our competitive position see “item b — business overview — competition”   as a result of these factors vehicle sales domestic and exports by indian automotive manufacturers increased to approximately  units in fiscal  compared to  units and  units in fiscal  and  respectively   as a result of strong demand for our products our capacity utilization in india rose from  in fiscal  to  and  in fiscal  and  respectively we outperformed the unit sales growth rate of the indian automotive industry in fiscal  and  which was  and  respectively tdcv which we acquired in late march  operated at around  capacity utilization during    we also achieved a major turnaround in our profitability over the last two fiscal years from a net loss of rs million in fiscal  to net income of rs million and rs million in fiscal  and  respectively in addition to benefiting from economies of scale from increased production volumes we also significantly improved our cost controls and productivity through value engineering and reductions in manufacturing cycle times all of which have contributed toward this turnaround we also benefited from sales price increases on most of our vehicles from fiscal  which helped us increase our gross margin from  in fiscal  to  and  in fiscal  and  respectively and turn an operating loss of rs million in fiscal  to an operating income of rs million and rs million in fiscal  and  respectively the gross margin declined in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due to significant increase in input costs primarily steel partially offset by cost reductions    table of contents notwithstanding our cost control measures costs and expenses continued to increase in absolute terms as a result of production volume increases and inflation as well as a significant increase in input costs in fiscal  and    though we previously had unabsorbed brought forward losses that could be setoff against future income we are liable to pay a minimum alternate tax or mat on our book profits which cannot be carried forward accordingly the total tax charge deferred plus current for fiscal  and fiscal  on income before taxes was  and  respectively higher than the applicable marginal tax rate of  and  for fiscal  and fiscal  respectively   our results of operations are also dependent on the cyclicality in demand in the automotive market new government regulations and to a limited extent to fluctuations in foreign currency rates   the following table shows the cyclicality of demand for fourwheel automotive vehicles in india which is generally linked to economic growth   year ended march    domestic sales units   change                                                                                                     source siam   there has been a greater emphasis by the government on the emission and safety norms for the automobile industry compliance with these norms will have a significant bearing on the costs and product life cycles in the indian automotive industry for further details with respect to these regulations please see “item  information on the company — environmental regulations and initiatives”   we are sensitive to to fluctuations in foreign currency rates with respect to our import and export activities our consolidated financial statements which are presented in indian rupees are affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk changes in foreign currency exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating costs and expenses operating income net income and retained earnings    table of contents to the extent that our financial statements for a particular period will be affected by changes in the prevailing exchange rates at the end of the period such fluctuations may have a substantial impact on comparisons with prior periods however the translation effect is a reporting consideration and does not impact our underlying results of operations we do not hedge against our translation risk   transaction risk is the risk that the currency structure of our costs and liabilities will deviate from the currency structure of sales proceeds and assets transaction risk relates primarily to sales proceeds from our automotive business segment exports sales produced in india because our exports sales are a small proportion of overall sales volumes this risk is limited for us however we enter into commercial borrowings and other hedging instruments to address some of these transaction risks these instruments enable us to reduce but not eliminate the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates please see “item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further details   results of operations   the indian automotive industry is substantially affected by general economic conditions in india in  the automotive industry witnessed a recovery in demand after declining trends for two years we incurred net losses in fiscal  and fiscal  primarily as a result of a sharp decline in demand for fourwheel vehicles in the period from  to late  mainly attributable to slow economic growth in india a revival in economic conditions in india in fiscal  after nearly three years of low growth led to a sharp increase in domestic sales of automotive vehicles to  units due to the continued growth of the indian economy combined with increased credit availability at lower interest rates sales of automotive vehicles in india reached their highest ever level of  units in fiscal  we benefited from these trends and enjoyed strong sales performances in both fiscal  and    all of our product lines achieved growth in volumes in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  vehicle sales of  units including  units sold by tdcv subsequent to our acquisition in late march  represented an increase of  during fiscal  compared to fiscal  our domestic market share in india improved to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  as a result of success of our new model launches and intensive marketing efforts we enjoyed market share gains across all of our product lines in fiscal    our strategy of entering different markets outside india resulted in significant increase in vehicle unit sales in our international markets as a result sales outside india increased to  of our total unit sales in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  we expect that with availability of lowcost qualified engineering skills and presence of a large domestic market india has the potential to emerge as a global manufacturing base for the niche automotive products this trend is already visible in the increasing exports of auto components out of india with large product range significant market position and large engineering capabilities we expect to benefit from this trend   fiscal  culminated with our acquisition of tdcv on march   at an acquisition price of krw  billion approximately rs million or us million financed equally through our equity investment in tdcv and direct lending facilities to tdcv for which we provided a letter of undertaking this acquisition will provide us with opportunity for growth in the korean and other markets in the coming years and also provide us with synergies in marketing and product development and a complementary product range   the following table sets forth

our revenues for each of our business segments   automotive operations segment   automotive operations generate the largest portion of our revenues revenues from this segment increased by rs million or  to rs million in fiscal  compared to fiscal  this increase was primarily due to the     •  increase in domestic vehicle unit sales in india     •   increase in international sales of vehicles manufactured in india     •  increase in automotive financing revenues to rs million   domestic sales were driven by road infrastructure development a low interest rate environment and replacement demand in addition to benefiting from these general market conditions we also enjoyed market share gains across our product line international sales benefited from focused marketing efforts in our traditional international markets and entry into new markets increases in automotive financing revenues resulted from our increased focus on this activity   other operations segment   revenues from our other operations increased by rs million or  to rs million in fiscal  compared to fiscal  this increase resulted from the impact of increased revenue from all operations in this segment except that of tal manufacturing solutions ltd which operates in the indian capital goods industry and which is facing increasing competitive pressure from the reduction of import duties   operating costs and expenses   operating costs and expenses increased by rs million or  to rs million during fiscal  compared to fiscal    cost of sales increased by  to rs million in fiscal  from rs million in fiscal  the increase reflects primarily the combined impact of increased vehicle unit sales and an increase in input prices partially offset by the impact of continued cost cutting efforts cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues increased to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  resulting in a gross margin decrease from  for fiscal  to  in fiscal     table of contents selling general and

general profitability improvements in the operations of our consolidated subsidiaries aided largely by the improved performance of the automotive industry in india   other income and expenses   total net nonoperating expenses decreased by  from rs million in fiscal  to rs million in fiscal  primarily due to a significant decrease in interest expense and an increase in nonoperating revenue   interest income declined by  to rs million in fiscal  compared to rs million in fiscal  due to decline in the interest rates on our term deposits in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in term deposits in fiscal    interest expense decreased by  from rs million in fiscal  to rs million in fiscal  primarily due to access to lowcost international debt repayment of higher interestbearing longterm loans as well as a general decline in interest rates our weighted average interest rate on shortterm debt declined to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  similarly our weighted average interest rate on longterm debt declined to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal    nonoperating revenue increased by  from rs million in fiscal  to rs million in fiscal  primarily due to higher income from investments and higher exchange gains partially offset by nonrecurrence of gain on sales of assets    table of contents income taxes   income tax expense increased to rs million in fiscal  compared to rs million in

ltd and tata holset ltd our affiliate companies   net income   our consolidated net income was rs million in fiscal  compared to a net income of rs million in fiscal  the increase was the result of     • increased operational economies due to a  increase in vehicle unit sales     • continued cost reduction partially offset by an increase in input commodity prices due to the substantial increase in commodity prices during fiscal  due to global demand factors our raw material cost as a proportion of our total revenues increased to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  however we were able to bring down

dies carried out in fiscal  cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues decreased to  during fiscal  from  in fiscal  resulting in gross margin increasing from  in fiscal  to  in fiscal    cost reductions in fiscal  were primarily achieved through value engineeringvalue analysis vendor consolidation commonalization of components and esourcing and a reduction in conversion and fixed costs   selling general and administrative expenses increased by  from rs million in fiscal  to rs million in fiscal  this increase is primarily due to the increased automotive unit sales and higher sales promotion activities on account of the launch of new vehicle models partially offset by continuing cost reduction efforts selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to  during fiscal  from  in fiscal    research and development expenses increased by  from rs million in fiscal  to rs million in fiscal  primarily as a result of increased activities relating to the development of new models upgrading of existing models and technologies to meet emission and safety regulations in india and overseas markets    table of contents during fiscal  we had undertaken an employee separation scheme or ess that resulted in an expense of rs million towards lump sum payments and pensions to  employees who opted for the scheme compared to essrelated expenses of rs  million in respect of  employees who submitted to the ess during fiscal    operating income   our consolidated operating income increased by rs million to rs million in fiscal  compared with an operating loss of rs million in fiscal  this change was primarily driven by growing sales continued reductions in raw material costs and fixed overhead and lower ess expenses the increase was partially offset by the increase in selling general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses   the following is a discussion of operating income for each of our business segments   automotive operations segment   operating income from our automotive operations increased by rs million to rs million in fiscal  compared to an operating loss of rs million in fiscal  this increase was primarily due to domestic vehicle unit sales growth of  higher finance income and continued cost reduction measures the increase was partially offset by an increase in selling general and administrative expenses   other operations segment   operating income from our other operations increased by rs million to rs million in fiscal  compared to rs million in fiscal  this increase was primarily due to general profitability improvements in the operations of consolidated subsidiaries especially in the automotive components and construction equipment businesses   other income and expenses   total nonoperating expenses decreased by  from rs million in fiscal  to rs million in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in interest expense which was partially offset by a decrease in nonoperating revenue   nonoperating revenue decreased by  from rs in fiscal  to rs million in fiscal  primarily due to nonrecurring income in fiscal  and a reduction in income from investments partially offset by income from sales of property in fiscal    interest income increased by  to rs million in fiscal  compared to rs million in fiscal  due to an increase in term deposits and interest received on certain nonrecurring refunds partially offset by declining interest rates on our deposits   interest expense decreased by  from rs million in fiscal  to rs million in fiscal  primarily due

solutions ltd and concorde motors ltd in fiscal    equity in earnings of affiliates amounted to rs million in fiscal  compared with a net loss of rs million in fiscal  this change was primarily due to improved performances by affiliates partially offset by a change in the status of concorde motors ltd from affiliate to subsidiary and the carrying value of investments in tata finance ltd an affiliate being reduced to nil in fiscal    net income   we had a turnaround performance in fiscal  with consolidated net income of rs compared to a net loss of rs million in fiscal  this was a result of     • the improvement in the performance of our automotive operations in fiscal  primarily due to a  increase in total vehicle unit sales to  and significantly lower cost of sales     • cost reduction efforts through value engineeringvalue analysis vendor consolidation commonizing components and esourcing and a reduction in conversion and fixed costs resulting in raw materials cost as a ratio to total revenues declining from  in fiscal  to  in fiscal      • reduced expenses on employee separation scheme of rs million in fiscal  compared to rs million in fiscal      • a  reduction in interest expenses from rs million to rs million due to soft interest rates in the indian economy and a  reduction in our overall debt in fiscal  compared to fiscal    critical accounting policies   the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate and reevaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience industry standards economic conditions and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on currently available information the results of these evaluations and reevaluations form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates and these estimates could differ under different assumptions we believe the following accounting policies are important to our financial condition and results and require the most significant management judgments and estimates    table of contents property plant and equipment   we state property plant and equipment at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation cost includes the purchase price taxes and duties labor cost and direct overheads for self constructed assets interest cost during the construction period and other direct costs incurred up to the date the asset is available for use   we provide depreciation at rates prescribed by the indian companies act which approximate estimated useful lives on a straightline basis   we review our estimated useful lives on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are appropriate we also test our long lived assets for impairment using undiscounted cash flows whenever events or circumstances arise that may indicate impairment if we find that a long lived asset is impaired we write its value down to our estimate of fair value we also write off any plant that relates to vehicle models that we no longer produce or that are obsolete   product warranty   vehicle warranties are provided for a specified period of time or for a number of kilometers with respect to which the vehicle is used our vehicle warranty obligations vary depending upon the type of the product geographical location of its sale and other factors   the estimated liability for vehicle warranties is recorded at the time products are sold these estimates are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible future incidence in the light of actions on product failures   changes in warranty provisions as a result of changes in estimated future warranty costs and any additional costs in excess of estimated costs relating to prior provisions can materially affect our net profit determining the amount of warranty cost provisions requires our management to estimate the frequency and amount of future claims which are inherently uncertain our policy is to continuously monitor warranty liabilities to determine the adequacy of warranty provisions and to maintain warranty provision at an amount our management deems adequate to cover estimated future warranty costs actual claims incurred in the future may differ from our original estimates which may result in a material change in warranty provisions   retirement benefits   pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates benefits earned interest cost expected return on plan assets mortality rates and other factors   any shortfall is treated as an expense in the year incurred   while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement costs and obligations and postemployment benefit costs    table of contents finance receivables deferred origination costs and allowance for credit losses   we finance vehicle sales with hire purchase financing provided to our customers finance receivables that we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balance reduced by a valuation allowance and net of any deferred origination costs   origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to the yield of the related finance receivable   we establish a specific and unallocated allowance for credit losses for finance receivables based on management’s best estimate of losses inherent in the finance receivable portfolio   b liquidity and capital resources   we fund our capital requirements through a variety of sources including cash from operations short and longterm lines of credit capital market borrowings and sales from time to time of our assets and investments we believe that we have sufficient resources available to us to meet our planned capital requirements however our sources of funding could be adversely affected by an economic slowdown in india which is beyond our control and therefore a decrease in the demand for our products and services could lead to an inability to obtain funds from external sources on acceptable terms or in a timely manner or at all   cash flow data   the

days of gross sales in fiscal  to  days in fiscal  and  days in fiscal    net cash used in investing activities was rs million rs million and rs million in fiscal   and  respectively the increase during fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily due to increases in our investments as we deployed excess cash in liquid investments and property plant and equipment and in finance receivables the

investments in affiliates and finance receivables these increases were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of properties   total capital expenditures for property plant and equipment excluding vehicles and equipment on operating leases were rs million rs million and rs million in fiscal   and  respectively the increases resulted primarily from the increase in maintenance capital expenditure   net cash used in financing activities was rs million and rs million in fiscal  and  respectively in fiscal  there was a net cash inflow of rs from financing activities the net outflow in fiscal  and  related primarily to repayments of longterm debt and shortterm borrowings and for fiscal  a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt for fiscal  the net inflow from financing activities resulted primarily from equity issuance on exercise of outstanding warrants and new debt issuances partially offset by dividend payments to shareholders   in view of our profitable performance in fiscal  and  we paid dividends in respect of both years after not declaring dividends in respect of either fiscal  or  for fiscal  we declared dividends including dividend tax thereon totaling rs million which was paid on july   for fiscal  we declared an interim dividend totaling rs million and a final dividend totaling rs million the interim dividend was paid on

sales   inventories increased during fiscal  by rs million to rs million as of march   primarily reflecting the impact of increased unit production and sales volumes however as a result of stringent inventory management and controls we reduced our inventory from the equivalent of  days of gross sales in fiscal  to  days in fiscal    gross finance receivables excluding noncurrent receivables increased during fiscal  by rs million to rs million as of march   this increase was primarily due to higher customer financing in light of increased unit sales   our investment portfolio increased by rs million during fiscal  to rs million as of march   the increase was primarily due to investments in mutual funds where we deployed surplus cash and unrealized gain on our availableforsale investments   capital expenditure   we have invested approximately rs million over the last three fiscal years to fund our planned capital expenditure and our program for the modernization of our production facilities capital expenditure totaled rs million rs million and rs million in fiscal   and  respectively our capital expenditures during the past three years have related mostly to the

modernization of existing plant property and equipment improvement of plant productivity and the quality and reliability of our products these expenditures are expected to be funded through a combination of internally generated cash existing investible surplus available in the form of cash cash equivalents and investment securities remaining proceeds from exercise of warrants as result of our rights issue in fiscal  of rs million of simultaneous but unlinked convertible and nonconvertible debentures with warrants and other external financing sources we have also agreed to purchase or arrange the purchase of preference shares issued by tata finance ltd up to a maximum amount of approximately rs million we have undertaken this obligation in order to assist tata finance ltd to secure its financing on more favorable terms and in turn to facilitate the offering of lower cost financing to our customers   liabilities and sources of financing   we fund our shortterm working capital requirements with cash generated from operations through overdraft facilities with domestic banks short and mediumterm borrowings from lending institutions and issuance of mediumterm debentures the

hedging or conversion transaction or     • a us holder as defined below whose functional currency is not the dollar   this section is based on the internal revenue code of  as amended its legislative history existing and proposed regulations published rulings and court decisions and the laws of india all as currently in effect as well as on the convention between the united states of america and india for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income the “treaty” these laws are subject to change possibly on a retroactive basis in addition this section is based in part upon the representations of the depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms   you are a us holder if you are a beneficial owner of shares or adss and you are for us federal income tax purposes     • a citizen or resident of the united states     • a domestic corporation     • an estate whose income is subject to united states federal income tax regardless of its source or     • a trust if a united states court can exercise primary supervision

states federal income and indian tax purposes if you hold adrs evidencing adss you will be treated as the owner of the shares represented by those adrs exchanges of shares for adrs and adrs for shares generally will not be subject to united states federal income or to indian tax but such exchange may give rise to indian stamp duty as described below under “— stamp duty”   taxation of dividends   indian taxation dividends paid to nonresidents of india will not be liable to tax however the company will be liable to pay a “dividend distribution tax” currently at the rate of approximately  inclusive of a surcharge on the total amount distributed as a dividend further under the union budget  an additional education cess of  is proposed to be levied on all direct and indirect taxes including dividend distribution tax distributions to nonresidents of india of additional adss or shares or rights to subscribe for such shares made with respect to adss or shares are not subject to indian tax   united states federal income taxation   us holders under the united states federal income tax laws if you are a us holder the gross amount of any dividend we pay out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for united states federal income tax purposes is subject to united states federal income taxation if you are a noncorporate us holder dividends paid to you in taxable years before january   that constitute qualified dividend income will be taxable to you at a maximum tax rate of  provided that you hold the shares or adss for more than  days during the day period beginning  days before the exdividend date and meet other holding period requirements on february   the irs announced that it will permit taxpayers to apply a proposed legislative change to the holding period requirement described in the preceding sentence as if such change were already effective this legislative “technical correction” would change the minimum required holding period retroactive to january   to more than  days during the day period beginning  days after the exdividend date dividends we pay with respect to the shares or adss generally will be qualified dividend income   the dividend is taxable to you when you in the case of shares or the depositary in the case of adss receive the dividend actually or constructively the dividend will not be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction generally allowed to united states corporations in respect of dividends received from other united states corporations dividends will be income from sources outside the united states and generally will be “passive income” or “financial services income” which is treated separately from other types of income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to you   in the case of shares the amount of the dividend distribution that you must include in your income as a us holder will be the us dollar value of the rupee payments made determined at the spot rupeeus dollar rate on the date the dividend distribution is includible in your income regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into us dollars generally any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date you include the dividend payment in income to the date you convert the payment into us dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the special tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income the gain or loss generally will be income or loss from sources within the untied states for foreign tax credit limitation purposes    table of contents distribution in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined for united states federal income tax purposes will be treated as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of your basis in the shares or adss and thereafter as capital gain   distributions of additional shares to you with respect to shares or adss that are made as part of a pro rata distribution to all of our shareholders generally will not be subject to united states federal income tax   nonus holders if you are a nonus holder dividends paid to you in respect of shares or adss will not be subject to united states federal income tax unless the dividends are “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business within the united states and the dividends are attributable to a permanent establishment that you maintain in the united states if that is required by an applicable income tax treaty as a condition for subjecting you to united states taxation on a net income basis in such cases you generally will be taxed in the same manner as a us holder if you are a corporate nonus holder “effectively connected” dividends may under certain circumstances be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a  rate or at a lower rate if you are eligible for the benefits of an income tax treaty that provides for a lower rate   taxation of capital gains   indian taxation   capital gains generally under the section ac regime any gain realized on the sale of the adss representing shares from one nonresident of india to another nonresident holder outside india is not subject to indian capital gains tax however it is unclear whether a capital gain derived from the sale of rights by a nonresident of india to another nonresident holder outside india may attract to indian capital gains tax   any gain realized on the sale of the shares by a nonresident of india to an indian resident whether in india or outside india or to a nonresident investor in india will be subject to indian capital gains tax for the purpose of computing capital gains tax on the sale of the shares under the section ac regime the cost of acquisition of shares received in exchange for adss will be determined on the basis of the prevailing price of the shares on the bse or nse as on the date on which the relevant depository gives notice to its custodian for the delivery of such shares upon redemption of the adss a nonresident holder’s holding period for purposes of determining the applicable indian capital gains tax rate in respect of shares received in exchange for adss commences on the date of the advice of withdrawal of such shares by the relevant depository to its custodian   capital gains realized in respect of shares held calculated in the manner set forth in the prior paragraph for more than  months long term gain — “long term” is defined differently under the income tax act for the purposes of listed securities in contrast with the adss is subject to tax at the rate of  plus applicable surcharge on income tax capital gain realized in respect of shares held calculated in the manner set forth in the prior paragraph for  months or less short term gain is subject to tax at variable rates with a maximum rate of  plus applicable rate of surcharge on income tax the actual rate of tax on short term gains depends on a number of factors including the legal status of the nonresident holder and the type of income chargeable in india   under the union budget  the following measures which are also applicable to registered fiis have been proposed   a long term capital gains arising on sale of shares effected on a recognized stock exchange in india would be exempt form tax this exemption is proposed to be effective after the introduction of the security transaction tax described below    table of contents b the tax on short term capital gains arising on sale of shares effected on a recognized stock exchange in india is proposed to be reduced from  to  plus applicable surcharge and an education cess of  which is proposed to be levied on all direct and indirect taxes   c a securities transaction tax of  plus an education cess of  which is proposed to be levied on all direct and indirect taxes which is proposed to be levied on all transactions on a recognized stock exchange in india the finance minister of india has proposed that this tax is to be borne equally between the buyer and the seller   tax on capital gains is to be deducted at source by the person paying for the shares in accordance with the relevant provisions of the income tax act   capital losses the section ac regime does not deal with capital losses arising on a transfer of shares in india in general terms losses arising from a transfer of a capital asset in india can only be set off against capital gains and not against any other income to the extent that the losses are not absorbed in the year of transfer they may be carried forward for a period of eight assessment years immediately succeeding the assessment year for which the loss was first computed and may be set off against the capital gains assessable for such subsequent assessment years in order to make use of capital losses in this manner the nonresident investor would be required to file appropriate and timely tax returns in india and undergo the usual assessment procedures   tax treaties dividend income is not subject to tax in india in the hands of the holder of the shares if any shares are held by a us holder following withdrawal thereof from the depository facility under the deposit agreement provisions of any double taxation treaty if any entered into by india with the country of residence of such us holder will be applicable to taxation of any capital gain arising from transfer of such shares   however during the period of fiduciary ownership of shares in the hands of the overseas depository bank the provisions of double taxation avoidance agreement entered into by the government of india with the country of residence of the overseas depository bank will be applicable in the matter of taxation of capital gains in respect of adss   stamp duty under indian law any transfer of adss will be exempt from liability to indian stamp duty purchasers of shares who seek to register such shares on the share register of the company are required to pay indian stamp duty at the rate of rs for every rs or part thereof of the market value of such shares in order to register a transfer of shares in the physical form with the company it is necessary to present a stamped deed of transfer an acquisition of shares in physical form from the depository in exchange for adss representing such shares will not render an investor liable to indian stamp duty but the company will be required to pay stamp duty at the applicable rate on the share certificate however since our shares are compulsorily deliverable in dematerialized form except for trades of up to  shares which may be delivered in physical form no stamp duty is payable on the acquisition or transfer of shares in dematerialized form   service tax brokerage or commission fees paid to stockbrokers in india in connection with the sale or purchase of shares are now subject to an indian service tax of  further under the union budget  it is proposed to increase the rate of service tax from  to  and to levy a  education cess on all direct and indirect taxes including service tax a stockbroker is responsible for collecting such service tax at such rate and for paying the same to the relevant authority    table of contents united states federal income taxation   us holders if you are a us holder and you sell or otherwise dispose of your shares or adss you will recognize capital gain or loss for united states federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the dollar value of the amount that you realize and your tax basis determined in dollars in your shares or adss capital gain of a noncorporate us holder that is recognized before january   is generally taxed at a maximum rate of  where the holder has a holding period greater than one year the gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the united states for foreign tax credit limitation purposes   subject to certain limitations indian withholding tax will be creditable against your united states federal income tax liability in the case of income to which indian withholding for shortterm capital gains applies the income may be general limitation income rather than passive income   nonus holders if you are a nonus holder you will not be subject to united states federal income tax on gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of your shares or adss unless     • the gain is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states and the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment that you maintain in the united states if that is required by an applicable income tax treaty as a condition for subjecting you to united states taxation on a net income basis or     • you are an individual you are present in the united states for  or more days in the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions exist   if you are a corporate nonus holder “effectively connected” gains that you recognize may also under certain circumstances be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a  rate or at a lower rate if you are eligible for the benefits of an income tax treaty that provides for a lower rate   pfic rules we believe that shares and adss should not be treated as stock of a pfic for united states federal income tax purposes but this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to change   backup withholding and information reporting   if you are a noncorporate us holder information reporting requirements on internal revenue service form  generally will apply to     • dividend payments or other taxable distributions made to you within the united states and     • the payment of proceeds to you from the sale of shares or adss effected at a united states office of a broker   additionally backup withholding may apply to such payments if you are a noncorporate us holder that     • fails to

income tax returns or    table of contents   • in certain circumstances fails to comply with applicable certification requirements   payment of the proceeds from the sale of shares or adss effected at a foreign office of a broker generally will not be subject to information reporting or backup withholding however a sale of shares or adss that is effected at a foreign office of a broker will be subject to information reporting and backup withholding if     • the proceeds are transferred to an account maintained by you in the united states     • the payment of proceeds or the confirmation of the sale is mailed to you at a united states address or     • the sale has some other specified connection with the united states as provided in us treasury regulations   unless the broker does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a united states person and the documentation requirements described above are met or you otherwise establish an exemption   in addition a sale of shares or adss effected at a foreign office of a broker will be subject to information reporting if the broker is     • a united states person     • a controlled foreign corporation for united states tax purposes     • a foreign person  or more of whose gross income is effectively connected with the conduct of a united states trade or business for a specified threeyear period or     • a foreign partnership if at any time during its tax year     • one or more of its partners are “us persons” as defined in us treasury regulations who in the aggregate hold more than  of the income or capital interest in the partnership or     • such foreign partnership is engaged in the conduct of a united states trade or business   unless the broker does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a united states person and the documentation requirements described above are met or you otherwise establish an exemption backup withholding will apply if the sale is subject to information reporting and the broker has actual knowledge that you are a united states person   you generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules that exceed your income

interest rates and foreign exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments including interest rate option contracts and currency swap agreements the application of which is primarily for hedging purposes and not for speculative purposes   interest rate and swap agreements   our exposure to interest rate risks relates primarily to     • our long term debt which is normally utilized to finance capital expenditure     • our investment in marketable securities and     • finance receivables    table of contents we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing investing and cash management activities we enter into various financial instrument transactions to maintain the desired level of exposure to the risk of interest rate fluctuations and to minimize interest expense we have entered into exchange traded future and option contracts interest rate caps and floors along with various investments to reduce the interest rate risk related to these activities   there are particular shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented below the model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve however in reality changes are rarely instantaneous although some assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates also the interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates while interest rates on other types of assets may lag behind changes in market rates   the sensitivity to a change in interest rates of  on our unhedged floating rate loans as at march   and march   is rs million and rs million respectively the sensitivity to a change in interest rates of  on the value of our portfolio of marketable securities as at march   is rs million we did not have any marketable securities as of march     we may have a prepayment and default risk with respect to our finance receivables due to any change in interest rates based on our model with certain assumptions the sensitivity to a  change in interest rates on the prepayment risk that is perceived by us on unearned finance charges as at march   and  is rs million and rs million respectively the sensitivity to a change in interest rates of  on the default written offs amounts as at march   and  is rs million and rs million respectively on the unsecuritized portion of our finance receivables   foreign exchange risk   the following table sets forth information relating to our foreign currency debt exposure for the periods indicated        as at march     as at march       percent  total foreign currency denominated debt as percentage of total outstanding debt         total us debt as percentage of total outstanding debt           we have foreign currency exposure related to buying selling and financing in currencies primarily in the dollar other than the local currencies in which we operate we are also exposed to foreign currency risk related to future earnings or assets and liabilities that are exposed due to operating cash flows and various financial instruments that are denominated in foreign currencies   we use derivative instruments primarily to hedge our foreign exchange exposure and also to hedge our interest rate exposure nevertheless a weakening of the rupee against the dollar and other major foreign currencies may have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing and consequently may increase the cost of financing our capital expenditures in addition we have experienced and expect to continue to experience foreign exchange losses and gains on obligations denominated in foreign currencies in respect of our borrowings   the sensitivity to a change in currency prices of  per us on our unhedged foreign currency loans as at march   and  is rs million and rs million respectively    table of contents we completely hedge our exports however some of our imports remain unhedged the sensitivity to a  change in exchange rates of individual currencies against the rupee for the unhedged portion of our imports as at march   and  is rs million and rs million respectively   investment price risk   the fair value of some of our investments in availableforsale securities exposes us to equity price risks in general these securities are not held for trading purposes these investments are subject to changes in the market prices of the securities the fair value of our availableforsale securities as of march   and  was rs million and rs million respectively a  change in equity prices of availableforsale securities held as at march   and  would result in an impact of rs million and rs million respectively   commodity price risk   commodity price risk is the possibility of impact from changes in the prices of commodities such as nonferrous metals like aluminum ferrous alloys like steel and others like rubber which we use in the production of automotive vehicles and their components we do not use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of these commodities however we cover some of these risks through longterm purchase contracts   item  description of securities other than equity securities   a debt securities   not applicable   b warrants

principal balances reduced by a valuation allowance and are reported net of any deferred origination costs   origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to yield of the related finance receivable   the company establishes a specific and unallocated allowance for credit losses for finance receivables in accordance with sfas no  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan as amended by sfas no  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan—income recognition and disclosures an amendment of fasb statement no  based on management’s best estimate of losses inherent in the finance receivable portfolio   f table of contents the company considers a finance receivable to be impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that the company will be unable to collect scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the financing agreement   the company provides a specific allowance for credit losses for loan receivables and hire purchase receivables that are in arrears for two quarters or four quarters or more respectively in an amount equivalent to the outstanding principal and interest balance   finance receivables comprise small homogeneous balances such balances are collectively evaluated for impairment at each balance sheet date and an unallocated allowance for credit losses is established based on historical losses incurred   the allowance for credit losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management’s view of the probability of recovery of receivables in light of historical experience adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay the estimated value of any underlying collateral amounts that may be recoverable from originating dealers factors affecting the industry which the receivable exposure relates to and prevailing economic conditions this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available   credit losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the balance cannot be recovered subsequent recoveries and proceeds from auctions of repossessed vehicles are credited to the allowance   repossessed vehicles   vehicles repossessed from delinquent financing customers and held for auction are recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance and estimated net realizable value gains or losses on disposal are recorded when the vehicles are sold     n

not classified as heldtomaturity and retained interests in sold receivables are classified as availableforsale and recorded at fair value unrealized gains and losses on such securities net of applicable taxes are reported in other comprehensive income a separate component of shareholders’ equity   f table of contents retained interests in sold receivables are initially measured at fair value determined by an external credit rating process considering various factors principally the expected credit losses the age of the receivables portfolio expected prepayments and the credit rating of the company these retained interests are not quoted and therefore subsequent fair values are determined based on a valuation model that takes account of various assumptions such as the shortfall in collections prepayments the age of the portfolio and other assumptions these fair values are usually certified by the special purpose entities   equity securities that do not have readily determinable market values are accounted for in accordance with apb opinion no  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock and are carried at original cost   declines in the fair values below cost that are other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses   the cost in respect of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method     q property plant and equipment   property plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation   cost includes the purchase price taxes and duties labor cost and direct overheads for self constructed assets and other direct costs incurred up to the date the asset is available for use   interest cost incurred for constructed assets is capitalized up to the date the asset is available for use based on borrowings incurred specifically for financing the asset or the weighted average rate of all other borrowings if no specific borrowings have been incurred for the

furniture and fixtures     to    depreciation on assets taken on capital lease is provided over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the primary period of the lease   depreciation is not provided on capital workinprogress until construction and installation are complete and the asset is ready for its intended use   in respect of the assets of the company whose estimated useful lives are revised the unamortized depreciable amount is expensed prospectively over the revised remaining useful life     r leases   assets acquired under capital leases are initially recognized at the lower of the fair value of the leased assets at inception and the present value of minimum lease payments lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the outstanding liability finance charges are allocated to periods during the lease term at a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability   f table of contents   s impairment of longlived assets   whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of longlived assets may not be recoverable the company subjects such assets to a test of recoverability based on the undiscounted cash flows from use or disposition of the asset if the asset is impaired the company recognizes an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the lower of its fair value and net realizable value as of march   and  none of the company’s longlived assets was considered impaired   in addition the undepreciated cost of any assets that are abandoned or plant that relates to discontinued models is expensed     t goodwill and other intangible assets   purchased intangible assets other than goodwill primarily consist of technology knowhow that is valued at acquisition cost and is amortized over its useful life of two to six years   purchased goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are capitalized such intangibles are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or when significant events occur that indicate that the fair value is less than its carrying value the company determines fair value by estimating the present value of expected future cash flows     u derivative instruments   tata motors is party to a variety of foreign exchange rate interest rate and foreign currency forward contracts entered

both us gaap and indian gaap require consolidation of subsidiaries the basis for determining whether an investee is a subsidiary or an affiliate is different us gaap requires the consolidation of entities where we have a direct or indirect majority voting interest or if we are a primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity indian gaap requires the consolidation of entities where we exercise control through a direct holding or through another subsidiary as a result three entities namely tata autocomp systems concorde motors and tata precision industries have been treated as subsidiaries under us gaap whereas under indian gaap these entities are accounted for as equity method affiliates in addition the amounts consolidated under us gaap are the us gaap earnings of these entities whereas the equity method amounts included in the indian gaap consolidated financial statements are their indian gaap results   net assets acquired are considered at book value under indian gaap the excess of book value of net assets acquired over the purchase consideration is recognized as capital reserve under shareholders’ equity under indian gaap net assets acquired are considered at fair values under us gaap the excess of fair values of net assets acquired over the purchase consideration is first allocated to reduce the amounts otherwise assigned to the eligible acquired longterm assets and any excess remaining is recognized as extraordinary income under us gaap   a table of contents b property plant and equipment   under us gaap all foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are included in net income and are not includible in interest cost that may be capitalized during the construction period under indian gaap foreign exchange gains and losses arising on foreign currency denominated borrowings that are incurred to acquire fixed assets are included in the cost of the asset and depreciated over its remaining useful life and any such exchange gains or losses arising during the construction period are included in borrowing costs capitalizable as a part of the cost of the asset   under indian gaap the cost of fixed assets also includes indirect preoperative expenses that are incurred before a constructed plant is ready for its intended use under us gaap such costs are expensed as incurred   under us gaap any plant relating specifically to a vehicle model that has been discontinued or abandoned is subject to impairment testing and if impaired is written off under indian gaap mandatory impairment testing is required with effect from april     depreciation and related deferred income taxes relating to the above differences in the cost of property plant and equipment between us gaap and indian gaap have also been adjusted   c deferred revenue expenses   under us gaap expenses relating to the development of new vehicle models and all startup costs are expensed as incurred under indian gaap such costs are capitalized as deferred revenue expenses and are amortized   deferred revenue expenses also include employee separation cost under us gaap expenses relating to voluntary employee separation programs are expensed when employees accept a separation offer under indian gaap these costs are deferred and amortized   d compensated absences   under us gaap a liability for compensated absences is established based on leave earned but not utilized at each balance sheet date and changes in the liability are included in net income under indian gaap a liability is established for the actuarially determined present value of the amount expected to be paid   e retirement benefits   under both us gaap and indian gaap a liability is established for the actuarially determined present value of future pension benefits and for post retirement benefits other than pensions however actuarial methods and the basis for selecting actuarial assumptions primarily the discount rate differ under us gaap and indian gaap resulting in different estimates of the liability at each balance sheet date   under us gaap the discount rate is based on the rate at which pension obligations could be settled which in turn references high quality corporate bonds available in the market under indian gaap the discount rate is selected at the discretion of a professional actuary in accordance with a variety of factors specified in the actuarial society of india’s guidance note  generally the discount rates in india would be based on typical yields in a funded portfolio of assets and are not benchmarked to any financial instruments available in the market   a table of contents additionally a pension liability under us gaap is measured at the start of the fiscal year and us gaap permits certain items to be amortized over a number of years under indian gaap pension liabilities are measured as at the balance sheet date and indian gaap does not permit deferral of actuarial gains and losses   f imputation of interest   under us gaap interest is imputed for notes receivable or payable such as our sales tax deferral loan where the stated rate of interest differs from the market rate applicable to the company under indian gaap such interest cost or income is generally not recognized in the financial statements   g debt issue expenses   under us gaap debt issue expenses are amortized over the life of the instrument using the interest method under indian gaap such expenses are either charged directly to the securities premium account or are deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over five years   h loss on early extinguishment of debt   under us gaap any loss arising on the early extinguishment of debt is reported as an expense under indian gaap losses on early redemptions of certain debt instruments may be charged directly to the securities premium account   i interest on debt with detachable warrants   under us gaap the proceeds from the issue of debt with a detachable stock purchase warrant are allocated between the debt and the warrant based on their respective fair values additionally under us gaap the proceeds of debt issued with a beneficial conversion feature at inception are allocated to the host contract and the embedded option based on the intrinsic value of the conversion feature at inception under indian gaap such allocations are not made accordingly the yield on debt with detachable warrants or debt with beneficial conversion features at inception under us gaap is higher than it would be under indian gaap   j deferred tax   under us gaap a deferred tax liability is established for the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis and the carrying value of assets and liabilities the tax rate used to establish deferred tax liabilities is the enacted tax rate expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse under indian gaap a deferred tax liability is established for the tax effect of timing differences between book and tax income for the year at the “substantially enacted” tax rate applicable on the balance sheet date in addition in the us gaap financial statements any deferred tax effect of other us gaap to indian gaap differences is also recognized   k valuation of investments   under us gaap investments are classified into trading held to maturity or available for sale based on management’s holding intent on the date of acquisition we do not have any trading investments available for sale investments consisting of debt securities and equity securities with readily determinable   a table of contents market values are carried at their fair values with any unrealized gains or losses recorded in accumulated comprehensive income a component of shareholders’ equity held to maturity investments are carried at amortized cost equity securities without a readily determinable market value are carried at cost an impairment loss is recognized for any impairment that is other than temporary   under indian gaap investments are classified into current and longterm investments current investments are carried at the lower of cost or market while long term investments are carried at cost less any impairments that are other than temporary   l dividends   under us gaap dividends payable are recorded as a liability when declared under indian gaap dividends payable are recorded as a liability in the year to which they
