products and solar mounting and commercial greenhouses pedal to the metal gibraltar has had quite a run this year up around  ytd i first wrote about the stock as a bull of the day when it was a zacks  rank in early december and trading in the mids and i chose rock for bull of the day again in august after i bought shares looking for the next breakout above  heres what i said then construction markets are still strong and how about  more earnings beats for the rock  two of them by over  plus analysts are still scrambling to raise estimates in the past  days the fullyear  consensus rose from  to  and  profit projections rose from  to  also worth noting in q goldman sachs added  shares of rock to their portfolios whats changed since august another earnings beat and raised guidance thats what the q beat reported on october  was only  but the company raised its fullyear  adjusted earnings within the range of  per share from  per share previously stated analysts responded by raising their estimates thus making rock a zacks  rank again for the fullyear  the eps consensus jumped from  to  representing  growth and  profit projections have moved up twice in the last month from  to  and then again to  in the last week signaling  growth the only disappointment in the quarter was that gibraltar industries net sales were  million down  year over year the top line also missed the

million down  year over year segmental sales declined due to lower sale of postal products adjusted operating margin was  up  bps year over year the improvement was attributable to greater operational efficiency accomplishment of the centralized mailbox contract and early receivables from the  simplification plan industrial and infrastructure products yielded revenues of  million down  year over year the decline stemmed from the divestiture of the companys industrial business in europe lower volume of orders from energyrelated markets construction postponements for major infrastructure projects and augmented competition in pricing the segments adjusted operating margin was  down  bps year over year the downside was witnessed due to reduced volumes and weaker customer pricing as cost of raw materials increased the renewable energy  conservation segments revenues came in at  million in the quarter under review flat year over year gibraltar industries exited the third quarter with
