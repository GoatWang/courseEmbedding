product development department offshore product development focuses on the launch sale and marketing of funds off the domestic shore of the united states legal regulations vary considerably in different countries and offshore product development staffers must work carefully with legal and compliance departments to make certain that the funds are compliant for each country in which they are issued sales and marketing approaches must also be tweaked depending upon the country in which the investment vehicle is issued  especially when a particular country has important cultural traits to consider when determining successful marketing and sales strategies some staffers within product development choose to specialize in offshore marketing due to these compelling challenges however when

legal department in order to go over the prospectus for the launch of a new fund right after that meeting there may be a similar gathering within the compliance department in order to go over compliance issues with that same fund that is due to launch in the near future over lunch the product development department may informally eat together in order to compare notes and discuss the latest developments on fund launches the afternoon may bring meetings with the sales and marketing departments in order to discuss another investment vehicle that has recently launched topics might be on the collateral required to sell the fund or briefing the sales force on the best way to position the sale of the fund with potential investors finally before the staffer heads home that day he or she may pour over competitor pricing data in order to consider a pricing strategy for a new fund product about to launch some of these reports may find their way into the staffers briefcase to continue to assess over dinner or at home pursuing the product development dreamproduct development is a challenging  but ultimately rewarding  career path within an investment management firm those in product development have their fingers on the pulse of exciting new fund launches and are integral in developing the strategies behind new products if you like the idea of being at the center of

days locationprague nh hotel prague the process of idea generation in asset management how to identify global economic and regulatory trends structuring and developing of investment products underlying payoff and investment style fund setup fund administration and maintenance distribution service providers and transfer agents regulatory constraints in asset management how regulation impact the structuring of new products workshop objectives the purpose of this workshop is for participants to learn about the art of product development in asset management product development is a multidisciplinary activity and requires different skills from different areas a project manager is in the crossroads of all departments within fund management companies sales compliance legal risk investment teams operational teams etc and needs to acquire a general understanding of the different constraints of all these teams his objectives are  to identify client needs and provide investment ideas for the origination of new products and  manage the project from a to z making sure that all parameters from the different teams have been optimised this workshop will provide a detailed analysis of what a product manager should take into account in his activity of product origination key points there are two keys aspects that must be taken into account when originating a new investment product the first one is what we could call its economic substance which would need to meet the client needs obligation and financial constraints the second one is what we could call the legal substance or the regulatory format also called the wrapping of the product that must be structured in a way to optimise legal and regulatory cost this workshop will emphasizes these two main points by providing concrete and detailed materials who should attend product managers and fund structurers that are in charge of developing new projects in the field of asset management companies product managers or team members dedicated to specific teams compliance team legal team operational team risk team marketing team etc that take part in development and origination project methodology the workshop is taught using both theoretical theory and practical and interactive case studies economic structuring will require the use of excel to price financial instruments that are used to match more precisely the client needs regulatory structuring will require the study of the regulation in detail and its application through detailed key study excel may be used for this purpose as well    welcome and introduction   0 the process of idea generation in this chapter we will talk about methodology for idea generation in asset management while a bottomup approach is the main approach used sales or client feedback market watch etc a topdown approach may sometime provide a competitive advantage for product managers for this heshe will need to identify global economic and regulatory trends emergence of a new sector change of policies new regulation impacting some clients etc that may impact your clients the objective is to anticipate their future needs and offer customised and tailored solution different practical case will be provided using my personal experience as fund structurer such as  multiasset income fund or autocall payoff in formula fund or high yield etfs for retail clients in a context of a low yield environment and  providing more transparency on hedge funds to insurance companies in a context of solvency ii implementation 0   underlying payoff and investment style the second phase of product development is the actual economic structuring of the project three aspects must be taken into account carefully one is the underlying or the asset class that will ultimately deliver the performance of the product second is the payoff the idea is to use specific financial instruments or management technics to modify the risk profile of an underlying to match in more details the needs of the client we will study how the use of options and insurance portfolio technics can achieve this objective different study case and excel exercise will be done to see how these technics can modify the economic profile of a product third is the investment style will the product be managed actively by an asset manager or use passive management technics to achieve more transparencies    lunch    fund setup fund administration  maintenance distribution and service providers approval process and passporting will be detailed in this section ucits directive and aifm directive propose the possibility to passport funds in europe this process will be developed during the life of a fund terms and condition may change which lead to an amendment of the prospectus and other key materials this process is submitted to specific rules and condition that will be detailed a mapping of all the different service providers will be developed with a specific focus on the administrator in charge of the nav calculation and the accounting of investment funds the transfer agent in charge of the reception centralisation aggregations of subscriptionredemption and the holding of registers and the distributor in charge of dealing with the endclient directly in this respect liquidity and subscription  redemption schedule need careful attention to ensure equal treatment of unitholders they will depend on the liquidity of the underlying but also on the operational organisation of all different service providers we will also focus on some operational aspects that need careful attention such as fees we will here develop the different type of fees and their calculation methods ongoing fees upfront fees performance fees etc the structure of class of shares structure of subfunds within umbrella structures masterfeeder etc day two this second day will focus on regulatory constraints which will impact how investment products are structured in the first part of this second day we will present the current regulatory framework in asset management in europe and we will focus on the rules that significantly impact the structure of funds this first chapter will help to understand what will follow in the second chapter in this second chapter we will focus on the impact of regulation on the global structure of the investment product and on the rationales that determine the optimal wrapper for a new investment product 0   regulation in asset management in this section we will discuss where we stand in terms of regulation in europe ucits remains the main regulatory framework in europe for retail funds this regulation will be presented and the main changes from ucits i to ucits v will be highlighted as well as the discussed topics toward ucits vi more specifically we will concentrate on the rules that significantly impact the structure of funds for example the way leverage limits are measure eligibility of assets and indices are defined shape the way funds are originated in this chapter many different practical cases will be used using excel to illustrate how investment restrictions are applied in practice for example the way leverage is calculated and the way diversification requirement is measured    lunch    how regulation impact the structuring of new products in this section we will discuss how regulation will impact the whole structure of an investment product structure of etfs newcits formula funds and structured funds highly depend on investment restrictions within the ucits framework index strategy smart beta index which are often sold through ucits structure are shaped by those regulatory constraints fund structuring will also depend on tax consideration which will determine the type of instruments that needs to be used    determination of the optimal legal wrapper finally the choice of the legal wrapper is another important part of product management sophisticated fund managers have usually different options lux funds ucits or not irish funds ucits or not contractual funds cayman funds jersey funds mauritius funds etc in this chapter we will study the parameters that need to be taken into account when deciding which wrapper must be used clients profile and their restrictions must be taken into account as well as the global pricing of the structure we will elaborate on what makes the pricing of the different wrappers and provide some estimates about their levels evaluation and termination of the seminar more   site map    policy statements    mobile version copyright 0
