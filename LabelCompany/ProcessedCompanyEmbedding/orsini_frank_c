“countdowntochristmasscenedevice” as stated in claim  that may play christmas songs as part of its function description field and background of invention there are many december devicescalendars december  to anticipate christmas day december th as well as other events during the year new years eve birthdays easter etc put simply this invention was thought of as a way for children and adults alike as a way to enhance their anticipation of the arrival on christmas with lights and flair there are many “calendars” out there for the month of december but nothing that specifically counts down the “ days to christmas” some devicescalendars have “popout” windowsboxes which reveal a treat or a story some use candy some are configured with the standard columns and rows like a regular calendar some have individual pieces to mark the days or numbers and yet some are blank for individuals to mark the days themselves the  days before christmas during the christmas season represent and always mark the “highest” time of anticipation to christmas day as you will see the “countdowntochristmasscenedevice” is a new and improved christmas holiday anticipation product and far superior to the prior art of holiday calendars further all prior art is based on manual participation of a person open set squares write on a board move pieces or objects the countdowntochristmasscenedevice uses modern technology is electrical plugin or battery operated has lights and uses a preset or the atomic clock us pat no —jun   holiday countdown consists of fabric with ribbons that attach to it marking

“days” and “weeks” us pat no —sep   calendar organizer this invention is for identifying important events holidays vacations bill payments etcsummery of invention undoubtedly you can picture what was previously stated and the uniqueness of the product however in summery the countdowntochristmasscenedevice uses modern technology to count down the  days to christmas like no other product the prior art is made of paper or another form of fabric has spaces for all or a portion of the days of a month but most off all they dont single out the  days to christmas non not patent  or  or  or  or
