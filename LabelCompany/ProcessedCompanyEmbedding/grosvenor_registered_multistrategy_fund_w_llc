to time pursuant to policies established by the board of directors the board pursuant to the valuation procedures the board has delegated to the adviser the general responsibility for valuation of the master funds underlying investments the portfolio funds subject to the oversight by the board the master fund board has approved procedures pursuant to which the master fund will value its investments in portfolio funds at fair value generally at an amount equal to the nav of the master funds investment in the portfolio funds as determined by portfolio funds general partner or investment manager if no such information is available or if such information is deemed to not be reflective of fair value by the adviser an estimated fair value is determined in good faith by the adviser pursuant to the master funds valuation procedures generally the navs of the investments in the portfolio funds are determined whereby the master fund records the investment and subsequent subscriptions at its acquisition cost which represents its fair value at the time of subscription the investment is adjusted to reflect the master funds share of net investment income or loss and unrealized and realized gain or loss that reflects the changes in the fair value of the investment for the period the portfolio funds record their investments at fair value in accordance with gaap or international financial reporting standards the portfolio funds generally hold positions in readily marketable securities and derivatives that are valued at quoted market values andor less liquid nonmarketable securities and derivatives that are valued at estimated fair value accordingly valuations do not necessarily represent the amounts that might be realized from the sale or other dispositions of investments nor do they reflect other expenses or fees that might be incurred upon disposition the mix and concentration of more readily marketable securities and less liquid nonmarketable securities varies across the portfolio funds based on various factors including the nature of their investment strategy and market forces because of the inherent uncertainty of

master funds net assets additionally the governing documents of the portfolio funds generally provide that the portfolio funds may suspend limit or delay the right of their investors such as the master fund to withdraw capital the primary restrictions applicable to individual portfolio funds as of june   are described in detail on the master funds schedule of investments the master fund uses a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price accordingly the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows        level   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities that the master fund has the ability to access at the measurement date        level   quoted prices which are not considered to be active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability and        level   prices inputs or modeling techniques which are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable supported by little or no market activity the preparation of the schedule of investments in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the schedule of investments and accompanying notes management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the master funds schedule of investments are reasonable and prudent however the actual results could differ from these estimates the master fund applies the authoritative guidance under gaap for estimating the fair value of investments in the portfolio funds that have calculated their navs in accordance with the specialized accounting guidance for investment companies accordingly the master fund estimates the fair value of an investment in a portfolio fund using the nav of the investment or its equivalent without further adjustment unless the adviser determines that the nav is deemed to be not reflective of the fair value investments may be classified as level  when market information eg observable navs is available yet the investment is not traded in an active market andor the investment is subject to transfer restrictions or the valuation is adjusted to reflect illiquidity andor nontransferability market information including observable navs subscription and redemption activity at the underlying portfolio fund and the length of time until the investment will become redeemable is considered when determining the proper categorization of the investments fair value measurement within the fair valuation hierarchy portfolio fund investment lots that have observable market inputs eg published navs and that the master fund has the ability to redeem from within twelve months of the balance sheet date are classified in the fair value hierarchy as level    grosvenor registered multistrategy master fund llc notes to schedule of investments unaudited continued june     the master funds investments in the portfolio funds that have unobservable inputs andor from which the master fund does not have the ability to redeem within twelve months are classified in the fair value hierarchy as level  when observable prices are not available for these securities the master fund uses the market approach as defined in the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements to evaluate the fair value of such level  instruments although the master fund does not have the ability to redeem from the portfolio funds classified in level  of the fair value hierarchy within twelve months of the measurement date these portfolio funds may transact with other investors at the nav of the investment or its equivalent in certain circumstances the adviser may make adjustments to the reported nav of a portfolio fund when it believes that the reported nav is not representative of fair value specifically for certain portfolio funds in liquidation the reported nav is adjusted based on the advisers estimate of the net realizable value of the portfolio fund in liquidation as of june   approximately  million or  of
