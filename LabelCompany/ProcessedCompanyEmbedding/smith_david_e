labor theory of value  wikipedia labor theory of value from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the labor theory of value ltv is a theory of value that argues that the economic value of a good or service is determined by the total amount of socially necessary labor required to produce it rather than by the use or pleasure its owner gets from it at present this concept is usually associated with marxian economics although it is also used in the theories of earlier liberal economists such as adam smith and david ricardo and later also in anarchist economics contents  definitions of value and labor  distinctions of economically pertinent labor  ltv and the labor process  relation between values and prices  history  origins  adam smith and david ricardo  anarchism  karl marx  criticisms  a generalization of labor theory of value  see also  competing theories  notes  references  further reading definitions of value and laboredit when speaking in terms of a labor theory of value value without any qualifying adjective should theoretically refer to the amount of labor necessary to produce a marketable commodity including the labor necessary to develop any real capital used in the production both david ricardo and karl marx tried to quantify and embody all labor components in order to develop a theory of the real price or natural price of a commodity however the labor theory of value as presented by adam smith did not require the quantification of past labor—nor did it deal with the labor needed to create the tools capital that might be used in producing a commodity smiths theory of value was very similar to the later utility theories in that smith proclaimed that a commodity was worth whatever labor it would command in others value in trade or whatever labor it would save the self value in use or both but this value is subject to supply and demand at a particular time the real price of every thing what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it is the toil and trouble of acquiring it what every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it and who wants to dispose of it or exchange it for something else is the toil and trouble which it can save to himself and which it can impose upon other people wealth of nations book  chapter v smiths theory of price which for many is the same as value has nothing to do with the past labor spent in producing a commodity it speaks only of the labor that can be commanded or saved at present if there is no use for a buggy whip then the item is economically worthless in trade or in use regardless of all the labor spent in creating it distinctions of economically pertinent laboredit value in use is the usefulness of this commodity its utility a classical paradox often comes up when considering this type of value in the words of adam smith the word value it is to be observed has two different meanings and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys the one may be called value in use  the other value in exchange the things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange and on the contrary those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use nothing is more useful than water but it will purchase scarce any thing scarce any thing can be had in exchange for it a diamond on the contrary has scarce any value in use but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it wealth of nations book  chapter iv value in exchange is the relative proportion with which this commodity exchanges for another commodity in other words its price in the case of money it is relative to labor as explained by adam smith the value of any commodity  to the person who possesses it and who means not to use or consume it himself but to exchange it for other commodities is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or command labour therefore is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities wealth of nations book l chapter v emphasis added value without qualification is the labor embodied in a commodity under a given structure of production marx defined the value of the commodity by the third definition in his terms value is the socially necessary abstract labor embodied in a commodity to ricardo and other classical economists this definition serves as a measure of real cost absolute value or a measure of value invariable under changes in distribution and technology ricardo other classical economists and marx began their expositions with the assumption that value in exchange was equal to or proportional to this labor value they thought this was a good assumption from which to explore the dynamics of development in capitalist societies other supporters of the labor theory of value used the word value in the second sense to represent exchange value ltv and the labor processedit since the term value is understood in the ltv as denoting something created by labor and its magnitude as something proportional to the quantity of labor performed it is important to explain how the labor process both preserves value and adds new value in the commodities it createsnote  the value of a commodity increases in proportion to the duration and intensity of labor performed on average for its production part of what the ltv means by socially necessary is that the value only increases in proportion to this labor as it is performed with average skill and average productivity so though workers may labor with greater skill or more productivity than others these more skillful and more productive workers thus produce more value through the production of greater quantities of the finished commodity each unit still bears the same value as all the others of the same class of commodity by working sloppily unskilled workers may drag down the average skill of labor thus increasing the average labor time necessary for the production of each unit commodity but these unskillful workers cannot hope to sell the result of their labor process at a higher price as opposed to value simply because they have spent more time than other workers producing the same kind of commodities however production not only involves labor but also certain means of labor tools materials power plants and so on these means of labor—also known as means of production—are often the product of another labor process as well so the labor process inevitably involves these means of production that already enter the process with a certain amount of value labor also requires other means of production that are not produced with labor and therefore bear no value such as sunlight air uncultivated land unextracted minerals etc while useful even crucial to the production process these bring no value to that process in terms of means of production resulting from another labor process ltv treats the magnitude of value of these produced means of production as constant throughout the labor process due to the constancy of their value these means of production are referred to in this light as constant capital consider for example workers who take coffee beans use a roaster to roast them and then use a brewer to brew and dispense a fresh cup of coffee in performing this labor these workers add value to the coffee beans and water that comprise the material ingredients of a cup of coffee the worker also transfers the value of constant capital—the value of the beans some specific depreciated value of the roaster and the brewer and the value of the cup—to the value of the final cup of coffee again on average the worker can transfer no more than the value of these means of labor previously possessed to the finished cup of coffeenote  so the value of coffee produced in a day equals the sum of both the value of the means of labor—this constant capital—and the value newly added by the worker in proportion to the duration and intensity of their work often this is expressed mathematically as c  l  w   relation between values and pricesedit one issue facing the ltv is the relationship between value quantities on one hand and prices on the other if a commoditys value is not the same as its price and therefore the magnitudes of each likely differ then what is the relation between the two if any various ltv schools of thought provide different answers to this question for example some argue that value in the sense of the amount of labor embodied in a good acts as a center of gravity for price however most economists would say that cases where pricing is even approximately equalclarify to the value of the labor embodied are only special cases and not the general case in the standard formulation prices also normally include a level of income for capital and land these incomes are known as profit and rent respectively in book  chapter vi adam smith writes the real value of all the different component parts of price it must be observed is measured by the quantity of labour which they can each of them purchase or command labour measures the value not only of that part of price which resolves itself into labour but of that which resolves itself into rent and of that which resolves itself into profit the final sentence explains how smith sees value of a product as relative to labor of buyer or consumer as opposite to marx who sees the value of a product being proportional to labor of laborer or producer and we value things price them based on how much labor we can avoid or command and we can command labor not only in a simple way but also by trading things for a profit the demonstration of the relation between commodities unit values and their respective prices is known in marxian terminology as the transformation problem or the transformation of values into prices of production the transformation problem has probably generated the greatest bulk of debate about the ltv the problem with transformation is to find an algorithm where the magnitude of value added by labor in proportion to its duration and intensity is sufficiently accounted for after this value is distributed through prices that reflect an equal rate of return on capital advanced if there is an additional magnitude of value or a loss of value after transformation then the relation between values proportional to labor and prices proportional to total capital advanced is incomplete various solutions and impossibility theorems have been offered for the transformation but the debate has not reached any clear resolution ltv does not deny the role of supply and demand influencing price since the price of a commodity is something other than its value in value price and profit  karl marx quotes adam smith and sums up it suffices to say that if supply and demand equilibrate each other the market prices of commodities will correspond with their natural prices that is to say with their values as determined by the respective quantities of labor required for their production the ltv seeks to explain the level of this equilibrium this could be explained by a cost of production argument—pointing out that all costs are ultimately labor costs but this does not account for profit and it is vulnerable to the charge of tautology in that it explains prices by prices marx later called this smiths adding up theory of value smith argues that labor values are the natural measure of exchange for direct producers like hunters and fishermen marx on the other hand uses a measurement analogy arguing that for commodities to be comparable they must have a common element or substance by which to measure them and that labor is a common substance of what marx eventually calls commodityvalues historyedit originsedit the labor theory of value has developed over many centuries it had no single originator but rather many different thinkers arrived at the same conclusion independently aristotle is claimed to hold to this view some writers trace its origin to thomas aquinas in his summa theologiae – he expresses the view that  value can does and should increase in relation to the amount of labor which has been expended in the improvement of commodities scholars such as joseph schumpeter have cited ibn khaldun who in his muqaddimah  described labor as the source of value necessary for all earnings and capital accumulation he argued that even if earning results from something other than a craft the value of the resulting profit and acquired capital must also include the value of the labor by which it was obtained without labor it would not have been acquired scholars have also pointed to sir william pettys treatise of taxes of  and to john lockes labor theory of property set out in the second treatise on government  which sees labor as the ultimate source of economic value karl marx himself credited benjamin franklin in his  essay entitled a modest enquiry into the nature and necessity of a paper currency as being one of the first to advance the theory adam smith accepted the theory for precapitalist societies but saw a flaw in its application to contemporary capitalism he pointed out that if the labor embodied in a product equaled the labor commanded ie the amount of labor that could be purchased by selling it then profit was impossible david ricardo seconded by marx responded to this paradox by arguing that smith had confused labor with wages labor commanded he argued would always be more than the labor needed to sustain itself wages the value of labor in this view covered not just the value of wages what marx called the value of labor power but the value of the entire product created by labor ricardos theory was a predecessor of the modern theory that equilibrium prices are determined solely by production costs associated with neoricardianism based on the discrepancy between the wages of labor and the value of the product the ricardian socialists—charles hall thomas hodgskin john gray and john francis bray and percy ravenstone—applied ricardos theory to develop theories of exploitation marx expanded on these ideas arguing that workers work for a part of each day adding the value required to cover their wages while the remainder of their labor is performed for the enrichment of the capitalist the ltv and the accompanying theory of exploitation became central to his economic thought th century american individualist anarchists based their economics on the ltv with their particular interpretation of it being called cost the limit of price they as well as contemporary individualist anarchists in that tradition hold that it is unethical to charge a higher price for a commodity than the amount of labor required to produce it hence they propose that trade should be facilitated by using notes backed by labor adam smith and david ricardoedit adam smith held that in a primitive society the amount of labor put into producing a good determined its exchange value with exchange value meaning in this case the amount of labor a good can purchase however according to smith in a more advanced society the market price is no longer proportional to labor cost since the value of the good now includes compensation for the owner of the means of production the whole produce of labour does not always belong to the labourer he must in most cases share it with the owner of the stock which employs him nevertheless the real value of such a commodity produced in advanced society is measured by the labor which that commodity will command in exchange  but smith disowns what is naturally thought of as the genuine classical labor theory of value that laborcost regulates marketvalue this theory was ricardos and really his alone classical economist david ricardos labor theory of value holds that the value of a good how much of another good or service it exchanges for in the market is proportional to how much labor was required to produce it including the labor required to produce the raw materials and machinery used in the process david ricardo stated it as the value of a commodity or the quantity of any other commodity for which it will exchange depends on the relative quantity of labour which is necessary for its production and not as the greater or less compensation which is paid for that labour ricardo  in this connection ricardo seeks to differentiate the quantity of labor necessary to produce a commodity from the wages paid to the laborers for its production however ricardo was troubled with some deviations in prices from proportionality with the labor required to produce them for example he said i cannot get over the difficulty of the wine which is kept in the cellar for three or four years ie while constantly increasing in exchange value or that of the oak tree which perhaps originally had not  s expended on it in the way of labour and yet comes to be worth £ quoted in whitaker of course a capitalist economy stabilizes this discrepancy until the value added to aged wine is equal to the cost of storage if anyone can hold onto a bottle for four years and become rich that would make it hard to find freshly corked wine there is also the theory that adding to the price of a luxury product increases its exchangevalue by mere prestige the labor theory as an explanation for value contrasts with the subjective theory of value which says that value of a good is not determined by how much labor was put into it but by its usefulness in satisfying a want and its scarcity ricardos labor theory of value is not a normative theory as are some later forms of the labor theory such as claims that it is immoral for an individual to be paid less for his labor than the total revenue that comes from the sales of all the goods he produces it is arguable to what extent these classical theorists held the labor theory of value as it is commonly defined for instance david ricardo theorized that prices are determined by the amount of labor but found exceptions for which the labor theory could not account in a letter he wrote i am not satisfied with the explanation i have given of the principles which regulate value adam smith theorized that the labor theory of value holds true only in the early and rude state of society but not in a modern economy where owners of capital are compensated by profit as a result smith ends up making little use of a labor theory of value anarchismedit see also anarchist economics and cost the limit of price sample labor for labor note for the cincinnati time store scanned from equitable commerce  by josiah warren pierre joseph proudhons mutualism and american individualist anarchists such as josiah warren lysander spooner and benjamin tucker adopted the liberal labor theory of value of classical economics and used it to criticize capitalism while favoring a noncapitalist market system warren is widely regarded as the first american anarchist and the fourpage weekly paper he edited during  the peaceful revolutionist was the first anarchist periodical published cost the limit of price was a maxim coined by warren indicating a prescriptive version of the labor theory of value warren maintained that the just compensation for labor or for its product could only be an equivalent amount of labor or a product embodying an equivalent amount thus profit rent and interest were considered unjust economic arrangements in keeping with the tradition of adam smiths the wealth of nations the cost of labor is considered to be the subjective cost ie the amount of suffering involved in it he put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental labor for labor store called the cincinnati time store at the corner of th and elm streets in what is now downtown cincinnati where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor all the goods offered for sale in warrens store were offered at the same price the merchant himself had paid for them plus a small surcharge in the neighborhood of  to  percent to cover store overhead the store stayed open for three years after it closed warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism these included utopia and modern times warren said that stephen pearl andrews the science of society published in  was the most lucid and complete exposition of warrens own theories mutualism is an economic theory and anarchist school of thought that advocates a society where each person might possess a means of production either individually or collectively with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutualcredit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate just high enough to cover administration mutualism is based on a labor theory of value that holds that when labor or its product is sold in exchange it ought to receive goods or services embodying the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility mutualism originated from the writings of philosopher pierrejoseph proudhon collectivist anarchism as defended by mikhail bakunin defended a form of labor theory of value when it advocated a system where all necessaries for production are owned in common by the labour groups and the free communes  based on the distribution of goods according to the labour

of economic thought socialist economics critiques of capitalism economics portal marxism portal v t e contrary to popular belief marx never used the term labor theory of value in any of his works but used the term law of value marx opposed ascribing a supernatural creative power to labor arguing that labor is not the source of all wealth nature is just as much a source of use values and it is surely of such that material wealth consists as labor which is itself only the manifestation of a force of nature human labor power here marx was distinguishing between exchange value the subject of the ltv and use value marx used the concept of socially necessary labor time to introduce a social perspective distinct from his predecessors and neoclassical economics whereas most economists start with the individuals perspective marx started with the perspective of society as a whole social production involves a complicated and interconnected division of labor of a wide variety of people who depend on each other for their survival and prosperity abstract labor refers to a characteristic of commodityproducing labor that is shared by all different kinds of heterogeneous concrete types of labor that is the concept abstracts from the particular characteristics of all of the labor and is akin to average labor socially necessary labor refers to the quantity required to produce a commodity in a given state of society under certain social average conditions or production with a given social average intensity and average skill of the labor employed that is the value of a product is determined more by societal standards than by individual conditions this explains why technological breakthroughs lower the price of commodities and put less advanced producers out of business finally it is not labor per se which creates value but labor power sold by free wage workers to capitalists another distinction to be made is that between productive and unproductive labor only wage workers of productive sectors of the economy produce valuenote  criticismsedit main article criticisms of the labour theory of value the marxist labor theory of value has been criticised on several counts some arguecitation needed that it predicts that profits will be higher in laborintensive industries than in capitalintensive industries which would be contradicted by empirical datacitation needed even if marx has never mechanically simplified the matter in this terms as capital itself is product of past labour thus the general tendency of falling profit does not concern or invalidate the labour origin of value present in both live and dead labour capitalcf chapter  and  of das kapital this is sometimes referred to as the great contradiction in volume  of capital marx explains why profits are not distributed according to which industries are the most laborintensive and why this is consistent with his theory whether or not this is consistent with the labor theory of value as presented in volume  has been a topic of debate according to marx surplus value is extracted by the capitalist class as a whole and then distributed according to the amount of total capital not the just variable component in the example given earlier of making a cup of coffee the constant capital involved in production is the coffee beans themselves and the variable capital is the value added by the coffee maker the value added by the coffee maker is dependent on its technological capabilities and the coffee maker can only add so much total value to cups of coffee over its lifespan the amount of value added to the product is thus the amortization of the value of the coffeemaker we can also note that not all products have equal proportions of value added by amortized capital capital intensive industries such as finance may have a large contribution of capital while laborintensive industries like traditional agriculture would have a relatively small one the theory can also be sometimes found in nonmarxist traditionsnote  for instance mutualist anarchist theorist kevin carsons studies in mutualist political economy opens with an attempt to integrate marginalist critiques into the labor theory of value some postkeynesian economists have been highly critical of the labor theory of value joan robinson who herself was considered an expert on the writings of karl marx wrote that the labor theory of value was largely a tautology and a typical example of the way metaphysical ideas operate others have argued that the labor theory of value especially as it arises in the work of karl marx is due to a failure to recognize the fundamentally dialectical nature of how human beings attribute value to objects pilkington writes that value is attributed to objects based on our desire for them and that this desire is always intersubjective and socially determined he writes that value is attributed to objects due to our desire for them this desire in turn is intersubjective we desire to gain a medal or to capture an enemy flag in battle because it will win recognition in the eyes of our peers a medal or an enemy flag are not valued for their objective properties nor are they valued for the amount of labour embodied in them rather they are desired for the symbolic positions they occupy in the intersubjective network of desires pilkington insists that this is an entirely different conception of value than the one we find in the marginalist theory found in many economics textbooks he writes that actors in marginalist analysis have selfcontained preferences they do not have intersubjective desires in ecological economics the labor theory of value has been criticized where it is argued that labor is in fact energy over time however echoing joan robinson alf hornborg an environmental historian argues that both the reliance on energy theory of value and labor theory of value are problematic as they propose that usevalues or material wealth are more real than exchangevalues or cultural wealthyet usevalues are culturally determined for hornborg any marxist argument that claims uneven wealth is due to the exploitation or underpayment of usevalues is actually a tautological contradiction since it must necessarily quantify underpayment in terms of exchangevalue the alternative would be to conceptualize unequal exchange as an asymmetric net transfer of material inputs in production eg embodied labor energy land and water rather than in terms of an underpayment of material inputs or an asymmetric transfer of value in other words uneven exchange is characterised by incommensurability namely the unequal transfer of material inputs competing valuejudgements of the worth of labor fuel and raw materials differing availability of industrial technologies and the offloading of environmental burdens on those with less resources a generalization of labor theory of valueedit to resolve the abovementioned contradiction of the theory with reality some authors proposed to reconsider the role of production equipment constant capital in production of value following hints in das kapital where marx  described the functional role of machinery in production processes in chapter xv machinery and modern industry in the following words on a closer examination of the working machine proper we find in it as a general rule though often no doubt under very altered forms the apparatus and tools used by the handicraftsmen or manufacturing workman with this difference that instead of being human implements they are the implements of a mechanism or mechanical implements pp – the machine proper is therefore a mechanism that after being set in motion performs with its tools the same operations that were formerly done by the workman with similar tools whether the motive power is derived from man or from some other machine makes no difference in this respect p  the implements of labour in the form of machinery necessitate the substitution of natural forces for human force and the conscious application of science instead of rule of thumb p  after making allowance both in the case of the machine and of the tool for their average daily cost that is for the value they transmit to the product by their average daily wear and tear and for their consumption of auxiliary substances such as oil coal and so on they each do their work gratuitously just like the forces furnished by nature without the help of man p  these words state that one has to account while interpreting production of value that the workers efforts in production of things are substituted with work of production equipment with due effect really at substitution of labourers work by forces of the nature that is at substitution of efforts of people by work of external forces of the nature by means of the production equipment work operates in a complex as workers efforts plus work of the equipment thus work of machines can be appreciated only so far as this work does what people wish replacing their efforts and consequently a measure of value certainly can be the labourers work only see alsoedit business
