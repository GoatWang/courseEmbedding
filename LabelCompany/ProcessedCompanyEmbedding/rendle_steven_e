officer scott roe following our prepared remarks well open the call for questions steve steven e rendle  vf corp thanks joe and good morning everyone thank you for joining us for our first quarter  earnings call vfs first quarter results were right in line with our expectations our growth engines continue to deliver solid results despite a retail backdrop that continues to experience disruption and consolidation particularly here in the united states overall revenue was down  during the quarter but this doesnt tell the whole story the momentum we see building in our largest brands and in our international and directtoconsumer platforms is strong and our first quarter results give me confidence in our expectation for accelerated growth as we move through  for the quarter vans the north face and timberland grew at a combined rate of  with strength in the north face and vans which grew  and  respectively our international business grew  and our china business delivered an impressive  growth rate directtoconsumer grew  including a midsingle digit comp and our digital business was up more than  were really pleased with this solid performance operational discipline and sharp focus on fundamentals led to a  basis point improvement in our gross margin during the quarter our gross margin drivers remain intact and our strong margin expansion will fuel investment in our strategic priorities and provide flexibility as we execute against our  plan its an important and sustainable part of our model eps was down  to  in the first quarter that being said know that our earnings growth was negatively impacted by  percentage points due to a higher tax rate that means that our eps growth wouldve been  excluding the tax headwind scott will cover this in more detail later in the call one of the core pillars of our strategy is to reshape our portfolio weve shared with you in detail the strategic and financial filters we use to evaluate our existing portfolio and also our acquisition pipeline in early april we announced that vf had signed an agreement to sell our lsg business to fanatics this announcement is another example of our work as active portfolio managers and our intention to move faster on a personal note the lsg and jansport collegiate employees have been part of the vf family for many years and i thank them for their service and wish them all continued success pace of change in our industry and the broader consumer landscape is accelerating the choices and capabilities embedded in our  strategic growth plan positions us to win and will serve as a catalyst for vfs accelerated growth we will become a more agile and consumer centric organization we will reshape our portfolio and we are a diversified value creation company so with that lets dive into our first quarter results and look at our top five brands and workwear starting with the north face global revenue was up  with strength in the americas and europe offset by a slight decline in asiapacific which we did expect excluding the impact of bankruptcies in the americas business which didnt really impact us until the second half of  global revenue for the north face was up at a low double digit rate our revenue growth during the quarter was balanced with low double digit growth in dc and midsingle digit growth in wholesale by region americas grew  driven by low teen growth in dc with strong results from ecommerce which grew nearly  this was offset by a low single digit decrease in wholesale due to the impact of the bankruptcies from a product standpoint rainwear performed well in the quarter driven by the launch of our new apex flex goretex jacket which provides comfort and protection coupled with a new fit and aesthetic in europe the north face was up  as its strong momentum continued the wholesale business was particularly solid with growth of nearly  the business remains wellbalanced with strong results across all product categories and channels which we expect to continue for the balance of the year in asia as expected first quarter revenue was down  as low double digit growth in dc was offset by a high single digit decline in wholesale as the outdoor environment remains highly promotional in china we continue to consolidate our retail partners and aggressively manage inventory in the marketplace we continue to expect high single digit growth in  primarily weighted toward the second half while revenue growth at the north face was slightly above our expectations for the first quarter theres no change to our outlook for midsingle digit revenue growth for the brand in  now switching to vans global revenue was up  with broad based growth across all regions of the world and all product franchises from a channel perspective dc increased at a high teen rate while wholesale was flat as growth in the americas and asia was offset by an expected decline in europe vans americas business was up  driven by low double digit dc growth including more than  growth in ecommerce the wholesale business increased at a low single digit rate as youd expect our wide range of product continues to resonate with consumers with classics and particularly the old skool fueling success in dc and wholesale and building on our commitment to deep consumer connectivity the brand opened a permanent house of vans in chicago a popup house of vans in toronto and three popup house of vans locations in mexico in europe the vans turnaround story continues to take hold with  growth during the quarter our dc business remains strong with  growth driven by a  increase in ecommerce and a highteen comp growth as expected wholesale declined at a low single digit rate with inventory levels in the channel now normalizing and double digit growth in our fall order book were on track to deliver high single digit growth in europe in  in asia for the third consecutive quarter vans delivered more than  growth this was fueled by more than  growth in dc with strength across all markets driven by exceptional growth in the digital space in china wholesale increased at a midsingle digit rate with strength in china and korea looking to  we are confident in our low double digit growth outlook for the vans brand in line with our expectations timberland global revenue decreased  with low single digit growth in dc and high single digit decline in wholesale revenue in the americas decreased  as midsingle digit growth in our dc business including almost  growth in ecommerce was offset by a low double digit decline in wholesale we continue to work on diversifying our business toward a more balanced assortment which will reduce our reliance on classic boots in the americas region this is the strategy we outlined at the investor day and its the same successful strategy that has led to more consistent balanced growth in our international business while not yet to scale in the americas we are seeing tremendous success in our mens casual platforms such as sensorflex and aerocore our dc business has the right assortment and the growth we are seeing gives us confidence that we have the right strategy however the product transition in the wholesale channel will take a little longer to play out as we diversify the assortment and our retail partners work through inventory in the boot category we expect the americas business to return to growth in the second half of  timberland revenue in europe was in line with  levels as low single digit growth in dc was offset by flat revenue in wholesale as expected wholesale revenue in the quarter was impacted by timing of shipments in our distributor business we expect timberland europe to return to growth in the second quarter and for growth to accelerate into the high single digit range in the second half of  supported by the order book which is now fully allocated revenue in timberlands asia business was down  dc declined a midsingle digit rate as strong ecommerce growth in china and low single digit comp growth was offset by our decision to reduce underperforming doors in some of our mature markets wholesale was down at a high single digit rate for  we continue to expect timberland to grow in the low single digit range we expect the brand to return to growth in the second quarter and for growth to accelerate in the second half of the year as our international business gains momentum and we continue to evolve our product segmentation and assortment in the americas looking at wrangler global revenue for the first quarter was down  with low double digit growth in dc more than offset by a low double digit decline in wholesale in the americas region a low teen revenue decline in the us offset high teen growth in our nonus americas business and revenue in europe and asia declined at a low single digit rate for the quarter as weve discussed our us business has been impacted by inventory destocking related to the strategic repositioning of a key customer and continued channel consolidation these actions will affect our business primarily in the first half and growth should return by year end were working closely with our key retail partners but our visibility regarding timing is low and the variability is hard to predict while quartertoquarter forecasting will be difficult our past experience tells us several things that we can expect once the repositioning is complete first strong brands like wrangler will command even stronger positions as smaller brands are edited out and second superior supply chain and replenishment capabilities give us an advantaged position regarding product this week we announced that we are expanding our offerings for the spring season with a mens collection that is built for the outdoors the wrangler outdoor line incorporates multifunctional features ideal for the outdoor enthusiast made of performance materials that keep the wearer cool dry and comfortable these products also feature upf  to protect the consumer from the sun this is a perfect example of our efforts to transform wrangler into more of a lifestyle brand while keeping it connected to its heritage and its loyal consumer switching to lee revenue declined  during the quarter with midteen growth in dc offset by a high single digit decline in wholesale low single digit growth in europe asia and our nonus americas business was offset by a low double digit decline in the us body optix continues to perform well in asia comprising about  of our womens business we plan to bring this to europe and to north america later this fall in the us our mens business continues to deliver solid growth as xtreme comfort khakis and extreme motion denim continue to resonate with the lee consumer however ongoing channel weakness and challenging conditions in our womens business are impacting results for  we continue to expect jeanswear revenue to be in line with  levels and finally id like to highlight workwear the business we recently presented as a new growth platform for vf workwear which includes our image business as well as timberland pro and wrangler riggs workwear increased  during the quarter our image business was negatively impacted by the timing of a government contract between q and q and declined  however our largest brands within workwear were strong as the recovery in the industrial sector continues timberland pro grew  bulwark was up  and wrangler riggs workwear increased  given our expectation for accelerated growth through the balance of  and the inherent profitability of this business we are even more optimistic about the workwear opportunity and with that ill turn it over to scott scott a roe  vf corp thanks steve before i cover the first quarter in detail let me provide a few comments regarding the lsg transaction and how it impacted our first quarter results relative to the outlook we provided in february as you know in early april we announced that we had reached an agreement with fanatics to sell our lsg business the sale price is about  million pretax subject to working capital and other adjustments and we expect to close this transaction very shortly in conjunction with the sale of lsg we are also exiting the licensing business of jansport collegiate accordingly the results of these businesses have been classified as discontinued ops and the prior periods have been adjusted in  these businesses contributed about  million of revenue and roughly  of eps we provided an income statement in the press release issued this morning excluding the licensing business so you can see the full impact relative to the first quarter of  before restructuring and other charges triggered by the transaction these businesses contributed about  of eps during the quarter so relative to the outlook we provided in february our lsg and jansport collegiate businesses contributed about  million of revenue and our continuing operations eps of  wouldve been  on a likeforlike basis so with that out of the way lets review the first quarter results in line with our expectations revenue was down  on a currency neutral basis to  billion our growth engines delivered solid results in the quarter our big three brands were up  on a combined basis with particular strength in the north face and vans which grew  and  respectively and as the industrial recovery continues to evolve bulwark timberland pro and wrangler riggs grew at a midteen rate our international business grew  and china remained particularly strong with  growth and our direct to consumer business was up  in the quarter including more than  growth in our digital business now to unpack our direct to consumer results a little further our outdoor  action sports jeanswear and international businesses all achieved low double digit growth during the quarter wholesale revenue was down  due to a key customers inventory action in our jeanswear north american business the impact of bankruptcies in outdoor  action sports and difficult conditions in the department store channel which continue to pressure our sportswear businesses in contrast our international wholesale delivered low single digit growth and our digital wholesale accounts grew at a combined rate in the midteens i want to take a few minutes to provide more context around our outlook for the jeanswear business in  there is no change to our outlook of about flat revenue for the year our international business remains solid with particular strength in europe and asia where we expect low to midsingle digit growth this year we continue to expect our business in north america to decline at a low single digit rate as a result of the previously mentioned inventory destocking this impact will primarily be in the first half now despite the shortterm noise its important to keep focused on the end game we are confident that our jeanswear brands are strong and our superior supply chain places us in an advantaged position once the process is complete however our visibility regarding timing is low therefore the quarter to quarter variability will be hard to predict gross margin remained strong at  up  basis points on a reported basis which included a  basis point negative impact for fx thats a basispoint increase on a currencyneutral basis as we mentioned in february we are sharply focused on fundamentals and willing to sacrifice a little growth in the near term for quality our efforts are clearly paying off in the gross margin line and we believe our decisions will improve the longterm health of both our brands and the marketplace sga as a percentage of revenue was up  basis points to  while we remain diligent with respect to overall expense control in light of the growth environment we continue to invest in strategic priorities dc and in particular digital product innovation demand creation and technology in fact while our overall sga expense was up just  investments and strategic priorities accounted for more than all of that increase as our focus on agility and cost optimization allowed us to reduce cost elsewhere and as our growth accelerates in the second half and we begin to realize the full benefits of our agility and optimization efforts we expect to drive significant leverage in our sga ratio in the second half and into  first quarter operating margin declined  basis points to  primarily as a result of the negative impact of changes in foreign currency on a currency neutral basis our operating margin during the quarter was down  basis points to  so carrying all this to the bottom line our eps declined  on a currency neutral basis to  in the quarter however our eps rate was negatively impacted by  percentage points due to lower discrete tax benefits primarily as a result of the adoption of the equity comp accounting standard last year excluding the discrete tax impact eps on a currency neutral basis was up at a midsingle digit rate turning to our balance sheet our inventory increased  and as promised we continued to return capital to shareholders as we repurchased about  million of stock as we announced in march our board has approved a new  billion share repurchase program to support the capital allocation priorities we laid out in our  plan as we look to the balance of  we are updating our outlook to incorporate the sale of the licensing business reported revenue is still expected to be up at a low single digit rate including about a  percentage point negative impact from foreign currency however this is off an adjusted  base to reflect the sale of lsg we expect gross margin to improve about  basis points to  which includes a  basis point headwind from fx operating margin is still expected to approximate  on a reported basis including about a  basis point negative impact from fx currency neutral eps is still expected to be up at a midsingle digit rate in  or down at a low single digit rate compared to  adjusted eps of  while there is no change to our currency neutral revenue and eps outlook for the full year id like to make a few comments relative to the first outlook – first half outlook we provided in february first our licensing business contributed about  to  of eps per quarter during  so that should help you think about your models second as we mentioned our visibility in jeanswear north america is low and the quartertoquarter variability is hard to predict right now while there is no change to our annual outlook for jeanswear its hard to predict which side of the qq quarter break orders may fall as a result were providing an eps outlook in a range of  to  for the second quarter so in closing the first quarter of our  strategic plan played out as expected we are confident in our midsingle digit earnings growth outlook for  and in our ability to accelerate growth in the second half we are focused on fundamentals and becoming a more agile and retail centric organization and we are committed to becoming a more active portfolio manager while delivering topquartile tsr through our diversified model we are a value creation company and with that ill turn it back over to the operator and well open up the call for your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you sir well go first to laurent vasilescu of macquarie laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc morning and thanks for taking my question i wanted to follow up on the  decline in the wholesale business i think in the prepared remarks i think it was noted that it was primarily due to a key us customer any sense what the wholesale business wouldve looked like if we strip out that customer scott a roe  vf corp well youre right laurent it was driven by the us customer particularly in our jeans business but we also called out our sportswear business was a little tough in the quarter as well so i think if you stripped those out really if you look our – we did see growth in our larger brands as well as our international business and also importantly our digital accounts as well we saw midteen growth laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc okay very helpful and then on international revenues i wanted to follow up on last quarters guide that europe and asia would both grow at a high single digit rate for the year in light of the first quarter results for those regions can you possibly walk us through how we should think about those regions how theyll grow in the first half versus the second half scott a roe  vf corp well i think ill start with europe we are seeing – the largest acceleration in the second half will be in our vans business this has been a really great story over the last several quarters where weve seen sequential improvement in fact we returned to growth although it was modest in the first quarter but based on the order book we see going forward were seeing double digit positive order books in europe and thats going to be a big driver that has been a big driver consistently in our europe business and were really excited to see that come roaring back because thats also a very profitable business as cfo i like that also on the second half our digital business our ecomm is where we see the majority of that its more second half weighted and based on the trends while the trends wont necessarily get larger as a percentage the absolute amount of business is larger as well as the openings that weve had from a dc standpoint in the first half as those start to pay off in the second half so generally thats the trend we see in both regions which gives us confidence steve steven e rendle  vf corp and laurent i would just add a little bit there i mean clearly it is the return of strong growth with our vans business i mentioned we have a very strong back half order book but its also the continued growth and the high level performance from our north face brand in europe our timberland brand comes back to very strong growth as we see our expanded apparel offer a stronger womens offer coming into the second half but we also – its the strength of our vans brand in asia that continues to drive that strong double digit growth and gives us confidence in that back half growth scott a roe  vf corp more than  growth in asia right laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc very helpful best of luck operator well go next to michael binetti of ubs michael binetti  ubs securities llc hey guys good morning thanks for taking my question scott a roe  vf corp morning michael michael binetti  ubs securities llc i just wanted to ask a couple modeling things really quickly on the fx weve seen that – its been pretty volatile here recently i was actually a little surprised to see that it was still just a  estimate in your – the way that youre modeling it for the year on the impact to revenue for the year is that – i mean is that – would you mind helping us with how youre pegging the euro or maybe the pound on that just so we understand what youre looking at in case things change more through this quarter which obviously they could tend to be volatile scott a roe  vf corp sure michael so we looked at the last  days basically average and thats essentially what weve – for all our basket of currencies and yeah some of them are positive like the euro and others not as much but what weve done is weve looked about at the last  days and gone – projected that going forward so if the currencies if the dollar continues to weaken could that be a tailwind for us yeah it could but based on what were seeing right now in our forward projections were not counting on that trend continuing and its slightly beneficial but its not material to the overall results the other thing id just remind everybody is about  of our transactional exposure is hedged so from an incountry profitability standpoint there is some variability but not a lot michael binetti  ubs securities llc right and then i think just you mentioned something i think around timberland but i was surprised to see it looks like only about four net new store openings in the quarter versus last quarter it sounded like you had a couple closures though maybe we could get a little bit of context behind how youre thinking about the seasonality of the store openings this year because i think if we just look at some of the longer term run rates you gave us at the analyst day it looks like that youd be opening at a lot faster pace than what you reported in the first quarter scott a roe  vf corp yes maybe ill start there so one of the things that we said michael is that were going to take a hard look at the productivity of our stores and profitability and in asia and in particular we have a large business in some of the more mature markets like japan there where frankly weve struggled a bit and weve taken a step back from a store footprint there based on productivity michael binetti  ubs securities llc okay i guess just one last one i think you had a – for north face you had a competitor i guess this week talking about a little bit more of a cautious outlook for the us on orders through the year which is unusual from the standpoint of the first quarter taking a more cautious outlook for the year can you just talk about your north face outlook in the americas obviously the europe numbers are great but for the americas this year what gives you confident in the order book you have today and how much variability there is around those numbers if things change through the year steven e rendle  vf corp sure ill grab that one michael as you heard we reaffirmed our midsingle digit growth outlook for the year really happy with our first quarter results as we came through the colder january february and then the launch of some new products here at the back half of q i think the key here is as we came through last year and the decisions that we made to clean up the marketplace and focus on first quality sales the orders that we have in hand are really driven against the sellthrough we saw last year and very thoughtful growth rates across each of the wholesale partners that we have theres some new products coming in our higher end summit series some new ski and snowboard styles that are giving us confidence with that wholesale distribution but i think the key here also is our dc is performing really well and we see our digital platform driving strong growth and certainly thats the higher quality product offer but its also the impact of a cleaner marketplace and not having to compete with a large amount of offpriced goods some ours some others but i think that all of that kind of aggregate gives us confidence against that midsingle digit outlook that we just reaffirmed michael binetti  ubs securities llc thank you operator well go next to ike boruchow of wells fargo ike boruchow  wells fargo securities llc hey good morning everyone scott a roe  vf corp good morning ike boruchow  wells fargo securities llc just a question i wanted to focus on timberland in the us so im just trying to look at the numbers and dc is up midsingles so it looks like with the current product you have things look good and the wholesale channel is down low double digits so just kind of curious if you could contextualize it how much of it is just a channel inventory issue and you just need that to get kind of cleaned up versus the current product pipeline performance steven e rendle  vf corp yeah so i think youve characterized it really well we talked at the investor day and i think we really see that continuing right now is our – a little bit more dependent on boots here in the us than we see in other parts of the world specifically europe and a lot of work going on right now to work on product segmentation and really leveling the different franchises that sit within each of the different channel partners we are moving through some boot inventory as we place our sensorflex and aerocore franchises at a better rate but where we are able to get that front and center is in our own dc and that is where were seeing really strong reactions and in our ecommerce platform where we were up  so its really moving through inventory its getting – really creating the space to place these new franchises and using the proof points that we see in our own dc here in the us but also the performance that weve seen in our european platform in taking those learnings back here to our domestic market ike boruchow  wells fargo securities llc got it thats helpful and if i could scott one more for you on the jeanswear side im just trying to make sure i understand so on one hand it sounds like youre saying you think the jeanswear business could begin to improve in the back half of this year but i thought you were – you discussed at the analyst day that you didnt really expect the pressure in that segment to abate until early  and thats why you thought the business would start to inflect more on the top line at that point can you help me just kind of understand i mean i know you dont have a lot of visibility given whats going on there right now scott a roe  vf corp yeah yeah ike boruchow  wells fargo securities llc but just how do i take those two comments and think about them scott a roe  vf corp yeah so first of all as you think about the pace of the year were going to see sequential improvement as the year progresses and if you think about it just kind of big picture you got a destocking thats occurring through the first half which is again one of the reasons we talked about the variability and lack of visibility is we dont fully control the timing of how markdowns and floors are cleared and all that thats our customers decision right not ours but we know where were going to end up at the end and at the end of the year – by the end of the year we should according to their plans be through the destocking phase and getting into the new floor set by the end of the year we have visibility to what programs we have we know what the expectations are but the way this is laying out is a narrower assortment with higher velocity and again these are a lot of assumptions so we should see that higher velocity start to pay off in the second half and thats what i meant by the acceleration by the end of the year now if you zoom out a click and go back to the investor day we know that there are a number of factors in that channel of distribution which cause variability one of those is the repositioning of a major customer theres other customers that have been closing doors and theres other disruptions that are occurring so my comments at the investor day were more of a broader picture to say that while quarter to quarter we could see some disruption and choppiness if you keep the end game in mind and think about the big picture here we really like where were going to end up once all this plays out right that is we own the strongest brand in that category with the wrangler brand we know that in a narrower assortment big brands win and theres more focus on replenishment and quick supply chain capabilities that plays right into our strengths so one of those comments is more tactical just its going to be really hard quarter to quarter to thread the needle exactly on what we expect but we know where the end game is and the other is if you keep your eye on the prize here we like strategically where were going to end up in the jeans section given what we believe are some core advantages strength of brand and strength of supply chain ike boruchow  wells fargo securities llc got it thanks a lot operator well go next to omar saad of evercore isi omar saad  evercore isi thanks for taking my question scott a roe  vf corp morning omar omar saad  evercore isi morning wanted to talk to you about kind of a dichotomy between the us trends in the business here versus in europe and asia where there seems to be a growing kind of separation do you feel like that some of the challenges in the us and the wholesale channel and promotionality going on over here do you feel like these issues are going to stay confined to the american market the north american market and theres – europe and asia are structurally different industries and those challenges can be avoided in those markets or do you think they eventually flow globally kind of from an industry level steven e rendle  vf corp ill try to answer that question omar some of that is looking at a crystal ball but what i would say what we see in our international business where really things are not necessarily that much easier our brands are doing extremely well the thoughtful approach to segmentation and really placing the right product collections in each of these distribution channel partners doors and how were using our retail and digital platforms to build our brands breadth and depth with consumer is helping us outperform the marketplace here in the us its clear that weve got ourselves in a really uneven and inconsistent performance but there are retailers and there are brands that are doing well in this marketplace were going to settle through retail closures we all read the same reports but i think the thing that we all need to really remember is that strong brands that have a very authentic connection with consumers that are delivering unique products that provide consumers the opportunity to enjoy the experiences that they look for position brands to succeed in this marketplace well navigate this because of the strength of our portfolio and its really the learnings that we take in our european and asia markets that are helping us fine tune our approach to segmentation and the use of the various product collections in those channels thats giving us confidence that well navigate it scott a roe  vf corp yeah id just add on to that omar there are some fundamental differences the us we all look at the same numbers right the us is overstored as a general statement much more than what you would see in europe and asia so thats one issue also remember the relative time in market and maturity of our brands are less internationally so we have a lot of room to run there just from penetration and an expansion standpoint so if you think about our business visàvis those markets thats how we look at it and lastly in the us while its macro trends are certainly true and again weve tried to say we will see disruption and choppiness as certain contractions and consolidations happen there are clear winners out there too right and we are winning with those winning retailers and thats another reason why from a strategic standpoint weve really pivoted and focused on our dc and particularly our digital business and you might remember from the investor day  of our growth is coming from digital and digital partners and of that  thats essentially in international so in the next five years were not expecting much on a net basis from wholesale in the us we will be winning disproportionately with some vendors and were also expecting that there will be continued consolidation thats going to occur over the next five years omar saad  evercore isi thats really helpful guys could i also ask a question about timberland that business continues to strengthen a little bit do you feel like youve got the right strategy and plan in place for that brand or is it really just more of a market level issue where that kind of active lifestyle has shifted away maybe from that rugged outdoor aesthetic to more of the athletic athleisure aesthetic and you just kind of have to wait for that cycle to play out thanks steven e rendle  vf corp omar i mean theres clearly a cycle that were all seeing right now with the retro athletic but to the point on timberland we absolutely believe we have the right strategy and the proof point is what we see going on with our european business who was much quicker to diversify across multiple franchises specifically sensorflex and the launch of aerocore and have really brought down the percent to total of the boots the total boot collection we were slow to do that here in the united states market and that work is underway jim pisani did i thought a good job really of being able to explain that at the investor day that work is underway concurrently weve really elevated our apparel product creation sitting now in our stabio office leveraging the strength of our apparel machine there were really seeing that investment pay out in our european marketplace as that starts to come here to the us we have confidence that that will be a growth driver but were also unlocking womens growth and youll remember the three focuses for timberland are their mens business and the diversification across new franchises womens and apparel and again the womens business and the strength that were seeing with products designs in europe that were now bringing back into our americas marketplace gives us confidence that we have the right product as we begin to be more diligent around segmentation and really diversifying those collections appropriately omar saad  evercore isi thanks steve thanks scott thats really helpful good luck scott a roe  vf corp yeah steven e rendle  vf corp thanks omar scott a roe  vf corp see you omar operator well go to erinn murphy piper jaffray erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co great thanks good morning i wanted to focus a little bit on innovation behind the north face brand it feels like for the last three years to four years its been concentrated around fuseform thermoball in particular i guess first question how much white space is left for these platforms to run and then is there anything you can share with us on kind of whats next how your thinking about better balancing the spring versus the fall line thanks steven e rendle  vf corp no erinn very good question if you remember back in the q call ive talked about we need to own some of where the north face finds itself today weve leaned heavily on thermoball for the last three seasons fuseform an interesting technology and material innovation is important for our outerwear and ski wear but what we need to be doing is really being much more thoughtful around multiyear line plans and product lifecycle management married to our innovation platform there are a number of innovation projects underway specifically around materials but also design concepts for outerwear footwear equipment and some very specifically in sportswear as now as we bring new leadership into both the overall brand and product were lining up that multiyear model with our innovation platform and theres some exciting things coming this fall i dont remember if i saw you at the outdoor retailer show but there was an introduction of a new portion of our summit series collection engineered for ski mountaineering but that also is having influence on some of the broader apparel product and youre just seeing better designed product more thoughtful use of materials color and fit that we have a lot of confidence will open up the lens for our core consumers but also broaden the lens for new consumers and were seeing this prove out in our european business ive talked about that a lot but its no secret that our european business is very very successful right now and it is the focus on product the segmentation of that product into specific channel partners and our own stores but its also the quality of the leadership and really driving those very specific choices and being able to season after season build that momentum through really thoughtful product line management erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co got it thats helpful and then i guess scott for you just going back to how you were kind of articulating the guidance you talked about significant sga leverage in the back half can you just expound upon that i guess if sales in the second half – youre obviously planning for a big acceleration as well so if whether its environment or further bankruptcy the sales werent as high lets say they were in the low single digit range or midsingle how do we think about kind of what the leverage you have on the sga would be in the back half thanks scott a roe  vf corp yeah so first of all as cfo i think every cost is variable so thats probably kind of underneath your question but – and so what does our guidance imply so we said about  operating margin and with the margin expansion that would imply an increase in sga and you see thats relatively higher in the first part and we see – we leverage that in the second half and it comes down first of all id say we have a pretty good line of sight to the second half of the year right and so were not expecting a tremendous volatility we see our order book we see the trends now theres always some variability possible but we have a lot of confidence in the second half so thats the first comment id make so secondly were also – we outlined a strategic plan in our boston meeting and we are investing behind those priorities so the point i was trying to make by significant leverage is obviously as the top line accelerates were going to see leverage right in the second half were also taking a lot of – a hard look at all the nonstrategic sga we have a transformation project that were going on – that were undertaking here and id call it more of a philosophy than a project actually and were challenging every spend item that we have in the pl and saying if its not directly related to bringing our strategy forward then were empowering our leaders to take a hard look at that and the fruits of that labor are were going to – were seeing and will continue to see leverage in those nonstrategic areas our thought is that is a fuel that we put right back and reinvest against those strategic priorities so again second relative as the top line grows were going to see second half leverage remember in the first half we have a bit of a perfect storm right were opening our dc – were opening dc stores we see relative low wholesale growth for all the reasons that we detailed in our prepared remarks and some of the questions we see that accelerating in the second half and thats where you start to see that leverage erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co got it thank you guys and best of luck steven e rendle  vf corp thanks erinn scott a roe  vf corp thanks erinn operator well go next to bob drbul of guggenheim robert drbul  guggenheim securities llc hi good morning guys steven e rendle  vf corp hey bob scott a roe  vf corp bob robert drbul  guggenheim securities llc i was wondering if you could spend a little time just on vans the trends that youre seeing especially in the us and the competitive set their inventory levels and then the second question that i have is on the inventory levels in the business so like with wholesale revenues being down  and inventories i think were up  can you talk about how like wholesale inventories are for you guys heading into the remainder of the year and how youre planning the wholesale part of the business versus your dc part of the business given that your expectations are for a significant pickup in the second half of the year steven e rendle  vf corp so bob ill take vans and then let scott grab that second question so from a vans standpoint here in the us – but it really it applies to how the vans businesses is managing itself across each of the regions – is just a really strong broad diversified set of products starting first with footwear and not depending on a single style but really leveraging the classics and then there within old skool bringing new innovations in their pro skate collection were looking at new launches in apparel launched a new authentic chino this spring helped brought to market through our innovation platform just how we use the different franchises that we have across each of these apparel and footwear collections in their segmentation strategy and how we bring those to life in our stores and digital i think really separates vans from the rest of the marketplace and its their intense focus on their consumer and the focusing on those emotional elements of music art and street culture and how we are connecting digitally with our consumers our customs platform which we launched last year continues to accelerate as we expand  the offer and the means by which consumers can upload content to have us then transfer that onto footwear theyre just bringing a lot of new ideas each season across each of these different categories of product and doing it consistently across the globe and tying that to the experiences that they have through marketing and events really separates them from the rest of the marketplace and i think kind of puts them in a category in many ways in their own right scott a roe  vf corp yeah and so bob versus you – or kind of your inventory related question so a couple things number one we do have pretty good line of sight to the balance of the year so as it relates to the quality of our inventory we feel good about that right we dont see any issues and from a quality standpoint also remember that the marketplace is substantially cleaner as we look at it now theres a few – theres always a few pockets here and there but as an overall statement we would say that retail inventories are in good shape and we dont see any issues on a go forward basis robert drbul  guggenheim securities llc great thank you very much operator well go next to kate mcshane of citi kate mcshane  citigroup global markets inc hi good morning thanks for taking my question scott with your guidance for q of  to  i know you said the visibility to jeanswear is tough because you dont quite know where its going to break but what are you assuming for jeanswear in order to get to that eps growth scott a roe  vf corp yeah so were looking at down midsingle digits on a currency neutral basis in the second quarter thats what our current guidance implies and again what were saying is weve seen some variability frankly in the first quarter it was the timing shifted a little bit from us and it was a little more severe than we had anticipated we had some offsets which helped us get back on an overall basis and so we would – thats really whats behind the comment just a little uncertainty on how the timing of all this is going to wind through the process kate mcshane  citigroup global markets inc okay okay and would you say what youre assuming is a base case scenario or scott a roe  vf corp well if you back up if you go to the high end of our range thats essentially in line with what we said in february right so were saying we see a path to – and remember all this is excluding lsg so the guidance we gave in february included lsg weve kind of given you the roadmap on how to model taking lsg out of it so excluding that impact the  would be right in line with our previous outlook and were saying there could be as much as a  variation on that based on the timing of jeanswear kate mcshane  citigroup global markets inc okay great and then my second question is i know there have been some management changes in the outdoor coalition and i think north face as well i just wondered if you could walk us through some of the newer hires that have been made and if there are still any bigger positions that still need to be filled steven e rendle  vf corp sure kate ill do that there have been some changes in our outdoor business last year we made a change at timberland in jim pisani who presented at the investor conference is our new leader there very excited about the leadership that hes bringing to that team i think the north face is where we have two openings of significance our president and our head of product we are very close to naming a new president for the north face brand and with that shortly thereafter with that individuals participation well make that move on head of product the good news is we have some really steady strong sets of hands in that business scott baxter out head of that group is working day to day with our north face brand weve recently moved arne arens from europe our gm of our european business is now our gm of the americas arne has presented at the investor conference very strong history with our brands strong leadership and deep deep understanding of our brand so really feel confident about where we are in our north face kind of time line and the – really the search that weve utilized to identify that new leader now we also placed a new president at smartwool and travis campbell comes to us from a relatively similar background very strong general management skills passion for this category and the outdoors and hes bringing really good leadership to that brand so those would be those openings that weve had and feeling good about where we are kate mcshane  citigroup global markets inc thank you operator well take our next question from jonathan komp robert w baird jonathan r komp  robert w baird  co inc broker yes hi thanks scott if i could ask just a clarification on the guidance for the full year first of all i understand  coming lower when you exclude the lsg business im just wondering the thought on holding the earnings decline rate for  i would assume that you might have some proceeds from lsg that you could put to productive use through buying back stock or something like that so any comment on either the proceeds or kind of the assumptions behind holding the growth rate scott a roe  vf corp yeah no good question so we talked about returning  billion to shareholders this year which includes a  billion repurchase obviously we had some line of sight to whats going on with lsg and so we were assuming those proceeds in that  billion buyback so we are not intending to increase the  billion at this time jonathan r komp  robert w baird  co inc broker okay great thats helpful and then on the gross margin cadence through the year i just wanted to ask about some of the puts and takes i mean obviously the first quarter was strong and i think might account for your entire fullyear projected gross margin increase so im just wondering for the next three quarters what some of the puts and takes you see there scott a roe  vf corp yeah yeah id say it was really strong by the way so yeah we saw mix was really strong in the first quarter about  basis points and thats close to what we see for the year a little less than that for the year and our rate was up  basis points several factors there so we do see some price benefit its about  for the full year and thats a little bit more toward the first half cost the same we see cost benefit in the first half that actually turns the other way in the second half and for the year and thats to kind of a small number those are some different – those are two shaping things and then finally if you just think about that mix number as it evolves so as our jeanswear business accelerates as our image business accelerates throughout the year youre going to see some of that mix come back the other direction so off to a really good start one quarter in the other thing i would just remind everybody at this point were one quarter in and we got a lot of real estate ahead of us so could we have been a little conservative maybe but looking at the balance of puts and takes we think thats a prudent place to be one quarter into the year jonathan r komp  robert w baird  co inc broker and just to follow up your prepared remark about sacrificing a little growth for quality near term is that more backward looking in the last quarter or two or do you see that continuing scott a roe  vf corp well i think youll see a continuation of that philosophy now the reality is a lot of that is behind us now in terms of were not doing much offprice theres not much included in this outlook for  because weve already cleaned a lot of that up in general what weve said is we would prefer to dispose of things through our own outlets its more brand appropriate and thats really why theyre there and so if that means holding a little inventory and selling it through in a more brand enhancing way then were going to make that choice jonathan r komp  robert w baird  co inc broker okay great thank you scott a roe  vf corp yeah just to follow up on that too i think youre starting to really see – i said this in my prepared remarks but we believe were really starting to see that philosophy pay off and of the best proxies for that is gross margin and were really encouraged to see that strong gross margin rate in the first quarter we talked about focus on fundamentals thats one of the markers that shows that the strategy is paying off operator well go next to sam poser susquehanna sam poser  susquehanna financial group lllp thank you for taking my question ive got two questions one is more housekeeping can you give us some idea of the jansport and licensed sports revenue by quarter for last year so we can really model this properly scott a roe  vf corp yeah so we gave you the quarter and the full year in the table and weve said its  to  per quarter from an earnings standpoint so while i guess we didnt break out exactly the by quarter you can assume based on that that its fairly evenly spread through the balance of the year sam poser  susquehanna financial group lllp okay and then i mean – and then secondly i mean i guess my question is is with the us the sort of mature us market for some of your larger brands one within your guidance for jeanswear and in general how many store closures domestically do you have built in to like the current guidance and the fiveyear guidance and then secondly what gives you the confidence that the european influence will move appropriately to the us i mean what direction – are you sure its going that way or is it just that the international businesses are less developed started like the timberland business overseas doesnt have the reliance on the classic boot how do you get a gauge on whats pushing what which direction i guess scott a roe  vf corp yes ill start with the kind of the numbers side of that question sam so were not going to get into the specifics of what weve put in or whats in whats out but just generally just to reorient the comments i made earlier were really not expecting in the fiveyear plan any net wholesale growth in the us and within that we will see growth for sure but we know its going to be choppy we may have a year where we see a little growth then we may see continued bankruptcies and were sure thats going to happen we have modeled it behind the scenes but thats not – for reasons i think you can appreciate thats not something that were going to talk about what were assuming on some of our customers in a public forum just know that again when you think about where is our growth going to come from its going to come from our dc our digital and that includes our digital partners as well and our international wholesale thats whats driving the next five years from our standpoint steven e rendle  vf corp yes sam we absolutely see further consolidation here in the us market and really weve built our plans with that in mind and to scotts point that net neutral number wholesale here in the us market the comment around europe and the influence that we see from our international business its not necessarily style or designs that we have in those marketplaces its more the discipline around thoughtful segmentation elevated product really strong experiential marketing within our own environments and our wholesale partners and the way our leadership teams in specifically europe are driving the business in a very methodical professional way its those disciplines and the need to elevate product our focus around design and innovation and what that means to product and brand experience thats what id ask you to take away and those disciplines being utilized across our business its the disciplines that sit within our vans north america business here its one of the reasons theyre so successful in putting together quarter after quarter positive results its taking that discipline making sure its well placed in each of our large brands and just having the disciplined conversations to give us confidence in the long term sustainability of our growth but this is – to be honest with you sam this is one of the reasons we made management changes is to really get that leadership in place the movement of arne to our us business just bringing that focus that leadership presence to these key brands gives us confidence that everything weve been talking about from a longerterm standpoint is absolutely within our line of sight sam poser  susquehanna financial group lllp thanks and one last thing i mean with the north face brand when you talk so much about all the technical attributes there was an earlier question regarding some of the different technologies that youve had over the years and what you have i mean how much of this is technology related and how much of it is style related i mean if your stuff looks good and keeps you warm and protects you and breathes appropriately isnt that sort of expected and then the changing of styling and compelling other people to buy new stuff is this technology – and ive read this in the notes about other companies is this technology the icing or the cake when it comes to the brand steven e rendle  vf corp wow sam thats a question at a guy who really loves technology so ill have to be careful about how i manage this answer its both its style first we know that when a consumer walks into a store they notice color followed by style that brings you over to look at the product and then how you interact with it is where your – again some of the style components of the quality of the material can i understand what the technology is in the garment is it relevant to my needs its why we have moved to this consumer focused business unit approach is having more of a clear understanding across those four brand territories of what the consumer needs are style and function equally balanced and really having the discipline of building thoughtful collections for each of the channels of distribution so we can put the very best designed product with all of the right features and functions out there so that when you do use the product that it performs to the highest level of expectation but at the same time you feel good and look good in that product so its really a balance of both sam poser  susquehanna financial group lllp thank you very much and good luck steven e rendle  vf corp thanks sam operator and that is all the time we have for questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over to steve rendle for any additional or closing comments steven e rendle  vf corp so thank you everybody for joining us were excited to share with you how weve begun the year i hope what you take away is our growth drivers remain very much intact and our three largest brands delivering against expectation and in some cases doing a little bit better our dc and digital platforms performing well and international continuing to deliver strong results and all of that balanced with our fundamentals as we look to improve how we operate the gross margin expansion thats giving us the confidence and the fuel to invest behind our strategic choices as we pivot to become more consumer and retail centric and really giving us a much more agile and efficient approach to our gotomarket so thank you and we look forward to talking to you next quarter operator that does conclude our

performance in the face of an unpredictable retail environment around the world demonstrates the strength of our brand portfolio and diversified value creation model were in the early phases of our journey to become a more agile and consumer centric organization and we are encouraged by our strong start to  during the second quarter revenue increased  which was slightly ahead of our expectations as core growth engines continued to accelerate our big three brands vans the north face and timberland grew at a combined rate of  our international business grew  including  growth in china directtoconsumer grew  and our digital business was up more than  and growth accelerated to  in workwear our digital wholesale accounts a key growth driver for vf over the next five years also increased at a high singledigit rate through the first half of  gross margin improved  basis points an exceptional performance which again exceeded our expectations vfs brands are strong we remain disciplined in our renewed focus on elevating our creative capabilities specifically in product design to enrich consumers brand experience coupled with stronger marketplace management is driving more profitable growth and further strengthening our brand equity eps was  in the quarter at the highend of the range we guided to in april we also repurchased an incremental  million of stock which when combined with our strong dividend brings our anticipated total cash returns to shareholders in  to more than  billion strengthening total shareholder return remains a top priority as we look to the second half of  we are gaining momentum across key dimensions of our business and we see several catalysts on the horizon to ignite accelerated growth and value creation in our core growth engines as a result we are raising our fullyear  revenue outlook to  billion based on strongerthanexpected growth in our outdoor  action sports business most notably vans and the north face brands dc and workwear additionally for the second consecutive quarter we are raising our gross margin guidance now to  our strong gross margin performance is a central element of our diversified value creation model it provides us the flexibility and fuel to accelerate investment and drive growth behind our largest opportunities in light of our increased revenue growth in gross margin expectations we are investing an additional  million or  per share in  to amplify our momentum and fuel accelerated growth as we move into  our  eps outlook is now  which reflects the highend of our previous outlook and includes the incremental investment just mentioned earlier this year i said that vf is a value creation company and some wondered what that meant this quarters results begin to provide evidence of our commitment to value creation were in the business of creating catalysts through our strong portfolio of diverse global brands we will continue to reshape our portfolio and accelerate growth and while we expect the retail landscape to remain uncertain we will invest against our largest growth opportunities to create momentum rather than wait for it with that lets review our second quarter results and dive deeper into our top five brands workwear and sportswear starting with the north face brand global revenue increased  driven by a  increase in europe and a  growth in both the americas and asia revenue growth during the quarter was driven by strong results from our dc business which increased at a midteen rate wholesale was relatively flat for the quarter however excluding the impact of bankruptcies in the americas which didnt really start to impact us into the second half of  global revenue for the north face increased at a high singledigit rate for the first half of  global revenue for the north face increased  or  excluding the impact of bankruptcies just mentioned by region revenue growth in the americas was driven by midteen growth in dc with strong results from digital which grew more than  in the quarter this was partially offset by a high singledigit decrease in wholesale due in large part to the impact of bankruptcies turning to product performance the success of the apex flex jacket continued with outside magazine naming it one of the best summer jackets of  and we cant forget to mention the north face athlete alex honnold who made climbing history when he completed the first freesolo ascent of el capitan in yosemite i’m not if sure everyone can appreciate just how remarkable the steep was a  foot granite wall in less than four hours climbing alone and without safety gear with only his shoes shorts and chalk bag the mental and physical strength required are beyond comprehension alex your passion encouraged an inspiration to us all thank you for being the perfect embodiment of the north face spirit of exploration in europe consumer demand for north face brand remains very strong across the region our wholesale business was particularly solid with growth of nearly  and dc grew at a high singledigit rate the brand has tremendous momentum as we move into the second half of the year based on the forwardlooking visibility we have into our order books as well as broadbased strength across key product categories in markets we expect more than  growth for the balance of  in asia second quarter revenue sequentially improved as high teen growth in dc was partially offset by an expected high teen decline in wholesale from a product standpoint outdoor training launched on april  with more than  sellthrough supported by the i train for marketing campaign across the region and the opening of the first global outdoor training station in shanghai our urban exploration territory also continues to perform very well in asia providing consumers an opportunity to experience the brand new use occasions while the outdoor environment remains highly promotional in china and we continue to consolidate our retail partners and aggressively manage inventory in the marketplace we expect accelerated growth in the second half of  including mid singledigit growth in the third quarter there is no change to our mid singledigit growth expectation for the north face brand in  that being said based on our strong first half performance current order book visibility and increased confidence for the balance of the year we now expect growth to be at the higher end of that mid singledigit range regarding the shape of our second half performance fewer offprice sales and a significant shift in the timing of our order books from september to october which scott will touch on later will likely result in a mid singledigit decline in revenue for the third quarter normalizing for the timing shift however revenue growth for the third quarter would be in the low to mid singledigit range now to our largest and fastestgrowing brand vans global revenue was up  with  growth in the americas  growth in europe and  growth in asia from a channel perspective dc increased more than  with  growth in our digital business as expected wholesale declined at a low singledigit rate in the americas our dc business remained strong with more than  growth in the quarter including over  growth in digital and high teen comp growth wholesale declined at a mid singledigit rate pressured primarily by conditions in the family channel where we are in the midst of a product transition and up against strong distribution gains a yearago based on current visibility as well as a significant momentum we have in the business we now expect low doubledigit growth in the americas in  vans brand growth extends across multiple product categories and families while the old skool has recently become the number one classic style the iconic slip on and checkerboard styles and designs are seeing tremendous growth up more than  in the quarter targeting the core skate community the new athlete inspired ultrarange pro was recently launched and at a  price point saw real strength in the market with more than  sellthrough in skate and board sport accounts vans product collaborations have always been incredibly popular with consumers and the indiscernible colab was no exception and last but not least our powerful customs platform which blends the experiential with the transactional increased at a triple digit rate and is the only  and is only beginning to tap its full potential in the market as we add functionality each month in europe the vans business is performing better than expected as demand continues to accelerate our dc performance was exceptional with more than  growth driven by more than  increase in digital and  comp growth in line with the expectations wholesale declined at a low singledigit rate due to the timing of shipments based on strongerthanexpected second half orders we now expect our vans europe business to increase at a low doubledigit rate for  including strong high teen growth in the second half of this year in asia our vans business is firing on all cylinders delivering almost  growth marking the fourth consecutive quarter of more than  growth in the region results during the quarter were powered by  growth in dc with strength across all markets including almost  growth in digital in china looking to our outlook for  we now expect global revenue growth for vans to be at the highend of our low doubledigit growth range as expected timberland return to growth in the second quarter as global revenue increased  in line with our low singledigit growth outlook for the year growth was nicely balanced with a mid singledigit increase in dc and a low singledigit increase in wholesale timberland brand revenue in the americas increased  with high singledigit growth in dc including  growth in digital and low singledigit growth in wholesale our nonclassics business increased at a low doubledigit rate during the quarter with more than  growth in our new platforms including sensorflex and aerocore our timberland pro business also remained very strong with more than  growth our growth strategy is gaining traction as we work to diversify in north america business toward a more balanced assortment the strong sellthrough we are seeing with our nonclassics products gives us confidence we can drive accelerated growth in the second half of  and into next year in europe timberland brand revenue was up  in the second quarter driven by low doubledigit growth in dc partially offset by a modest decline in wholesale growth across the region is strong and broadbased with more than  growth in our new platforms such as sensorflex and aerocore and high singledigit growth in apparel our european business has good momentum and is expected to deliver high singledigit growth in the second half of  timberlands asia business improved sequentially but was down  as dc declined at a low singledigit rate and wholesale was in line with last year high singledigit comp growth including more than  growth in digital revenue was offset by our strategic decision to close underperforming doors in some of our more mature markets at the same time our new footwear plus dc concept is performing well across the region and we continue to achieve scale and significant momentum in china as revenue increased an impressive  regarding the shape of our second half performance similar to the north face brand a significant shift in the timing of our order books will likely result in a low singledigit decline in revenue for the third quarter however when normalizing for the timing shift revenue growth for the third quarter will likely be in the low singledigit range theres no change to our low singledigit growth outlook for timberland brand in  moving to the wrangler brand as expected global revenue for the second quarter was down  dc increased at a low doubledigit rate but was offset by a low singledigit decline in wholesale revenue in the americas declined  while revenue in europe increased  and asia which represents less than  of global brand revenue declined at a low doubledigit rate for the quarter primarily because of the continuing demand weakness in india primarily related to fiscal policy changes as we outlined in april our us business continues to be impacted by inventory destocking related to the strategic repositioning of a key customer and channel consolidation and while our forward visibility remains low and the quartertoquarter variability is difficult to predict we do believe were on track to return to moderate growth in the second half of this year most notably in the fourth quarter and we’re seeing strong growth with our digital wholesale partners and in our own wranglercom business our efforts to elevate the brand and extend more deeply into new channels such as department stores and specialty retail are showing early signs of success from a product perspective the th anniversary retro glory collection continues to attract new and existing consumers with strong sellthrough globally and to wrap up the wrangler brand our outdoor line is performing very well now to the lee brand revenue declined  with  growth in dc offset by a low doubledigit decline in wholesale the lee americas business was down  as ongoing channel weakness and consolidations as well as difficult market conditions in our womens product more than offset solid performance in our mens business xtreme comfort khakis and extreme motion denim are clearly resonating with the male lee consumer lee europe was down  as low singledigit growth in dc was offset by a mid singledigit decline in wholesale in asia revenue declined slightly as mid singledigit growth in china was offset by ongoing weakness in india our womens business in china increased at a doubledigit rate powered by our body optix and jade fusion innovations which should drive improved performance in the second half of  turning now to imagewear revenue was up  in the quarter due in part to lsg jersey sales as part of the transition agreement with fanatics which acquired our licensing business early this year we will supply jerseys for oneyear following the transaction excluding the impact of lsg jersey revenue our image business was up  and consistent with our growing optimism about our workwear platform which includes our image business as well as our timberland pro and wrangler riggs workwear revenue growth accelerated to  in the quarter with at least  growth in three of our largest brands timberland pro bulwark and wrangler riggs workwear we are very bullish on the workwear space and are clearly advantaged owner in our highest return on capital business in addition to the macro tailwinds we see forming we have a unique opportunity to drive accelerated growth and value creation in a highly fragmented market we will accelerate growth by leveraging our expertise capabilities and platforms with some of the strongest brands in the sector with this solid performance and favorable outlook we now expect image revenue to increase at a mid singledigit rate in  excluding the lsg jersey business and up from our previous estimate of a low singledigit rate increase looking at sportswear revenue is showing signs of stabilization and profit has improved congratulations to our new management team which is beginning to make progress in a difficult environment and with that ill turn it over to scott a  scott a roe thanks steve our second quarter results were right in line with our expectations and came in at the highend of the range we communicated back in april revenue growth accelerated to  during the quarter driven by strong results from our core growth engines our big three brands were up  on a combined basis led by strength in vans and the north face brands which grew  and  respectively as expected timberland delivered  growth in the quarter and our workwear businesses increased  collectively with timberland pro bulwark and wrangler riggs all achieving at least  growth our international business grew  with consistent growth across all three regions china remains our fastestgrowing market generating  growth and we were particularly encouraged to see that our directtoconsumer business was up  including more than  growth in our digital business thats even more impressive when you consider that our store count is down from the prior quarter and our growth rate accelerated our outdoor  action sports jeanswear and international businesses all achieved high teen dc growth during the quarter our dc business has significant momentum as we head into the second half of the year but more on that in a minute consistent with our expectations wholesale revenue declined  primarily due to the channel pressures in our jeanswear north american business which as  which we previously discussed international delivered low singledigit growth and our digital wholesale accounts grew at a high singledigit rate through the first half gross margin remained strong at  up  basis points which includes an  basis point negative impact from changes in fx that is  basis point increase currency neutral and better than our prior expectations as we discussed we remain sharply focused on fundamentals even at the expense of a little bit of revenue growth in the nearterm first half gross margins of  were up  basis points currency neutral our strong gross margin performance is a core element of the diversified value creation model that provides us with flexibility and fuel to accelerate investment and drive growth behind our largest opportunities sga as a percentage of revenue was up  basis points to  in the quarter to address a question likely on your mind let me take a few minutes and provide more context around the shape of our expense and investment profile this year and keep in mind that the second quarter is the lowest volume quarter of the year so our sga ratios are always a little distorted while we remain diligent with respect to overall expense control we are making deliberate growth focused investments in our strategic priorities dc and in particular digital product innovation demand creation and technology in fact through the first half our investment in these areas account for more than all of the sga increase versus last year as our focus on agility and cost optimization allowed us to reduce cost elsewhere as we told you in boston at our investor day we’ve made the strategic decision in  to begin investing now rather than wait for our anticipated growth acceleration in the second half in fact weve committed an additional  million of investments in demand creation and strategic priorities this year our investments will accelerate growth as we move into  and its to our advantage to move quickly and take the offensive ph our brands are strong and in a marketplace that continues to experience significant disruption we believe we have a unique investment and growth opportunity when many of our competitors are on their heels so putting this all together this means that we expect sga to deleverage through the first three quarters of this year as our growth accelerates in the fourth quarter and we began to realize the benefit of our agility and cost optimization efforts we expect to drive significant leverage in sga in the second half and into  second quarter operating margin declined  basis points to  including a  basis point negative impact from changes in fx as well as the growth investments just mentioned so carrying all this to the bottom line our eps of  was in line with prioryear on a currency neutral basis turning to the balance sheet our inventory increased  slightly less than our second half growth expectation during the quarter we repurchased about  million of stock bringing our total share repurchase to  billion so far this year thats  million higher than our previous expectation and when combined with our strong dividend brings our anticipated total cash return to shareholders in  to more than  billion that’s an  cash flow yield based on our current market cap the first half was in line with or slightly better than we expected based on the momentum we have in our business and the additional investments were making to fuel accelerated growth we are raising our outlook for the fullyear our updated  outlook now includes the following reported revenue is expected to be up  or  on a currency neutral basis to  billion this compares to our previous expectation of low singledigit increase our increased revenue outlook is driven by strength in outdoor  action sports particularly vans and the north face increased expectation for dc most notably digital and higher growth from our workwear businesses gross margin is now expected to improve about  basis points to  which still includes a  basis point headwind from fx this represents a  basis point improvement relative to our previous outlook of  operating margin is still expected to approximate  on a reported basis including about a  basis point negative impact from changes in fx eps is now expected to be  down  on a reported basis but up at a mid singledigit rate on a currency neutral basis our outlook now includes  per share or  million pretax impact from additional investments to fuel accelerated growth into  as a reminder our prior eps outlook was a range of  to  now let me provide a few comments regarding the shape of our second half as it relates to the third quarter which has historically represented the peak for fall shipments we’ve seen a significant shift in order book timing from the end of september to early october simply put as consumers by a closer to need our key retail partners are setting their floors later which pushes our shipments from what has traditionally been q and to q and while we have visibility to the orders the shift has pushed almost  million of wholesale revenue into q compared to a yearago as a result we expect revenue growth in the third quarter to be in the low singledigit range and eps to be in the range of  to  normalizing for the wholesale timing shift our revenue and eps growth rate for q would be in the mid singledigit range some with the first half behind us we are confident in our increased growth outlook and have good momentum as we move into the second half of the year our core growth engines are delivering high singledigit growth our gross margin is strong our fundamentals are intact and we are investing in our future growth drivers and as steve mentioned given our momentum and the confidence we have in our growth plan were putting more investment behind our largest brands and growth platforms and returning more cash to shareholders we will create momentum not wait for it if you take away one thing from our comments i hope that one thing is confidence confidence in our outlook confidence in our brands and our people and confidence in our strategy i’m going to close by addressing the topic i know is top of mind for many investors the ma environment as you recall reshaping our portfolio is the number one choice in our  strategy we are committed to active portfolio management as we’ve said we believe we are a value creation company we have a robust pipeline of opportunities and the activity has increased over the past few months and we continue to evaluate the shape of our existing portfolio we look forward to keeping you updated our progress with that ill turn it back to the operator and we will open the call for your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions we will have our first question from bob drbul with guggenheim securities robert drbul hi guys good morning steven e rendle good morning bob scott a roe good morning bob robert drbul i guess the two questions the first one is more on when you look at the third quarter expectation in some of the detail on like the order book or the changes in the order book have there been any material changes to the total number or its just a shift into the third or the timing of it and the second question that i have is around the jeanswear business can you just give us an update on the transition its underway is there really a site line to stabilization in the jeanswear business where the profit pressures are pretty significant scott a roe so bob i will take the first part of that first of all our visibility versus what you guys can see is really what we tried to bridge here right we  there is really no change in what we see for the fullyear relative to the order books its  we’re just talking about a little bit of a shift in timing and just to put that in perspective we are literally talking about a couple weeks but thats the difference between q and q so absolutely no change in the big picture just a little bit of timing between q and q thats why we tried to zoom out and say if you look at the second half its kind of in that mid singledigit range and normalizing but you’re going to see a little of noise when you compare to last year when you specifically look at just the third quarter steven e rendle and bob your jeanswear question really there is little new news and little change to what we’ve talked about in the past the big room  big picture remains the same but our visibility is not great and we expect variability as we continue through the year though we do see a line of sight to an uptick coming back in the fourth quarter and its important to remember in our jeanswear business our international business continues to be strong especially in china where we see our lee womens business continue to grow at doubledigit great growth rates behind the two innovations body optix and jade fusion i think once we get through the destocking phase velocity will increase and thats where i think we vf really comes into play and our ability to respond quickly with the strength of our supply chain and the quality of our team that works on that business not to be able to really read and react quickly to be back  right back in the game robert drbul great thank you very much operator we will go next to lindsay drucker mann with goldman sachs lindsay drucker mann thanks good morning everyone with respect to your cold weather businesses specifically north face but also timberland is your view that you’re retail partners have ordered to reasonable end demand for a normal coldweather season or are we in a stage here where they’re ordering very very tight and looking to chase and have you based your orders on what youre pulling in terms of inventory in terms of their orders or have you put yourself in a position where you have excess inventory in order to chase into that demand steven e rendle yes hi lindsay this is steve i would characterize the outdoor specialty in even more broadly the outdoor community as buying very tight with  two years in a row multiyears where we’ve seen variable winters retailers are playing it very close to the best they’re investing behind those brands that have momentum and bringing those truly innovative products our inventory we  as you know we buy to our order book with a real thoughtful amount of reorder around key styles within each of these brands i would tell you where the strength sits for us its in the performance of our dc and you saw in this quarter where our comps are strong our digital is exceptional and i really would put that behind  the marketplace is clean and were sitting in an environment where  its to the rest of the year were not  our ability to chase is limited from a wholesale and probably where if as we see momentum in digital and dc thats really our opportunity from  if strong trends continue lindsay drucker mann got it and scott could you just walk through the drivers of the gross margin improvement in the quarter i know you talked about fx but anything specific to channel shift direct versus wholesale cost pricing etcetera to break down the change that we saw in the quarter would be helpful scott a roe yes sure so there is about  basis points of negative impact from fx i think it was in the prepared remarks so that means about  currency neutral that mix has been really consistent at that  to  basis points and we saw the mix come in through thats our dc digital international businesses being strong remember also we talked in february about the shape of cost right so cost through the first half is a tailwind to us it turns to a little bit of headwind in the second half for the fullyear its really not much of a factor so were seeing a little bit of benefit now that will turn negative in the second half and  but really not a huge factor like i said and then the other thing is honestly just better fundamentals we’ve reduced our offprice sales we’re focused on  not bringing excess inventory into the channel and were seeing more full price sellthrough along with better dc and digital those things are all pretty virtuous from a gross margin standpoint lindsay drucker mann great thanks so much scott a roe thank you operator we will go next to michael binetti ubs michael binetti congrats on a nice quarter i want to ask you about the  million in incremental investment obviously we just went through  the big fiveyear outlook with an investment plan there and so now we’ve got  million on top of it i just want to ask at a highlevel as you think about that what are some of the areas that youre seeing is it more recent stuff that you’ve seen as an opportunity you decided to dialup  million or is it just extending things from the analyst day and then  obviously how do you think about the payback on dialing that up as you’ve already gave an initial plan how does that  million flowthrough to your earnings outlook maybe in the indiscernible steven e rendle yes michael this is steve so really its based on our confidence as we look at where we are yeartodate and what we  line of sight to what we have for the balance of year we just have confidence in what wed like to do and what weve chosen to do is thoughtfully invest behind a select number of our strategic choices that we outlined in boston to get us moving into  where we talked about maintaining and building continued momentum so about a quarter of that  million is going against demand creation within our big three brands in dc and digital we expect that to have an impact this year and into next year but half is around specific strategic priorities design and innovation data and analytics our digital platform absolutely continuing to move on advanced manufacturing and innovation projects we have in play there and then talent talent really is the great driver for us longterm and we are continuing to look at acquiring as well as developing key talent to help us grow longterm michael binetti got it and then on north face specifically i think the one thing we heard coming out of the analyst day was i think we’ve some new leadership there so maybe there would be some more  more material update to the strategy after the analyst day i would love to check in on that how you guys are feeling about innovation for the year and then also just a little bit more on some of the strength youre seeing in europe where is that coming from its been several quarters now of very very big growth above what you see across i guess a lot of the channels in europe from other companies so i’d love to hear a little bit more about whats driving that business scott a roe yes and i would love to talk about that i think you remember in boston we introduced you to arne arens who at that point had been the leader of our european business and we are moving him to be the gm of the americas business he has since been appointed the president of the global north face business and just bringing that that strong leadership presence and vision that he had in europe to our total global business and you just really see that in very short order the confidence that  now sits within that broader north face team the clarity of focus against their strategy and you’re starting to see the momentum in our dc business specifically i will answer your point on what  as we think about year and innovation the apex flex jacket which came out in the spring was a really good beginning to seeing new products move into the marketplace this fall youre going to see dramatically updated summit series collection and there is a jacket in their called the ventrix that were very excited about that not only plays into the tier  aspect of the marketplace but also into our  into some of the broader market partners we also see some new ski lines coming in conjunction with the focus on mountain sports and then urban exploration more of that north face lifestyle presentation that just gets us into a broader set of usage occasions i think what you see going on in europe really is a much tighter focus if you remember couple of years ago we went through a reset there as well and arne led the  the return to growth through a much much more focused integrated marketplace management and significant segmentation tailoring and merchandising line specifically to wholesale partners as well as our own dc and as that momentum builds you’re seeing those results not only in our first half but in our expectation of getting that mid teen growth through the balance of  so this speaks to the benefit of quality leadership clarity of vision and focusing on creating products and brand experiences that consumers can be drawn into michael binetti i guess just to follow that really quickly is  we can see as it go through your stores in the us now some of the bigger ones starting to get segmented harder between the four different north face segments is the thinking that we can really follow that similar road map has driven such nice growth rates in europe in us i guess as you pull back on some of the wholesale doors in the us you can  you still think there is pretty good growth rates ahead for the north face as you start pushing out similar segmentation strategy here in the dc side scott a roe we absolutely do michael i mean i think you remember at boston we talked about a brand that would grow  to  on a fiveyear cagr we just raised our guidance this year to the highend of our mid single which is at the lowend of that  to  growth cagr that we posted for the fiveyear so we have great confidence just move into these four specific brand territories just allows our product team and the marketing team to focus on these key usage occasions for our core consumer speaking to the core consumer but also attracting new consumers and you see that in europe you see that in asia and we have great confidence that that will absolutely work here in the domestic market michael binetti okay thanks a lot scott operator we will go next to camilo lyon canaccord genuity camilo lyon thanks good morning gentlemen how are you steven e rendle hey camilo camilo lyon i was hoping you could speak a little bit about your endeavors around accelerating your speed ph to market capabilities and where do you see  which brands you see the most opportunity and that impacting the pl first to last i think that’s clearly a function that you guys are working hard to have and already achieved in but i’m curious to know where your thoughts on how you can really leverage that to your benefit so you can expect more from your dc goals across the brand steven e rendle right what we talked a little about this camilo in boston and its a foundational element of our new fiveyear strategy its one of those key choices around transforming to be more consumer and retail centric and what we’re looking at there is really the endtoend process of product creation and everything to do with going to market weve got a number of projects underway with our largest brands where we’re really tearing down the timelines of product creation as well as manufacturing and looking at where can we take time out how can we use digital technology to advance our ability to be more agile but its also true the integrated marketplace strategy segmentation and merchandising very specific collections to the distribution choice and building really well articulated  well merchandised collections and flowing them in a more relevant and consistent way so moving away from this old wholesale model that you’ve seen so many people do over the years to being present more often through more thoughtfully merchandised lines and its challenging every aspect of our product creation cycle our supply chain is deeply involved in this project and really helping shepherd how our product creation teams are looking at this and how they can be more integrated in thoughtful in improving our speed to market camilo lyon does it right to think that north face maybe the brand that feels the benefits of the first as you layer on the innovation that you’re talking about indiscernible of your four categories and how you’re improving the global process steven e rendle the north face is certainly one of those brands that’s deep into the work and i think each one of our big brands will benefit but to your point specifically yes the north face will benefit being  thinking through the lens of four specific territories across each of the regions into each of the specific channels when you can focus on doing fewer things better the results typically are always very positive camilo lyon and then scott since you brought it up i was just curious to get your latest thoughts on if your hunting ground for acquisition has changed or has evolved i would assume that the discussion well  tell me if the discussions have changed to become a little bit more fluid with respect to valuations and if that’s  if theres been a closer dialog with respect to the indiscernible grounds of where buyers and sellers indiscernible scott a roe well i guess i’d answer it this way camilo one of the nice byproducts of the disruption and carnage in our sector is the fact that valuations are coming a little bit our way and given our strong balance sheet the cash that we generate that puts us as an advantaged acquirer in the space so valuation as i try to say is only one component of the equation right and it has to be first of all the right brand the right space and something that we’re an advantaged owner to make it  make sense but given that valuation is always going to be a key component and valuations in general are moving our directions so i would say its a slightly more favorable environment compared to say the last  the  months camilo lyon and then for your hunting ground is that  it used to be if i recall correctly you’re focused on the outdoor  action sports face footwear was a key category that you’ve been looking at is that evolve steven e rendle yes camilo this is steve ill take that if you remember back in boston i stated pretty clearly that i’d really like the external world to not think of us as an outdoor  action sports company but as a value creation company that is deeply informed by our understanding of our core consumer anchored in our powerful brands and certainly a center of gravity sitting in outdoor  action sports but its less about really the  the sector and its more about the consumer usage occasions and where can we find a way to bring our skills and capabilities and the benefits of our platforms to bear it to unlock these new pools of value the number one choice in our integrated strategy is reshaping our portfolio and we are extremely committed to doing just that in aligning our portfolio to be consistent with our financial aspirations camilo lyon got it thanks a lot guys good luck operator we will go next to laurent vasilescu with macquarie laurent vasilescu good morning and congrats on the continued momentum in the business i want to follow up on the incremental investment in terms of the  impact how should we think about it between q and q and can we potentially further parse out in basis points the sga deleverage anticipated for the third quarter versus the leverage expected for the fourth quarter scott a roe good morning laurent i would expect a question like that as youre building that massive model the  we havent really shaped it but steve made a comment and some of that is in the second quarter you saw some of that incremental investment we even got going in the second quarter and its relatively balanced through the third and fourth this is the way i would answer that so the  and from a gross margin standpoint weve talked to you about the fullyear you know with the first half is you can assume thats fairly linear through the back half so i think that gives you the pieces to shape the second half of the year and model it out reasonably well laurent vasilescu okay super helpful and then a nonmodeling question a number of key vendors like nike and ralph lauren have recently outlined efforts to edit this can you count going forward your march investor day i think the term editing the portfolio with you several times so aside from any potential divestitures or acquisitions are there any internal processes you may be putting in place around indiscernible assortment to further drive the gross margin over time steven e rendle yes laurent that is real key to the transformation project that i answer just a little bit ago as you think about integrated marketplace and whats the correct number of skus in each of the specific deliveries to be agile and relevant to our consumer editing skus to amplify stronger product is a key part of that i dont have any specific metrics that i would share with you today but it is central to how we’re thinking about editing to amplify and becoming much more agile with how we come to market across each of our big brands laurent vasilescu okay and if i could squeeze one more in shipping out the  million shift from q and q can we expect the wholesale business to be roughly a flat to slightly up in the fourth quarter especially as you lap last years us bankruptcies scott a roe yes that  thats a reasonable assumption youll see relative  you will see the strongest wholesale growth for the year in the fourth quarter for the reasons that you mentioned also we are lapping  we have the bankruptcy impact indiscernible and were also starting to lap the destocking activities in the fourth quarter laurent vasilescu super helpful best of luck scott a roe yes one other thing just to add on that too dont forget vans europe really is returning back to growth we talked about that order book being in the doubledigit range in the second half so that’s a third factor operator we will have our next question from dana telsey telsey advisory group dana telsey good morning everyone and congratulations on the improved results as you think of the digital wholesale business and the growth that you’re seeing there how do you think about your strategy with the amazons in the world  of the world and then your thinking about dc which seems to have accelerated what are your plans with store openings and closing in the different regions thank you steven e rendle so dana i will start here so how we  i think its more about how do we think about really those the digital wholesale partners that we have across the globe and theres major pure plays theres also key customers that weve been with for years and they are part of that integrated marketplace that have choices that we have and they’re very important part we talked about that in boston that our digital wholesale partners is a significant part of our growth in the next five years amazon is an important customer and just we have  some of our brands that have p relationships we have some brands that have p relationships and we have some brands that have chosen to continue to look at and measure just how they could successfully work with amazon more importantly here in the us marketplace longterm i think its fair to say you will see the north face open up a p partnership and have a trial going into fall  or you might even want to call that a pilot as we look at how to integrate amazon into the longterm integrated marketplace strategy for the north face here in the united states we are working with amazon in europe and we will look at how we can do that here but i’d remind you theres a number of great players around the globe alibabas orlando ph all of those are key wholesale partners for us longterm dana telsey thank you and on the directtoconsumer piece on the retail stores part scott a roe yes maybe ill start with a little bit of that dana first of all good morning so we talked about the fact that our store count actually was down very modestly versus the last quarter and that the reason to highlight that is just to pay off the fact that we said were serious about looking at our portfolio from a profitability standpoint were really focused on improving the performance of and editing our underperforming stores and focusing on those formats and brands which are very successful so youll see that even if it costs us a little top line were willing to be  we are willing to take those actions and that really is a pay off against that having said that were really committed to brickandmortar stores going forward because we think thats part of that integrated marketplace that steve mentioned thats the highest and  ultimate experience of our brands and we see that is a critical component to the overall picture so we talked about  net store openings this year and you can expect something similar to that going forward according to our long range plan dana telsey thank you steven e rendle you bet thank you dana operator we will go next to matthew boss jpmorgan matthew boss thanks so on gross margin is it still fair to think about  to  basis points of underlying expansion from mix just on an annual basis and if so can you just walk through the drivers and then separately on sga i guess given your comments earlier should we expect expenses to grow below the pace of sales as we move into next year and beyond scott a roe yes so first of all gross margin yes youre right in that zone i mean our mix is a little ahead of our longterm rate but we’ve said that  to  basis points should be sustainable and its pretty simple our highest margin businesses are fastestgrowing thats been true and we expect that to continue to be true that being our international business are our digital and our dc in general plus outdoor  action sports are big three brands have higher gross margins in the total so that mix we expect to continue i will just remind you of kind of the formula right our gross margins expand we are investing from an sga standpoint in those strategic drivers and then looking for leverage as we talk about platforms across indiscernible if looking for leverage and all other expenses and that’s how this formula works together so as it relates to sga we will continue to invest in sga over time thats going to be below our margin expansion we talked about in our  plan our operating margin will expand over the next five years but lets be clear we are going to continue to invest around as growth drivers particularly dc and specifically digital underneath that matthew boss got it thank you operator we will go next to sam poser susquehanna samuel poser good good morning thanks for taking my question i’ve got a couple can you clarify the change in your currency neutral revenue guidance between what you had prior and what you’re giving now scott a roe yes i will start hey sam its scott so yes we said last time low singledigit currency neutral and reported with  points of currency so that obviously if you do the math that’s about  and now were raising that to about  at a  million so thats how we get from and to and weve given you a very specific revenue target at   million samuel poser so your currency impact is the same just you’re raising the numbers scott a roe well there is some currency benefit if we think about whats happened in the currency markets our largest exposure is the euro and its a little favorable our second largest is the pound which is very unfavorable but when you net that together there is some benefit from a currency standpoint although not significant samuel poser okay and then  two other just housekeeping most of the questions have been answered the tax rate you’re looking for the fullyear and the share count whats built into the share count for the  in this guidance scott a roe yes so what we  we dont give you the share count per se but we talked about  billion of buybacks so i guess the math can be done as it relates to the tax rate we said about  and that’s consistent with what we said in our last guidance samuel poser well thank you very much and good luck steven e rendle thanks sam scott a roe thanks sam operator we will go next to erinn murphy piper jaffray erinn murphy great thanks technical difficulty steven e rendle yes hi erinn its steve so i think what we see going on there we put a new leadership team in place there in january brendan brought a really strong understanding of retail one of the areas we wanted to quickly shore up was our outlook business and thats really around productivity and how were really converting the traffic that comes in our doors concurrently with that we  last year continue to look at our product offering and evolving that to be  to allow us in the same idea of integrated marketplace have  specific products for each of our different channels of distribution and i see  i think what you see happening this year is what we have going on in the department store is relevant to that consumer its different than what you have in our outlet stores and online and i think just with a more focused assortment and in a slightly cleaner marketplace were seeing that drop to our profitability as we continue to look to reignite sales i really dont have a line of sight to what the balance of the year otherwise we’re going to continue to do more of the same and bring relevant third and fourth quarter styles through this to the lens of the nautica heritage that weve seen working really well and again just these assortment specific to each of the channels which is new to some of the things that weve done in the past erinn murphy got it thank you operator we will go next to kate mcshane citi research kate mcshane thanks for taking my question with regards to the operating margins for jeanswear specifically can you help us understand the mechanics of the operating margin during the quarter and for the rest of the year how much of it has to do with the destocking and how much is apex related scott a roe sure i will take it kate good morning so first of all theres a few dynamics that are going on in the profitability first regarding margin we’ve made a strategic decision to put more innovation and more make into the channel as an offensive move but its at a time when pricing is difficult so that has put pressure on our margins in the shortterm we think thats the right move remember the big picture here right we are going through a disruptive phase but were really targeting and focused on when we come out of this right we’re trying to position ourselves to be the strongest brand standing at the end of this process and as a result we decided from a shortterm profitability standpoint wed make that strategic decision the other side of that is again were playing really to win in the longterm so weve maintained our demand creation investments through this difficult period we could have easily made a different decision which would have helped us from a shortterm profitability but we think again for the same reasons the smart move here is to play for the long game and for the endpoint and so we’re going to see tough margins through this year and really those same drivers that i just mentioned that were seeing in the first half you will see those themes continuing into the second half steven e rendle and kate i would add to that why we made the decision to maintain our demand creation is we see our specialty business specifically the western category wrangler riggs but also mentioned the  retro style as we look to open up the lens of our wrangler brand and open it up to a broader set of channels were seeing really nice traction taking hold in some of these new points of sale in the moving up the distribution channel and we think its important to continue to invest behind the brand to assure that that continues to go kate mcshane thank you steven e rendle thank you kate scott a roe okay operator our last question will come from jim duffy stifel jim duffy thank you good morning guys hope you’re doing well steven e rendle hey good morning jim jim duffy couple questions for me you mentioned that the visibility on the jeanswear business is difficult is the destocking headwind behind you at this point in the jeanswear category scott a roe no jim its not behind us its progressing and just indiscernible the shape the reason we say we kind of know the endpoint here right we know where the floors are going to end up when we say lack of visibility we dont control the pace of markdowns as the floor is cleared and that can have a really big impact on our sellthrough depending on whats on sale how deep those discounts are etcetera so the quartertoquarter cadence is going to be a little hard for us to project but when you step back and say theres only so many  so much inventory in the floor to be cleared and we know where the endpoint is you kind of know the goalpost you’re just not sure exactly what happens in between jim duffy fair enough and then building on that you did a nice job managing the inventories can you talk about some of the things you are doing to keep inventory tightened how it is that you’re better managing the amount of offprice across all the brands not just specific to jeanswear scott a roe yes i guess i would say it started with the fact that i think from  we decided to play it a little on the conservative side right we didnt build excess inventory we are  we gave guidance its in the low end of the range and we said were willing to walk a little bit of revenue in order to improve the dynamics in the marketplace so were not building the field of dreams right were not building inventory in a hope that we will get it we are not  we are trying to hold back a little bit and match order books closer to the conservative position and weve seen over time that that type of action will pay off in the long run it hurts us a little bit in the shortterm from the top line and shortterm earnings but for the longterm brand health and longterm growth history has proven thats the right  the place we want to be jim duffy okay good and then my last question the sales model for some of the other businesses beyond jeanswear have historically offered better visibility in the us wholesale channel are your partners giving you a better baseline of visibility to plan the business or you just still feel theres a fair amount of uncertainty as they try to get their arms around their own fundamentals steven e rendle you know jim i think  here in the us i think the wholesale community is playing things very very tight to the west ph and rightfully so the marketplace is transforming and the historical ways of ordering are needing to change and thats really central to how we’re thinking about our transformation agenda how were  being much more diligent around the integrated marketplace understanding our channel partners whats the space that we have to place product in whats the frequency required to really be present and incent consumers to come in and interact with us either in our own stores or wholesale so i think things are tightening up and they should for all of us be i think more in tune with what our consumers are asking us for this notion of transforming is a really important aspect jim duffy okay thank you very much guys steven e rendle you bet scott a roe okay jim steven e rendle thank you jim operator that does conclude our questionandanswer session i will turn the conference back over to mr steven rendle for additional or closing remarks steven e rendle great yes thank you everybody i just want to reiterate we are in the early stages of our journey to become a more agile and consumer centric organization and were encouraged with where we are at the start of  but i would just remind us all that were at the beginning of this journey our core growth engines are delivering high singledigit growth our gross margins are improving and then our fundamental business disciplines are very very intact we are choosing to thoughtfully invest in our future growth and the confidence we have yeartodate has us moving more quickly against our design and innovation agenda driving demand creation but also looking at some of the core platforms of advanced analytics advanced manufacturing and specifically talent we are focused on creating momentum against our five years objectives and we look forward to interacting with you in the future as this  the strategy unfolds so thank you operator
