articles license faq q whats the difference between the licensesa each license is valid only for a single projectthe personal license is editable on windows and osx and can be used to author projects but not create packaged buildsthe indie license supports all platforms and is required for commercial projectsthe pro license is needed to support custom engine codethe enterprise license is for project budgets over k usd is a per seat subscription and includes a host of other benefits over the pro licenseq how does neofur licensing worka neofur is licensed on a perproject basis the license allows you to ship one “project” commerciallyq what is a perproject licensea our perproject license means that your license supports a single project be it an app game cinematic simulation etc so you would need a new license for each projectq what if i dont know what my project is yeta if you dont ship a project then you can transfer your neofur license onto a new project for instance if you start using neofur on a project but you shelve it without it actually shipping then you could use the same neofur license on your next project as a courtesy we would ask you to let us know the name of the new project so we can keep an eye out for where neofur appears in the wildq can i share my perproject licensea your perproject license is tied to your licensee title it cannot be transferred or shared with another project doing so breaches the terms of the agreement the only exceptions are to provide copies of the plugin under your license to other members working on the licensed project as per the terms of the license agreementq can i use my license for another projecta the license is tied to a specifically licensed licensee project so it cannot be used to create new projects doing so breaches the terms of the license agreement if you require to use neofur in another project you will need to purchase a new license for that projectq can i use my license for all team members on my projecta licenses are projectbased they are not individual or “perseat” licenses so for team members on a single project a single license is all that is needed for that projectq what platforms are included in

drive fur firection the problem is that sometimes the fur resets for no apparent reason and i have to simply reassign the skeletal growth mesh to the fur asset by dragging and dropping and it corrects itself the fur assets is already reading this skeletal mesh with the proper naming of the morph target so its strange that it has to randomly be reassigned is this a known bug vote   undo follow

manager  months ago •  i’m currently trying to integrate fur growth to my character only in certain areas similar to what your tutorial in the video attached demonstrates however i can’t really follow how the rigged mesh at  in the video is created if i try to delete mesh triangles  in order to only have a morph target mesh the skeleton and the mesh are no longer linked i would be very helpful if you could walk us through those steps i’m sure am i’m not the only can benefit from this thank you and i hope you can provide some insightg vote   undo follow answer peet product manager  months ago hey there the easiest way to create a modified growth mesh is to make a duplicate of your skinned mesh in ds max you can modify this duplicated mesh through an edit polymesh modifier which should retain any skinrig bindings my guess is that the way in which youre modifying the mesh is causing the skinrig binding to be lost which will cause the skeleton and mesh to no longer be linked as you describe as an example for you i set up this simple skinned sphere as a base mesh the mesh and modifier stack look like this to create the growth mesh i duplicated the skinned sphere object using an edit poly modifier i deleted the middle portion of the sphere i created my morph targets by using a copy of this modified growth mesh and then set up the morpher modifier im making sure that any modifiers i add are beneath the skin modifier in the stack after doing all of that the mesh and modifier stack now looks like thisonce i set the appropriate growth mesh and morph target name in the neofurasset my object appears as expected  fur growth only occurs in the area defined by the growth mesh and the movement of the growth mesh and fur matches the movement of the animated base meshi hope this example is useful  please let me know if i misunderstood the issue youre experiencing or if youre continuing to have problems so we can assist you furtherspencer  started neofur  osx animals

follow answer carlos montero  months ago this is most commonly due to issues with boundaries on a skeletal mesh presumably the fix is to make sure your skeletal mesh has good boundary values bad
