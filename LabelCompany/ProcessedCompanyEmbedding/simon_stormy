however in  stormy simon was named the copresident of overstockcom adding a capstone to her career at overstock that has included two vice presidency roles as well as chief of staff to the ceo her work at overstockcom is notable for its multiple achievements including adding entertainment media to overstockcoms portfolio restructuring its customer care and personal care departments and launching herself as the public face of overstockcoms commercialscustomer care raising the bar reaching the topone of stormy simons most notable accomplishments at overstockcom was the complete restructuring of its customer care program an initiative that led to overstockcom receiving its first ranking as one of the top five customer service departments in the united states in  overstockcom has remained on that list of top customer service departments ever sincesimon followed her customer care initiative with a similar overhaul of overstockcom’s partner care program ensuring that everyone who interacts with overstockcom gets a personalized toplevel service experience to quote overstockcom chairman of the board patrick m byrne “if you want to make your company customercentric just take the most stubborn unbending hardheaded customerloving employee you have and put her over customer service the company gets customercentric quicker than you ever thought possible”expanding overstocks mission books music videos and gamesit was ms simons innovation that led to the development of overstockcoms book music video  game department in the early s this allowed overstockcom to compete more effectively with other online retailers specifically amazon simon was prescient enough to recognize consumers’ growing interest in purchasing media online a decision which has reaped numerous benefits for both her customers and her companycommercial endeavors becoming the face of overstockcomat the same time as stormy simon was bringing multimedia into overstockcom’s fold she also took on the job of writing producing and starring in overstockcoms commercials stormy simon essentially became the face and voice of overstockcom inviting customers to share in overstockcoms deals by reminding them that its all about the oremember  in the early s advertising was dominated by quirky corporate mascots from the quiznos spongmonkeys to the geico gecko by deciding to become the public face of overstockcom instead of turning over the marketing to a puppet or comic character stormy simon let customers know that overstockcom was all about persontoperson contact and oneonone customer servicein the all about overstock with stormy simon ad for example ms simon explains how to use the overstockcom site to find great products at the same time that she highlights the benefits that overstockcom provides  like its  shipping regardless of order size  and gives a shoutout to overstockcoms awardwinning customer service team its a brilliant ad both for stormy simons clear description of overstockcoms services as well as for its simplicity nobody will leave the ad wondering what overstockcom does or how to use the site to find dealssocial media bringing a personal touch to the professionalstormy simons overstockcom commercials are only one example of her ability to add a touch of personality to her corporate mission a quick peek at stormy simons twitter account aka persnickidy shows that she understands how to be both a corporate leader and a personable individual on social media she combines tweets about daily life at overstockcom with reports of her trip to a tattoo convention and short anecdotes about life on her farm where she helps raise dogs cats goats horses and ducksstormy simon is also willing to have a little fun agreeing to let publications like midlifebachelorcom interview her for articles like stormy simon woman of the month she understands the importance of putting a public face on her work and letting people understand that she is a real person with a distinct personality this type of social sharing is what new media is all about the more people know about you as a person the more likely they are to trust your company overstockcoms customer value and appreciation remains high in part because of stormy simons decision to put herself out there and make overstockcom personablewhats going to happen next for stormy simon and overstockcom we cant say for sure but we look forward to seeing what ms simon has planned both for the future of overstockcom and for her own work in social media author information amanda green sign

growth by joe keenan facebook facebook twitter twitter linkedin linkedin email email  comments comments an ecommerce lifer — granted that’s less than  years — stormy simon can’t imagine doing anything else for a career as president of overstockcom the salt lake citybased online retailer of home goods furniture women’s and men’s apparel jewelry electronics and a host of other products simon relishes the opportunity to come to work each day in such a dynamic fastpaced industry from temp worker to leading a company of  employees it’s been quite a year journey for simon at overstock when she started at overstock in  two years after the company was founded simon had zero experience in the retail industry she was hired to work in the sales department and was tasked with learning an industry in its infancy simon was in the right place overstock along with amazoncom and ebay were the pioneers of ecommerce a level trust of trust that’s been built with consumers over the years — along with a lot of hard work — have been key to overstock’s success says simon “when overstock started in  we were developing a new behavior for consumers” simon recalls “traditionally consumers bought everything by walking into a store i think our success comes from timing it was the right time to introduce shopping online shopping home goods online people hadn’t done it before shopped online so we really had to be dedicated to seeing it through” that success continues on today in its most recent earnings call in august overstock reported its th consecutive profitable quarter along with  percent revenue growth loyalty driving growth  the loyalty of overstock’s customers is what simon points to as essential for the retailer’s future growth to help it retain customers for the long term overstock offers an aggressive loyalty program club o that rewards members with cash back on their purchases exclusive offers and free shipping exclusive to club o gold members and the program is easy to join club o gold is  annually while all that’s required of shoppers to become a member of overstock’s recently launched club o silver program is for them to give their email address to the retailer in addition club o membership is free to military teachers students and all first responders “it’s all about club o it’s just the richest rewards program online” says simon “i’m a consumer at heart so i can’t be passionate just because i’m an etailer i love shopping and finding good deals and overstock really does give people that and club o pays me to shop and i love it” with the success of amazon prime and the recent launch of walmart’s shippingpass unlimited free shipping for a  flat fee customer retention through subscription loyalty programs appears to be a growing trend in the retail industry overstock has taken notice and responded with improvements to its club o program “everyone is trying to figure out how to keep their customers more loyal” says simon “you have to be dedicated to retention”   amazon a competitor  as a pureplay online retailer it’s just assumed that amazoncom would be considered competition for overstock and it is — just maybe not to the extent that you would expect it to be due to the diversity of amazon’s business — eg its fulfillment business web services streaming entertainment options — overstock doesn’t view it as a true competitor “amazon isn’t our competitor” simon states “it’s into so many categories and it’s hard to compete in areas that we’re not currently in how we do compete with amazon is that we sell products online and we have a curated product assortment from curated partners” furthermore overstock is now competing with traditional brickandmortar retailers — eg walmart target macy’s etc — that have moved online as well with the marketplace growing by the day overstock is looking to differentiate its business through highquality products that provide value to its customers “everybody is competing right now — you’re competing for that wallet share” says simon “the problem is you can’t address every competitor you can’t have a strategy for how to take on target how to take on walmart how to take on kohl’s for us we have to be true to our brand our value proposition and our customers and what they expect from us while keeping our eyes wide open” in an effort to differentiate itself from the competition overstock is investing in technology and trying to give its customers the best shopping experience possible every time they engage the brand mobile is central to this mission overstock’s awardwinning app and mobile site for example are used primarily as a research tool by its customers who ultimately make their purchases on the desktop site that trend has influenced overstock to do things such as produce more highquality content for its customers to consume “content is king” declares simon “and we’ve worked really hard towards providing more content about our products consumers can be anywhere at any time now with their phone so we’re constantly evaluating ways to make a bigger impact in mobile consumers want to be able to research their purchases — that’s our content — but you also have to make it so it’s easy to buy and that’s our app” product expansion in the works in addition to doing a better job of retaining its existing customers overstock wants to add new customers as well introducing new product categories is one way it’s going about doing that however simon and her team are extremely cautious about adding the right products and working with the right manufacturers overstock doesn’t want to become the alleverything store value and quality is the foundation on which the company wishes to build on “we have these great partnerships that started  years ago and i do think we can broaden our assortment” says simon “the manufacturers that we’ve created partnerships with have been known to deliver amazing product they take pride in what they’re making and we know at the end of the day that there’s going to be a happy customer we don’t want to do business with people that sell junk there’s never a good end to that story when you’re an ecommerce company” to help with the increase in traffic that will come with a bigger product assortment overstock has invested time and resources into developing a proprietary commerce platform for stormy simon and overstockcom the past  years have been all about establishing themselves as leaders in the ecommerce arena the next  years and beyond will be about growing the brand through a commitment to its customers its products and vendor partners and technology about stormy simon what she enjoys most about working in the retail industry i love shopping and its so cliché for a woman to say that but its the truth i love the idea of treasure hunts i love the people that i meet shopping retail as an industry is a few hundred years old but online its  a lot of the passion for me comes from that – being able to define an industry is what i love most and still having it be a challenge unknown and changing every day is really appealing to me what she would be doing if not working in the retail industry i used to do radio and would probably have moved into a productiontype business but now i would love to work for the chicago bears im a huge football enthusiast im from chicago and i always have these sports analogies because thats how my dad raised us he was always comparing something to sports i love the concept of team and everyone working for a common goal leadership style casually intense im very different at home than i at work at home im just casual at work im casually intense you can live in this environment where you get to be yourself but at the end of the day youre really held accountable for the team youve drafted the intense side comes from not letting the casual side fool you into thinking that were not going to work hard or were not going to achieve every day the best advice shes ever received one that i refer to a lot is from my mom she said to me when i was young you do the right thing even when no one is looking even if you dont have to do the right thing you should because youre the one that has to live with it at the end of the day what she enjoys doing outside of work i enjoy home because ive been traveling an awful lot so home is great i have two young men that im lucky enough to be their mom and one of them has a daughter – and i dont say the “g” word – thats two and that has become my new obsession and i love rock concerts theyre a good way to blow off steam and then little short trips here and there regardless of where here and there is yoga and watching sports and then there are those days when youve been working so hard and doing so much that a good couple hours of reality tv where it doesnt really matter is exactly what you need favorite book shel silversteins books favorite movie the untouchables favorite band aerosmith i started listening to aerosmith when i was maybe seven through my brothers and its just been a band thats really stayed relevant and theyre amazing to see live favorite city chicago causes organizations that shes involved in before i got so busy i was on the board of the girls  boys club here and the columbus community center which helped adults with disabilities get employment those are things that i think are important and i need to get back to doing them its time  comments view comments peoplestormy simon e joe keenan authors page joe keenan is the executive editor of total retail related content can

directors until no later than sept  she began a leave of absence from overstock on june  for undisclosed reasons according to a filing with the securities and exchange commission her responsibilities were divided among acting ceo mitch edwards chief revenue officer saum noursalehi and senior vice president brian popelka—who will continue to exercise these roles as simon prepares to leave the company according to the company statement this is the second major change at the top of overstock’s executive ranks this year in april patrick byrne who founded overstock in  and who had been its ceo took a medical leave of absence byrne has been battling hepatitis c which he contracted in  in china in june he returned to an active role on the board although edwards has continued as interim ceo

our board since ” byrne said simon joined overstock in  “she has been a valuable member of the management team” said tom forte analyst with maxim group who covers overstock “she has been there a long time and filled a lot of roles today overstock is one of the largest ecommerce companies in the us” over the past year however overstock’s revenue growth has slowed forte noted in addition wayfair has been taking market share from overstock and other online retailers particularly in home furnishings “i could see this as a contributing factor to stormy’s departure” forte said “while i will miss

edition twitter hfnmag tweets by hfnmag the stalwart the overstock story thickens the stalwart « googlenet  main  the last word on peak oil » the overstock story thickens recently we brought you the case against overstockcom summarizing the argument against the company made by bloggerhedge fund manager jeff matthews  in a series of posts mr matthews has spelled out a convincing case that something isnt right with the company  too many questions unanswered and the appearance sometimes of outright fraud now we generally know it to be true that when a company focuses much of its efforts on shortbashing theyre probably wasting their time or more likely masking up deeper problems  after all the best way to hurt the shorts is in their pocketbook via good performance via highbeam i found a bizarre transcript of an interview between ron insana and patrick byrne overstockcoms ceo in which he lashes out at a conspiracy of nakedshortsellerinsana  first of all give us the evidence that you have that a naked shortselling scheme is behind the decline in your stock price byrne  we have affidavits from people who participated insana  all right  can you be more specific byrne  no i could im not going to  we have affidavits from people who participated insana  and what did they say was done exactly byrne they say that the research was supplied to rocker before it was published to the other clients that rocker had a hand in editing it making changes making demands that certain grades be lowered and then ultimately that camelback ph insana  which is in now gradient right byrne gradient  im sorry that gradient actually hold the research so he could build his position it continues i mean the same people say herb greenberg at thestreetcom was  is certainly linked to this  insana linked in what way i mean you are making now allegations about journalists helping others to frontrun or trade illegally in the shares of your company stock byrne  thats correct thats what i am doing insana  all right  so what evidence do you have that a journalist byrne ive got affidavits from people who were involved and can tell the whole story and that i look forward to the day that those are public insana all right now let me ask you about the sec investigation which you disclosed on your conference call this morning is this sec investigation which you said was begun in february and is informal an investigation of the short sellers or an investigation of your company and its financials byrne well first of all i think im not supposed to officially know i was tipped off anonymously from folks within wall street that the sec had gone on a fishing trip ive been highly insana  so youre getting inside information too jeff matthews in his most recent entry reprints some of the recent conference call which i havent been able to verify myself as it is not on highbeam yet under the title i am not a cokehead and other truths from patrick byrne ceoi believe there’s been a plan since we were in our teens to destroy our stock drive it down to  to these are the folks i’m going to talk about…leon black i’ve put in there just because he’s a wellknown financier hedge fund guy got nothing to say about him sort of putting him in as an example of a  just somebody in a hedge fundjim caruthers is an interesting fellow he’s up at eastborne capital north of san francisco eastborne has an “e” at the end it’s funny because there’s a fellow holding himself out in a nearby location by the name of jim karruthers with a slightly different spelling holding himself out as a private investigator from eastborn investigations no “e” at the end i know that couldn’t be this jim caruthers because that would be a felony for a person to hold himself out as a pi when he’s not and that pi has a very interesting relationship with a certain lawyer in detroit who has some very odd practices that maybe we’ll have time to get back tokevin ingram was a prominent fellow in the late ’s in wall street he left wall street started a dot com i think it was crashing he got caught attempting to sell stinger missiles or obtain stinger missiles for some pakistani isi agent who turned out to be undercover feds in fact he agreed to work on obtaining a nuclear trigger for them so he went to the pen for a few years he’s out now and he’s basically a gopher for some of these folkstheres moreas this went on i started realizing that there was actually some more orchestration here being provided by what i’m calling here is the sith lord…he’s one of the master criminals from the s and he’s back in business but i’m not going to i’ll just call him the master mind todayso in the words of wayne and garth “squeeze me”by the way carol remond has something stuck in her craw about the fact most people i think understood that when i said “those i took baths with” to mean like my cousins and brothers whatever girlfriends she’s calling around and saying that there’s a byrne has a gay bathhouse cabal and that’s where this has been organized something about the whole bath reference has steamed carol my theory is it’s because she’s french…i put information down there that i was gay and…i put information down that i was a coke head now my apologies to my gay friends both within and without outside the company i don’t mean to equate the two i don’t care i’m a libertarian and i don’t care at all in fact i don’t give a hoot if anyone thinks i’m gay but i thought that by keeping by putting that information down on one channel and putting the coke head information down the other channel i would then know if it leaked…on the coke head thing and by the way i’ve never with one exception i’ve never even seen cocaine in my life so in case you’re wondering no i’m not a coke headread the whole thing here if this is really what was said on the conference call and ill be checking back to confirm this then the ceo of overstock appears to have gone off the deep end and i shudder to think of the shareholders entrusting their money to him but what to make of jeff matthews and his oneman battle against byrne and overstock  in the views of this blog it is overdone  in this entry he accuses byrne of hiring a former exotic dancer as an executive vice president by virtue of the effect that the executive stormy simon shares a name with an exotic dancer made in a utah court    the evidence is tenuous and when combined with calling the ceo names it seems that mr matthews may be crossing the line and using his blog as a way of promoting the short case a bet which he has made to his own profit  just like byrne should let the companys operations do the talking perhaps mr matthews should let this die and make his profits if and when shares of overstock crater august   in misc  permalink comments why doesnt anyone check into stormy simons past she is a high school druggie dropout with no real business experience the only and i mean the only reason she moved up in the overstock organization is she sleeps with the boss yes she is mr brynes sex toy at his beckon and call that is why she is a sr vice president there is a reason she has had many positions at overstock and it is because she is not good at any of them others here at overstock write memos and correspondence for her and these ideas that she supposedly comes up with like the bigo advertisements they were not her ideas she stole them in fact she cant even spell half the supposed words that are in her correspondence she is a druggie who boasts about sharing drugs with her children and basically has nothing good to say about her family so why doesnt someone really look into her past before they try to make her look like some role model in fact how do we not know she wasnt an accomplice to the crime dating a man she knew was married and then waiting  years to look like a hero ms simon is a deceptive phony just looking to get into the spotlight at anyones expense posted by overstock anonymous  march   at  pm is stormy from texas did she go to rl turner highschool would she be about  if so i remember her posted by jenn  may   at  pm i worked for overstockcom for almost  years and dealt directly with stormy simon for most of that time she has held numerous titles with the company the most interesting thing about her tenure with the company is her meteoric rise to power stormy was hired as a temp to telemarket for the bb sales division essentially she was cold calling local businesses out of the yellow pages in less than a year she managed to go from a temp employee from a staffing service to senior management it was widely known in the company that stormy had a special relationship with patrick however given her power and status in the company it is not in anybodys best interest to object or talke about it i had numerous conversations with stormy and other executives regarding pot use and other recreational activities there is a very good reason that overstockcom does not drug test its employees at the corporate office stormy has a son who she got a job working at the warehouse he failed a random ua and instead of being terminated he was offered a second chance to retake the ua in a month the cocky kid then proceeded to brag that he was not too worried about passing his test as stormy and patrick would never let him be fired for drugs as he has smoked pot with patrick on numerous occasions needless to say this caused quite an hr issue with the warehouse staff and stormys son was quietly dismissed upper management of overstockcom has a name for some of the more bizzare directives and ideas put forth by patrick byrne they are referred to as patricks thai stick moments i have witnessed patrick byrne stoned on several occassions as well as stormy and other former executives the company was effectionately known as smokemorepotcom by employess and others in the know there is a serious lack of qualified management at this company anybody who is capable that is hired is quickly put into place by stormy and most wont stick around long enough to to try and be effective at their jobs it is well known at this point that should you cross stormy or any of her minions that you will find yourself on the unemployment line so at the end of all this i guess my point is stormy patrick and other management at overstock are drug users to some degree or another the biggest problem with this company is putting someone like stormy in a position where she has mostly unlimited power over the staff and little if any qualifications for the position other than being a good little girl for the big boss posted by mike ockslarge  february   at  pm i know stormy she grew up in small town tooele utah and i have done cocaine with her on several occasions and you are right she does not have the qualifications to be in the position she is in she did infact drop out of high school posted by joe dones  october   at  pm she has slept with me for coke twice in  posted by jason huggins  may   at  pm i dont have any opinion about what sue lowden said there but i get the impression she has this stupid imperial air about her when answering

are all jealous idiots stormy simon is a beautiful successful amazing business woman who took her rough life and disadvantages and turned around to make a name for herself she dropped out of high school so what there are plenty of successful people who barely even passed the seventh grade grew up in third world countries or have been in rehab do not judge her on her past or assume that she is only at the top because she slept with someone get a life did you see her in bed with someone doubt it go back to high school if you believe rumors and start gossip do your thing stormy simon ignore the haters jason huggins uh she slept with you for coke huh why should anyone believe u cokeheads are liars christinajonesyahoocom posted by jaymee  september   at  am well i just saw her commercial and was wondering if she may have been related to carly simon my mistake posted by kristen  september   at  pm damn potheads are ruining the internet id much rather buy from an ecommerce site that employs alcoholics power trippers and sex addicts who arent qualified to have a few certain letters and maybe a period or apostrophe before their name hell with it i say that anyone whos risen to president or vice president of anything has either slept with everyone in corporate snorted coke off at least  hookers tits made everyones kids smoke pot or slaughtered  puppies in order to get the job posted by jigdo  october   at  am some of you in here talking about oh my god she does pot shes a druggie are a jkoe if you want to call someone a druggie for smoking pot then you are a hypocrite because you do drugs too aspirintylenolalcoholtobacco and did you know pot has neveryes thats right never caused anyones death as long as humans have been on this earth tylenol kills wayyyy more people than that a year so you wanna think again who you are calling a druggie so next time you take a tylenol remember you are drug addict right posted by bm  october   at  pm im kinda thinkin you ppl are jealous of stormie cause she did move up so she used her yummie to do it at least she did it posted by bubba  october   at  pm we have often repeated that the truth because the error was also

announced that bitcoin sales were averaging  per month and that the company expected bitcoin sales to add  cents to the companys  earnings per share on september   overstock announced it would begin donating  of bitcoin revenue to foundations that were advocating for cryptocurrency naked short selling campaignedit the company has received attention stemming from ceo patrick byrnes battle against alleged naked short selling of his companys shares beginning in  byrne has contended that a number of companies including overstockcom have been the targets of this practice which involves selling a stock short but without the usual step of initially borrowing or locating the shares byrne alleges that the practice circumvents safeguards of conventional shorting and has been used in large schemes devised to profit from driving down the prices of companies shares in many cases leading to these companies failure with overstock byrne contends that the companys longstanding appearance on the regulation sho threshold security list an secmandated list showing companies with a high number of fails to deliver along with high trading volumes that sometimes surpass total quantity of the companys stock establish that it has been targeted by this practice byrnes campaign has been controversial including criticism in the financial press that byrne is seeking to divert attention from overstocks share price declines and failure to turn a profit new york times columnist joseph nocera has said in  that except for a few fellowtraveling web sites where mr byrne is viewed as a heroic figure most people who understand the issue or have looked into it think its pretty bogus others have suggested that the problem is real but that the sec acts to prevent it and that it does not happen on any scale such as byrne suggests sec chairman christopher cox called abusive naked short selling a fraud that the commission is bound to prevent and to punish overstock filed a lawsuit against the hedge fund rocker partners in  for libel unfair business practices and tortious interference saying it colluded with a research firm gradient analytics in shortselling the company while paying gradient analytics to publish negative reports about overstockcom and supplying prepublication copies to rocker naked shortselling was not alleged in that suit in a conference call with analysts in august  a day after the suit was filed byrne said that theres been a plan since we were in our teens to destroy our stock drive it down to   and even a plan for how the company would then get whacked up he said that the conspirators were part of a miscreants ball headed by a sith lord who he refused to identify but said hes one of the master criminals from the s byrne said the conspiracy included hedge funds journalists investigators trial lawyers the sec and eliot spitzer gradient countersued alleging byrne waged a smear campaign rocker partners renamed copper river management filed a counterclaim against overstock in november  alleging overstatement of profits false projections and misrepresentations about the companys ventures copper river also alleges that byrne tried to silence critics by suing them a portion of this suit was settled out of court on october   when overstockcom and gradient dropped the claims against each other after gradient retracted allegations that overstocks reporting methods did not comply with rules established by the fasb stated they believed overstockcom complied with gaap standards and that three directors were independent according to nasd standards and apologized byrne has said the apology and settlement represents a great step forward in our case while copper rivers attorney stated that if somehow this improved overstocks case then gradient would admit to doing something wrong and they haven’t and that he expected the settlement to help copper rivers case on december   it was announced that copper river had reached an out of court settlement with overstock as part of the agreement copper river which closed in december  agreed to pay overstock  million in a letter to his shareholders patrick byrne said the good guys won copper river said in a statement that it continued to deny overstocks allegations copper river managing general partner marc cohodes said although settlement deprives us of the ability to disprove overstocks case and prosecute our counterclaims we decided that the litigation costs did not justify passing up a practical way to end fourandhalf years of meritless litigation by overstock in february  overstockcom launched a  billion lawsuit against morgan stanley goldman sachs and other large wall street firms alleging a massive illegal stock market manipulation scheme involving naked short selling among its allegations overstock stated that since at least january  naked short selling has accounted for large portions of overstock stock in some cases exceeding the  million total shares outstanding the lawsuit alleged that this had created immense downward pressure on share prices over time kerry fields associate professor of law and business ethics at the university of southern california said byrne may be able to help set new law if he handles this right fields said byrnes best approach now is probably to persuade the sec which continues to wander around the issue or the government to serve subpoenas and let them decide whether or not his company was wronged john coffee director of the center on corporate governance at columbia university law school described it as overly ambitious and extremely unpromising two members of the overstockcom board of directors john fisher and ray groves resigned in disagreement over the lawsuit in december  all but two of the prime broker defendants settled out of court with overstock for  million that same month the company filed a motion seeking to amend its lawsuit against the remaining defendants—goldman sachs and merrill lynch—to include claims of rico violations the enhanced claims were based on evidence gained through discovery in the case see alsoedit companies portal ecommerce online auction referencesedit
