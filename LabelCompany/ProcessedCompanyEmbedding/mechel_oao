sharply criticized mechel management at a government meeting in nizhniy novgorod on july   which focused on ongoing troubles in the steel industry putin accused mechel for exporting raw materials for steelmakers at prices about half the domestic level which could be a sign of tax avoidance after putins accusations mechels stock dropped  on the new york stock exchange while the russian federal antimonopoly service launched investigation into mechels practice of raising domestic coking coal prices far above the export price levels on the following day july  the company issued a contrite statement promising full cooperation with federal authorities while share values rebounded by nearly  percent however vladimir putin once again criticized mechels management on july  during a government meeting on transfer pricing narrowing down his complaint “ when the domestic price is rub  per ton they sell the raw materials to themselves to their own offshore subsidiaries in this case to switzerland at rub  per ton which is only onequarter the domestic price  ” after this the stock price which had recovered a little over the previous days collapsed by another  producing a combined decline of  the companys market capitalization in august  was still half its value in july  in midaugust  the federal antimonopoly service found mechel guilty of violating article  of the competition law by causing the domestic price of coking to rise imposing a relatively small fine for this violation equivalent to  of the groups annual sales or rub  million in addition fas recommended that mechel should reduce the domestic price of coking coal by  this caused an additional weakness in the stock price in the wake of these events mechel announced on august  that a preferred share issue previously planned for placement on august  was to be postponed indefinitely this essentially closed the door to equity finance for mechel restricting its financing options to debt vladimir putin expressed regret over his own comments at a steel industry meeting in chelyabinsk on july   “ how can mechel organize normal decent fair business operation i remember my diatribe against mechel and i can only regret that it led to a more than  decline in the companys market capitalization i want to thank igor zyuzin — he did everything we spoke about and he has been on the best fair behavior ”

of its recently acquired stake to a consortium of russian and international investors the company later acquired  of the ports common stock from en for rub billion mechel sold  of common stock in vanino port for rub  billion on october   retaining only  in the port  criticism from the governmentedit russian thenprime minister vladimir putin sharply criticized mechel management at a government meeting in nizhniy novgorod on july   which focused on ongoing troubles in the steel industry putin accused mechel for exporting raw materials for steelmakers at prices about half the domestic level which could be a sign of tax avoidance after putins accusations mechels stock dropped  on the new york stock exchange while the russian federal antimonopoly service launched investigation into mechels practice of raising domestic coking coal prices far above the export price levels on the following day july  the company issued a contrite statement promising full cooperation with federal authorities while share values rebounded by nearly  percent however vladimir putin once again criticized mechels management on july  during a government meeting on transfer pricing narrowing down his complaint “ when the domestic price is rub  per ton they sell the raw materials to themselves to their own offshore subsidiaries in this case to switzerland at rub  per ton which is only onequarter the domestic price  ” after this the stock price which had recovered a little over the previous days collapsed by another  producing a combined decline of  the companys market capitalization in august  was still half its value in july  in midaugust  the federal antimonopoly service found mechel guilty of violating article  of the competition law by causing the domestic price of coking to rise imposing a relatively small fine for this violation equivalent to  of the groups annual sales or rub  million in addition fas recommended that mechel should reduce the domestic price of coking coal by  this caused an additional weakness in the stock price in the wake of these events mechel announced on august  that a preferred share issue previously planned for placement on august  was to be postponed indefinitely this essentially closed the door to equity finance for mechel restricting its financing options to debt vladimir putin expressed regret over his own comments at a steel industry meeting in chelyabinsk on july   “ how can mechel organize normal decent fair business operation i remember my diatribe against mechel and i can only regret that it led to a more than  decline in the companys market capitalization i want to thank igor zyuzin — he did everything we spoke about and he has been on the best fair behavior ” conflicts with minority shareholdersedit mechel has had numerous conflicts with minority shareholders practically from the time of its incorporation minority shareholders have accused mechel of disregarding their rights vostok nafta prosperity capital metage capital and hq fonder accused mechel in — of unfairly reducing the buyout stock price during consolidation of mechels subsidiary southern kuzbass assets the federal service for financial markets confirmed that mechel had in fact violated minority shareholders rights by withholding essential information from them eventually mechel was forced to buy out the minority shareholders at the market price in  at the time when the russian environmental watchdog rosprirodnadzor filed claims against mechel subsidiaries a minority shareholder in tomusinsky open pit mine oao which is part of southern kuzbass the swiss bank julius baer and co ltd accused tomusinsky of issuing stock at a lower price in violation of the law and shareholders rights in  saven which held a  equity stake in tomusinsky open pit mine oao filed nine suits with an arbitration court claiming more than rub  billion from tomusinsky and several other subsidiaries of mechel yakutugol mechel mining mechel service mechel trans and mechel energo saven accused the defendants of diverting profits under the guise of lowinterest loans to companies affiliated with mechel on conditions clearly detrimental to themselves at interest rates ‘‘below’’ the russian central banks refinancing rate ie well below the market interest rate and without any collateral argasera also filed a suit in  against mechel subsidiary urals stampings plant oao courts have invariably ruled for the plaintiffs in these suits late  problemsedit mechel stock unexpectedly dropped sharply towards the end of  the stock dropped  on november   losing another  of their value the following day mechels market capitalization decreased from us  billion in may  to us  million in late  while the groups debt had mounted to us  billion the company started delaying wage payments and contractual payments to suppliers industry experts are unanimous that the companys trouble arise from inefficient acquisitions and highly risky financing policy which has practically brought mechel to the brink of bankruptcy the company has been forced to engage in tough negotiations with both russian and international creditor banks mechel announced in late november  that it had negotiated an arrangement with creditor banks to restructure debt extend repayment terms and be released from debt covenants for a “covenant holiday”  some experts believe that the company is no longer capable of servicing its debt including coupon payments on its corporate bonds however market analysts see mechels bankruptcy as unlikely as it would be against the creditors best interests sberbank vtb and gazprombank are mechels main creditors accounting for as much as  of the groups debt bonds account for an additional  the situation is complicated by the fact that mechel is in need of dramatic upgrades to its production facilities some observers have noted difficult relationships between mechel and several local governments of the home regions of mechels plants

international investors the company later acquired  of the ports common stock from en for rub billion mechel sold  of common stock in vanino port for rub  billion on october   retaining only  in the port  criticism from the governmentedit russian thenprime minister vladimir putin sharply criticized mechel management at a government meeting in nizhniy novgorod on july   which focused on ongoing troubles in the steel industry putin accused mechel for exporting raw materials for steelmakers at prices about half the domestic level which could be a sign of tax avoidance after putins accusations mechels stock dropped  on the new york stock exchange while the russian federal antimonopoly service launched investigation into mechels practice of raising domestic coking coal prices far above the export price levels on the following day july  the company issued a contrite statement promising full cooperation with federal authorities while share values rebounded by nearly  percent however vladimir putin once again criticized mechels management on july  during a government meeting on transfer pricing narrowing down his complaint “ when the domestic price is rub  per ton they sell the raw materials to themselves to their own offshore subsidiaries in this case to switzerland at rub  per ton which is only onequarter the domestic price  ” after this the stock price which had recovered a little over the previous days collapsed by another  producing a combined decline of  the companys market capitalization in august  was still half its value in july  in midaugust  the federal antimonopoly service found mechel guilty of violating article  of the competition law by causing the domestic price of coking to rise imposing a relatively small fine for this violation equivalent to  of the groups annual sales or rub  million in addition fas recommended that mechel should reduce the domestic price of coking coal by  this caused an additional weakness in the stock price in the wake of these events mechel announced on august  that a preferred share issue previously planned for placement on august  was to be postponed indefinitely this essentially closed the door to equity finance for mechel restricting its financing options to debt vladimir putin expressed regret over his own comments at a steel industry meeting in chelyabinsk on july   “ how can mechel organize normal decent fair business operation i remember my diatribe against mechel and i can only regret that it led to a more than  decline in the companys market capitalization i want to thank igor zyuzin — he did everything we spoke about and he has been on the best fair behavior ” conflicts with minority shareholdersedit mechel has had numerous conflicts with minority shareholders practically from the time of its incorporation minority shareholders have accused mechel of disregarding their rights vostok nafta prosperity capital metage capital and hq fonder accused mechel in — of unfairly reducing the buyout stock price during consolidation of mechels subsidiary southern kuzbass assets the federal service for financial markets confirmed that mechel had in fact violated minority shareholders rights by withholding essential information from them eventually mechel was forced to buy out the minority shareholders at the market price in  at the time when the russian environmental watchdog rosprirodnadzor filed claims against mechel subsidiaries a minority shareholder in tomusinsky open pit mine oao which is part of southern kuzbass the swiss bank julius baer and co ltd accused tomusinsky of issuing stock at a lower price in violation of the law and shareholders rights in  saven which held a  equity stake in tomusinsky open pit mine oao filed nine suits with an arbitration court claiming more than rub  billion from tomusinsky and several other subsidiaries of mechel yakutugol mechel mining mechel service mechel trans and mechel energo saven accused the defendants of diverting profits under the guise of lowinterest loans to companies affiliated with mechel on conditions clearly detrimental to themselves at interest rates ‘‘below’’ the russian central banks refinancing rate ie well below the market interest rate and without any collateral argasera also filed a suit in  against mechel subsidiary urals stampings plant oao courts have invariably ruled for the plaintiffs in these suits late  problemsedit mechel stock unexpectedly dropped sharply towards the end of  the stock dropped  on november   losing another  of their value the following day mechels market capitalization decreased from us  billion in may  to us  million in late  while the groups debt had mounted to us  billion the company started delaying wage payments and contractual payments to suppliers industry experts are unanimous that the companys trouble arise from inefficient acquisitions and highly risky financing policy which has practically brought mechel to the brink of bankruptcy the company has been forced to engage in tough negotiations with both russian and international creditor banks mechel announced in late november  that it had negotiated an arrangement with creditor banks to restructure debt extend repayment terms and be released from debt covenants for a “covenant holiday”  some experts believe that the company is no longer capable of servicing its debt including coupon payments on its corporate bonds however market analysts see mechels bankruptcy as unlikely as it would be against the creditors best interests sberbank vtb and gazprombank are mechels main creditors accounting for as much as  of the groups debt bonds account for an additional  the situation is complicated by the fact that mechel is in need of dramatic upgrades to its production facilities some observers have noted difficult relationships between mechel and several local governments of the home regions of mechels plants and facilities pointing out specifically governor of the

international investors the company later acquired  of the ports common stock from en for rub billion mechel sold  of common stock in vanino port for rub  billion on october   retaining only  in the port  criticism from the governmentedit russian thenprime minister vladimir putin sharply criticized mechel management at a government meeting in nizhniy novgorod on july   which focused on ongoing troubles in the steel industry putin accused mechel for exporting raw materials for steelmakers at prices about half the domestic level which could be a sign of tax avoidance after putins accusations mechels stock dropped  on the new york stock exchange while the russian federal antimonopoly service launched investigation into mechels practice of raising domestic coking coal prices far above the export price levels on the following day july  the company issued a contrite statement promising full cooperation with federal authorities while share values rebounded by nearly  percent however vladimir putin once again criticized mechels management on july  during a government meeting on transfer pricing narrowing down his complaint “ when the domestic price is rub  per ton they sell the raw materials to themselves to their own offshore subsidiaries in this case to switzerland at rub  per ton which is only onequarter the domestic price  ” after this the stock price which had recovered a little over the previous days collapsed by another  producing a combined decline of  the companys market capitalization in august  was still half its value in july  in midaugust  the federal antimonopoly service found mechel guilty of violating article  of the competition law by causing the domestic price of coking to rise imposing a relatively small fine for this violation equivalent to  of the groups annual sales or rub  million in addition fas recommended that mechel should reduce the domestic price of coking coal by  this caused an additional weakness in the stock price in the wake of these events mechel announced on august  that a preferred share issue previously planned for placement on august  was to be postponed indefinitely this essentially closed the door to equity finance for mechel restricting its financing options to debt vladimir putin expressed regret over his own comments at a steel industry meeting in chelyabinsk on july   “ how can mechel organize normal decent fair business operation i remember my diatribe against mechel and i can only regret that it led to a more than  decline in the companys market capitalization i want to thank igor zyuzin — he did everything we spoke about and he has been on the best fair behavior ” conflicts with minority shareholdersedit mechel has had numerous conflicts with minority shareholders practically from the time of its incorporation minority shareholders have accused mechel of disregarding their rights vostok nafta prosperity capital metage capital and hq fonder accused mechel in — of unfairly reducing the buyout stock price during consolidation of mechels subsidiary southern kuzbass assets the federal service for financial markets confirmed that mechel had in fact violated minority shareholders rights by withholding essential information from them eventually mechel was forced to buy out the minority shareholders at the market price in  at the time when the russian environmental watchdog rosprirodnadzor filed claims against mechel subsidiaries a minority shareholder in tomusinsky open pit mine oao which is part of southern kuzbass the swiss bank julius baer and co ltd accused tomusinsky of issuing stock at a lower price in violation of the law and shareholders rights in  saven which held a  equity stake in tomusinsky open pit mine oao filed nine suits with an arbitration court claiming more than rub  billion from tomusinsky and several other subsidiaries of mechel yakutugol mechel mining mechel service mechel trans and mechel energo saven accused the defendants of diverting profits under the guise of lowinterest loans to companies affiliated with mechel on conditions clearly detrimental to themselves at interest rates ‘‘below’’ the russian central banks refinancing rate ie well below the market interest rate and without any collateral argasera also filed a suit in  against mechel subsidiary urals stampings plant oao courts have invariably ruled for the plaintiffs in these suits late  problemsedit mechel stock unexpectedly dropped sharply towards the end of  the stock dropped  on november   losing another  of their value the following day mechels market capitalization decreased from us  billion in may  to us  million in late  while the groups debt had mounted to us  billion the company started delaying wage payments and contractual payments to suppliers industry experts are unanimous that the companys trouble arise from inefficient acquisitions and highly risky financing policy which has practically brought mechel to the brink of bankruptcy the company has been forced to engage in tough negotiations with both russian and international creditor banks mechel announced in late november  that it had negotiated an arrangement with creditor banks to restructure debt extend repayment terms and be released from debt covenants for a “covenant holiday”  some experts believe that the company is no longer capable of servicing its debt including coupon payments on its corporate bonds however market analysts see mechels bankruptcy as unlikely as it would be against the creditors best interests sberbank vtb and gazprombank are mechels main creditors accounting for as much as  of the groups debt bonds account for an additional  the situation is complicated by the fact that mechel is in need of dramatic upgrades to its production facilities some observers have noted difficult relationships between mechel and several local governments of the home regions of mechels plants and facilities pointing out specifically governor of the

meeting in nizhniy novgorod on july   which focused on ongoing troubles in the steel industry putin accused mechel for exporting raw materials for steelmakers at prices about half the domestic level which could be a sign of tax avoidance after putins accusations mechels stock dropped  on the new york stock exchange while the russian federal antimonopoly service launched investigation into mechels practice of raising domestic coking coal prices far above the export price levels on the following day july  the company issued a contrite statement promising full cooperation with federal authorities while share values rebounded by nearly  percent however vladimir putin once again criticized mechels management on july  during a government meeting on transfer pricing narrowing down his complaint “ when the domestic price is rub  per ton they sell the raw materials to themselves to their own offshore subsidiaries in this case to switzerland at rub  per ton which is only onequarter the domestic price  ” after this the stock price which had recovered a little over the previous days collapsed by another  producing a combined decline of  the companys market capitalization in august  was still half its value in july  in midaugust  the federal antimonopoly service found mechel guilty of violating article  of the competition law by causing the domestic price of coking to rise imposing a relatively small fine for this violation equivalent to  of the groups annual sales or rub  million in addition fas recommended that mechel should reduce the domestic price of coking coal by  this caused an additional weakness in the stock price in the wake of these events mechel announced on august  that a preferred share issue previously planned for placement on august  was to be postponed indefinitely this essentially closed the door to equity finance for mechel restricting its financing options to debt vladimir putin expressed regret over his own comments at a steel industry meeting in chelyabinsk on july   “ how can mechel organize normal decent fair business operation i remember my diatribe against mechel and i can only regret that it led to a more than  decline in the companys market capitalization i want to thank igor zyuzin — he did everything we spoke about and he has been on the best fair behavior ” conflicts with minority shareholdersedit mechel has had numerous conflicts with minority shareholders practically from the time of its incorporation minority shareholders have accused mechel of disregarding their rights vostok nafta prosperity capital metage capital and hq fonder accused mechel in — of unfairly reducing the buyout stock price during consolidation of mechels subsidiary southern kuzbass assets the federal service for financial markets confirmed that mechel had in fact violated minority shareholders rights by withholding essential information from them eventually mechel was forced to buy out the minority shareholders at the market price in  at the time when the russian environmental watchdog rosprirodnadzor filed claims against mechel subsidiaries a minority shareholder in tomusinsky open pit mine oao which is part of southern kuzbass the swiss bank julius baer and co ltd accused tomusinsky of issuing stock at a lower price in violation of the law and shareholders rights in  saven which held a  equity stake in tomusinsky

november  that it had negotiated an arrangement with creditor banks to restructure debt extend repayment terms and be released from debt covenants for a “covenant holiday”  some experts believe that the company is no longer capable of servicing its debt including coupon payments on its corporate bonds however market analysts see mechels bankruptcy as unlikely as it would be against the creditors best interests sberbank vtb and gazprombank are mechels main creditors accounting for as much as  of the groups debt bonds account for an additional  the situation is complicated by the fact that
