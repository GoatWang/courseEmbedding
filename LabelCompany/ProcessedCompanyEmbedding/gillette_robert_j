imagine taking a dozen related but independentlyrun businesses each with its own unique product merging them into a cohesive business segment within an enormous corporation and driving up sales roughly  percent — all during an intense threeandahalf year period this is the highperformance world of robert j gillette arizonabased president and chief executive officer of honeywell aerospace the  billion behemoth that advertises with the catchy “we make ’em fly” slogan his segment aerospace produces integrated avionics engines equipment systems and services for everything from small jets to government missiles it has more than  production or service sites in the us united kingdom and europe “we turned our business upside down changing everything including how we go to market it was a relatively painful process” gillette told a ballroom of business leaders attending an economic club of phoenix luncheon held at the jw marriott camelback inn on april  the gathering drew more than  participants “but we had to put our customer first if we were going to win new business in the future to do a good job for them every day and deliver on commitments made that had not always been the case” he continued sales in the wind aerospace is a heavy hitter for honeywell responsible for roughly a third —  billion — of its overall  billion in sales last year the only segment that outproduced aerospace was automation and control solutions source of  billion in  sales transportation systems produced  billion while specialty materials pulled in  billion locally honeywell is a major presence with  arizona employees and  retirees approximately half of that workforce holds a bachelor’s or an advanced degree and the average salary is a comfortable  the corporation’s impact also is felt in the supply stream contracting with  suppliers in arizona statewide honeywell’s payroll is more than  billion and the company’s spending puts another  million annually into arizona’s economy add to that educational contributions topping  and it’s clear that honeywell’s arizona footprint is huge flying the notsofriendly skies but back when gillette took over aerospace in  many of the airlines that make up honeywell aerospace’s commercial customer base were still suffering the aftershock of the  terrorist attacks even worse customers across the board including military and private customers were dissatisfied with service complaints included slow response times a baffling bureaucracy and clueless salesservice employees who didn’t have the necessary technical expertise gillette initially came on board in  in mid he was named president and ceo of honeywell transportation systems with him at the helm transportation sales grew  percent while income leapt  percent at aerospace he had a simple mandate dominate the defense market and reinvigorate the commercial sector he identified five trends that aerospace hopes to cash in on — flight efficiency aftermarket outsourcing changes among competitors as well as business models growing global demand and an increasing defense budget blind sight for each trend aerospace came up with a strategy to exploit it and leveraged products by adding services an example is a justapproved system for “flying blind” in zero visibility gillette called the new technology “synthetic vision that gives pilots a computergenerated threedimensional look at what is in front of the plane” the military likely will use it on helicopters that otherwise are grounded due to sandstorms he noted aerospace is pouring considerable resources into its flyingblind solution which promises to save “incredible amounts of fuel while saving on co emissions” because it allows airplanes to fly pointtopoint “we no longer will have to fly highways in the sky” gillette added customers have responded to the new energy and better service by signing on the dotted line recent deals include an  billion year contract with airbus a  billion deal with gulfstream and another  million gig with a brazilian manufacturer of business jets he said the fastchanging global market gillette says global expansion indicates that honeywell aerospace’s market may change faster than domestic demands for instance  years ago  percent of all business jets sold worldwide were sold in north america today only  percent of that business stems from north american customers he explained “this changes our business dynamic as we must supply customers where they fly” he added another strategy is figuring out which tasks aerospace can perform for the customer that the company currently struggles with internally then there’s the diverse technology underlying aerospace’s performance air transport claims  platforms regional transport  platforms business jets approximately  platforms general aviation  platforms and helicopters  platforms and those are just the commercial platforms teamwork despite the incredibly successful reorganization gillette says his “biggest challenge and most rewarding experience” remains delivering on the company’s customer commitments key to that is a cohesive team of “really really good people” he noted “i don’t do a hell of a lot mainly i select people put them in the right positions and roles listen to them and alleviate what gets in their way when i go home at night or get on a plane to fly somewhere else i hope they come up with something good” he told the lunch crowd while developing leaders internally is a favorite focus gillette admits that business executives’ lectures on personal leadership can be “a bit of a clich ” his approach is to spend time and energy talking to employees about the company’s goals and direction the opposite of a leader is a victim and victimhood isn’t welcome at honeywell aerospace “some don’t want to take responsibility honeywell people do and it’s the reason for our success” he said “it’s not a bleedingheart kumbaya kind of thing it’s just the truth focus on customers deliver on commitments and when something happens fix it” bottom line more than  graduates of arizona state university work at honeywell aerospace according to gillette while aerospace is based in phoenix ariz parent company honeywell is headquartered in morris township nj honeywell is one of the  stocks that make up the dow jones industrial average and is also a component of the standard  poor’s  index aerospace accounts for roughly a third —  billion — of its overall  billion in sales last year click to share on facebook opens in new windowclick to share on twitter opens in new windowclick to
