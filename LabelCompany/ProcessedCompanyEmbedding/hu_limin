sent to the url mapped to the particular vendor id and action type as a response the user receives an html page displaying the status of the request or links directing them furtherin order to integrate the clickloan module in the lender web site the lender inserts the clickloan control into a web page using the object tag in the html page and referring to the classid of clickloan controlthe codebase attribute indicates where the cab file is located it is important to note that the version number has to be specified in the codebase attribute and it should correspond to the version of the control every time the web browser eg microsoft internet explorer navigates to the web page the version of the currently installed component is compared to the version specified in codebase attribute if codebase version is higher the new cab file is downloaded and installed otherwise already installed clickloan control is loaded it is therefore generally necessary to update the version in codebase with the current version number of the clickloan controlin one embodiment the clickloan cab files are hosted on the loan origination system server  all the vendors are provided with urls for these files and the codebase attributes should point to those urlsonce the clickloan module has been inserted into a web page there are several properties that need to be set by the hosting web page to set these properties a set properties setpropertiesbstr propname bstr propvalue function is made available to be used within the script tag of the web page this function is called as a method of clickloan object using the name specified by id attribute of object tagthe following mandatory properties are set by the user once the control has been inserted vendor identifier action

origination system interface module for interfacing a lender computer to los programs on a broker computer can be implemented in conjunction with a server based desktop based loan application processing and submission server such a system is described in copending us application ser no  entitled “online system for fulfilling loan applications from loan originators” fig  illustrates an exemplary network system for processing loan applications according to this alternative embodiment of the present invention as illustrated in fig  the los program or programs resident on the broker computer  are also coupled to a loan origination system computer  this computer executes several program modules that manage the loan origination process and comprise the processing and submission system these can include a business center process  one or more backend processes  and a data storage facility  in one embodiment the business center  contains a network interface that provides access between the loan origination system program and other entities for the embodiment in which the network comprises the internet the interface may be a webbased interface in this case the business center  includes a web browser client process  executed on the loan broker computer the backend processes  comprise the processing and submission system servers that provide downloadable program modules to the loan origination program andor perform calculations for the loan origination program the data storage facility  stores various data related to the lenders and users within the systemthe business center process  within the data center  includes the software module comprising a processing and submission system that implements business and processing logic modules for receiving loan application information from a borrower such as  data for mortgage loans storing data related to the borrower providing interfaces to processes utilized by lenders and other third parties that fulfill and settle the loan in one embodiment the data stored by the data center is used by the loan origination system programs  and provided to the broker through the lender web site  for processing and displayas illustrated in fig  the loan broker computer  is coupled through the business center process  to loan underwriters  and one or more settlement service vendors  these entities perform the function of fulfilling and settling the loan application these entities generally access the loan origination system program of the broker computer through the web browser interface of the business center  the business center also provides facilities to set up storefront type interfaces for lenders to customize their offerings and provides an information portal for brokers such a portal and storefront interface may be utilized by the lenders andor vendors to generate and maintain a web site presence on the internet such as through lender web site one or more of the loan underwriters  reviews the loan application and approves or denies the application one example of a mortgage loan underwriter is the fannie mae company which does not itself provide loan funds but works with lenders to assure that the funds are available lenders  are typically banks savings and loans or other financial institutions that provide the loan funds the settlement service vendors provide services and information required to close the loan such vendors include appraisers credit reporting agencies document preparers flood certification agencies and the like other third party entities that may be interfaced to the broker computer may include loan servicers who collect monthly payments from the borrower and other similar loan process companies the lenders and vendors may maintain web sites as a point of contact for brokers over the internetthe business center module  of the loan originator computer  accesses one or more loan origination system programs  the loan origination software programs  utilized by the loan broker can be a proprietary system or a commercially available system examples of present commercially available loan origination system programs include genesis™ contour™ calyx point™ and byte™ as described previously among other similar los programs alternatively the loan broker may utilize a standard internet web site to interface with the borrower and provide some degree of loan origination software functionalityoperation of the loan origination system  for a loan application process initiated by broker  is described in the aforementioned copending us application ser

primary health challenge in china stroke is the second most common cause of death traditional chinese medicine tcm has for many centuries been used and it is still widely used today in countries of south and east asia for the treatment of people with stroke the objective of this systematic review was to evaluate whether complex traditional chinese medicine ctcm improves poststroke motor recovery in particular we defined ctcm as intervention that included at least acupuncture and chinese herbal medicine methods—an extensive search including pubmed embase cbm and the cochrane library was performed up to december  randomized clinical trials rcts about ctcm for motor dysfunction of poststroke were searched irrespective of any language the quality of each trial was assessed according to the cochrane reviewers’ handbook  results—after selection of   articles  rcts and quasircts were included all these trials were conducted in china and published on chinese journals all trials but one reported results in favor of ctcm treatments suggesting a strong publication bias because of the significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity no metaanalysis was performed and thus no cumulative result was obtained pooling data of rcts conclusions—what appears from this systematic review is that scant data are available to evaluate efficacy of ctcm for poststroke motor dysfunction most of the primary studies available for this review were inadequately designed trials characterized by unknown dropout rates and definitional vagueness in outcomes measures none of the studies approached important end points like death survival times rate of dependency reduction in length of stay in hospital etc the key to lead to evidencebased practices is establishing a consensus on standardized relevant outcome measures and then designing and conducting appropriate rcts that adopt those standards traditional chinese medicinesystematic reviewstrokerehabilitationannually  million people worldwide suffer from stroke of these  million die and another  million are left permanently disabled stroke is the biggest single cause of major disability as such stroke represents a heavy burden both on family and communityin china official statistics data show that stroke is the second most common cause of death among both urban and rural residents  per   per year in cities and  per   in rural populations the ageadjusted stroke prevalence in china varies from  per   to  per   for all agestraditional chinese medicine tcm has for many centuries been used and it is still widely used today in countries of south and east asia for the treatment of people with stroke with the purpose of investigating the appropriate scientific evidence for tcm the italian national institute of health and the tianjin university of traditional chinese medicine have implemented a common project the joint sinoitalian laboratory josil on tcm this systematic review was conducted within the framework of josilmany systematic reviews of chinese traditional treatments in stroke rehabilitation have been published mainly on chinese journals some systematic reviews were delivered by the cochrane library mainly related to the acute phase of stroke most of these studies investigated the role of acupuncture or chinese herbal medicines alone with contradictory conclusions– tcm includes acupuncture massage physical exercise and chinese herbal medicines which are usually used in combination in clinical practice however whether or not the combinations of these treatments are truly effective for stroke is still unknown the objective of our systematic review was to determine whether complex tcm treatments ctcm improves poststroke motor recovery in particular we defined ctcm as intervention that included at least acupuncture and chinese herbal medicine methods types of studies randomized and quasirandomized clinical trials to evaluate ctcm for poststroke interventions up to december  were searched irrespective of language quasircts are trials that use approaches to allocate patients such as alternation case record numbers birth date etc these methods of allocation are relatively easy to manipulate introducing selection bias types of participants trials including patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke of any age or sex were eligible stroke had to be diagnosed according to the world health organization definition or to the corresponding diagnostic criteria adopted in china– or confirmed by computerized tomography or mri trials that included patients in an acute phase within  days from onset were excluded the reason for this choice depends on the fact that we wanted to investigate the effectiveness of ctcm on motor function in the rehabilitation stage and not in the acute phase in the acute phase the patients are at high risk and their treatment should comply also in china with the international guidelines a day interval from the onset was adopted in some clinical trials to distinguish the acutenon acute stroke phase eg httpclinicaltrialsgovctshownct trials of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hematoma were not considered types of interventions we included in our review only trials that included at least acupuncture and some kind of herbal medicine either traditional acupuncture in which the needles were inserted in classical meridian points or acupuncture in which the needles were inserted in nonmeridian or trigger points were considered regardless of the source of stimulation for example manual or electric stimulation “injectio ad acumen” acupuncture was also included this technique consists of injecting chinese medicine into certain acupoints all the preparations of different chinese herbs or extractions were considered all studies were required to have treatment duration of at least  week types of outcome measures all the trials concerning the patients and the treatments previously described were considered eligible for our review independently from the outcomes studied death activities of daily living adl functional recovery quality of life qol etc study selection to identify all relevant articles a comprehensive search was performed in december  we searched the cochrane central register of controlled trials  issue  pubmed – embase – and the chinese biomedical database – we also searched other chinese journal databases chinese journal fulltext database and scientific journal database to identify thesis and conference articles the search terms used were “traditional chinese medicine acupuncture massage scraping ventouse acupoint complex therapy” and “stroke apoplexy brain infarction cerebral infarction hematencephalon encephalorrhagia hemorrhage” these terms were used as freetext terms translated to chinese to search some of the chinese databases freetext and mesh terms were used to search cbm pubmed and cochrane library freetext and emtree terms were used to search embase we also examined the bibliographies of all of the considered publications so as to identify other studies two reviewers zhang junhua and shang hongcai independently examined titles and abstracts of the trials for inclusion based on the selection criteria outlined above a table with the english translation of all the titles and a summary of the articles was prepared and reviewed by a third investigator francesca mennitiippolito the full texts of articles were retrieved if there was any doubt whether an article should be excluded or not inconsistencies were solved through discussion the selected trials that were claimed to be randomized were retrieved and then examined for confirmation that they were indeed correctly randomized quality assessment of trials included a quality assessment was carried out for all the retrieved studies quality in a systematic review refers essentially to the absence of biases the main biases in a clinical trial can derive from systematic differences between comparison groups in measured or unmeasured baseline characteristics because of the way participants were selected or assigned selection bias care provided apart from the intervention being evaluated performance bias how outcomes are ascertained diagnosed or verified detection bias withdrawals or exclusions of participants from the results of a study attrition bias to assess the methodological validity of the studies included in this review the following aspects were evaluated according to a binary score presenceabsence randomization allocation concealment blinding and description of followup according to cochrane reviewers’ handbook  categories were defined  all quality criteria met low risk of bias  one or more of the quality criteria only partly met moderate risk of bias  one or more criteria not met high risk of bias articles were assessed by  reviewers zhang junhua and shang hongcai independently disagreements were resolved by consultation with a third reviewer gao xiumei data extraction the information on patients methods interventions outcomes and results was extracted and summarized by  reviewers zhang junhua xiong jun xu yuanyuan zhang xin using a standardized data extraction form disagreements were resolved through discussion among all investigators for dichotomous outcomes the number of responders and the total number of participants for each study arm were extracted for continuous outcomes eg deficit of neurological score the mean change and standard deviation for the mean in each group of the trial were extracted along with the total number data analysis in this study statistical analysis was performed using software provided by the cochrane collaboration review manager  we did not perform any estimate of pooled effect because of clinical and methodological heterogeneity among the trials included in the review results search flow an initial screening yielded   potentially relevant citations in accordance with the search strategy according to the inclusion criteria on the basis of the titles and abstracts   articles were excluded these studies were mainly excluded because duplicates of the same articles included in different databases because the tested treatments were not ctcm or because they were not rcts after the full text reading of  articles  studies were further excluded mainly because they had included patients in the acute phase of stroke ultimately  studies were included for analysis see figure  all of the trials were conducted in china and published on chinese journals

of the trials included the “effective rate” er was the most commonly used measure to evaluate efficacy used in  of the trials this measure is extensively cited in chinese biomedical literature to define the proportion of responders to treatments or interventions for poststroke treatments a “responder” was defined on the basis of a combined evaluation of muscle strength and functional independence measure fim or activities of daily living barthel adl index two of the trials used the fuglmeyer motor function assessment as an index two of the trials used the fim as an index only

randomization with only  of the trials reporting that the random sequence was generated by a random digits table three trials allocated patients by the sequence of admission no trial described allocation concealment or mentioned blinding procedures none of the trials described withdrawal and intentiontotreat analyses only  of the trials reported data on followup observations in general the methodological quality of the trials included was poor according to the cochrane handbook all of the trials included were of low quality classified as “c” effectiveness almost all the trials  used the er as an outcome measure for these studies an “effective rate ratio” err was calculated as the ratio between the proportion of responders in the treatment group and the proportion of responders in the

piracetam err   ci  to  buyanghuawu decoction plus acupuncture and rehabilitation exercise was more effective than piracetam plus vitamin e and compound danshen tablets err   ci  to  acupuncture massage physical exercise and xesaitong plus cytidine triphosphate ctp was more effective than physical exercise and xesaitong plus ctp err   ci  to  ctcms versus physical exercise treatment with herbal medicines based on symptoms and signs plus acupuncture bath injectio ad acumen and rehabilitation exercise was more effective than placebo defined as starch capsulesdecoction of henon bamboo leafsham acupuncture plus physical exercise err   ci  to  adverse events only  study reported adverse events  patients in the ctcms group of  patients had mild stomach discomfort discussion one of the most important aspects of our review refers to the methodological approach adopted in the studies in our systematic review in fact it was not possible to find welldesigned trials to evaluate efficacy of complex tcm treatments for the management of poststroke motor dysfunction most of the trials included in this review used an “ab versus b” design where patients are randomized to receive a control treatment the control group versus a control treatment plus the experimental treatment the treatment group this kind of design is quite popular in acupuncture studies where acupuncture is added to usual care nevertheless it is likely to generate falsepositive results without a rigorous control for placebo effect by using nonpenetrating or sham devices or placebo herbal medicine in the control group the results of these studies would be positive because of nonspecificplacebo effects related to the additional care given to patients in the treatment group or by the disappointment experienced by patients of the control group when not receiving the experimental treatments they may have hoped for because of the significant clinical heterogeneity eg different interventions different time since stroke onset it was not possible to perform a pooling analysis of the trials fourteen trials did not define the time to onset of stroke and  trials included patients with long intervals to stroke onset from  days to  years this can affect the external validity of the studies ie the extent to which the observed effects could be generalized in the clinical practice with regard to the quality of reporting of the trials a common shortcoming was the inadequate description of the randomization and blinding procedures a large number of these trials actually claimed to be rcts but most of the authors have apparently misunderstood the full concept of randomization allocation concealment was not reported in any of the trials included other important weaknesses were the very poor descriptions of dropouts and of harmrelated issues none of the trials reported patient withdrawals and only  study described the occurrence of adverse events as far as the herbal medicines are concerned quality control of herbal preparations is not mentioned in trial reports although this is crucial for the validity of the study results to assess the efficacy of a specific product in a clinical study all participants should be given exactly the same intervention in terms of product identity purity dosage and formulation overall because of the poor methodological qualities of the studies the results of the trials included in this systematic review are likely to be biased by many factors furthermore because the review included only articles published on the chinese literature a location bias cannot be excluded ie trials published in low or nonimpact factor journals are more likely to report significant results than those published in highimpact mainstream medical journals as demonstrated by the asymmetry of the funnel plot shown in figure  also other systematic reviews of tcm had encountered similar problems and the chinese government is stimulating through huge investments the improvement of the studies aiming to prove the efficacy of chinese medicine according to international standards in our review only  of the  selected articles declared the source of funding a critical element in conducting systematic reviews is having access to all relevant publications that address the clinical question there is the possibility that in our review we were not able to identify all relevant studies important results may have been published in reports technical reports discussion papers or other formats which were not indexed in the databases we used comprehensive identification of such “gray literature” is hard to achieve another possible limitation of our review is that we did not have the opportunity to contact study authors for obtaining additional information about the included studies the primary studies available for this review were mostly inadequately designed trials characterized by unknown dropout rates and definitional vagueness in outcomes measures none of the studies included in our review approached important end points like for example death survival times rate of dependency reduction in length of stay in hospital or long term care institution etc all the trials were actually focused on ancillary or surrogate outcomes measured through subjective qualitative scores ie “notable” “effective” “ineffective” etc in all the trials the duration of therapy and followup was indeed too short to allow to achieve conclusive results on more relevant outcomes both these aspects the low clinical relevance and the methods adopted to measure the end points demonstrate the need to approach with more rigorous tools the study of a possible role of tcm in stroke the key to lead to evidencebased practices is in establishing a consensus on standardized relevant outcome measures and then designing and conducting appropriate rcts that adopt those standards acknowledgments the italian national institute of health and the tianjin university of traditional chinese medicine are implementing a common project the sinoitalian joint laboratory josil on traditional chinese medicine tcm with the purpose of investigating the appropriate scientific evidence for tcm this systematic review was conducted within the framework of josil the authors thank xiong jun xu yuanyuan zhang xin and xiang yaozu for their
