hallrichard lipsky a lobbyist for small businesses who opposed the city’s plan to redevelop willets point and to use eminent domain to gain control of the land said that mr lieber’s approach failed to account for the collateral damage to the neighborhood“the deputy mayor and his agency have proceeded in a recession to promote a project that is going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars and displace scores of small businesses and thousands of workers without any conceivable plan or a developer to implement it” mr lipsky saidin april john c liu the city comptroller released an audit showing that the economic development corporation which mr lieber oversees had kept more than  million in payments taxes and fees rather than turning them over to the city’s general fundmr bloomberg
