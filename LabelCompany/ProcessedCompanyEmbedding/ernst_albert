for breath control and technical perfection why must we remain at the mercy of inferior instruments” couturier turned to instrument design to address that problem as did vincent bach elden benge renold schilke and jerome callet the continuous conical bore construction patented by couturier was a core principle in his designs ea couturier company was known for the unique shape of the valve tubing which in its original and purest form did not support any tuning slide for fine pitch adjustment this design was to support the most continuously conical bore possible and also offered less resistance to air flow through the horn slides when present continued a conical progression by varying the wall thickness in order to achieve a movable cylindrical exterior those instruments built without valve slides tasked the players to bend some notes using their lips and also to rotate the horn to free the instrument of condensation during rests the couturier cornet was typically available in a bba model with a rotary valve for selecting the key of the horn while other makers of the era such as hn white used interchangeable tuning slides couturier and the company received numerous
