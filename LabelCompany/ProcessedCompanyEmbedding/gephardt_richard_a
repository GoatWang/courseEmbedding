commanding heights  richard gephardt  on pbs interview  profile  print  pdf richard gephardt b  an influential member of the us congress since dick gephardt stepped down from his position as house democratic leader after the  midterm elections in which republicans gained the majority in both houses of congress in late  he announced his intention to make his second bid for the presidency his first was in  interview conducted  interview contents governments role in the economy reaganomics and the tax cut a turning point for democrats nafta and trade talks more than just the bottom line compatibility of trading partners crisis contagion political repercussions of fiscal policy interview governments role in the economy interviewer lets talk about the s who were the new democrats and the neoliberals what was the evolution of your own thinking about the right balance between government involvement and market involvement in shaping the economy richard gephardt well ive always felt that capitalism is the best system competition really works and produces the best products at the lowest possible price which is what were always after but the government has a role as an intermediary and at times as a rule keeper or referee so that the hard edges of capitalism and the free market are rounded off a little bit and the whole thing can work to its optimal capacity i felt at that time that government had a role to play in building the economy we always felt that an infrastructure program a national highway program was something that you couldnt get without government activity you cant defend the country without a military and thats really a government role you cant have a safe airline system unless you have somebody worrying about air safety and making sure that the companies do what they need to do with regard to safety you cant protect the environment if you just let everybody do what they want to do no matter what the cost to clean air and clean water and to having some wilderness areas still available for people i guess lincoln put it best when he said government ought to do what people cannot do for themselves while thats a rough test its probably the best test you can come up with for the appropriate role for government  to help do what people cant do for themselves back to top reaganomics and the tax cut interviewer what challenge did reaganomics pose to the democratic party how did you try to reshape the vision of the democratic party as the us was heading into the late s richard gephardt the reagan years were marked by one very big economic decision and that was a very large farreaching tax cut that really changed economic policy and ultimately the role of the government the republicans argued for the tax cut in terms of supplyside economics but there were a lot of us who never really believed that would work and were very worried about the deficits that we thought would result from these tax cuts without including spending cuts some republicans though were cynical about it and saw the tax cuts as a way to defund government they wanted to get rid of government because they were doctrinaire ideological opponents of any government effort some of them were almost libertarians who felt that the government shouldnt even exist even for national defense so it was the combination of the supplysiders who really believed in the economic theory of ideological opponents of government that combined to come together with the cynics on a very politically attractive proposal to get rid of taxes or to get taxes to be very low when this passed the congress a lot of us were very worried that deficits would occur that they would continue and that we would complicate fiscal budgetary and monetary policy in the country because the government would have such a voracious appetite for borrowing capital we believed that there should have been sufficient capital so that it could be borrowed at reasonable rental rates for individuals and businesses our prediction unfortunately came true and we went from  trillion of debt in this country to about  trillion in debt in about  years the economy was staggering and people couldnt borrow money inflation was up interest rates were up growth was down unemployment was up and what we feared would happen had happened it took a very hard job by president clinton in  along with the democratic congress to turn that policy around back to top a turning point for democrats interviewer we interviewed robert rubin last week and he was talking about his early meetings with clinton when he was governor just before the campaign he brought together a lot of people from wall street who really began talking about deficit reduction and trade liberalization and these were not traditional democratic issues wall street wasnt often the source of ideas for democratic candidates what was your sense of the direction the party was going in the direction clinton and rubin wanted to go in at the time richard gephardt i was very supportive in fact i helped line up the votes for the budget reduction plan in  i also helped a great deal in the drawing of the plan with leon panetta who came to the congress with me in the late s to me this was a departure point for the democratic party some day maybe well get some credit from people for that work it really began to identify the democratic party as the party of fiscal responsibility of getting the deficit down of getting interest rates down and of getting inflation down which is very important bob rubin was a very important part of this effort he had the deep respect of democratic members of congress not only because of his financial knowledge and his expertise but because hes a real democrat he cares about people he realizes the horrible impact on poor families when the economy is not working right he really cares about the impact of our fiscal activity on the people of this country so he was an excellent person to help the president sell this program to democrats in the congress back to top nafta and trade talks more than just the bottom line interviewer youre talking about trade with nafta was that a difficult decision for you to say this is not the right policy richard gephardt no because ive worked on trade a lot since ive been here i believe in trade and i think the wto is a good thing ive always supported international rules in trade we suffer when we dont have international rules that we can get countries and people to adhere to what was lacking in nafta was an enforceable set of provisions that would treat the issues of intellectual property labor rights human rights and environmental concerns in a consistent way theres been duplicity in trade negotiations the business community cares about intellectual property and so they insist on it being protected both international and national laws are being enforced in the same way trade treaties are enforced but when it gets to labor rights and environmental concerns and human rights the proponents of trade and many in the business community dont care they dont think it should be part of trade negotiations because frankly they dont care about those things i understand that but i think its inconsistent and i think its wrong what i wanted in nafta were enforceable provisions in the core of the treaty for labor rights and environmental concerns and human rights just as there were for intellectual property this would then cause the better enforcement of national laws on labor rights environmental concerns and human rights we were never able to get that stipulation because they always shoved it into a side agreement that in my view had no teeth what weve seen since then is that none of that is being attended to i have no illusions about how hard this is to do i know its a long project i know itll take a long time to even get the national laws of various countries to be enforced in their own countries but i think thats the minimum that we have to ask for in trade treaties at the end of the clinton administration through the work of president clinton and bob rubin and others we began to get much more effective provisions put in treaties on environmental and labor and human rights concerns and thats what we have to continue to do interviewer on nafta in particular were you right richard gephardt i think i am right there has been very little progress on those concerns and i think there will continue to be very little progress until we put effective provisions in the treaty the natural inclination is always to go for the cheapest labor where the environmental regulation is the most lax or nonexistent because it costs money and everybody in business is trying to meet a bottom line i understand thats a good thing its a case where societys good the countrys good the worlds good has to come into play its a place where capitalism has to be adjusted so that the things were concerned about are not just profit not just money but other values that are as important and need to be recognized once again the business community proponents of free trade are the first to say that intellectual property should be protected in trade treaties they do that because they care about that it means money to them and it is a valuable commodity to them well people need to have rights too labor needs to have their concerns listened to and we all need to worry about the environment because if we destroy the environment were not going to have an economy these longer range concerns need to be factored into commercial transactions so they can be dealt with when youre dealing with third world countries its very complicated and difficult often third world countries think were raising these issues just to stop trade with them to keep them down and to keep them in a poor condition that is not our goal one of the things i say to people in third world countries is that if we could get better enforcement of labor laws and minimum wage laws we could start building some consumers in these countries so that all of the consumption is not in america if this is going to be real twoway free and fair and prosperous trade weve got to begin to build a larger body of consumers in the world who can share in the prosperity back to top compatibility of trading partners interviewer let me ask you about globalization matters what is your sense of the anxiety thats being expressed on the streets richard gephardt if we just push trade at any cost under any conditions and we dont pay attention to peoples legitimate and real concerns about trade  ie were not worried about labor rights were not worried about the environment were not worried about human rights were not worried about displaced workers from trade treaties were not going to deal with the human equation in trade  then trade is going to get a bad name and a very important process in the furtherance of human rights for the whole world will go by the wayside i dont think that has to happen theres a way to do this so that over time people will accept more trade between more countries and ultimately throughout the world as a positive the problem in trade is that countries are incompatible they have different cultures different levels of development different money different environment different everything the more compatible countries are the easier trade is and the easier it is to deal with all of these adjacent problems trade between missouri and illinois is very easy no one questions it no one doubts that its good for both the states trade between united states and canada very easy because of the compatibility between the language the money the culture the way we do business trade between the united states and europe brings more problems but generally is pretty easy when you get trade between the united states and mexico or the united states and korea or the united states and china you get into a lot more incompatibility and difficulty that you have to work through in the treaty and agreement process theres another thing we have to pay attention to that the europeans have done much better than we have when you have these different levels of incompatibility developed nations need to invest in the infrastructure and environmental concerns of the developing partners for instance in the european union the more developed countries have invested over a long period of years a lot of money in turkey and greece and other countries that are less developed in order to bring about more compatibility they work with their infrastructure and they work on developing education and other trade adjustment assistance in those countries lets go back to nafta for a moment one of the things i wanted in nafta was a large fund through the nad north american development bank which was finally created but weve never put any money in it and its never done much we need that fund to build infrastructure on the border we need more highways more bridges more housing more sewage and more water infrastructure on both sides of the border we act like trade has no cost that magically somehow it solves all problems well it doesnt there are things that societies have to do that government has to do especially in developed countries like ours to make this all work we just havent paid attention to the things that we ought to be paying attention to in order to get everyone in our society and across the world to see that trade done right is a very powerful affirmative force in our world back to top crisis contagion interviewer you saw some of the potential costs of trade in the asian crisis youre sitting here on capitol hill and you watch this thing spread over months across asia south america and russia what was your sense of what was going on and the ability of washington to control events what did it tell you about the way that this trade expansion had changed the way politics operated richard gephardt when you get in a room with alan greenspan and robert rubin and they say theyre scared to death theyve never seen anything like this and theyre worried about whether or not we can get through it i get worried because they know a heck of a lot more about it than i do so i was concerned but again i think we avoided worse problems because the united states government and the federal reserve acted in a speedy and forthright manner to try to take care of some of these problems and to help developing countries avoid problems we had a world bank and an imf which are not perfect and make lots of mistakes but id hate to see the world without those institutions and so i think we ought to fund those institutions properly we ought to work with them to do their business better in some cases if we think theyre doing things poorly i do think that some of their economic thinking was a little bit arrogant with some of these developing countries and they pushed them and maybe forced them to do some things that were very difficult for them to do maybe that isnt the right thing to do but heck were all making this up as we go along nobody really knows the answers to all these things and generally the leadership of those institutions and the un are trying to do the right things trying to figure this out we need to continue to support these institutions again we need to get them to pay attention to the environment human rights concerns labor rights concerns so that theyre looking at the full array of issues that they ought to be addressing one of the concerns i have is that when they dealt with these developing countries they said heres the right economic policy for everybody one size fits all just go with this and even though it throws a whole lot of people out of work were not going to worry about that the leaders of those countries have to worry about that and thats where i think youve got to fall back on your abraham lincoln admonition that some things people can do on their own and with some things you need a little help from the government interviewer when youre in that room with alan greenspan and robert rubin what was going on richard gephardt you had the contagion sweeping across all the developing countries you had the thailand crisis and the indonesian crisis even south korea and some of the more developed countries in asia were in trouble brazil was having problems the sense was that we can have an allout worldwide recession and collapsing economies and collapsing currencies across the world and we had never as rubin said wed never seen that before maybe in the depression they saw that over a period of time but nothing happened that quickly what you have to remember is were in a new world today this is not  or  this is  and communication occurs constantly and consistently across the world markets never close people can climb on a plane today and go to any of these places so there is a lot more information out there theres a lot more travel between these countries we live in a little bitty world economy today and what affects one country can immediately affect a whole bunch of other economies so the developed world and america is the leader has to make investments has to lead has to be on the scene has to try to help these countries when they get into real immediate difficulty and i think that under rubin and greenspans leadership we did that congress couldnt find the wherewithal to pass what they needed to when mexico had its devaluation problem we did however give them congress the room to come up with an attorney general opinion this allowed rubin to go ahead and do something that probably was questionable legally but was the right thing to do and the congress didnt stand in his way back to top political repercussions of fiscal policy interviewer it was amazing to see the events leading up to the deficit reduction can you just tell us about the struggle that culminated in the government shutting down why the republicans lost and what mistakes they made richard gephardt it really comes in two parts the original action was in november of  right after hed been elected clinton invited tom foley george mitchell and i  i was the majority leader in the house  to little rock we met with him and talked to him about what was ahead when i got my chance to talk i said that the biggest challenge facing the country and him was the deficit i said  was a big mistake we have to correct that mistake and its going to take spending cuts and tax increases no matter what anybody tells you doing this is going to be politically painful for the democratic party and for you but it has to be done the analogy is that this is the admission into the ballpark to play the rest of the economic game if you dont get the deficit straightened out well never deal with research well never deal with education well never get interest rates down and well never get inflation down and he president clinton believed that we worked with leon panetta in the senate to write this budget it had about  percent tax increases and  percent spending cuts and as i predicted it was very hard to pass newt gingrich who was the republican leader and whip had told me that they would not give us any votes so we had to get all the votes on our side we passed it by one vote in the house and one vote in the senate i didnt realize how negative it would be in the next election the republicans ran ads against all of us who had voted for it saying that we had voted for the biggest tax increase in history which it probably was it raised taxes on gasoline and social security benefits which are very unpopular things to do but it was necessary in our view along with the spending cuts to get the budget straightened out and indeed in the next election in  we lost  seats in the house we had lost control of the house for the first time in  years and we lost control of the senate as well it was a very negative political act for the democratic party in my view it was still the right thing to do by  people had not yet seen the good economics that were coming out of those actions unemployment was not really down yet growth was not really up yet we hadnt seen the good from that act the second part of this story is that in  when the republicans took over the congress and newt gingrich became the new speaker of the house he was very desirous of a lot more cuts in the budget because he didnt think the budget was yet balanced a lot of us believed that we had taken the hard medicine and that the budget was going to go into balance even though it hadnt gotten there quite yet this is a big boat to turn around so gingrich was insisting on a budget that made a broad range of cuts including medicare social security school lunches and a lot of other things that the rest of us didnt want to cut the president newt gingrich tom daschle and myself were sitting in a meeting on the budget and we were at an impasse and newt turned to the president and he said you know the problem here is you have the veto power gun to my head and the truth is i need a gun to your head and i have one i can shut the government down unless you agree to the budget we want and if you dont thats what im going to do after the meeting clinton took me over in a corner and he asked me if i thought he would do this and i said i wouldnt be surprised and if he does were all going to get blamed people will look at this and say none of them know what theyre doing and they all deserve to be kicked out i was really worried that it would be a pox on everybodys house but as it turned out the people did distinguish between who really wanted to shut the government down and who didnt and ultimately gingrich had to sue for peace the republicans took a hard hit for shutting down the national parks and social security they came back day after day and said by shutting the government down we dont mean social security offices we dont mean national parks or the military we dont want to shut that down they destroyed their own argument it was an important moment in our history because what gingrich was really trying to do was to get an interpretation of the constitution that gave him veto power over the president and we dont have that back to top interview  profile  print  pdf dick

criticized what he thought were unfair trade barriers by korea and japan gephardt won the iowa caucuses and south dakota primary in february while finishing a strong second in new hampshire which made him one of the serious contenders for the nomination his campaign ran out of money after losing badly in the march super tuesday primaries when he won only the missouri primary an ad aired by the campaign of governor michael dukakis focused on gephardts flipflopping voting record and showed a gephardt lookalike doing forward and backward flips for the camera many felt that the ad killed any chance gephardt had of winning the nomination gephardt dropped out after winning only  in michigan despite support from the united auto workers dukakis considered gephardt for his running mate but chose texas senator lloyd bentsen house leadershipedit portrait of gephardt from the  congressional pictorial directory in part due to the visibility gained from his  presidential bid gephardt was elected majority leader by his house colleagues in june  making him the secondranking democrat in the house behind thenspeaker tom foley gephardt served in that position until january  after foley was unseated in the republican landslide of  that gave the republicans a seat majority gephardt became the leader of the house democrats as minority leader initially opposite newt gingrich and then from  onwards dennis hastert when gingrich faced a coup within his own party in  there was a possibility of gephardt becoming speaker if there had been a floor vote and he could gain the support of republican congressman dissatisfied with gingrich however gingrich refused to resign and no vote occurred in the   and  elections gephardt led the democrats to gains in the house although they did not retake the majority until  after gephardt had left congress gephardt was considered a keen politician who worked hard at passing legislation defending traditional democratic principles and for his home district in st louis he became a prolific financial supporter of democrats around the country in the early s when he assembled a team of top fundraising staff who helped him support hundreds of candidates for local and federal office although gephardt worked hard for many of president bill clintons programs he and his union supporters strongly opposed nafta and other free trade programs so clinton required republican support to pass these initiatives during the impeachment proceedings of president clinton gephardt led a walkout in the house after a censure motion was ruled irrelevant to the impeachment debate gephardt speaking at a vigil for matthew shepard in  in  vice president al gore named gephardt to his short list of possible vice presidential candidates the other names on the

shaheen gore eventually selected lieberman in the  congressional midterm elections gephardt campaigned on the issues of the economy and social security however the continuing resonance of the september  attacks the momentum for military action against iraq and president george w bushs popularity lead to republican gains with the democrats losing four house seats harold ford of tennessee described the results an absolute blowout and called upon gephardt to step down saying that it was time for new ideas and new faces due to his previous success it has been said that gephardt would have been easily returned as minority leader if he decided to stay on but gephardt did not run for reelection as house minority leader stepping down in january  his leadership position was contested by the centrist martin frost the outgoing democratic caucus chair and the liberal nancy pelosi the minority whip who was elected as gephardts successor no longer having congressional leadership duties freed up gephardt to concentrate on a  presidential bid  campaign for presidentedit gephardt announced his second run for president on january   his successor as minority leader nancy pelosi endorsed his bid for president his campaign was notable for the highprofile coming out of his daughter chrissy in people magazine when she was helping him on the campaign trail a subject they also discussed in interviews for the  documentary film for the bible tells me so he has continued to be an outspoken advocate for gay rights since the campaign though still opposes samesex marriage although republicans considered him a formidable candidate gephardt was seen by many as too old fashioned and unelectable his fundraising efforts were behind that of former vermont governor howard dean and senators john kerry and john edwards and tied with joe lieberman furthermore gephardts support of the iraq war resolution hurt him among liberal activists gephardt promoted a form of universal health care and was backed by  labor unions but did not have enough support to receive the endorsement of the aflcio supporters of gephardts campaign in  throughout early  gephardt was ahead in polling for the iowa caucus but by august dean had taken the lead his campaign fueled by antiwar activists the gephardt campaign was embarrassed by an early august st louis postdispatch article that revealed that  of  gephardt team leaders listed on his iowa campaigns web site were actually supporting other candidates or neutral the race between gephardt and dean became negative and took an ugly turn in october when a gephardt staffer reportedly pushed a dean staffer out of a meeting while calling him a faggot many press at the event claimed the dean staffer was picking a fight and that the gephardt staffer did not make the hurtful comment dean chairman joe trippi who had previously worked for gephardt in  and gephardt chairman steve murphy became involved in a war of words over that incident as well as murphys allegation that the dean campaign was bringing in outofstate nonresidents to participate in the caucus in the final days of the iowa campaign both dean and gephardt faded and ultimately finished third and fourth respectively gephardt ended his presidential campaign after that disappointing result after he dropped out of the presidential race gephardt was mentioned as a possible running mate for john kerry on march   new mexico governor bill richardson seen as a strong possibility for the position himself endorsed gephardt for the vice presidency i think hes the best candidate richardson said of gephardt in an interview with the associated press theres a good regional balance with kerry and gephardt kerry announced on july   that he had chosen john edwards as his running mate on the same day the new york post published an incorrect headline stating that gephardt had become kerrys running mate shortly after this false story broke the headline was compared to the  dewey defeats truman front page of the chicago tribune which incorrectly reported the presidential election results of that year in  it was revealed in the book no excuses concessions of a serial campaigner by bob shrum who served as kerrys campaign adviser in the  us presidential election that kerry wanted to choose gephardt as his nominee for vice president but was convinced by shrum and

gephardt was strongly antiabortion and was viewed as a social conservative he was initially extremely critical of the supreme courts landmark roe v wade ruling that legalized abortion he wrote on the subject in  life is the division of human cells a process that begins with conception the supreme courts abortion ruling was unjust and it is incumbent on the congress to correct the injustice i have always been supportive of prolife legislation i intend to remain steadfast on this issue i believe that the life of the unborn should be protected at all costs in  when gephardt decided to run for president he announced that he would no longer support legislation to restrict abortion rights he told the national right to life committee i now do not support any constitutional amendment pertaining to the legality of abortion gephardts views on economic policy also changed over the years he voted for ronald reagans tax cuts in  in the s however he became a staunch opponent of similar tax cuts by president george w bush saying that the enormous surplus created during the administration of bill clinton should have been spent on health care instead gephardt is widely viewed as an economic populist he supports universal health coverage fair trade and progressive taxation although he once chaired the centrist democratic leadership council gephardt in his later years in congress distanced himself from the organization finding his prolabor views at odds with the dlcs probusiness positions on october   gephardt was among the  house democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion

trade barriers by korea and japan gephardt won the iowa caucuses and south dakota primary in february while finishing a strong second in new hampshire which made him one of the serious contenders for the nomination his campaign ran out of money after losing badly in the march super tuesday primaries when he won only the missouri primary an ad aired by the campaign of governor michael dukakis focused on gephardts flipflopping voting record and showed a gephardt lookalike doing forward and backward flips for the camera many felt that the ad killed any chance gephardt had of winning the nomination gephardt dropped out after winning only  in michigan despite support from the united auto workers dukakis considered gephardt for his running mate but chose texas senator lloyd bentsen house leadershipedit portrait of gephardt from the  congressional pictorial directory in part due to the visibility gained from his  presidential bid gephardt was elected majority leader by his house colleagues in june  making him the secondranking democrat in the house behind thenspeaker tom foley gephardt served in that position until january  after foley was unseated in the republican landslide of  that gave the republicans a seat majority gephardt became the leader of the house democrats as minority leader initially opposite newt gingrich and then from  onwards dennis hastert when gingrich faced a coup within his own party in  there was a possibility of gephardt becoming speaker if there had been a floor vote and he could gain the support of republican congressman dissatisfied with gingrich however gingrich refused to resign and no vote occurred in the   and  elections gephardt led the democrats to gains in the house although they did not retake the majority until  after gephardt had left congress gephardt was considered a keen politician who worked hard at passing legislation defending traditional democratic principles and for his home district in st louis he became a prolific financial supporter of democrats around the country in the early s when he assembled a team of top fundraising staff who helped him support hundreds of candidates for local and federal office although gephardt worked hard for many of president bill clintons programs he and his union supporters strongly opposed nafta and other free trade programs so clinton required republican support to pass these initiatives during the impeachment proceedings of president clinton gephardt led a walkout in the house after a censure motion was ruled irrelevant to the impeachment debate gephardt speaking at a vigil for matthew shepard in  in  vice president al gore named gephardt to his short list of possible vice presidential candidates the other names on the short list were thenindiana senator evan bayh thennorth carolina senator john edwards thenmassachusetts senator john kerry thenconnecticut senator joe lieberman and thennew hampshire governor jeanne shaheen gore eventually selected lieberman in the  congressional midterm elections gephardt campaigned on the issues of the economy and social security however the continuing resonance of the september  attacks the momentum for military action against iraq and president george w bushs popularity lead to republican gains with the democrats losing four house seats harold ford of tennessee described the results an absolute blowout and called upon gephardt to step down saying that it was time for new ideas and new faces due to his previous success it has been said that gephardt would have been easily returned as minority leader if he decided to stay on but gephardt did not run for reelection as house minority leader stepping down in january  his leadership position was contested by the centrist martin frost the outgoing democratic caucus chair and the liberal nancy pelosi the minority whip who was elected as gephardts successor no longer having congressional leadership duties freed up gephardt to concentrate on a  presidential bid  campaign for presidentedit gephardt announced his second run for president on january   his successor as minority leader nancy pelosi endorsed his bid for president his campaign was notable for the highprofile coming out of his daughter chrissy in people magazine when she was helping him on the campaign trail a subject they also discussed in interviews for the  documentary film for the bible tells me so he has continued to be an outspoken advocate for gay rights since the campaign though still opposes samesex marriage although republicans considered him a formidable candidate gephardt was seen by many as too old fashioned and unelectable his fundraising efforts were behind that of former vermont governor howard dean and senators john kerry and john edwards and tied with joe lieberman furthermore gephardts support of the iraq war resolution hurt him among liberal activists gephardt promoted a form of universal health care and was backed by  labor unions but did not have enough support to receive the endorsement of the aflcio supporters of gephardts campaign in  throughout early  gephardt was ahead in polling for the iowa caucus but by august dean had taken the lead his campaign fueled by antiwar activists the gephardt campaign was embarrassed by an early august st louis postdispatch article that revealed that  of  gephardt team leaders listed on his iowa campaigns web site were actually supporting other candidates or neutral the race between gephardt and dean became negative and took an ugly turn in october when a gephardt staffer reportedly pushed a dean staffer out of a meeting while calling him a faggot many press at the event claimed the dean staffer was picking a fight and that the gephardt staffer did not make the hurtful comment dean chairman joe trippi who had previously worked for gephardt in  and gephardt chairman steve murphy became involved in a war of words over that incident as well as murphys allegation that the dean campaign was bringing in outofstate nonresidents to participate in the caucus in the final days of the iowa campaign both dean and gephardt faded and ultimately finished third and fourth respectively gephardt ended his presidential campaign after that disappointing result after he dropped out of the presidential race gephardt was mentioned as a possible running mate for john kerry on march   new mexico governor bill richardson seen as a strong possibility for the position himself endorsed gephardt for the vice presidency i think hes the best candidate richardson said of gephardt in an interview with the associated press theres a good regional balance with kerry and gephardt kerry announced on july   that he had chosen john edwards as his running mate on the same day the new york post published an incorrect headline stating that gephardt had become kerrys running mate shortly after this false story broke the headline was compared to the  dewey defeats truman front page of the chicago tribune which incorrectly reported the presidential election results of that year in  it was revealed in the book no excuses concessions of a serial campaigner by bob shrum who served as

japan gephardt won the iowa caucuses and south dakota primary in february while finishing a strong second in new hampshire which made him one of the serious contenders for the nomination his campaign ran out of money after losing badly in the march super tuesday primaries when he won only the missouri primary an ad aired by the campaign of governor michael dukakis focused on gephardts flipflopping voting record and showed a gephardt lookalike doing forward and backward flips for the camera many felt that the ad killed any chance gephardt had of winning the nomination gephardt dropped out after winning only  in michigan despite support from the united auto workers dukakis considered gephardt for his running mate but chose texas senator lloyd bentsen house leadershipedit portrait of gephardt from the  congressional pictorial directory in part due to the visibility gained from his  presidential bid gephardt was elected majority leader by his house colleagues in june  making him the secondranking democrat in the house behind thenspeaker tom foley gephardt served in that position until january  after foley was unseated in the republican landslide of  that gave the republicans a seat majority gephardt became the leader of the house democrats as minority leader initially opposite newt gingrich and then from  onwards dennis hastert when gingrich faced a coup within his own party in  there was a possibility of gephardt becoming speaker if there had been a floor vote and he could gain the support of republican congressman dissatisfied with gingrich however gingrich refused to resign and no vote occurred in the   and  elections gephardt led the democrats to gains in the house although they did not retake the majority until  after gephardt had left congress gephardt was considered a keen politician who worked hard at passing legislation defending traditional democratic principles and for his home district in st louis he became a prolific financial supporter of democrats around the country in the early s when he assembled a team of top fundraising staff who helped him support hundreds of candidates for local and federal office although gephardt worked hard for many of president bill clintons programs he and his union supporters strongly opposed nafta and other free trade programs so clinton required republican support to pass these initiatives during the impeachment proceedings of president clinton gephardt led a walkout in the house after a censure motion was ruled irrelevant to the impeachment debate gephardt speaking at a vigil for matthew shepard in  in  vice president al gore named gephardt to his short list of possible vice presidential candidates the other names on the short list were thenindiana senator evan bayh thennorth carolina senator john edwards thenmassachusetts senator john kerry thenconnecticut senator joe lieberman and thennew hampshire governor jeanne shaheen gore eventually selected lieberman in the  congressional midterm elections gephardt campaigned on the issues of the economy and social security however the continuing resonance of the september  attacks the momentum for military action against iraq and president george w bushs popularity lead to republican gains with the democrats losing four house seats harold ford of tennessee described the results an absolute blowout and called upon gephardt to step down saying that it was time for new ideas and new faces due to his previous success it has been said that gephardt would have been easily returned as minority leader if he decided to stay on but gephardt did not run for reelection as house minority leader stepping down in january  his leadership position was contested by the centrist martin frost the outgoing democratic caucus chair and the liberal nancy pelosi the minority whip who was elected as gephardts successor no longer having congressional leadership duties freed up gephardt to concentrate on a  presidential bid  campaign for presidentedit gephardt announced his second run for president on january   his successor as minority leader nancy pelosi endorsed his bid for president his campaign was notable for the highprofile coming out of his daughter chrissy in people magazine when she was helping him on the campaign trail a subject they also discussed in interviews for the  documentary film for the bible tells me so he has continued to be an outspoken advocate for gay rights since the campaign though still opposes samesex marriage although republicans considered him a formidable candidate gephardt was seen by many as too old fashioned and unelectable his fundraising efforts were behind that of former vermont governor howard dean and senators john kerry and john edwards and tied with joe lieberman furthermore gephardts support of the iraq war resolution hurt him among liberal activists gephardt promoted a form of universal health care and was backed by  labor unions but did not have enough support to receive the endorsement of the aflcio supporters of gephardts campaign in  throughout early  gephardt was ahead in polling for the iowa caucus but by august dean had taken the lead his campaign fueled by antiwar activists the gephardt campaign was embarrassed by an early august st louis postdispatch article that revealed that  of  gephardt team leaders listed on his iowa campaigns web site were actually supporting other candidates or neutral the race between gephardt and dean became negative and took an ugly turn in october when a gephardt staffer reportedly pushed a dean staffer out of a meeting while calling him a faggot many press at the event claimed the dean staffer was picking a fight and that the gephardt staffer did not make the hurtful comment dean chairman joe trippi who had previously worked for gephardt in  and gephardt chairman steve murphy became involved in a war of words over that incident as well as murphys allegation that the dean campaign was bringing in outofstate nonresidents to participate in the caucus in the final days of the iowa campaign both dean and gephardt faded and ultimately finished third and fourth respectively gephardt ended his presidential campaign after that disappointing result after he dropped out of the presidential race gephardt was mentioned as a possible running mate for john kerry on march   new mexico governor bill richardson seen as a strong possibility for the position himself endorsed gephardt for the vice presidency i think hes the best candidate richardson said of gephardt in an interview with the associated press theres a good regional balance with kerry and gephardt kerry announced on july   that he had chosen john edwards as his running mate on the same day the new york post published an incorrect headline stating that gephardt had become kerrys running mate shortly after this false story broke the headline was compared to the  dewey defeats truman front page of the chicago tribune which incorrectly reported the presidential election results of that year in  it was revealed in the book no excuses concessions of a serial campaigner by bob shrum who served as kerrys campaign

japan gephardt won the iowa caucuses and south dakota primary in february while finishing a strong second in new hampshire which made him one of the serious contenders for the nomination his campaign ran out of money after losing badly in the march super tuesday primaries when he won only the missouri primary an ad aired by the campaign of governor michael dukakis focused on gephardts flipflopping voting record and showed a gephardt lookalike doing forward and backward flips for the camera many felt that the ad killed any chance gephardt had of winning the nomination gephardt dropped out after winning only  in michigan despite support from the united auto workers dukakis considered gephardt for his running mate but chose texas senator lloyd bentsen house leadershipedit portrait of gephardt from the  congressional pictorial directory in part due to the visibility gained from his  presidential bid gephardt was elected majority leader by his house colleagues in june  making him the secondranking democrat in the house behind thenspeaker tom foley gephardt served in that position until january  after foley was unseated in the republican landslide of  that gave the republicans a seat majority gephardt became the leader of the house democrats as minority leader initially opposite newt gingrich and then from  onwards dennis hastert when gingrich faced a coup within his own party in  there was a possibility of gephardt becoming speaker if there had been a floor vote and he could gain the support of republican congressman dissatisfied with gingrich however gingrich refused to resign and no vote occurred in the   and  elections gephardt led the democrats to gains in the house although they did not retake the majority until  after gephardt had left congress gephardt was considered a keen politician who worked hard at passing legislation defending traditional democratic principles and for his home district in st louis he became a prolific financial supporter of democrats around the country in the early s when he assembled a team of top fundraising staff who helped him support hundreds of candidates for local and federal office although gephardt worked hard for many of president bill clintons programs he and his union supporters strongly opposed nafta and other free trade programs so clinton required republican support to pass these initiatives during the impeachment proceedings of president clinton gephardt led a walkout in the house after a censure motion was ruled irrelevant to the impeachment debate gephardt speaking at a vigil for matthew shepard in  in  vice president al gore named gephardt to his short list of possible vice presidential candidates the other names on the short list were thenindiana senator evan bayh

the  congressional midterm elections gephardt campaigned on the issues of the economy and social security however the continuing resonance of the september  attacks the momentum for military action against iraq and president george w bushs popularity lead to republican gains with the democrats losing four house seats harold ford of tennessee described the results an absolute blowout and called upon gephardt to step down saying that it was time for new ideas and new faces due to his previous success it has been said that gephardt would have been easily returned as minority leader if he decided to stay on but gephardt did not run for reelection as house minority leader stepping down in january  his leadership position was contested by the centrist martin frost the outgoing democratic caucus chair and the liberal nancy pelosi the minority whip who was elected as gephardts successor no longer having congressional leadership duties freed up gephardt to concentrate on a  presidential bid  campaign for presidentedit gephardt announced his second run for president on january   his successor as minority leader nancy pelosi endorsed his bid for president his campaign was notable for the highprofile coming out of his daughter chrissy in people magazine when she was helping him on the campaign trail a subject they also discussed in interviews for the  documentary film for the bible tells me so he has continued to be an outspoken advocate for gay rights since the campaign though still opposes samesex marriage although republicans considered him a formidable candidate gephardt was seen by many as too old fashioned and unelectable his fundraising efforts were behind that of former vermont governor howard dean and senators john kerry and john edwards and tied with joe lieberman
