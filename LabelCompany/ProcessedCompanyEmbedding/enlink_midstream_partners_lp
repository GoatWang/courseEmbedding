the partnership signed a definitive agreement to acquire coronado midstream holdings llc “coronado” which owns natural gas gathering and processing facilities in the permian basin for approximately  million subject to certain adjustments coronado operates three cryogenic gas processing plants and a gas gathering system in the north midland basin including approximately  miles of gathering pipelines  million cubic feet per day mmcfd of processing capacity and  horsepower of compression construction of an additional  mmcfd of processing capacity and gathering system expansions of the coronado system are currently underway coronados key assets have been constructed within the past five years and the system has current inlet volumes of approximately  mmcfd enlink plans to connect the coronado system with its bearkat system to create a multicounty rich gas gathering and processing system to create optimization opportunities for its customers and its product marketing services the owners of coronado will receive  million in cash  million of partnership common units and  million of a new class of partnership common units subject to certain adjustments the partnership will be able to pay distributions on the new class of partnership common units in cash or in additional common units of such new class at the partnership’s election the new class of partnership common units will be entitled to receive distributions equal to those paid on the partnership common units currently outstanding after five quarters of distributions have been paid following the closing of the transaction or earlier at the partnership’s election the new class of common units will convert into the same class of common units that are currently outstanding the coronado system is underpinned by longterm contracts which include the dedication of production from over  acres coronado’s key producer customers include reliance energy inc reliance diamondback energy inc diamondback and rsp permian inc rsp permian reliance is currently the largest owner of coronado with affiliates of both diamondback and rsp permian owning the remainder of coronado “this transaction builds on enlink’s growing midstream platform in west texas” said barry e davis  enlink president and chief executive officer “the coronado assets are located in the core of the north midland basin and are supported by the region’s most focused and active producers by combining coronado with our recent lpc acquisition and our existing footprint we have the opportunity to create tremendous value for our producer customers by linking our gas gathering processing and crude oil logistics operations to provide a fullservice midstream solution” “in just over four months we have announced approximately  billion of acquisitions which is consistent with our growth strategy to expand our platform in key producing areas” davis said “enlink is a strong vehicle for sustainable growth due in large part to our current financial position which allows us to effectively expand in times like these” economics in the north midland basin are among the most favorable of all oilproducing regions in the united states the region has seen a rapid transition to horizontal drilling with producers targeting the lower spraberry wolfcamp b and wolfcamp d zones among other prospective intervals recent well results from coronado’s producer customers as well as other producers indicate outstanding resource potential in the area “we have assembled a strong acreage position in the north midland basin that will continue to serve as a key driver of production growth for many years” said travis d stice  chief executive officer of diamondback and viper energy partners “we are excited about the development potential for multiple horizontal targets within the area that has and will continue to serve the coronado system in the future we have been involved with coronado since its formation and grown together as business partners we look forward to working together with its new owners to support each other’s growth aspirations” “reliance has been focused on expanding and derisking its acreage around the coronado system since ” said gary d mckinney  president of reliance “we believe we are located in some of the best areas of the midland basin and we’re excited about our recent horizontal well results in the region” “rsp permian has built a premier acreage position in the northern midland basin that will continue to serve as a cornerstone to our strong production growth and attractive rates of return” said steve gray  chief executive officer of rsp permian “we have relied on coronado throughout our development and look forward to working with its new owners in the future” enlink expects the acquisition of coronado to be neutral to distributable cash flow per unit at both the partnership and the general partner in the nearterm given the current market environment and taking into consideration the producers’ current drilling plans over the next few years enlink expects increased activity around coronado’s system will generate significant accretion in distributable cash flow per unit enlink expects its total investment will be approximately seven to eight times coronado’s adjusted ebitda with the timing dependent on the recovery of commodity prices and an increase in producer activity taking into consideration expected additional capital investments of  million to  million this does not include synergies with enlink’s existing permian assets and the potential for expansion of the combined systems by securing new customers or additional dedicated acreage about the enlink midstream companies enlink midstream is a leading midstream provider formed through the

midstream operating lp the operating partnership and enlink oklahoma gas processing lp enlink oklahoma toenlink oklahoma to is sometimes used herein to refer to enlink oklahoma gas processing lp itself or enlink oklahoma gas processing lp together with its consolidated subsidiaries overview we are a delaware limited partnership formed on july   we primarily focus on providing midstream energy services including gathering processing transmission fractionation storage condensate stabilization brine services and marketing to producers of natural gas ngls crude oil and condensate our midstream energy asset network includes approximately  miles of pipelines  natural gas processing plants  fractionators barge and rail terminals product storage facilities purchasing and marketing capabilities brine disposal wells a crude oil trucking fleet and equity investments in certain private midstream companies we manage and report our activities primarily according to the nature of activity and geography we have five reportable segments which include the � texas segment the texas segment includes our natural gas gathering processing and transmission activities in north texas and the permian basin in west texas � oklahoma segment the oklahoma segment includes our natural gas gathering processing and transmission activities in canawoodford arkomawoodford northern oklahoma woodford sooner trend anadarko basin canadian and kingfisher counties stack south central oklahoma oil province scoop and central northern oklahoma woodford cnow shale areas � louisiana segment the louisiana segment includes our natural gas pipelines natural gas processing plants storage facilities and ngl assets located in louisiana � crude and condensate segment the crude and condensate segment includes our ohio river valley orv crude oil condensate and brine disposal activities in the utica and marcellus shales our condensate stabilization and natural gas compression stations in the utica and marcellus shales our crude oil operations in the permian basin and our crude oil activities associated with the victoria express pipeline and related truck terminal and storage assets vex located in the eagle ford shale and � corporate segment the corporate segment includes our unconsolidated affiliate investments in howard energy partners hep our ownership in the cedar cove jv in oklahoma and our contractual right to the economic burdens and benefits associated with devons ownership interest in gcf in south texas and our general partnership property and expenses table of contents we manage our operations by focusing on gross operating margin because our business is generally to gather process transport or market natural gas ngls crude oil and condensate using our assets for a fee we earn our fees through various contractual arrangements which include stated fixedfee contract arrangements or arrangements where we purchase and resell commodities in connection with providing the related service and earn a net margin as our fee while our transactions vary in form the essential element of each transaction is the use of our assets to transport a product or provide a processed product to an enduser at the tailgate of the plant barge terminal or pipeline we define gross operating margin as operating revenue minus cost of sales gross operating margin is a nongaap financial measure and is explained in greater detail under nongaap financial measures below approximately  of our gross operating margin was derived from feebased services with no direct commodity exposure for the year ended december   we reflect revenue as product sales and midstream services on the consolidated statements of operations our gross operating margins are determined primarily by the volumes of � natural gas gathered transported purchased and sold through our pipeline systems � natural gas processed at our processing facilities � ngls handled at our fractionation facilities � crude oil and condensate handled at our crude terminals � crude oil and condensate gathered transported purchased and sold � brine disposed and � condensate stabilized we generate revenues from eight primary sources � gathering and transporting natural gas and ngls on the pipeline systems we own � processing natural gas at our processing plants � fractionating and marketing recovered ngls � providing compression services � providing crude oil and condensate gathering transportation and terminal services � providing condensate stabilization services � providing brine disposal services and � providing gas crude and ngl storage we typically gather or transport gas owned by others through our facilities for a fee we also buy natural gas from producers plants or shippers at either a fixed discount to a market index or a percentage of the market index and then transport and resell the natural gas at the same market index the fixed discount difference to a market index represents the fee for using our assets we attempt to execute substantially all purchases and sales concurrently or we enter into a future delivery obligation thereby establishing the basis for the fee we will receive for each natural gas transaction our gathering and transportation fee related to a percentage of the index price can be adversely affected by declines in the price of natural gas we are also party to certain longterm gas sales commitments that we satisfy through supplies purchased under longterm gas purchase agreements when we enter into those arrangements our sales obligations generally match our purchase obligations however over time the supplies that we have under contract may decline due to reduced drilling or other causes and we may be required to satisfy the sales obligations by buying additional gas at prices that may exceed the prices received under the sales commitments in our purchasesale transactions the resale price is generally based on the same index at which the gas was purchased on occasion we have entered into certain purchasesale transactions in which the purchase price is based on a productionarea index and the sales price is based on a marketarea index and we capture the difference in the indices also referred to as basis spread less the transportation expenses from the two areas as our fee changes in the basis spread can increase or decrease our margins or potentially result in losses for example we are a party to one contract associated with our north texas operations with a term to  to supply approximately  mmbtud of gas we buy gas for this contract on several different productionarea indices and sell the gas into a different market area index we realize a cash loss on the delivery of gas under this contract each month based on current prices the fair value of this performance obligation was recorded based on forecasted discounted cash obligations in excess of market prices under this gas delivery contract as of december   the balance sheet reflects a liability of  million related table of contents to this performance obligation narrower basis spreads in recent periods have increased the losses on this contract and greater losses on this contract could occur in future periods if these conditions persist or become worse we typically transport and fractionate or store ngls owned by others for a fee based on the volume of ngls transported and fractionated or stored we also buy mixed ngls from our suppliers at a fixed discount to market indices for the component ngls with a deduction for our fractionation fee we subsequently sell the fractionated ngl products based on the same indexbased prices the operating results of our ngl fractionation business are dependent upon the volume of mixed ngls fractionated and the level of fractionation fees charged with our fractionation business we also have the opportunity for product upgrades for each of the discrete ngl products the fees we earn on the product upgrade from this fractionation business are higher during periods with higher liquids prices we typically gather or transport crude oil and condensate owned by others by rail truck pipeline and barge facilities for a fee we also buy crude oil and condensate from a producer at a fixed discount to a market index and then transport and resell the crude oil and condensate at the same market index we execute substantially all purchases and sales concurrently thereby establishing the fee we will receive for each crude oil and condensate transaction we realize gross operating margins from our processing services primarily through different contractual arrangements processing margins margin percentage of liquids pol percentage of proceeds pop or fixedfee based under margin contract arrangements our gross operating margins are higher during periods of high liquid prices relative to natural gas prices gross operating margin results under pol contracts are impacted only by the value of the liquids produced with margins higher during periods of higher liquids prices gross operating margin results under pop contracts are impacted only by the value of the natural gas and liquids produced with margins higher during periods of higher natural gas and liquids prices under fixedfee based contracts our gross operating margins are driven by throughput volume see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskcommodity price risk operating expenses are costs directly associated with the operations of a particular asset among the most significant of these costs are those associated with direct labor and supervision property insurance property taxes repair and maintenance expenses contract services and utilities these costs are normally fairly stable across broad volume ranges and therefore do not normally increase or decrease significantly in the short term with increases or decreases in the volume of gas liquids crude oil and condensate moved through or by the asset our general and administrative expenses are dictated by the terms of our partnership agreement these expenses include the costs of employee officer and director compensation and benefits properly allocable to us fees services and other transaction costs related to acquisitions and all other expenses necessary or appropriate to the conduct of business and
