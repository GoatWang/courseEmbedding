and create a diversified professionallymanaged portfolio of commercial real estate assets reits are legally required to pay  percent of taxable income as dividends and therefore have the potential to provide attractive streams of income  the united states congress created reits in  to make investments in large scale income producing real estate accessible to smaller investors investors in a professionally managed reit may benefit from greater diversification through a portfolio of properties rather than a single building and the benefits from an experienced real estate investment team how nontraded reits work potential benefits of investing in commercial real estate through nontraded reits given the historic uncertainty of the financial markets we believe adding an investment in commercial real estate to a traditional investment portfolio may provide investors with a number of potential benefits including capital preservation reduced portfolio volatility increase portfolio diversification provide an alternative source of cash flow lower portfolio risk through reducing the correlation across major asset classes help hedge against potential inflation an investment in commercial real estate through nontraded reits does not guarantee that the benefits described above will be realized we set the offering price of our shares arbitrarily this price is unrelated to the net book value of our assets or to our expected operating income if we raise substantially less than the maximum offering we may not be able to acquire a diverse portfolio of investments and the value of your shares may vary more widely with the performance of specific assets investing in nontraded reits includes various risks including but not limited to unfavorable market conditions loss of
