source morningstar® the style box reveals a funds investment style for credit quality of the bonds owned morningstar combines credit rating information provided by the fund companies only using ratings assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  nrsro with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration average effective duration

investors and institutional investors join the community here wwwfamilyofficeinsightscom tell us about your background and your company asymmetry capital management lp scott kay founder and chief investment officer of asymmetry capital management i started my career in the pharmaceutical industry at pfizer where i held various positions over my year tenure and was involved in the launches of some of their largest selling pharmaceutical products then following my passion for investing i moved into a research analyst position for bank of america securities bofa where i eventually became an ii ranked senior global pharmaceutical analyst after bofa i joined andor capital management a multibillion dollar hedge fund as a vp research analyst in  i became a founding partner of partner fund management pfm an equity longshort hedge fund where i founded along with two others the pfm healthcare fund in the second half of  i left pfm to launch asymmetry i have always had an interest and passion for investing and being an entrepreneur but coming from a pharmaceutical background my route managing a fund has been quite different than most i grew up in an entrepreneurial family and always had a desire to run my own business and the combination of my background in healthcare being an analyst and then helping to build a successful and large healthcare fund has served me well as we have grown asymmetry my experiences have fostered what i believe is a unique approach to healthcare investing and portfolio management we have an investment philosophy and process steeped in fundamental deep dive analysis and we employ proprietary tools for portfolio and risk management that have been successful in protecting investor capital we take very seriously our fiduciary responsibility to our partnersinvestors and seek to minimize losses while still achieving attractive returns that is the guiding philosophy behind asymmetry capital management  chris zellner founder chief operating officer and chief compliance officer of asymmetry capital management when scott and i met he was looking for someone to run the business side of asymmetry he had seen other cios build successful firms only to find that they were spending a considerable amount of time running the business and not focused on investing he wanted a business partner that could manage all the various operational financial regulatory and irbusiness development aspects of the fund while he focused on doing what he does best investing long and short in healthcare with over  years of diversified wall street experiences including positions in investment banking equity capital markets and prime brokerage at leading firms such as the new york stock exchange morgan stanley lehman brothers and merrill lynch i had built a wellrounded career that seamlessly fit into the role of chief operating officer at asymmetry but no one person can do everything and we have assembled a very capable business team that includes a cfo and a vp of operations with this team and a group of globally recognized service providers asymmetry has always had an institutional caliber business organization asymmetry capital management which manages the asymmetry global healthcare funds was founded in  we launched the funds in  asymmetry is designed to deliver attractive riskadjusted returns to investors by constructing a diversified global portfolio of equity longshort healthcare securities the fund invests across all healthcare sectors including therapeutics branded pharmaceuticals specialty pharmaceuticals biotechnology and generics medical devices labs diagnostics healthcare it insurers and healthcare services to name a few we are valuationoriented longterm investors we seek investments where our view of a company’s value differs significantly from the current market price and where we can identify catalysts that should close the gap to do this we employ a rigorous deepdive fundamental research process which we apply equally to both long and short positions individual stock selection operates within a framework of equally rigorous and disciplined portfolio and risk management to protect capital and deliver attractive longterm risk adjusted returns what is your target investment asymmetry allocates capital opportunistically across all healthcare subsectors based on the fundamental analysis of data to identify longterm valueoriented long and short investments within the following investment framework • asymmetric opportunities assess the probability and magnitude of a gain and determine whether or not it is significantly greater than the possibility of a loss • liquidity we seek stocks that have minimum average dollar traded per day to avoid getting “trapped” in a position during volatile market environments or a meaningful change in the fundamental outlook • access to management regardless of our position long or short we require a dialogue with the c suite not just investor relations • sector diversification while we allocate capital to our “best picks” we are committed to maintaining a diversified portfolio across healthcare subsectors we believe there are opportunities longshort in all sectors and that diversification is important from a risk management perspective our investable universe is made up of approximately  global listed healthcare companies applying the liquidity and management access filter narrows the universe to  companies asymmetry’s portfolio is typically comprised of  –  individual positions  –  long –  short our target investments are companies where there is a significant divergence between our view of fundamental value and the current market price andor consensus view to do this we employ a disciplined and structured investment process that we abbreviate csme calls surveys model and expectations c  s calls  surveys represents the foundation of our deepdive research and includes meeting with companies attending medical conferences speaking with competitors suppliers key opinion leaders regulatory and legal experts ip attorneys etc surveys help us cast a wider net to gain quantitative and qualitative data to support our modeling and identify trends and themes m models all our models are proprietary and based on  year discounted cash flows dcf they are very detailed tailored to each specific company and include revenue drivers pl balance sheet valuation and a multiscenario outcomes analysis our models represent what we know about the company and are the basis for our price targets e expectations this represents an analysis that is completely separate from our fundamental work here we are examining the nonfundamental elements that impact stock price movements the questions we seek to answer include what does the stock price tell us what is the consensus view what is view of those that disagree with us why what are some of the challenges you face in this market as datadriven fundamental investors we believe that stock prices over the medium to longterm must rise or fall based on a company’s operating performance markets go through various cycles and when we are in a period where underlying fundamentals are less of a factor in stock prices that can be challenging the market environment over the past two years has been heavily influenced by macro factors and the flow of funds into and out of different market sectors we have had to adjust some aspects of our investment process while keeping to our core capabilities to adapt to this environment one of the eternal challenges of successful investing is to balance portfolio risk management capital preservation while still maintaining confidence and patience to stick to one’s convictions when market sentiment and performance is against you how are you different from your key competitors a critical difference between asymmetry and most other equity longshort funds is our expertise in short selling these are investments where we expect the company’s share price to go down we fundamentally short individual companies vs using etfs which is what many fund manager’s do our short positions are not hedges we expect our shorts to produce positive returns the same as our long positions and we apply the same fundamental deepdive investment process to every position in the portfolio another difference is our commitment to portfolio diversification and liquidity we believe there are attractive opportunities longshort across all healthcare subsectors many healthcare funds either by mandate or cio bias focus on a specific subsector or related subsectors asymmetry typically has    of its portfolio in therapeutic companies branded pharmaceuticals specialty pharmaceuticals generics and biotech with the other    in nontherapeutic companies medical technology diagnostics healthcare services labs tools payers etc portfolio liquidity is critical for our process healthcare can be volatile and our theses can change quickly separately when market conditions are unfavorable we want to be able to adjust position sizes as well as portfolio grossnet exposure quickly with minimal market impact this is an important aspect to capital preservation finally we believe that the asymmetry investment process and company culture is another differentiator the investment process is structured rigorous and repeatable it is designed to uncover valuation dispersion – before it’s recognized by others – through the objective analysis of data given that our top ten positions frequently represent over  of our portfolio we need to build conviction in these positions and our process is designed to do just that we have a passion for what we do and get pleasure from being ahead of the curve and finding things that other people aren’t seeing culturally we believe that better investment and business decisions arise from multiple inputs and divergent viewpoints we have continuous discussions and debates to test and retest our investment thesis for current and prospective positions and investment ideas we have a talented team of collaborative and goaloriented individuals who love what they do and enjoy working together this type of positive and encouraging environment is hard to find we are lucky to have great synergy in our professional home the funds’ name is asymmetry global healthcare and you previously discussed asymmetric opportunities can you be more specific about what is an asymmetric opportunity an asymmetric opportunity is characterized by a positive return probability that is significantly greater than the risk of loss a simple long example might be a pharmaceutical company trading at share with share of cash on the balance sheet and with our dcf discounted cash flow valuation at share the concept is applied equally to long and short positions as a general guideline we typically target a minimum riskreward of  to  for long positions and  to  on our shorts who is your ideal investor how much capital are you looking to raise our current investors include high net worth individuals single and multifamily offices and institutions what they have in common is an interest for some an excitement in healthcare investing our investors generally have interest in working with a manager who enjoys doing the deepdive fundamental work that plays out in the longterm healthcare is a large dynamic sector where individual companies have historically displayed a lot of performance dispersion that means winners and losers it is a sector where persistent valuation inefficiencies are driven by complexity and rapid change where specialized investment teams able to navigate complex scientific technological and regulatory environments can identify and capture these valuation differences we like to work with people who understand what we do and have developed the same level of conviction in our team as we have in our top positions our investors are interested in the healthcare sector and its prospective returns but recognize that it can be a volatile they choose to partner with us because we seek to maximize riskadjusted returns while also protecting capital everyone on the asymmetry team that is able to invest in the fund is invested in the fund our limited partners are coinvesting alongside of us the current aum of the firm is mm and our capacity is between mm our intention is to keep our aum below bn as we believe that with an aum greater than bn it would be difficult to achieve our annual return target we plan to soft close the fund at m and then will grow organically until we get to mm what is your mission a passion and love for healthcare is at the core of our mission there’s a societal overlay about supporting good companies with innovative products that are changing the world and saving lives – and conversely voting against companies with underwhelming products or poor management teams by shorting stocks we believe in supporting solid companies with operating profits that we believe will be greater than consensus expectations and forecasting against poorly run companies with products that do not add value are overly promotional or obsolescent essentially we aim to deploy capital in an ethical way we have a dynamic team and investment process in place our mission is to grow the fund and produce attractive riskadjusted returns for our partners investors and for ourselves we enjoy working with people we like doing what we are passionate about and expect to generate outsized returns for our stakeholders and asymmetry what’s next for you both scott and i have worked for big and small companies over our careers we are very happy with the team we have built and would be happy to manage and grow asymmetry for at least the next ten years we love being in this environment with our team and investors over the next couple years we could look to add another healthcare fund or two that expresses unique strategies from our core fund

reserved  legal disclaimer about us ​ asymmetry capital management lp is a san franciscobased alternative asset management firm founded in  by scott kay a year veteran of healthcare investing we utilize a datadriven primary research process to identify and invest in outofconsensus healthcare companies that we believe have both asymmetric return profiles and nearterm valuation catalysts our differentiated investment process and focus on fundamental shorts seek to produce a return stream for investors that is both unique and repeatable over the long term asymmetry seeks to deliver high riskadjusted returns low correlations to both broad market and healthcare indices and lower volatility a letter from our founder ​ when i decided to launch asymmetry it was the culmination of a dream that brought me full circle to a family history of entrepreneurship and healthcare my grandfather owned pharmacies in brooklyn ny and my parents were entrepreneurs my grandfather wasn’t alive to see me accept my first job at pfizer a pharmaceutical company but he would have been proud to know i had continued in the sector to which he dedicated his life having grown up watching my father and grandfather invest in the stock market i developed a passion for investing alongside theirs this ultimately led me to wall street as a healthcare analyst i was fortunate to be able to integrate the two interests that have been a driving force in my life healthcare and investing   i have always been competitive and drawn to complex problem solving healthcare investing allows me to exercise both of these traits i wake up every day thankful i am able to do what i love on behalf of our investors partners and the team we have assembled at asymmetry   healthcare is unique among the sectors compromising the global economy what other sector offers the opportunity to advance peoples wellbeing and happiness fulfills a basic human need comprises so many diverse subsectors and encompasses so much complexity many of the businesses we invest in save lives and make products that enhance daytoday living businesses that do not fulfill their promises to patients customers and shareholders are firms we bet against   the success of asymmetry rests on our ability to deliver for our partners and investors attractive investment returns over the longterm while effectively managing risk investment success is not easily measured monthtomonth or even yeartoyear as we operate in a dynamic and volatile industry recognizing that different views on valuation inevitability become reconciled over a longer horizon and that in the shortterm market pricing is often inefficient led me to develop asymmetry’s founding investment principals and philosophy   a structured rigorous and iterative process provides both a strong foundation upon which to build and a guiding light from which to navigate forward   company fundamentals must over time drive asset valuations   portfolio diversification can both enhance returns and mitigate risk   portfolio liquidity offers both a margin of safety if an exit strategy is necessary as well as the opportunity to capitalize on positive fundamental developments   just like a successful athlete investing success is about doing the work there are no short cuts it is a constant process and it can be grueling but i have found few other things as satisfying as identifying an idea validating it through one’s own efforts and then being objectively rewarded when others recognize the value of what you uncovered   we have built an institutional asset management business that reflects the entrepreneurship pride of ownership and high standard we hold as the sacred responsibility entrusted to us by our partners and investors the concept of fiduciary responsibility is one we have always taken seriously and is an overarching principal in how we manage our business and investments this is what guides us as a steward of our

partners and investors attractive investment returns over the longterm while effectively managing risk investment success is not easily measured monthtomonth or even yeartoyear as we operate in a dynamic and volatile industry recognizing that different views on valuation inevitability become reconciled over a longer horizon and that in the shortterm market pricing is often inefficient led me to develop asymmetry’s founding investment principals and philosophy a structured rigorous and iterative process provides both a strong foundation upon which to build and a guiding light from which to navigate forward company fundamentals must over time drive asset valuations portfolio diversification can both enhance returns and mitigate risk portfolio liquidity offers both a margin of safety if an exit strategy is necessary as well as the opportunity to capitalize on positive fundamental developments just like a successful athlete investing success is about doing the work there are no short cuts it is a constant process and it can be grueling but i have found few other things as satisfying as identifying an idea validating it through one’s own efforts and then being objectively rewarded when others recognize the value of what you uncovered we have built an institutional asset management business that reflects the entrepreneurship pride of ownership and high standard we hold as the sacred responsibility entrusted to us by our partners and investors the concept of fiduciary responsibility is one we have always taken seriously and is an overarching principal in how we manage our business and investments this is what guides us as a steward of our clients’ capital thank you for your continued partnership and trust respectfully     scott c kaycio and founder  microsoft
