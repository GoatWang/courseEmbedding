inglis cfo of ford motor company published april   fox news facebook twitter email print this is a partial transcript from your world with neil cavuto april   click here for complete access to all of neil cavutos ceo interviews  neil cavuto host no departure from the usual these days at ford f the company reporting its fourth straight quarterly loss today  million excluding a huge restructuring charge as you know the company unveiled a major turnaround plan at the beginning of the year but will it do it any good joining me now is martin inglis he is the chief financial officer at ford motor company mr inglis thanks for joining us martin inglis cfo ford motor thank you cavuto all right i know you are trying to go forward and say things are going to start picking up but there are a lot of people wondering especially when they a look at your stock over the last year or so whether you can pick these pieces up can you inglis well it is hard to say when you say you made a sixcent loss that you are satisfied but it was ahead of the analyst expectations but very importantly underpinning our firstquarter results with some really excellent movement on our revitalization plans our new models are launching very well new expedition navigator town car the quality is getting better and we are starting to address the cost so i think it was a good start to the year cavuto well what is wrong i think we have a stock chart here otherwise make me a liar but i think what your stock has just been tumbling the mirror opposite at gm have you just been usurped inglis well we looked at the overall issues that we had and that is why we needed a very substantial revitalization plan it takes until middecade before we get back to the results that we think are appropriate for ford motor company and is being reflected in the stock at the moment cavuto so middecade being what another couple of years off at least before things start moving inglis thats correct that is correct but we cavuto i dont know if investors are going to be that patient what do you think inglis well we are moving in the right direction and i think results will be what investors are interested in rather than promises for the future and we are starting to show results already and our products are looking very very good and we will concentrate on execution and well let the stock price take care of itself cavuto all right now sir i would be remiss if i didnt mention this news that — and this i am sure wasnt exclusively your doing — but that ford has gone ahead and paid your former chief executive jacques nasser a  million in salary stock options other compensation for last year the guy botched it right and he gets an  goodbye present it seems weird doesnt it inglis well i think for the shareholder out there they should have a look at the fact that we and ford have committed to a  billion reduction in costs outside of the product arena this year cavuto but you did not reduce his costs inglis we are going to bring our costs through the bottom line as i say and meet the results that are necessary for the company to be successful cavuto but sir you know you did not reduce his costs youre still paying him and he got fired so a lot of workers who are going to realize that things are going to start being downsized but quick they are looking at that and saying something is not right inglis we need to focus our attention on what we can do moving forward rather than looking over our shoulder at the past and that is what we are going to do cavuto all right so you do not have any regrets or think it is weird this whole nasser payment or no inglis i think we need to deliver results for ford some great products some great quality and some great investor results and then everything else will become insignificant cavuto all right mr inglis thank you very much inglis thank you very much cavuto martin inglis the ford motor cfo content and programming copyright  fox news network inc all rights
