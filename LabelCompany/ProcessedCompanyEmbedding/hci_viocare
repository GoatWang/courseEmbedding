otcmktsvica is a penny play that has grabbed hold of the attention of traders during the stock’s recent bounce while we continue to see price action that connotes heavyduty supply embedded in the tape the sharp rise in average daily volume over the past few weeks is reason enough to look a bit deeper the company’s most recent release reports that its wholly owned subsidiary hci viocare technologies the company behind “the revolutionary sensing technology flexisense” has begun to ship its fourthgeneration “athletic smart” insoles to its potential wouldbe partner manufacturers in the athletic shoe sector that release has sparked an asyet unsuccessful attempt at a socalled “jailbreak” bounce move off the lows however given the small float involved here another sharp jump in volume might alter the pattern significantly hci viocare otcmktsvica trumpets itself as a company that has a dual complementary business model of  creating the first crossborder independent chain of prosthetics  orthotics po and diabetic foot clinics in europe and the middle east and  developing a wide portfolio of proprietary hardware solutions with first in line the flexisense sensor system aiming to empower the user by providing ondemand information in the fields of digital health prosthetics orthotics diabetes assistive devices sports and wellbeing and licensing to established industry

above the company has started to ship its new th generation smart insole product which is a networkenabled iot technologically enhanced athletic shoe component this in itself is intriguing according to the company’s recent release “the th generation smart insole is the closest to commercialready product due to its significantly higher level of durability and resolution as well as its improved communication and connectivity capabilities” the new version embeds the additional feature of temperature monitoring the key point here is this “the flexisense enabled insole” is really an “internet of things” product line and apparently maintains its uniqueness of measuring direct and shear forces in use dr christos kapatos hci viocare’s cofounder and cto stated “we are very happy today i am proud for our th generation smart insole which is as close to a commercialready product as it can get from our side in the next days the samples will be delivered to the major sports manufacturers we are in discussions with and we are positive that they will see the insoles for what they are the future of sports wearable performance measuring devices” dr kapatos added “i expect this version to even attract the direct interest of major athletic associations” traders will note  added to share values of the name over the past month of action but this action is running counter to the larger bearish trend in the name that said as noted above average volume has been mounting sharply with transaction levels soaring more than  beyond the stock’s month average this is particularly important given the stock’s tight float of just m shares one is wise to respect the dynamic this may create — a jump in average daily transaction volume in a stock with a restricted float can unleash fireworks
