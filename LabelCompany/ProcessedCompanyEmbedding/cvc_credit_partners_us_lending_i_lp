don’t need perfect credit and you can explore all your options at once rather than bouncing from lender to lender” “even financial is a unique online matching service that educates and helps consumers searching for personal loans it systematically matches borrowers with lenders in order to keep the borrowers costs and the lenders defaults low” “guardian debt relief has an excellent reputation although they have not yet reached accreditation status by the bbb they are certified by the afcc and the iadpa  the company’s debt negotiation program is a positive alternative to bankruptcy” “personalloanscom is a good choice if you are willing to work with some of the riskier and higher priced lenders many of these loans should be considered as temporary loans to get you back on your feet” what is debt consolidation the process of combing various unsecured debts – credit cards payday loans personal loans medical bills etc into a single bill is known as debt consolidation so rather than paying off  creditors individually each month you combine all the bills into a single payment and only write a single check this simplifies your life and helps avoid payment errors that can result in bounced check fess and late payment penalties the three most popular forms of  debt consolidation are  debt consolidation loans debt management plans  debt settlement programs none of these options will provide you with a quick fix however they are designed for your benefit as longterm debt reduction strategies debt consolidation should bring reduced interest rates and monthly payments and long term credit score improvement other forms of debt consolidation there are a number of methods to consolidate debt if your credit is strong and you have less than  of debt it may make more sense to apply for a  interest credit card and apply balance transfers from your high interest credit cards another alternative is to consider a personal loan for paying off your balances your can also choose to use your home as collateral through a home equity line of credit or refinance your current mortgage borrowing against your retirement savings or life insurance policies is also an available option these are generally less expensive options but carry greater risk because your collateral is at risk in the event of nonpayment what is a debt consolidation loan a debt consolidation loan is new loan that allows you to payoff your existing loans and make a single payment to one creditor  a debt consolidation loan usually has a fixed rate of interest lower than your current interest rate and helps decrease your monthly payments  what is a debt management plan a lot of financial experts prefer a debt management plan and the majority of recommended debt management plans are organized by nonprofit businesses they start with a credit analysis session in order to help decide the amount of money you are able to pay creditors every month the nonprofit organization can assist you in getting a cheaper rate of interest from creditors and lower or even waive late fee charges so you can comfortably pay off your monthly bills you would send a single payment to the debt management agency the agency systematically divides the payment among your lenders a debt management program will not work if you can’t keep up with your monthly payments all it takes is one missed payment and your creditors can remove you from the program this eliminates any benefits you’ve been granted and you can end up in the same or worse position from where you started  it is important to remember that making use of a debt management plan will initially have a negative affect on your credit score the goal is to pay off your debts in years at a discount and end up debt free ultimately improving your score what is a debt settlement program a debt settlement program will negatively impact your credit score but not nearly as bad as filing for bankruptcy it is a cost effective way to resolve your debts professional negotiators attempt to settle your debts with your creditors and then create a payback of  to  years in order to enter a debt settlement program your accounts must already be  to  months delinquent  what is bill consolidation the process of eliminating debt by bundling all your bill payments and reimbursing them with a single loan is referred to as bill consolidation with this method you only make one payment each month which is a good idea if you have six or perhaps even ten individual payments to make for utilities credit cards phone service etc if you combine all the bills into one amalgamated sum the consolidated payment should have a reduced monthly payment and a lower interest rate any savings you have could best be used for starting a backup fund to help avoid any possibility of a future financial crunch consolidating credit card debt on your own if your credit score is good  or higher then the ideal way you can consolidate your credit card loan is by applying for a zeropercent interest balance transfer credit card the zeropercent interest is a preliminary rate that typically lasts for around  to  months every payment made in that period will go straight toward decreasing your balance when the preliminary rate concludes interest rates rise to around  to  percent on the leftover balance be careful because balance transfer cards usually demand a transfer fee typically  and some even charge a yearly fees another means to consolidate your credit card balance on your own is by going cold turkey  stop using credit cards and paying with cash or debit cards as an alternative after you have fully paid off your debts you can then pick one credit card and be extra careful with its use how to consolidate your bills bills and debt consolidation require persistence patience and some form of management skills you should begin by collecting all your dues from things such as utilities credit cards medical and cell phone services add the aggregate sum you owe on the unsecured loan and then decide how much you can really manage to pay for each month while still being able to pay your basics like food transportation and rent when you have a number in front of you choose whether a debt management plan a personal loan or a debt settlement plan will give you the maximum chance to get rid of your debt realize that this procedure usually takes around  to  years and there are no quickfixes and no shortcuts   charlie debt consolidation expert “we put this comparison together to get you on the road to financial freedom
