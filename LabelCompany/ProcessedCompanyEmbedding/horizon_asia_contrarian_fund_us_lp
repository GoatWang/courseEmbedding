the contrarian call yen nee lee thursday  mar    pm etcnbccom shares getty images investors around the world are predicting a number of calamitous downturns for chinas economy but a team of experts from morgan stanley are making the opposite call asias largest economy will manage to avoid a financial shock and it will continue to present significant investment opportunities for global investors the analysts forecast that china will overcome recent macroeconomic challenges and the prospect of a financial shock to transition into a high income economy by  that will see the countrys per capita incomes reaching  from the current  they say this is despite of their projection that chinas growth could slow to an average of  percent in  the analysts say that rate of growth will sufficiently support chinas transition towards a high income economy that development will allow the msci china to continue to outperform the broader msci emerging markets index msci china has outperformed msci emerging markets by  percent per annum in the last  years the morgan stanley analysts note in a page report msci china has also outperformed the sp  by a far greater amount over this long time horizon though the outperformance has paused in recent years our end of  target for msci china is  set at the end of november  when msci china was  driven by a cyclical upswing in earnings and some modest multiple expansion on southbound flows through the connect programs they say the connect programs refer to the tieup between chinas mainland markets shenzhen and shanghai and hong kongs stock exchange the programs allow foreign investors to buy china a shares through hong kong with fewer restrictions the morgan stanley report also says that chinas transition into a high income economy will further push the country towards growth led by consumption the services industry and high valueadded manufacturing that bodes well for the it consumer and healthcare sectors the analysts say and among their picks of chinese firms that would do well are alibaba group anta sports product bank of china limited and ctripcom show chapters things are under control in china economist    tuesday  feb    pm et   risks remain high despite the optimism the morgan stanley analysts acknowledge that china continues to face both external and domestic risks that could derail its growth prospects they note that most middle income economies have not managed to transition to high income status such lacklustre track record could weigh on chinas chances of making a successful shift moreover the countrys transition is happening at a time when the global economic environment is less supportive for growth and with the increasing risk of trade protectionism china may be hit hard as it is the worlds largest trading nations the analysts say going beyond the direct impact on chinas exports growth a protectionist environment would adversely affect corporate sentiment more importantly with significant manufacturing capacity and with select sectors still facing challenges of excess capacity extreme trade protectionism would exacerbate existing issues and lead to the reemergence of deflationary pressures for china they say more broadly the reduced competition and flow of goods services and people in a more protectionist environment would reduce the exchange of ideas and slow the rate of technological transfer that has been one of the driving forces of chinas rise towards middle income status domestically the slow pace of reform and a debt cycle not handled well would weigh on productivity and overall growth chinas debt has risen from  percent of gross domestic product gdp in  to  percent in  leading to concerns about the sustainability of the debt buildup and risks of a financial shock but the analysts downplay such risks in the report saying the buildup in debt has been funded by the countrys own savings and has been used to fund investments rather than consumption chinas strong net asset positions current account surplus high level of foreign exchange reserves and the lack of significant inflationary pressures mean that it could avoid shocks our confidence … stems from a few reasons first policy levers and buffers remain adequate leaving room for policy makers to maneuver and manage the debt cycle second significant headway has been made in a number of the key transitions that would be needed to be taken they say hence as the economy moves steadily in the right direction we expect steady growth and continued progress towards a status of high income show chapters ulrich
