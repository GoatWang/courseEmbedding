enthusiasm at valmie resources when we received the news that our company had received the sought after faa  exemption to commercially operate unmanned aircraft in the national airspace systemthis authority is being leveraged to grant caseby case authorization for certain unmanned aircraft to perform commercial operations prior to the finalization of the small uas rule which will be the primary method for authorizing small uas operations once it is completewhen the excitement died down we began a thoughtful and careful consideration about what our authorization signified as us transportation secretary anthony foxx said “make no mistake unmanned aircraft enthusiasts are aviators and with that title comes a great deal of responsibility”first for us it means we are pioneers in this emerging space we are among the first to have the ability to fly commercially and therefore will forever be viewed as industry trailblazers we take this responsibility very seriously as we move forward with growth plans in a responsible mannernext we will fly safely with every negative drone incident our entire industry suffers a setback we plan to follow applicable safety guidelines and never do anything that will damage the evolution of this exciting sectorlast we are committed to the overall growth of the drone sector as well as the growth of valmie and we are open to collaborations that will not only move our companies forward but also the entire industry we are pleased with the partnerships we have formed thus far and look forward to partnering with other likeminded companies that

specializes in fabricating and selling racing frames for the competitive drone racing industry vertitek racing’s original product model lde  is extremely light and durable it was quickly accepted among drone racersthe three new vertitek racing products are the ldx the lde  and the lde the extremely lightweight yet rugged ldx is a hybrid frame that allows the pilot to seamlessly go from racing to freestyle it is perfect for going fast and doing tricksthe lde  is now the goto racing frame for the vertitek racing team it is almost mm larger than the original lde  yet is equally light and durable using the newest battery and motor technology it is not uncommon to reach top speeds of  mph with this modelthe lde  is a smaller frame that can be utilized with the same components as the larger vertitek models built from mm carbon fiber this tiny quadcopter is capable of keeping up with frames in a much larger category using inch propellers this frame can reach speeds in excess of  mph and is extremely nimble in the cornersin addition to the drone racing frames vertitek’s engineering and services component will offer design and prototyping to the commercial drone industry backed
