and we came up again to investigate still finding nothing however there was then a noticeable list to starboard with probably a few degrees of pitch and as the ship had a list to port nearly all afternoon i decided to remain up in spite of a feeling of perfect safety upon returning to the stateroom for the purpose of completing dressing i looked at the starboard end of our passage where there was the companion leading to the quarters of the mail clerks and farther on to the baggage room and i believe the mailsorting room at the top of these stairs i found a couple of mail clerks wet to their knees who had just come up from below bringing their registered mail bags as the door in the bulkhead in the next deck was open i was able to look directly into the trunk room which was then filled with water and was within  inches or  feet of the deck above we were standing there joking about our baggage being completely soaked and about the correspondence which was seen floating about on the top of the water i personally felt no sense of danger as this water was forward of the bulkhead while we were standing there three of the ships officers  i did not notice their rank or department  descended the first companion and looked into the baggage room coming back up immediately saying that we were not making any more water this was not an announcement but merely a remark passed from one to the other then my wife and myself returned in the direction of our stateroom a matter of a few yards away only and as we were going down our own alleyway to the stateroom door our steward came by and told us that we could go back to bed again that there was no danger in this i agreed with him personally however i finished dressing my wife being already fully and warmly clothed and she in the meanwhile having gone out into the passage to note any later developments came rushing back to me saying that she had seen another passenger who informed her that the call had been given out for lifebelts and on the boat deck i went out myself and found my room steward passing down the alleyway and had the order verified as i was at the time fully dressed and wore my heavy overcoat in the pockets of which i had already placed certain necessities we started up my wife had presence of mind enough to take a lifebelt i opened my steamer trunk and took out a small pocket compass and sending my wife on ahead opened my bag and removed my automatic pistol we then proceeded immediately upward my wife being rather alarmed as she had also been at the time of the collision but for her i should have remained in bed reading we kept on upward passing at the various landings people who did not appear to be particularly frightened until we arrived on the a deck going out on the port side where i shortly found the deck steward joked with him about opening his little office room and obtained our two steamer rugs we then proceeded up the port outside companion onto the boat deck there did not at any time seem to be any particular group of passengers around the boats on the port side although there were seamen there unlimbering the gear owing to the list being to the starboard i assumed that the boats which were lowered on the starboard side would be sure to clear the ship while those on the port side might have some difficulty this was only an assumption as i have not heard of any such difficulty since we the proceeded over the raised deck caused by the unusual height of the ceiling in the lounge and came down again onto the boat deck proper on the starboard side then i gave my wife a drink from my flask filled my pipe put on my lifebelt at her urgent request she having hers already on and we stood at the rail for a few moments i would like to call particular attention to the fact that from the moment the engines were stopped steam was of course blown out from the boilers this coming through one single steam pipe on the starboard side of the forward funnel made a terrific loud noise so loud indeed that persons on the boat deck could only communicate by getting as close as possible and speaking loudly as a matter of fact i shouted in my wifes ear all this time i considered that the lifeboats were merely a precaution and upon my wifes suggestion we moved up forward of the entry from the deck house there were still quite a number of passengers coming out the stewards standing there directing them to the boats aft instead of going aft we stepped behind the projection of this entry which was of the vestibule type and waited until people had apparently ceased coming and the steward was no longer there then we started forward again and as nearly as i can remember stopped at the last one of the forward starboard group of lifeboats this was already swung out level with the deck and to my eyes appeared sufficiently loaded however my wife said that she was going in that boat and proceeded to jump in calling me to come as i knew she would get out again had i not come i finally jumped into the boat although i did not consider it from the looks of things safe to put very many more people in that boat as i remember it there were two more men both called by their wives who jumped in after i did one of them  a german i believe  told me as i recollect it later on the carpathia that he had looked around and had seen no one else and no one to ask whether he should go in or not and he jumped in senator smithhow many people were in the boat at that time mr chambersthat i cannot tell by the time we were settled and i began to take note of the things on the ship i noticed a tall young officer clad in a long overcoat which may help identify him giving orders to another officer to go into our boat and take charge of the boats on our side as a parting injunction he gave our officer whom i later found to be a mr pitman instructions to hold onto his painter and pull up alongside the gangway after the boat had reached the water preliminary to this and before lowering all of which was done with absolute calm i heard someone in authority say that is enough before lowering we can get more in after she is in the water i remember these conversations particularly as at the time i was wondering at the source of the order being morally certain myself that no doors in the ships side had been opened we were then lowered away in a manner which i would consider very satisfactory taking into account the apparent absolute lack of training of the rank and file of the crew shortly before we reached the water our officer called and finally blew his whistle for them to stop lowering that he might find out if the plug was in or not the inquiry was called in a loud tone of voice to which one of the crew in our boat replied that it was that he himself had put it in meanwhile a voice from above called down as nearly as i can recollect it it is your own blooming business to see that the plug is in anyhow when we reached the water we then had difficulty in casting off the falls the little quartermaster had to crawl between our legs to the amidship portion of the boat in order to reach what was apparently called the trigger which is i believe a mechanism used to release both falls simultaneously we then put out our oars and crawled away slowly from the ship until we lay some three or four hundred yards off senator smithdid you observe anything unusual regarding the watertight compartments mr chambersi was rather surprised at the time when she struck to hear no particular orders or signals for closing the watertight doors by those i mean such as are usually closed by the stewards and were when i last traveled on the cunarders a number of years ago always tested by being closed by the stewards themselves at noon or thereabouts senator smithat noon of each day mr chambersat noon each day yes when the whistle blew at noon that was on the old etruria and umbria i never traveled on the campania and lucania while i did not make a careful examination of the mechanism of the doors i at the same time had looked them over rather more than casually on my way to and from the swimming pool in mornings i remember being somewhat surprised that these doors were not nowadays operated by electricity this being only a landsmans point of view as a matter of fact they were operated from the deck above the e deck by first removing a small boiler plate which fitted flush with the deck and was unscrewed by means of the two forked end of a pin spanner that apparently giving access to the square or hexagon end of a shaft which being rotated by another box wrench some  feet  inches in length with a t handle operated a double series of bevel gears the last shaft having on it a pinion meshing in a door rack and closing the door the cover plates to the mechanism of the watertight doors as far as i am able to state were not removed before our final departure for the upper decks senator smithdid you see any attempt being made to remove them mr chambersi did not i saw no attempt being made to remove them senator smithwhat else can you tell about that matter that will be helpful to the committee mr chambersi have no reason to believe that any attempt was made by the stewards on whom i have always understood this duty devolved to close these doors particularly as a large percentage of the steward part of the crew were new seeing these door plates undisturbed just before our final departure to the upper decks i reached the conclusion that the doors had not been closed in connection with my statement that a large percentage of the steward part of the crew were new i may say that my own room steward complained to me on the second day out that he did not know
