policies   basis of presentation   the accompanying unaudited financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for interim financial information and with the instructions to form q and regulation sx accordingly the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements   in the opinion of management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for a the financial position b the result of operations and c cash flows have been made in order to make the financial statements presented not misleading the results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year   principles of consolidation   for september   the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries element resources international limited “element resources” incorporated in hong kong and cei all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation prior to january   the financial statements presented are those of cei   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments   discontinued operations   the company follows asc   “discontinued operations”  to report for disposed or discontinued operations   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks money market funds and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which in the opinion of management are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value   foreign currency translation and remeasurement   in

exchange rates resulting translation adjustments are reflected as other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are charged to operations as incurred the company did not have any significant foreign currency translations for the six months ended september   and       table of contents    concentrations of credit risk   the company’s financial instruments that

cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness at times its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits the company’s management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds and as such it believes that any associated credit risk exposure is limited   financial instruments   the company follows asc  “fair value measurements and disclosures” which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between  market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and  an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below   level    level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level    level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets or modelderived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data   level    level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities   fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of september   the carrying values of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents accounts payable and accrued expenses and loans and notes payable approximate their fair values due to the shortterm maturities of these financial instruments   business combinations   in accordance with asc  “business combinations” the company accounts for all business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting under this method assets and liabilities including any remaining noncontrolling interests are recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired net of liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests is recognized as goodwill certain adjustments to the assessed fair values of the assets liabilities or noncontrolling interests made subsequent to the acquisition date but within the measurement period which is up to one year are recorded as adjustments to goodwill any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period are recorded in income any cost or equity method interest that the company holds in the acquired company prior to the acquisition is remeasured to fair value at acquisition with a resulting gain or loss recognized in income for the difference between fair value and the existing book value results of operations of the acquired entity are included in the company’s results from the date of the acquisition onward and include amortization expense arising from acquired tangible and intangible assets      table of contents   deferred income taxes and valuation allowance   the company accounts for income taxes under asc  “income taxes” under the asset and liability method of asc  where deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs a valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the company will not realize tax assets through future operations no deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized as at september   and march     net income  loss  per share of common stock   the company has adopted asc topic  “earnings per share” “eps” which requires presentation of basic eps on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic eps computation in the accompanying financial statements basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period   the following table sets forth the computation of basic earnings loss per share for the six months ended september   and        six months ended september                              net income loss                             weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted

contingencies liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims assessments litigation fines and penalties as well as other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated there were no commitments or contingencies as of september   and march        table of contents   recent accounting pronouncements   management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our financial statements the companys management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the companys financial statements   related parties   the company follows asc  “related party disclosures” for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions see note    revenue recognition   the company will recognize revenue from the sale of products and services in accordance with asc  “revenue recognition” however the company will recognize revenue only when all of the following criteria have been met     i persuasive evidence for an agreement exists         ii service has been provided         iii the fee is fixed or determinable and         iv collection is reasonably assured   note   going concern   the companys financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business the company has not established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating cost and requires additional capital to commence its operating plan the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable if the company is unable to obtain adequate capital it could be forced to cease operations these factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern   in order to continue as a going concern the company will need among other things additional capital resources managements plan to obtain such resources for the company include sales of equity instruments traditional financing such as loans and obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses however management cannot provide any assurance that the company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans   there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds if available will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the company in addition profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues received from business operations however there is no assurance that the company will attain profitability the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern      table of contents    note  – stockholders ’ equity deficit   common stock   the company has authorized capital of  common shares

and procedures   as of september   management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso and sec guidance on conducting such assessments based on that evaluation they concluded that during the period covered by this report such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of us gaap rules as more fully described below this was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses   the matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were  lack of a functioning audit committee  lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures  inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives and  management dominated by two individuals without adequate compensating controls the aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our chief executive and financial officer in connection with their review of our financial statements as of september     management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial
