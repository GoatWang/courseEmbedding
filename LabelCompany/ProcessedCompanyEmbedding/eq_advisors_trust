allocation of aggregated orders among the fund and other accounts managed by the funds portfolio manager a portfolio manager potentially could give favorable treatment to some accounts for a variety of reasons including favoring larger accounts accounts that pay higher fees accounts that pay performancebased fees accounts of affiliated companies and accounts in which the portfolio manager has an interest such favorable treatment could lead to more favorable investment opportunities or allocations for some accounts loomis sayles makes investment decisions for all accounts including institutional accounts mutual funds hedge funds and affiliated accounts based on each accounts availability of other comparable investment opportunities and loomis sayles desire to treat all accounts fairly and equitably over time loomis sayles maintains trade allocation and aggregation policies and procedures to address these potential conflicts conflicts of interest also may arise to the extent a portfolio manager short sells a stock in one client account but holds that stock long in other accounts including the fund or sells a stock for some accounts while buying the stock for others and through the use of soft dollar arrangements compensation as of june   loomis sayles believes that portfolio manager compensation should be driven primarily by the delivery of consistent and superior longterm performance for its clients portfolio manager compensation is made up primarily of three main components base salary variable compensation and a longterm incentive program although portfolio manager compensation is not directly tied to assets under management a portfolio managers base salary andor variable compensation potential may reflect the amount of assets for which the manager is responsible relative to other portfolio managers loomis sayles also offers a profit sharing plan base salary is a fixed amount based on a combination of factors including industry experience firm experience job performance and market considerations variable compensation is an incentivebased component and generally represents a significant multiple of base salary variable compensation is based on four factors investment performance profit growth of the firm profit growth of the managers business unit and team commitment investment performance is the primary component of total variable compensation and generally represents at least  of the total for fixedincome managers and  for equity managers the other three factors are used to determine the remainder of variable compensation subject to the discretion of the chief investment officer cio and senior management the cio and senior management evaluate these other factors annually equity managers while mutual fund performance and asset size do not directly contribute to the compensation calculation investment performance for equity managers is measured by comparing the performance of loomis sayles institutional composites to the performance of the applicable morningstar peer group andor the lipper universe generally speaking the performance of the respective products fund is compared against the applicable morningstar peer group andor the lipper universe if the majority of the assets in the product are contained in the mutual fund that comparison will drive compensation to the extent the majority of assets managed in the fund    strategy are for institutional separate accounts the evestment alliance institutional peer group will also be used as an additional comparison in situations where substantially all of the assets for the strategy are institutional the institutional peer group will be used as the primary method of comparison a managers performance relative to the peer group for the   and  year periods or since the start of the managers tenure if shorter is used to calculate the amount of variable compensation payable due to performance the  year may be eliminated for some products longerterm performance  and  years or since the start of the managers tenure if shorter combined is weighted more than shorterterm performance  year in addition the performance measurement for equity compensation will incorporate a consistency metric using longer term   etc rolling excess return compared to peer group over a sustained measurement period   etc years the exact method may be adjusted to a products particular style if a manager is responsible for more than one product the rankings of each product are weighted based on either relative revenue or asset size of accounts represented in each product an external benchmark is used as a secondary comparison loomis sayles uses either an institutional peer group as a point of comparison for equity manager performance a morningstar universe andor the lipper universe in cases where the institutional peer groups are used loomis sayles believes they represent the most competitive product universe while closely matching the investment styles offered by the loomis sayles fund mutual funds are not included in loomis sayles composites so unlike other managed accounts fund performance and asset size do not directly contribute to this calculation however each fund managed by loomis sayles employs strategies endorsed by loomis sayles and fits into the product category for the relevant investment style loomis sayles may adjust compensation if there is significant dispersion among the returns of the composite and accounts not included in the composite loomis sayles has developed and implemented two distinct longterm incentive plans to attract and retain investment talent the plans supplement existing compensation the first plan has several important components distinguishing it from traditional equity ownership plans        the plan grants units that entitle participants to an annual payment based on a percentage of company earnings above an established threshold      upon retirement a participant will receive a multiyear payout for his or her vested units and      participation is contingent upon signing an award agreement which includes a noncompete covenant the second plan is similarly constructed although the participants annual participation in company earnings is deferred for two years from the time of award and is only payable if the portfolio manager remains at loomis sayles in this plan there is no postretirement payments or noncompete covenants senior management expects that the variable compensation portion of overall compensation will continue to remain the largest source of income for those investment professionals included in the plan the plan is initially offered to portfolio managers and over time the scope of eligibility is likely to widen management has full discretion on what units are issued and to whom portfolio managers also participate in the loomis sayles profit sharing plan in which loomis sayles makes a contribution to the retirement plan of each employee based on a percentage of base salary up to a maximum amount the portfolio managers also participate in the loomis sayles defined benefit pension plan which applies to all loomis sayles employees who joined the firm prior to may   the defined benefit is based on years of service and base compensation up to a maximum amount ownership of securities of the fund as of

accounts managed could have different investment strategies that at times might conflict with one another to the possible detriment of the fund alternatively to the extent that the same investment opportunities might be desirable for more than one account possible conflicts could arise in determining how to allocate them other potential conflicts might include conflicts created by specific portfolio manager compensation arrangements and conflicts relating to selection of brokers or dealers to execute fund portfolio trades andor specific uses of commissions from fund portfolio trades for example research or soft dollars federated has adopted policies and procedures and has structured the portfolio managers compensation in a manner reasonably designed to safeguard the fund from

calculating the annual incentive amount each fund or account may be categorized into multiple ipp groups within each performance measurement period and ipp group ipp is calculated on the basis of an assigned weighting of each included account managed by the portfolio manager although the performance of each fundaccount is considered in calculating the annual incentive amount the weighting of the ipp group weightings may differ a portion of the bonus tied to the ipp score may be adjusted based on managements assessment of overall contributions to fund performance and any other factors deemed relevant the financial success category is designed to tie the portfolio managers bonus in part to federateds overall financial results funding for the financial success category may be determined on a product or asset class basis as well as on corporate financial results senior management determines individual financial success bonuses on a discretionary basis considering overall contributions

the following information relating to federated global investment management corp and vaughan nelson investment management federated global investment management proxy voting policy procedures and guidelines the subadvisers general policy is to cast proxy votes in favor of proposals that the subadviser anticipates will enhance the longterm value of the securities being voted generally this will mean voting for proposals that the subadviser believes will a improve the management of a company b increase the rights or preferences of the voted securities andor c increase the chance that a premium offer would be made for the company or for the voted securities the following examples illustrate how these general policies may apply to proposals submitted by a companys board of directors for approval or ratification by holders of the companys voting securities however whether the subadviser supports or opposes a proposal will always depend on the specific circumstances described in the proxy statement and other available information on matters of corporate governance generally the subadviser will vote for the full slate of directors nominated in an uncontested election but against any director who a had not attended at least  of the board meetings during the previous year b serves as the companys chief financial officer c has committed himself or herself to service on a large number of boards such that we deem it unlikely that the director would be able to commit sufficient focus and time to a particular company d is the chair of the nominating committee when the roles of chairman of the board and ceo are combined and there is no lead independent director andor e served on the compensation committee during a period in which compensation appears excessive relative to performance and peers in addition the subadviser will vote for proposals to require a companys audit committee to be comprised entirely of independent directors declassify the board of directors require a majority voting standard in the election of directors eliminate supermajority requirements in a companys bylaws grant shareholders the right to call a special meeting if owners of at least  of the outstanding stock agree require independent tabulation of proxies andor confidential voting by shareholders ratify the boards selection of auditors unless compensation for nonaudit services exceeded  of the total compensation received from the company or the previous auditor was dismissed because of a disagreement with the company and repeal a shareholder rights plan also known as a poison pill the subadviser will generally vote against the adoption of such a plan unless the plan is designed to facilitate rather than prevent unsolicited offers for the company on matters of capital structure generally the subadviser will vote against proposals to authorize or issue shares that are senior in priority or voting rights to the securities being voted and for proposals to reduce the amount of shares authorized for issuance authorize a stock repurchase program and grant preemptive rights to the securities being voted the subadviser will generally vote against proposals to eliminate such preemptive rights on matters relating to management compensation generally the subadviser will vote for stock incentive plans that align the recipients interests with the interests of shareholders without creating undue dilution against proposals that would permit the amendment or replacement of outstanding stock    incentives with new stock incentives having more favorable terms and against executive compensation plans that do not disclose the maximum amounts of compensation that may be awarded or the criteria for determining awards on matters relating to corporate transactions the subadviser will vote proxies relating to proposed mergers capital reorganizations and similar transactions in accordance with the general policy based upon its analysis of the terms conditions and anticipated results of the proposed transaction the subadviser will vote proxies in contested elections of directors based upon its analysis of the opposing slates and their respective proposed business strategies when the companys board or another party involved in a proposed transaction or change in the board submits proposals for the purpose of facilitating or impeding such transaction or change the subadviser will cast its proxies based on its evaluation of the proposed transaction or change to the board in these circumstances the subadviser may vote in a manner contrary to its general practice for similar proposals made outside the context of such a proposed transaction or change in the board for example if the subadviser decides to vote against a proposed transaction it may vote in favor of antitakeover measures reasonably designed to prevent the transaction the subadviser generally votes proxies against proposals submitted by shareholders without the favorable recommendation of a companys board the subadviser believes that a companys board should manage its business and policies and that shareholders who seek specific changes should strive to convince the board of their merits or seek direct representation on the board however the subadviser would vote for shareholder proposals not supported by the companys board that the subadviser regards as a likely to result in an immediate and favorable improvement in the total return of the voted security and b unlikely to be adopted by the companys board in the absence of shareholder direction in addition the subadviser will not vote any proxy if it determines that the consequences or costs of voting outweigh the potential benefit of voting for example if a foreign market requires shareholders voting proxies to retain the voted shares until the meeting date thereby rendering the shares illiquid for some period of time the subadviser will not vote proxies for such shares in addition the subadviser is not obligated to incur any expense to send a representative to a shareholder meeting or to translate proxy materials into english proxy voting procedures the subadviser has established the proxy voting committee proxy committee to exercise all voting discretion granted to the subadviser by the board in accordance with the proxy voting policies the subadviser has hired a proxy voting service to obtain vote and record proxies in accordance with the directions of the proxy committee the proxy committee has supplied the proxy voting service with general instructions the standard voting instructions that represent decisions made by the proxy committee in order to vote common proxy proposals as the proxy committee believes that a shareholder vote is equivalent to an investment decision the proxy committee retains the right to modify the standard voting instructions at any time or to vote contrary to them at any time in order to cast proxy votes in a manner that the proxy committee believes is a in the best interests of the subadvisers clients including shareholders of the funds advised by the subadviser and b will enhance the longterm value of the securities being voted the proxy voting service may vote any proxy as directed in the standard voting instructions without further direction from the proxy committee however if the standard voting instructions require casebycase direction for a proposal the proxy voting service shall provide the proxy committee with all information that it has obtained regarding the proposal and the proxy committee will provide specific direction to the proxy voting service the proxy committee has created the proxy voting management group pvmg to assist it in carrying out the daytoday operations related to proxy voting the daytoday operations related to proxy voting are carried out by the proxy voting operations team pvot and overseen by the pvmg this work    includes but is not limited to interacting with the proxy voting service on the proxy committees behalf soliciting voting recommendations from the subadvisers investment professionals as necessary on casebycase items referred to the proxy committee by the proxy voting service bringing requests to the proxy committee from the subadvisers investment professionals for voting contrary to the standard voting instructions filing any required proxy voting reports providing proxy voting reports to clients and investment companies as they are requested from time to time keeping the proxy committee informed of any issues related to proxy voting and voting client shares as directed by the proxy committee conflicts of interest the subadviser has adopted procedures to address situations where a matter on which a proxy is sought may present a potential conflict between the interests of the fund and its shareholders and those of the subadviser or distributor this may occur where a significant business relationship exists between the subadviser or its affiliates and a company involved with a proxy vote a company that is a proponent opponent or the subject of a proxy vote and which to the knowledge of the proxy committee has a significant business relationship with the subadviser is referred to below as an interested company the subadviser has implemented the following procedures in order to avoid concerns that the conflicting interests of the subadviser have influenced proxy voting any employee of the subadviser who is contacted by an interested company regarding proxies to be voted by the subadviser must refer the interested company to a member of the proxy committee and must inform the interested company that the proxy committee has exclusive authority to determine how the subadviser will exercise its voting discretion any proxy committee member contacted by an interested company must report it to the full proxy committee and provide a written summary of the communication under no circumstances will the proxy committee or any member of the proxy committee make a commitment to an interested company regarding the voting of proxies or disclose to an interested company how the proxy committee has directed such proxies to be voted if the standard voting instructions already provide specific direction on the proposal in question the proxy committee shall not alter or amend such directions if the standard voting instructions require the proxy committee to provide further direction the proxy committee shall do so in accordance with the proxy voting policies without regard for the interests of the subadviser with respect to the interested company if the proxy committee provides any direction as to the voting of proxies relating to a proposal affecting an interested company it must disclose annually to the funds board information regarding the significant business relationship any material communication with the interested company the matters voted on and how and why the subadviser voted as it did alternatively the proxy committee may seek direction from the funds board on how a proposal concerning an interested company shall be voted and shall follow any such direction provided by the board in seeking such direction the proxy committee will disclose the reason such company is considered an interested company and may provide a recommendation on how such proposal should be voted and the basis for such recommendation if the subadvisers client owns shares of an investment company for which the subadviser or an affiliate is the investment subadviser the proxy committee will vote the clients proxies for that investment company in the same proportion as the votes cast by shareholders who are not clients of the subadviser unless otherwise directed by the client or in the case of an investment company its board of directors or trustees downstream affiliates if the proxy committee gives further direction or seeks to vote contrary to the standard voting instructions for a proxy relating to a portfolio company in which an investment company client owns more than  of the portfolio companys outstanding voting securities at the time of the vote downstream affiliate the proxy committee must first receive guidance from counsel to the proxy    committee as to whether any relationship between the subadviser and the portfolio company other than such ownership of the portfolio companys securities gives rise to an actual conflict of interest if counsel determines that an actual conflict exists the proxy committee must address any such conflict with the executive committee of the board of directors or trustees of any investment company client prior to taking any action on the proxy at issue vaughan nelson investment management investment adviser policies and procedures manual revised february  proxy voting policy and procedures introduction rule  under the investment advisers act of  addresses an investment advisers duty with regard to the voting of proxies for clients under the rule an adviser must   a adopt and implement written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that client securities are voted in the clients best interest and to address procedures to be undertaken in the event a material conflict arises between the firms interest and that of our clients as to how a particular security or proxy issue is voted   b disclose to clients how they may obtain information regarding how the firm voted with respect to the clients securities and   c describe the firms policies and procedures to clients and upon request furnish a copy of the policies and procedures to the requesting client the policy and procedures below have been reasonably designed to ensure proxies are voted in the best interest of our clients and in compliance with rule  our authority to vote proxies for our clients is established through either the advisory contract if the contract is silent implied by the overall delegation of discretionary authority or our fiduciary responsibility to erisa clients under department of labor regulations policy the firm undertakes to vote all client proxies in a manner reasonably expected to ensure the clients best interest is upheld and in a manner that does not subrogate the clients best interest to that of the firms in instances where a material conflict exists or potentially exists the firm has created a proxy voting guideline the guideline see exhibit n reasonably believed to be in the best interest of clients relating to common and recurring issues found within proxy voting material in drafting this guideline the firm considered the nature of the firms business and the types of securities being managed the firm created the guideline to help ensure voting consistency on issues common amongst issuers and to help serve as evidence that a vote was not the product of a conflict of interest but rather a vote in accordance with a predetermined policy conflicts of interest the most common conflicts of interest result from a situation involving a business relationship andor a potential financial benefit to the firm the firm envisions only rare situations where a conflict of interest would exist or potentially exist between the firm and its clients given the nature of the firms business clients relationships and the types of securities managed notwithstanding apparent or actual conflicts of interest may arise from time to time in such instances the firm will undertake to vote such proxies in the continued best interest of clients in accordance with the procedures put in place addressing potential or actual material conflicts    a potential conflict may be resolved in either of the following manners      if the proposal that gives rise to an actual or potential conflict is specifically addressed in the guideline the firm may vote the proxy in accordance with the predetermined guideline provided that the predetermined guideline involves little or no discretion on the firms part or      the firm may follow the recommendations of institutional shareholder services an independent third party as to how the proxy should be voted limitations there may be circumstances or situations that may preclude or limit the manner in which proxies are voted this may include but is not limited to      mutual funds  where voting may be controlled by restrictions within the fund or the actions of authorized persons      international securities  where the perceived benefit of voting an international proxy does not outweigh the anticipated costs of doing so      new accounts  instances where security holdings assumed will be sold in the near term thereby limiting any benefit to be obtained by a vote of proxy material      unsupervised securities  where the firm does not have a basis on which to offer advice      unjustifiable costs  where the firm may abstain from voting a client proxy in a specific instance if in our good faith determination the costs involved in voting such proxy cannot be justified eg total client holdings less than  shares and not held by a mutual fund costs associated with obtaining translations of relevant proxy materials for nonus securities in light of the benefits to the client of voting in accordance with the firms fiduciary duties the firm shall in appropriate cases weigh the costs and benefits of voting proxy proposals and shall make an informed decision with respect to whether voting a given proxy proposal is prudent the decision will take into account the effect that the vote either by itself or together with other votes is expected to have on the value of clients investment and whether this expected effect would outweigh the cost of voting      securities out on loan      erisa accounts  with respect to erisa clients for whom we have accepted the responsibility for proxy voting we vote proxies in accordance with our duty of loyalty and prudence compliance with the plan documents and the firms duty to avoid prohibited transactions guideline formulation the majority of proxy issues to be voted on are both recurring in nature and common amongst issuers this would include items ranging from the election of directors and ratification of auditors to cumulative voting and poison pills a proxy voting guideline has been developed see exhibit n to reflect how we believe a vote should normally be cast in order to support the best interest of our clients the use of this guideline also facilitates a process that supports voting consistency and efficiency in administration however it should be acknowledged that a blanket voting approach cannot be applied to many recurring and common issues the guideline indicates that such issues will be addressed on a casebycase basis in consultation with a portfolio manager to determine how to vote the issue in our clients best interest the guideline is the work product of the firms investment team which has the responsibility to determine how proxy issues should be voted to promote the interest of our clients the investment team draws on various sources of information in reviewingformulating the guideline including but not limited to research provided by an independent research firm institutional shareholder services internal research published information on corporate governance and experience    disclosure to clients the disclosuredelivery to clients required by rule  includes a concise summary of the firms proxy voting process rather than a reiteration of the firms policies and procedures and an indication that a copy of the policies and procedures is available on request the method of delivering this summary is not stipulated however it must be clear not hidden in a longer document and delivered directly to the client in addition the disclosure should describe how the client may obtain information from the adviser on how it voted with respect to the clients securities procedures the procedures to be performed in the execution or our proxy voting duty to clients will be as follows oversight the compliance department will be responsible for the administration and oversight of the proxy voting process the compliance department will also  review and update the firms policies and procedures as necessary  coordinate the review and update of the firms proxy voting guidelines by the investment team or its designee  consult with and coordinate the voting of proxies with the appropriate portfolio manager as needed the compliance individual ci and proxy administrator pa will oversee the use of institutional shareholder services an outside thirdparty vendor who provides assistance with proxy research proxy voting and record retention account setup    new clients will receive a copy of the description of proxy voting policies and procedures as part of information provided in connection with the firms new client checklist    at the time a contract is entered into a determination will be made as to whether the client will retain proxy voting responsibilities a separate acknowledgement will be obtained where the client elects to retain proxy voting responsibilities    the pa will arrange for client proxy material to be forwarded to institutional shareholder services for voting securities lending in many cases vaughan nelsons clients participate in securities lending programs whereby the legal right to vote a proxy is transferred to the borrower as a result of the lending process from time to time circumstances may arise where vaughan nelson desires to vote shares in an upcoming proxy ie acquisition contested election etc in these cases vaughan nelson if the record date has not passed will request the client to recall the security in question from loan until the proxy record date in order for the client and thereby vaughan nelson to be the holder of record in order to cast the proxy vote voting process    the pa uploads a file each day on a settlement date basis detailing all the securities held on behalf of our clients for which we own more than  shares to institutional shareholder services    institutional shareholder services is responsible for matching the proxy material received with this listing and following up with any custodian that has not forwarded proxies within a reasonable time     through web access and the institutional shareholder services software the pa is able to determine for each security its record date meeting date and whether institutional shareholder services has completed proxy research on the security    the pa will download the institutional shareholder services proxy research for each security along with a copy of the voting form and forward the package to the ci    the ci will make a determination as to whether a material conflict exists with regard to the proxy or an individual proxy issue the results of this determination will be documented and initialed on the proxy voting form    the ci will review the proxy issues against the firms guideline and cast each vote on the voting form if able and sign off on having voted those issues   a if all issues were able to be voted within the guideline the package will be returned to the pa for online voting   b if issues exist for which a casebycase review must be made the package is forwarded to the appropriate manager the manager will review the information within the package and any other necessary information in order to formulate the vote to be cast the rationale for any departures from the firms guideline will be documented within the package all votes will be indicated on the voting form and the manager will sign off as to having voted those issues the package will then be returned to the pa for voting   c as described under conflicts of interests where a material conflict exists the firm may vote the issue  in accordance with the guideline if the application of such policy to the issue at hand involves little or no discretion on the part of the firm or  as indicated by the independent thirdparty research firm institutional shareholder services by voting conflicts in accordance with the indication of an independent thirdparty the firm will be able to demonstrate that the vote was not a product of a conflict of interest an indication that this was the approach taken to vote the issue will be made and signed off on by the compliance individual the package will then be returned to the pa for voting    through the software interface with institutional shareholder services the pa will indicate review and submit our vote on individual securities the pa is able to resubmit our vote up until the day before the meeting which can accommodate cases where new information may come to light    institutional shareholder services will then process the vote with the issuer on behalf of the firm recordkeeping the
