lps chief executive officer brad southern lps chief operating officer as well as mike kinney and becky barckley our primary investor relations contact i will begin the discussion with a review of our financial results for the first quarter of  and this will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selective balance sheet items after i finish my remarks brad will provide an update on our siding capacity expansion plan followed by curt discussing the general market environment in which lp has been operating his perspective on our operating results and give his thoughts on the outlook as weve done in the past weve opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast the webcast can be accessed at wwwlpcorpcom additionally to help with the discussion weve provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release i will be referencing these slides in my comments we filed our q and an k earlier today with some supplemental information i do want to remind all the participants about the forwardlooking statements comment on slide  of the presentation please also be aware of the discussion of our use of nongaap financial information included on slide  of the presentation the appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations that have been supplemented by the form k filing we made this morning rather than reading these two statements i incorporate them with this reference the first quarter of  was lps highest adjusted ebitda first quarter in the last four years on  million of sales we reported  million of adjusted ebitda and  adjusted ebitda margin while this past quarter adjusted ebitda was below the  million reported for the first quarter of  the change in our mix of earnings is worth noting in  the adjusted ebitda was driven by osb price north central osb price on a  basis was  per thousand board feet and osb represented  of the business segment adjusted ebitda our siding business was  of the business segment adjusted ebitda the high osb pricing was the most significant driver of the earnings in that  quarter in this past quarter osb pricing for north central on a  basis was  per thousand and osb represented  of the business segment adjusted ebitda in the first quarter of  the siding segment was  million of adjusted ebitda reported almost twice the adjusted ebitda of the first quarter of  when siding represented  of the total we are executing on our strategy to grow the percentage of earnings derived from the siding segment with that let me go into the detail moving to slide  of the presentation for a discussion of first quarter  consolidated results we are reporting net sales of  million for the first quarter of  a  increase from the net sales of  million reported in the first quarter of  in the first quarter we recorded net income of  million or  per diluted share compared to a net income of  million or  per diluted share in the first quarter of  the adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter was  million or  per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of  as compared to  million or  per diluted share reported in the first quarter of  adjusted ebitda from continuing operations was  million in the quarter compared to  million in the first quarter of  moving on to slide  and the review of our segment results beginning with osb osb reported net sales for the first quarter of  of  million up  from  million in the first quarter of  osb reported operating income of  million compared to operating income of  million in the first quarter of  adjusted ebitda from continuing operations was  million compared to  million in  sales volumes were essentially flat pricing for osb was higher by  which improved operating results by  million offsetting the higher sales price was an increase in manufacturing costs due to downtime related to capital projects primarily a press rebuild at our jasper osb facility as well as higher maintenance spending we do believe that the jasper press rebuild reduced our first quarter earnings by about  million slide  reports the results of the siding business this segment includes our smartside and canexel siding products as well as osb produced on one line at our hayward wisconsin operation the siding segment reported sales of  million an  increase from the first quarter of  operating income of  million  million higher than the  million of operating income reported in the first quarter of  adjusted ebitda of  million in the first quarter of  was an increase of  million over the first quarter of  for the quarter smartside average sales prices were up  and volumes increased  volume increased on our smartside siding line due to increased demand some of which was probably moved forward into the first quarter from the second quarter due to the price increase we announced on march  the increase in osb sales price on products sold in the siding segment accounted for approximately  million of the increase in operating result and adjusted ebitda we produced  million feet of osb in this segment during the first quarter of  slightly below the osb production of  million feet in the first quarter of  please turn to slide  of the presentation which shows the results from our engineered wood products segment this segment includes ijoist laminated strand lumber laminated veneer lumber osb produced at our houlton maine facility plus other related products this segment also includes the sale of ijoist and lvl products produced by the abitibi joint venture or under a sales arrangement with murphy plywood the engineered wood products segment recorded sales of  million in the first quarter of  up from  million in the first quarter of  the segment reported operating income of  million in the first quarter of  as compared to an operating loss of  million in the first quarter of  for the first quarter of  adjusted ebitda from continuing operations was  million as compared to  million in the first quarter of  improved utilization at our facilities was the most significant driver of this segments improved performance volumes of high ijoist were up  and volumes of lvl and lsl were up  compared to the same quarter of last year pricing was up  in lvl and lsl and up  in ijoist moving on to slide  of the presentation for the quarter our south american segment recorded sales of  million  million higher than the  million reported in the first quarter of  operating income was  million and adjusted ebitda was  million for the first quarter of  about flat with the same quarter in  volumes in chile were up  and volumes in brazil were up  as compared to the same quarter of last year the sales volume increase in chile was due to selling imported products in us dollars pricing was up  in chile and  in brazil in local currency chile pricing was down  and brazils pricing decreased  as compared to the same quarter in  due to the appreciation of the chilean peso and brazilian real against the us dollar total selling general and administrative expenses were  million in the first quarter of  compared to  million in the same quarter of  for the quarter the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily related to increases in certain management incentives and higher costs associated with sales and marketing please refer to slide  of the presentation as of march   we had cash cash equivalents investments and restricted cash of  million working capital of  million and net cash of  million capital expenditures for the first quarter were  million we are forecasting capital expenditures for  between  million and  million this includes funding for the third mill in chile as well as funding for current siding capacity optimization and additional siding capacity as i mentioned on our call last quarter well begin paying taxes in the us in  the us represents approximately  to  of our operating income the tax payments relate to our  earnings including the gain on the sale of timber sold in  as well as  forecasted earnings in the second quarter we anticipate tax payments just over  million we dont anticipate paying cash taxes in canada due to our net operating loss carryovers the benefit amount of our available canadian net operating losses was  million at the end of  and before i turn the call over to brad for his comments i would like to remind everyone on the call that we are hosting an investor trip to our hayward wisconsin mill on june  and june  we selected the hayward mill for the investor day to highlight the synergies between the siding and osb segment if you are interested in joining us please let mike kinney know now ill turn the call over to brad for his comments william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp thank you sallie and good afternoon to all as sallie reported we continue to drive strong smartside volume and revenue growth our capacity expansion strategy for smartside is to stay ahead of demand using a rigorous evaluation process this process considers factors such as timing scale production cost capital cost staffing construction risk and operating risk last quarter we reported that we completed the mill swap in québec with norbord and acquired a manufacturing site in cook minnesota that gives us additional flexibility to add capacity to support the growth in our smartside business in addition we have explored the option of converting other aspen woodbased osb mills in our system or owned by others because of the growth were seeing on the west coast and our desire to lower the risk our current plan is to convert our dawson creek british columbia osb mill to a smartside plant key factors that differentiated this side are timing to first board wood cost cost of production proximity to our west coast customer base and reduced operational risk due to the fact that dawson creek is currently staffed and producing osb we plan to request board approval for this conversion project in july once we have completed the detailed engineering and design with that said both valdor quebec and cook minnesota sites are likely options for future siding expansion given our strong smartside demand growth we estimate that the dawson creek conversion will satisfy about two to three years of demand growth since valdor is not currently operating and the cook minnesota site will basically be a brownfield mill with new buildings and equipment we are continuing our planning process for both locations with a focus on cook given the brownfield nature of cook we have initiated a more detailed engineering and design study which will be followed by the necessary environmental permitting assessments these are exciting times for our smartside business were fortunate to have multiple viable manufacturing options to support the demand growth being realized by our sales and marketing team with the support of our distribution partners with that ill turn the call over to curt curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp thanks brad for the update on the siding expansion with the growth that weve seen in the last couple of years im more determined than ever to making sure that we have the capacity available to grow this business meaningfully good afternoon thanks for joining us on the call i recognize this is a friday afternoon but our board of directors took several actions this morning that we wanted to discuss with the analysts and investors as soon as possible ill get to that in a few minutes as usual ill start with our safety performance in q we had a total incident rate of  and a months rolling average of  in addition we were informed by the apa that based on our  safety performance lp won  out of the  safety awards that we were eligible for including the safest large company and the safest small company and you might ask yourself how can we be both a large company and a small company the small company award actually went to the resolute lp ijoist jv in québec that has two mills today ill be providing comments on our results and accomplishments in the first quarter provide some comments on the lumber countervailing duties that were recently put in place on canadian imports give you my views on housing and the outlook for the rest of  and end with a few comments on the upcoming leadership change at lp i know sallie went through our financial results in detail but id also like to have a chance to talk about those numbers so total sales sallie said were  higher than q of last year led by higher osb pricing and a  volume increase in siding net income was  million and adjusted ebitda at  million a couple of other highlights in the quarter this was the best quarter in a decade in our ewp segment which returned to profitability and then i think sallie mentioned that we did have a successful jasper press rebuild although it cost us a little bit in earnings and was the right thing to do at the right time and were expecting good things out of that press rebuild on the lumber duties im actually little surprise by the number of questions weve got on the recent announcement on the countervailing duties but let me just give you a little background and tell you how it might affect us as many of you know the dispute goes back probably  or  years and is grounded in the fact that most of the timber in canada is owned by the provinces the us producers contend that the canadian government uses this resource to create jobs in the communities where the wood is located but to make these companies competitive the contention is that this is essentially a government subsidy over the last several decades there has been much legal action but usually the two governments have come together with a managed trade agreement the last managed trade agreement expired in october of  the agreement did provide for a one year renegotiation period during that time there was no agreement at the end of the period the us producers filed for both countervailing and antidumping duties to be applied on these canadian imports on april  us announced preliminary countervailing duties that will be applied to the softwood lumber imports into the us that vary between  and  for the five specific companies investigated and an allother rate of around  the second duty antidumping will likely be announced on june  and has been estimated to be in the range of  to  on top of the countervailing duties discussed just above so the questions for lp is how will this affect our business none of the products we manufacture are subject to these duties we do purchase softwood lumber from canada for ijoist production in california we could see an increase in price with higher lumber pricing this could also make our ijoist laminated strand lumber and laminated veneer lumber more competitive these duties will raise the cost of construction for new homes and there could be a dampening effect on housing starts finally we have heard from at least two stocking distributors that they allocated more their inventory dollars to buying lumber ahead of the duty announcement which lowered their investment in some of our siding products turning to housing market current consensus for  is actually a little bit higher than it was reported last quarter at  million its an  increase over last year perhaps this is finally the year where actual housing starts will be higher than the forecast at the beginning of the year that has not happened in a very very long time other economic news related to construction is mostly good the average rate for year fixed mortgages was  during the week ended april  which was slightly lower than what we talked about last quarter the inventory of existing homes for sale is at historic low levels while new home inventory increased a little bit the caseshiller home price index has stayed steady at about a  increase since about the middle of  unemployment rate declined to  in march and i just saw it was  reported today consumer sentiment remains very high and in fact the april reading of  for current conditions is the highest reading on record for consumer sentiment and retail sales of building materials and garden equipment in the quarter rose at a rate of about  so for the rest of the  and the discussions weve had with distributors dealers and builders all of them are feeling good about the demand in the market and theyre seeing good levels of activity the complaints from builders are similar to what i reported last quarter labor availability and quality and the negative impact of aggressive enforcement of immigration regulations too many too complicated and adds too much expense and higher raw materials costs lumber and panels in particular as i just mentioned there is a heightened level of concern with the recently announced lumber duties assessed against the canadian producers another bright spot for the next few years is expected to be repair and remodeling with home prices rising there is an increased ability to finance new projects with homeowners equity loans in addition with rising mortgage rates there is an incentive to stay in your current home longer with an excellent quarter first quarter behind us and a strong start this quarter i believe that  will be a better year for lp than last year turning to the personnel side im certain that you all saw the press release this morning on the upcoming leadership change at lp after nearly  years working for the safest company in our industry i will be retiring as ceo of lp at the end of june earlier this morning the board of directors named brad southern as lps new chief executive officer effective on july  i have been working with the board for several years to develop a meaningful succession plan for both the executive management of lp and the continued excellence of our board of directors brad was named chief operating officer last november and quickly took on the task of reshaping our organization to be more competitive efficient and positioned to take full advantage of our growth and innovation initiatives with neil sherman heading up siding jason ringblom leading osb and ewp and frederick price expanding in south america as well as the outstanding functional leadership within lp brad has the team in place that will accelerate the positive momentum achieved over the last several years today two of our longtime directors retired colin watson and dan frierson and a third director john weaver decided not to stand for reelection in anticipation of that during  we added tracy embree and ozey horton to the board in anticipation lp is fortunate to have a wellqualified diverse and experienced board of directors to provide guidance and support to management as we continue to execute on our strategies to increase shareholder wealth for me im enjoying coming to work every day while there are certainly challenges and activities that werent fun the people culture and attitudes have made lp a great place to work all the accomplishments over the last  years due to the work and efforts of lps employees and ive been pleased to be a part of these successes i will miss the interactions that ive had with all of you over the years with the analysts and investors you always ask good questions provided us with your thoughts and views and were respectful in our discussions and meetings over the next two months i will be working with brad and his team to ensure a seamless executive transition most of you have met brad and know him to have high integrity be a strategic thinker have strong leadership capabilities with brad at the helm im confident in lps future sallie im going to turn it back to you sallie b bailey  louisianapacific corp great thank you curt charlotte if we can wed like to go to the questions please questionandanswer session operator certainly our first question comes from the line of ketan mamtora from bmo capital markets your line is now open ketan mamtora  bmo capital markets united states good afternoon thank you for taking my question first on dawson creek can you provide some kind of metrics in terms of capex or capacity and timeline william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp so as i mentioned were going to go to the board in july with our detailed engineering and capital request the range of capital probably be between  million and  million as far as capital cost and we are looking at a startup facility in  probably the early part of – like  or early part of  ketan mamtora  bmo capital markets united states and how much capacity would that – this be brad william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp  million feet at the siding ketan mamtora  bmo capital markets united states  million feet and you said this is worth two to three years of demand william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp correct two to three years yes ketan mamtora  bmo capital markets united states i see and so the existing capacity that you have will run through the end of  is that correct william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp that is correct ketan mamtora  bmo capital markets united states and then beyond that when i think about valdor and cook can you talk a little bit about sort of puts and takes between those two you said that cook obviously is brownfield and so there is more of a work that needed to be done there but can you kind of at a high level provide us kind of how you think about those two options that you all have william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp sure so just to remind it to everyone valdor does have equipment in place as an osb mill but it is not running so unlike dawson which is staffed and running we would – we require to hire staff and get it up and operational and convert it from osb to siding the mill is also a smaller mill than either dawson or cook with – from a siding perspective were looking at about  million feet so it would probably be a little quicker rampup in cook because of the existing equipment thats in place for cook as it is more of a brownfield there are few buildings in place on that site but it would be – we would need to construct some buildings do a lot of foundational work and obviously equip the entire mill the advantages of cook though is it is a larger mill it would be about  million square feet so it would be even larger than dawson and has a footprint where down the road even a second press line could be added so there is a lot of – cook gives us a lot of upside on volume its a beautiful land – piece of land beautiful site to construct the mill and then expand it to a second press line in the future if we need to so valdor would be a smaller option but a little quicker getting it up and running ketan mamtora  bmo capital markets united states understood and just to be clear so this  million square feet that you said for cook is just on one line is that correct or second press line william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp that is ketan mamtora  bmo capital markets united states capacity would be on top william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp correct yeah thats the  million square feet that i mentioned is one line correct ketan mamtora  bmo capital markets united states understood and just one followup on dawson so is it fair to say up until the time of conversion the dawson creek mill will be running to osb so i mean the transition should be pretty seamless when you switch over from osb to siding so implying that you could produce osb right until the end of  william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp correct that is very similar to what we did in swan we will produce the osb up until the day we can take the plant down to tiein and do all the conversion – the conversion tieins we were down in dawson for – i mean on swan for four weeks  curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp four months william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp i am sorry four months for the conversion and so were looking at running up to it shut down three to four months and then they come up running a combination of siding and osb as we go through the learning curve ketan mamtora  bmo capital markets united states okay got you thats very helpful ill turn it over and thanks for all the answers william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp okay youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chip dillon from vertical your line is now open clyde alvin dillon  vertical research partners llc hi good afternoon curt brad and sallie sallie b bailey  louisianapacific corp hey chip clyde alvin dillon  vertical research partners llc my first question is just on the siding results it would seem like – and i might have missed the number here i think you said that your production of commodities – of just regular osb there fell so it was like  million square feet this year and what was it last year in the first quarter sallie b bailey  louisianapacific corp other way around it was  million last year and  million –  million square feet last year and  million square feet this year clyde alvin dillon  vertical research partners llc got you so given where prices are it was probably about a  million swing for you if you assume prices were up   yearoveryear is that in the right ballpark curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp for the siding segment thats correct as sallie said clyde alvin dillon  vertical research partners llc early  for that yeah okay and then how much would you estimate i know we had this issue two years ago with a pull forward in the segment but yet i dont – im not sure you were putting it forward a price increase though  strong first quarter in  and then – and unusually it was down seasonally in – despite seasonality in the second quarter a little bit to ebit and when you look at the impact this year i guess there are two pieces one is the positive of the pricing and then – but then there is the negative of the pullforward and im guessing a couple of years ago it could have been  million or  million that went to the first from the second quarter would it be that kind of magnitude this year curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp well remember that one of the reasons why q is typically lower than q is we sell to the prefinishers and they buy ahead so they can prefinish during this spring to get ready for the summer selling season so its not atypical for second quarter to be lower than the first quarter because of that factor and then you add into this the fact that we did put price increases in and we staggered them by segment so weve got price increase in the shed segment in q in march we had a price increase in retail sector and it wasnt till april  or april that we had a price increase for the largest piece which is the distributors so yeah we do think we brought something forward i dont know if i can exactly quantify it sallie b bailey  louisianapacific corp chip this is a very different situation than two years ago two years ago was – as were getting ready to go into swan and so we are putting customers on allocation we do think that part of the reasons that weve pulled some – potentially pulled some demand forward is because we did allow our customers to buy up to – in the first quarter of  to buy up to  more than they bought in the first quarter of  under the old pricing so thats part of what is leaving us to that conclusion so i think we wait to see when we get through the second quarter to be able to quantify the impact clyde alvin dillon  vertical research partners llc and the pricing is what – what was the percentage roughly curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp it was – depending on the segment and the region it was between  and  clyde alvin dillon  vertical research partners llc okay thats very helpful and then just shifting gears back to the expansion and let me just say its been great how you all have given us some – been very candid with some of your thoughts about valdor cook and now dawson and i seem to think last fall it looked like – it seemed like that valdor was your first option and that cook was your second now if i heard you right i believe – and i might have completely missed this but i believe the expansion you just mentioned that would be  million square feet is actually dawson and that valdor is maybe the last option is that fair william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp well no its not – let me tell you the factors that will go into if these are the only two options when we get ready to build or convert the next mill here is what would weigh into those first of all the size so as weve mentioned cook is a lot larger and so itd cover a longer period of time of demand growth there is a nice advantage to valdor though and that is a foot press which is very conducive and optimal for making lap and trim siding so depending on our mix growth over the next couple of years that will weigh on how we make the decision for the next mill swinging in between valdor and cook but i will say if valdor happens to be the next because its so small we would almost immediately have to be working on cook or another option behind that because it could only cover a yearandahalf to two years of growth on our current pace so clyde alvin dillon  vertical research partners llc whereas when you look at dawson which you said was  million feet that would – how much – how long would that cover you for so i know youre good through  so how long should that cover you william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp two to three years clyde alvin dillon  vertical research partners llc two to three years so you really would need to not have to have a cook or valdor out there until like   or so give or take william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp correct clyde alvin dillon  vertical research partners llc okay thats very helpful william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp but both of those would have a lot longer conversion cycle because were not currently operating so we would need to get started on those earlier than were having to do with dawson clyde alvin dillon  vertical research partners llc okay and then the last one real quickly on on dawson i know when curt was giving us some numbers on the siding – unlike valdor and cook there is a difference it looks the siding ratio is maybe  of the square foot put into osb so would that mean that youre giving up maybe  million feet which you ramp up fully at dawson in commodity osb to get the  million feet of siding is that a good guess william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp wed giving up about  million feet the difference in capacity between dawson on osb and dawson on siding is about  million feet clyde alvin dillon  vertical research partners llc okay and curt listen best of luck as you move forward its been great working with you and again its been a pleasure i hope you enjoy your retirement curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp all right thank you chip operator thank you our next question comes from the line of james armstrong from armstrong investment your line is now open james h armstrong  armstrong investment research good afternoon thanks for taking my questions and curt good luck on the retirement curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp thanks james h armstrong  armstrong investment research first up just going back to valdor and cook could either of those come up online as an osb facility before they actually are converted or would those probably stay idle until a conversion actually happens william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp no actually they could both could and would we would want to run osb in either of those two facilities for a while to make sure we have the proper quality control systems in place before siding conversion so the timing of that depends on a lot of factors but we would intend to run either plant on osb for some period of time before converting it to siding james h armstrong  armstrong investment research okay that helps a lot and then switching gears to engineered wood theres a lot of other companies that have gone out with price increases i didnt hear that you had announced a price increase could you remind us if there is one out there what the magnitude is and what do you think the timing will be curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp yeah the first price increase we put in place was in canada and we did about a  price increase there and then in the us were  to  again depending on the product and the region we didnt see any of that in the first quarter well see a little bit in the second quarter but the full impact wont happen until q james h armstrong  armstrong investment research okay that helps a lot and then as you look to volume in osb it was pretty flat while the housing market was up was there anything specific to you that held those volumes flat besides one less day in the quarter or would you probably grow more in line with the market into the second quarter curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp yeah there were two things one we did have some equipment downtime in our peace valley mill that reduced production by about  million feet and then we did the press rebuild at jasper so it was out for  days james h armstrong  armstrong investment research okay so  james h armstrong  armstrong investment research yeah perfect thank you very much thats all i had sallie b bailey  louisianapacific corp great thank you james operator thank you our next question comes from the line of gail glazerman from roe equity research your line is now open gail s glazerman  roe equity research hi thank you good afternoon just a quick follow up on that last comment i thought you had a pretty big rebuild last first quarter as well can you just give us a sense of either in volume andor cost how that might have compare to what you saw this year curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp the hanceville outage was a little shorter its about  days versus  days so that was probably an eight day difference gail s glazerman  roe equity research okay and going back to the conversion project and again piggybacking something james was asking about i mean is there anything in your system that you would think of doing perhaps like restarting valdor as you look ahead to losing the osb volume at dawson and do you have wood licenses at valdor sorted out yet or no william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp we do not have the wood license sorted out at valdor back to the question about would you run osb before siding at cook or valdor both of those options would be considered as a way to secure market share out of dawson as we converted the siding but the timing of that is yet to be worked out thats how feasible that is gail s glazerman  roe equity research okay and on engineered wood i know you had referenced that you had seen some prebuying in siding ahead of the price increase did you see any prebuying in engineered wood ahead of those price increases curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp we dont think so because generally what we do is engineered wood is a little bit different because our dealers and distributors lock in projects and we guarantee in pricing for that project and so thats why it takes longer to get a price increase through to the bottom line in engineered wood because youre committed from a pricing standpoint to those projects gail s glazerman  roe equity research okay and just one last one curt could you maybe flesh out a little bit the comments youre making about i guess customers allocating maybe some more working capital to buying lumber ahead of duties and how that impacted you curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp yeah we had two specific distributors tell us that they bought lumber ahead in anticipation of the duties coming into place so that they could save money on that and make a little bit better margin and as a result so if they had  million they could spend on inventory they spend more on lumber than they would have normally and so they spent less on siding and putting the siding inventory in place gail s glazerman  roe equity research okay curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp so i think it affected our siding business gail s glazerman  roe equity research okay thank you sallie b bailey  louisianapacific corp great thanks gail operator thank you our next question comes from the line of george staphos from bank of america your line is now open john p babcock  bank of america merrill lynch good morning this is actually john babcock on the line for george i just want to followup quickly on the siding projects you mentioned that you might be running osb for a period of time there would any of that be marketed outside of lpx or would that largely just be trials that youd be running there curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp it would be sold by our osb team im not sure i got the question john p babcock  bank of america merrill lynch no i just wanted to see because i mean occasionally some companies will run product but it wont necessarily be of good enough quality to actually sell outside and so i just want to kind of get some color there curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp but wed expect it to be first quality william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp yes i mean there would obviously be some startup board at the very beginning but we would be fighting to get to a grade in a matter of days at a new startup john p babcock  bank of america merrill lynch okay sounds good and then as far as for the full year are you still expecting well full year and also longer term guidance still expecting growth of around  to  in the siding business sallie b bailey  louisianapacific corp well they didnt really guide and so we want to be clear on that just from an fte point of view but from a trending point of view yes absolutely and – yes thats our expectation  to  revenue growth and  adjusted ebitda margins john p babcock  bank of america merrill lynch okay sounds good i think otherwise my other questions have been answered thanks sallie b bailey  louisianapacific corp great thanks john operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mark weintraub from buckingham research your line is now open mark weintraub  the buckingham research group inc okay not to beat a dead horse so just are there other ways that you might be able to increase your osb capacity to fill in for the dawson creek besides of valdor or cook or if you end up going that strategy would likely be via valdor or cook william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp well we are buyer for osb capacity in aspen wood baskets as a part of our strategy to grow our siding business also i will say we are not running our peace valley operation which is in british columbia fairly drivable distance from dawson creek at full capacity today and so some of that volume would transfer into peace as we continue to optimize that location which is a very large osb mill for us so the nearterm solution would be to fill up – get peace running at capacity and fill it up with volume out of dawson after that then were looking at some optimization across the rest of our footprint and then valdor and cook being two options that are in our portfolio today mark weintraub  the buckingham research group inc okay william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp let me also remind you that when we start up a siding mill so like dawson has  million feet of siding capacity we wont have  million feet of siding demand immediately most likely and so we will be running osb – we will continue to run osb within our siding system at both dawson and back at hayward so it doesnt – the lost osb capacity doesnt just go away at the conversion we just move that volume around our existing system particularly in siding so that all our mills are running at full capacity and balancing between siding and osb mark weintraub  the buckingham research group inc understood and just one point of clarification where you had talked about both valdor and cook that there would be – that would be a longer process than at dawson creek how much of that is a function of you going through the process and where you would be making osb for a while versus it being higher – getting the staffing in place and all that because theyre not up and going and maybe if you could just give a little bit more clarity on – from the point you say its a go on valdor to how long itd be before you would be able to make osb versus how long after making osb it would be then appropriate to be moving into the siding market william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp so i would say and these are rough estimates but were probably looking at from the very go on cook two years including the permitting time in that timeframe and if we had our  we would like to run osb six months before converting it to siding and then valdor would be something less than that given the fact that the equipments in place there mark weintraub  the buckingham research group inc okay great so maybe  months instead of the two years or more like  months  william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp yes  to  months for valdor mark weintraub  the buckingham research group inc okay terrific very helpful thanks william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp and as a preliminary part of that the critical item would be securing the wood license mark weintraub  the buckingham research group inc okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steve chercover from davidson your line is now open steven pierre chercover  da davidson  co thanks so i guess i will try and beat a dead horse philosophically are you guys prepared to actually seed share in osb because somethings got to pick up the slack i assume curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp well this plan does seed share because were converting on existing osb mill into siding but as brad said part of the plan would be to run osb at a future siding location steven pierre chercover  da davidson  co yes but since youre being transparent and i appreciate that do your customers get concerned that you will be less of a factor in osb going forward curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp i dont think so no i dont believe that steven pierre chercover  da davidson  co all right and then switching gears to south america i know its not a huge needle mover but operating income and ebitda were flat but sales were up so why were the margins down was there something operational sallie b bailey  louisianapacific corp steve that was the point i was trying to make about selling the imported product as youre aware when we import product into chile from either brazil or from one of our north american facilities we really dont get much margin on that if any and so the sales the increase is primarily due to sales of imported products steven pierre chercover  da davidson  co okay and just how is south america doing is it finally particularly brazil coming out of its funk and when will that third line in chile be ready for prime time curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp so brazil is not coming out of the funk theres new scandals just about every week in the paper the housing market in brazil is down between  and  and it remains down whats saving us in brazil is our ability to ship into china and as well selling the product into chile although as sallie said we dont get a lot of margins we give it to the shipper as far as when the third mill will be operational it should be the third quarter of next year steven pierre chercover  da davidson  co great well thanks and congratulations to both you curt and to brad william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp thank you curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp thanks steve operator thank you our next question comes from the line of paul quinn from rbc capital markets your line is now open paul quinn  rbc dominion securities inc yes thanks very much first off congratulations curt you steered lp through some very interesting times both on the high side and also on the low side so curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp thanks paul quinn  rbc dominion securities inc and choose to fill there brad couple of questions wondering just because of the investor focus on capacity adds what is dawson running at now in terms of osb production i thought it was more on the valueadded side it wasnt running at a full  million capacity curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp well it is running valueadded product its running some more flooring product and techshield principally techshield doesnt take the capacity out because its a full process when you add the foil to it run a roughly  million william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp  million curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp  million square feet right now paul quinn  rbc dominion securities inc okay and then in terms of the increased shipments in chile is that coming from primarily brazil or is that coming from north america and if its coming from north america does it have any kind of financial impact on the segments result curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp no we didnt ship any from north america in the last quarter its all from brazil paul quinn  rbc dominion securities inc okay and then just on the siding conversion of dawson it looks like its  per thousand higher than i think what you did at swan maybe you could just remind us of the cost and what the difference is curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp yes well one of the things were trying to do and i think brad said it and while we didnt emphasize it enough is we dont have the detailed engineering done on the conversion yet and so thats what the intention is between now and july is to get that detailed engineering down so we all have a plus or minus  budget for that mill and youre right what brad said is its somewhere between  million  million and swan it was  million but what brads including is  million to  million is more capability than we put into swan we did it in swan and we just made it into a panel facility so you dont have the capability to do lap and trim which adds about  million to the cost so thats principally what would be one of the reasons if we put that extra capability on sallie b bailey  louisianapacific corp thats a good plan for our investor trip to hayward in june because i think i mean this quite seriously i think its a lot easier to visualize the various ways that we have siding how we manufacture siding by actually same as in the mill so i know youre on the list paul so well make sure we address that when we see you in june paul quinn  rbc dominion securities inc great okay and then just longterm and i guess maybe this is a question for brad as youre taking over what do you see lp being in five years is this going to be  osb company  siding or with the growth of siding and sort of the shrinkage of osb actually put you more into the siding camp william bradley southern  louisianapacific corp well wed say theyre aggressive in large growth opportunity being in our siding business what were talking about the  to  growth and obviously in osb there is still some upside on volume because of some of our larger commodity plans have some capacity to – from better optimization so that mix is going to swing and also let me add to we do have valueadd products like flameblock lots of legacy flooring product that we launched this quarter that are high valueadd osb products that were pushing and growing as well so our strategy is not to lessen our exposure to osb in a large sense but to move up the value chain so that we are having more stable and higher margin products produced with a lot of emphasis on growing our siding business but also a lot of opportunity in our osb business in areas like techshield flooring and flameblock to grow high valueadd products enriching our mix there as well you can do the math on the capacities given what were doing with the dawson conversion and to figure out we end up being – when well be  and when well be  either way but our focus is on that  to  revenue growth in siding and continue to have valueadd growth in our osb products paul quinn  rbc dominion securities inc okay and maybe i can ask a bonus one just youve got one main competitor in the siding side whose valuation is essentially double of yours right now on an ebitda multiple basis what percentage of siding do you think you need to get to for the market to recognize the business that youve got there curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp i think the market is beginning to recognize us and i think that you and your other brethren have been helpful to us and pointing out that there is more of a building material on the siding than imported products but i think were going to make incremental progress every quarter as we continue to show growth and we continue to show the earnings potential out of the siding business paul quinn  rbc dominion securities inc excellent thanks very much curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp i wish i could give you a better answer but weve been scratching our head on that for four years paul quinn  rbc dominion securities inc me too thanks sallie b bailey  louisianapacific corp thanks paul operator thank you our final question comes from the line of chip dillon from vertical your line is now open clyde alvin dillon  vertical research partners llc yes i just had a quick followup and that is based on sort of plans you have with – all the activity with the plant in south america and the conversion at dawson what should we be using at this point for capex both for this year and next year sallie b bailey  louisianapacific corp well for this year chip  million to  million and we havent given capex guidance yet for  but you think about the plans weve been talking about i think that gives you some new build off of some place between  million and  million for maintenance capital that will have some high capital needs in  as well clyde alvin dillon  vertical research partners llc so it looks like it should be – youre going to be fighting most of the spending on dawson next year so it would be probably similar to this year if not may be a tad higher sallie b bailey  louisianapacific corp i would not disagree with that statement clyde alvin dillon  vertical research partners llc okay all right thanks again curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp but thats not guidance thats not guidance chip clyde alvin dillon  vertical research partners llc i understand its my guess but that helps and curt i will not – well not come looking for you to hold you to it thank you curtis m stevens  louisianapacific corp all right sallie b bailey  louisianapacific corp all right well great thank you chip and charlotte i think thats all the time we have for questions so if you could
