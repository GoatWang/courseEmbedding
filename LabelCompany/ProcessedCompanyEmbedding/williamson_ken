statements book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide estuarine sediment controls on trace metal distributions by r j daviescolley book  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide sediments are the major compartment in aquatic environments for many materials of toxic or nutrient concern the lack of knowledge of the phase associations of toxic metals in sediments is the largest deficiency in our understanding of the environmental hazard posed by metal contamination this study examined the sedimentary partitioning of copper and cadmium with the goal of predicting the environmental fate of these metals in estuaries five solid phases synthetic hydrous oxides of iron and manganese montmorillonite clay a synthetic aluminosilicate gel and estuarine humic substances ehs extracted from a natural sediment were chosen to simulate components responsible for trace metal binding in oxidized sediments the uptake of copper and cadmium by these model phases in artificial seawater was measured as a function of ph and salinity affinity of the model phases for cadmium as measured by ksubscript p the slope of the linear adsorption isotherm was in the following order manganese iron ehs aluminosilicates montmorillonite copper binding affinities were much higher than those of cadmium but the relative order of affinity of the phases was similar except for copper binding by ehs for which ksubscript p was relatively higher exceeding that of iron metal binding was not influenced by interactions involved in three types of phase complex ironclay ironhumic and clayironhumic suggesting that experiments with isolated phases are adequate to predict partitioning the measured ksubscript p values were used to calibrate a simple model for predicting partitioning and total metal uptake by sediments this model which is analogous to speciation in a solution of competing ligands predicts that cadmium uptake by estuarine sediments is dominated by iron while both iron and organics are important for copper results of selective extraction studies and studies of cadmium uptake by natural estuarine sediments are in semiquantitative agreement with these predictions in anaerobic sediments thermodynamic calculations suggest that copper and cadmium concentrations are determined by equilibria involving solid sulphides and bisulphide and polysulphide complexes it is expected that the results of this investigation will aid in assessing the environmental significance of metalcontaminated estuaries monitoring

project completion report owrr project n aorew october    september   by stewart m oakley book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide trace metals in the aquatic environment are generally concentrated on the surface of solid geochemical phases which eventually become incorporated into estuarine and marine sediments the mechanism of trace metal concentration is believed to be adsorption with various geochemical phases such as hydrous metal oxides clays and organic matter metals in estuarine or marine sediments can thus be expected to be partitioned between different phases depending on the concentration of the phase and the strength of the adsorption bond the bioavailability of sedimentbound metals to depositfeeding organisms will depend on trace metal partitioning and the kinetics of biological metal uptake from each geochemical phase the present study was undertaken to develop models for trace metal partitioning and bioavailability in marine sediments an equilibrium adsorption model was developed that can be used to predict the partitioning of trace metals between different geochemical phases in aquatic sediments from laboratory studies the model uses conditional equilibrium constants determined from the linear portion of an adsorption isotherm conditional equilibrium constants deterit mined for the adsorption of cu and cd on bentonite clay feoh₃ mn₂ and humic acid in seawater show that the model is applicable for trace metal concentrations existing in the natural environment based on the laboratory results the model predicts that the clay fraction may be a major sink for cu and cd in marine sediments a kinetic bioavailability model was then developed which can be used to estimate the relative bioavailability of trace metals from both different sediment phases and seawater under shortterm laboratory conditions this model was used to determine the bioavailability of cu and cd from several sediment phases bentonite clay humic acid feoh₃ and seawater to the depositfeeding polychaete worm abarenicola pacifica the results suggest that under natural conditions similar to those used in this study the bioavailability of sedimentbound cu and cd to a pacifica can be much more significant than that of seawater gravel disturbance impacts on salmon habitat and stream health  a report for the
