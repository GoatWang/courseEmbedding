and for exercising options and selling more than half of her equity position – approximately  million worth of dupont shares – a move peltz claims demonstrates kullman does not believe in the company

leaders the courage to do the right thing – to build long term enterprises”jeffrey sonnenfeld senior associate dean for leadership studies at yale school of managementthey point to a march  letter sent to chief executives and board chairmen by laurence fink chief executive of blackrock the worlds largest money management firm with  trillion in assets under management in it fink says blackrock has engaged with companies clients and regulators to instill the importance of taking a longterm approach to creating value that builds a better society and a stronger economywe have done so in response to the acute pressure growing with every quarter for companies to meet shortterm financial goals at the expense of building longterm value fink wrote this pressure originates from a number of sources – the proliferation of activist shareholders seeking immediate returns the everincreasing velocity of capital a media landscape defined by the  news cycle and a shrinking attention span and public policy that fails to encourage truly longterm investmentfink wrote that ceos and boards have a fiduciary duty to longterm investors many of whom count on shares purchased from quality companies for their retirementssuccessfully fulfilling that duty requires… that they corporate leaders resist the pressure of shortterm shareholders to extract value from the company if it would compromise value creation for longterm owners… finks letter saysskip in skipxembedxshareclose ceo ellen kullman is leading dupont co through a historic proxy war between dupont and peltz’s trian fund management
