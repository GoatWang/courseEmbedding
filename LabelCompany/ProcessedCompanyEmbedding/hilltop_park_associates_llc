highlanders it was also the temporary home of the new york giants during a twomonth period in  while the polo grounds was being rebuilt after a fire the ballparks formal name as painted on its exterior walls was american league park because the park was located on top of a ridge of manhattan island it came to be known as hilltop park and its team was most often called the new york highlanders as well as the americans and the yankees this highland connection contrasted with their intracity rivals the giants whose polo grounds was just a few blocks away in the bottomland under coogans bluff hilltop park sat on the block bounded by broadway th street fort washington avenue and th street the structure consisted of a covered grandstand stretching from first base to third base and uncovered bleacher sections down the right and left field lines originally built in just six weeks the park sat  with standing room for an additional  or so the bleachers were covered in  and also

highlanders played the washington senators the ballpark site was quite large for its time  acres or nearly double the size of many ballpark sites of that era and the south portion of the land plot was used for the parking of first carriages and later automobiles the shape of the land plot was a large trapezoid with right angles at the sites northeast and southeast corners the left field foul line ran mostly north to south and was parallel to fort washington road the western boundary of the park the left field foul line would if extended about  additional feet have intersected th street at less

capacity in the deadball era was a flexible concept in accordance with the practices of the day overflow crowds were allowed to stand in the perimeter of the outfield in addition for big games additional standees were allowed down the foul lines and between home plate and the backstop thus the effective overall capacity of the park was closer to  although even when stuffed to the gills it

third bases and a clubhouse was located behind the center field fence singledeck bleachers that extended down both foul lines reached from the grandstand almost to the fences the third base bleachers were not finished until june  these first and third base bleachers angled towards the foul lines reducing the foul area at the fences to about  feet a modestsized scoreboard was in fair territory down

burned hilltop park was not in good condition when it opened there was a swamp in right field that had yet to be filled with rock the outfield had no grass the grandstand had not been completed and players had to dress at their hotel rooms because the clubhouse was not completed when hilltop park was finally completed a single tier wooden covered grandstand extended from the third base dugout to homeplate and around to the first base dugout uncovered grandstands extended to both foul poles from behind homeplate fans could see scenic views of the hudson river and new jersey palisades a

mlb  hilltop park was the nickname of a baseball park that stood in the washington heights neighborhood of new york city it was the home of the new york yankees major league baseball club from  to  when they were known as the highlanders it was also the temporary home of the new york giants during a twomonth period in  while the polo grounds was being rebuilt after a fire the ballparks formal name as painted on its exterior walls was american league park because the park was located on top of a ridge of manhattan island it came to be known as hilltop park and its team was most often called the new york highlanders as well as the americans and the yankees this highland connection contrasted with their intracity rivals the giants whose polo grounds was just a few blocks away in the bottomland under coogans bluff hilltop park sat on the block bounded by broadway th street fort washington avenue and th street the structure consisted of a covered grandstand stretching from first base to third base and uncovered bleacher sections down the right and left field lines originally built in just six weeks the park sat  with standing room for an additional  or so the bleachers were covered in  and also bleachers to seat an additional  fans were built in  partially to accommodate giants fans who were temporary tenants after the polo grounds fire in center field the field was initially huge by modern standards —  ft  m to left field  ft  m to center field and  ft  m to right field an inner fence was soon constructed to create more realistic action both the park and the nickname highlanders were abandoned when the american leaguers left at the beginning of the  season to rent the polo grounds from the giants the polo grounds had a far larger seating capacity and by that time was made of concrete due to the  fire hilltop park was demolished in  contents  history  cy young and walter johnson  ty cobb  hilltop park site now  references  external links historyedit the entrance to hilltop park  american league baseball came to new york city in  when gambler frank j farrell and former new york city police chief william s devery bought the baltimore orioles franchise for  they established the team at hilltop park a hastily constructed wooden park seating about  fans on the west side of broadway between th and th streets opening day came on april   when the new york highlanders played the washington senators the ballpark site was quite large for its time  acres or nearly double the size of many ballpark sites of that era and the south portion of the land plot was used for the parking of first carriages and later automobiles the shape of the land plot was a large trapezoid with right angles at the sites northeast and southeast corners the left field foul line ran mostly north to south and was parallel to fort washington road the western boundary of the park the left field foul line would if extended about  additional feet have intersected th street at less than ° the right field foul line would if extended have intersected broadway the eastern boundary of the park at more than ° the ballpark site was thus trapezoidal in shape and large for the deadball era hilltop park in  mlb rules then allowed for standingroomonly fans to take up the foul lines and along the outfield fences the seating capacity of  was also rather large for this time period capacity in the deadball era was a flexible concept in accordance with the practices of the day overflow crowds were allowed to stand in the perimeter of the outfield in addition for big games additional standees were allowed down the foul lines and between home plate and the backstop thus the effective overall capacity of the park was closer to  although even when stuffed to the gills it fell well short of the normal capacity of the polo grounds the original  construction of hilltop park cost about  more than twothirds of which was spent for rock blasting and excavations and the groundskeeper of the highlanders phil schenck laid out the playing field the ballpark consisted of a covered grandstand of three sections although it was not actually roofed until june  that season two sections of the grandstand were parallel to the foul lines and the third section was a short intermediate diagonal which formed the backstop the grandstand extended a short way past both first and third bases and a clubhouse was located behind the center field fence singledeck bleachers that extended down both foul lines reached from the grandstand almost to the fences the third base bleachers were not finished until june  these first and third base bleachers angled towards the foul lines reducing the foul area at the fences to about  feet a modestsized scoreboard was in fair territory down the left field foul line the main entrance to the park was on broadway and a ramp led up to the top of the first base grandstand unlike many of the other contemporary wooden ballparksthis one never burned hilltop park was not in good condition when it opened there was a swamp in right field that had yet to be filled with rock the outfield had no grass the grandstand had not been completed and players had to dress at their hotel rooms because the clubhouse was not completed when hilltop park was finally completed a single tier wooden covered grandstand extended from the third base dugout to homeplate and around to the first base dugout uncovered grandstands extended to both foul poles from behind homeplate fans could see scenic views of the hudson river and new jersey palisades a bleacher section was placed in the center field corner around  painted black to serve as a batters eye screen after the polo grounds burnt down in  the highlandersyankees offered to share their facility with the new york giants and the grateful national leaguers took up temporary residence in hilltop park after two more seasons the american leaguers moved a few blocks east and south into the rebuilt polo grounds to sublease from the giants and the nickname highlanders was dropped as the team was now strictly the yankees the last big league game played at hilltop park was on october   the park was demolished in  hilltop park circa  cy young and walter johnsonedit hilltop park in  the three buildings above the bleachers still stand today  on th street and broadway two hall of fame pitchers had good outings at hilltop park in  on june   cy young pitched a nohitter against new york winning handily  this was the third and final nohitter in youngs illustrious career the game coverage by the new york times the following day along with a summary of youngs career is noteworthy in that the locals were referred to as the new york yankees or yanks throughout the article demonstrating how common the nickname was by then and with no reference at all to highlanders the times also consistently referred to the hilltop by its formal name the american league park the complete book of baseball a new york times scrapbook history arno press bobbsmerrill  p  one of the more impressive pitching performances of all time took place at the hilltop on september   yearold walter johnson of the washington senatorsnationals shut out the highlanders  with a fivehitter the next day johnson again blanked the yankees  on a threehitter the citys blue law prevented a game on sunday on monday september  senators manager joe cantillon again gave johnson the ball and he improved again this time hurling a twohit  victory over the hilltoppers his third shutout in the space of four days ty cobbedit cobb stealing third at hilltop park detroit outfielder ty cobb the georgia peach made many a mark on the game of baseball some famous and some infamous at least one of each happened at the hilltop in a game sometime in  according to photographer charles m conlon some sources claim an alternate date july   conlon snapped a photo of cobb sliding into third base stealing the base and spilling highlanders third baseman jimmy austin this photo became one of the most famous and widely circulated baseball photos ever on may   after being heckled for several innings cobb leaped the fence and attacked his tormentor he was suspended indefinitely by league president ban johnson but his suspension was eventually reduced to  days and  the tigers went on a onegame strike for the next game at philadelphia but rather than forfeit the tigers owners filled the lineup with a makeshift group of excollege players and whoever else could be found coincidentally one of the substitutes billy maharg would become involved behindthescenes in the black sox scandal seven years later hilltop park site nowedit plaque marking the former site of home plate at hilltop park closeup

ballparksthis one never burned hilltop park was not in good condition when it opened there was a swamp in right field that had yet to be filled with rock the outfield had no grass the grandstand had not been completed and players had to dress at their hotel rooms because the clubhouse was not completed when hilltop park was finally completed a single tier wooden covered grandstand extended from the third base dugout to homeplate and around to the first base dugout uncovered grandstands extended to both foul poles from behind homeplate fans could see scenic views of the hudson river and new jersey palisades a bleacher section was placed in the center field corner around  painted black to serve as a batters eye screen after the polo grounds burnt down in  the highlandersyankees offered to share their facility with the new york giants and the grateful national leaguers took up temporary residence in hilltop park after two more seasons the american leaguers moved a few blocks east and south into the rebuilt polo grounds to sublease from the giants and the nickname highlanders was dropped as the team was now strictly the yankees the last big league game played at hilltop park was on october   the park was demolished in  hilltop park circa  cy young and walter johnsonedit hilltop park in  the three buildings above the bleachers still stand today  on th street and broadway two hall of fame pitchers had good outings at hilltop park in  on june   cy young pitched a nohitter against new york winning handily  this was the third and final nohitter in youngs illustrious career the game coverage by the new york times the following day along with a summary of youngs career is noteworthy in that the locals were referred to as the new york yankees or yanks throughout the article demonstrating how common the nickname was by then and with no reference at all to highlanders the times also consistently referred to the hilltop by its formal name the american league park the complete book of baseball a new york times scrapbook history arno press bobbsmerrill  p  one of the more impressive pitching performances of all time took place at the hilltop on september   yearold walter johnson of the washington senatorsnationals shut out the highlanders  with a fivehitter the next day johnson again blanked the yankees  on a threehitter the citys blue law prevented a game on sunday on monday september  senators manager joe cantillon again gave johnson the ball and he improved again this time hurling a twohit  victory over the hilltoppers his third shutout in the space of four days ty cobbedit cobb stealing third at hilltop park detroit outfielder ty cobb the georgia peach made many a mark on the game of baseball some famous and some infamous at least one of each happened at the hilltop in a game sometime in  according to photographer charles m conlon some sources claim an alternate date july   conlon snapped a photo of cobb sliding into third base stealing the base and spilling highlanders third baseman jimmy austin this photo became one of the most famous and widely circulated baseball photos ever on may   after being heckled for several innings cobb leaped the fence and attacked his tormentor he was suspended indefinitely by league president ban johnson but his suspension was eventually reduced to  days and  the tigers went on a onegame strike for the next game at philadelphia but rather than forfeit the tigers owners filled the lineup with a makeshift group of excollege players and whoever else could be found coincidentally one of the
