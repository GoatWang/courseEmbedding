marketbeating performance for decades to come matthew frankel tmfmathguy dec   at am physicians realty trust nysedoc is a real estate investment trust reit specializing in healthcare real estate not only does this relative newcomer pay an impressive  dividend yield but the company has potential to deliver marketbeating total returns if its early performance is any indication of the future heres what you need to know about physicians realty trust and how it stands out from the competition about physicans realty trust physicians realty trust is a reit that invests in healthcare properties the company currently owns  properties in  states representing  million square feet of leasable space mostly in the eastern half of the us the vast majority  of the portfolio consists of medical office buildings with a small but significant amount of hospital properties as well a relatively new reit physicians realty trust completed its ipo in july  and has grown tremendously in the short amount of time since then why should you invest in healthcare real estate simply put it is a nearcertainty that demand for healthcare facilities will grow during the coming decades according to forecasts from the us census bureau national healthcare expenditures will increase by  over the next decade image source physicians realty trust  this is due to a combination of catalysts such as the affordable care act which has provided accessible healthcare for millions of previously uninsured people as well as the aging us population in fact the andover population is expected to double by the year  and the plus and plus age groups are projected to grow at an even faster rate image source physicians realty trust ambitious growth but a smart balance sheet since completing its ipo a little over two years ago physicans realty trust has grown rapidly with total investments rising from  million to  billion in just over two years including  million in new acquisitions this year alone impressively the company has achieved this level of growth while maintaining a conservative balance sheet through five followon equity offerings management has been able to finance most of its acquisitions without taking on an excessive level of debt in fact the companys fixed charge coverage ratio of  times is more conservative than many of its healthcare reit peers in other words the company earns  for every dollar in fixed charges such as interest that it is obligated to pay for comparison welltower nysehcn one of the sector leaders has a fixed charge coverage ratio of  times the strategy is simple yet effective physicians realty trust looks to capitalize on its existing relationships with physicians and hospitals in order to buy offmarket properties that could produce the best possible longterm returns for its investors by targeting properties in the  million to  million range there is little competition for the best deals from the larger healthcare reits a limited history  but so far so good ive mentioned that physicians realty trust is relatively new especially compared to some of the healthcare reit heavyweights – many of which have impressive records for example welltower has delivered an average  annual total return since its  ipo a remarkable level of performance to sustain for over three decades so if you want timetested performance physicians realty trust is probably not the best choice for you however the early results look promising since its ipo physicians realty trust has outperformed the snl us healthcare reit index by more than   achieved through a combination of the smart and unique acquisition strategy and an impressive  occupancy rate for comparison heres a look at physicians realty trusts performance compared with some of its peers a word about valuation and the competition its tough to compare physicians realty trust to its competition from a valuation perspective simply because a rapidly growing company doesnt have the earnings consistency that decadesold established companies do for example when looking at physicians realty trusts normalized funds from operations or ffo the reit version of earnings over the past four quarters we arrive at a pricetoffo ratio of  which is admittedly on the high side of peers however when you consider the fact that the companys normalized ffo has grown by  over the past year alone the higher valuation could easily be justified in fact by extrapolating the most recent quarters normalized ffo  over a year we arrive at a much more attractive pffo of  based on s third quarter heres how physicians realty trust stacks up to some of its peers company ticker symbol share price market cap q  ffoshare normalized priceffo welltower hcn   billion   hcp hcp   billion   medical properties trust mpw   billion   national health investors nhi   billion   omega healthcare investors ohi   billion   physicians realty trust doc   billion   data source each reits thirdquarter earnings release ffo  funds from operations note share price and market cap as of  as you can see physicians realty trust is indeed valued at a premium to peers bear in mind however that while reits are usually not valued as growth stocks physicians realty trust is growing rapidly in terms of both assets and earnings and this should be taken into account when examining its valuation the foolish bottom line physicians realty trust is an ambitious new player in an area of real estate that looks quite promising over the coming decades if the company can continue to use its relationships with physicians and hospitals to create value for shareholders this reit could potentially evolve into one of the sector leaders  and make its investors lots of money along the way matthew frankel owns shares of
