implementation of an innovative but ultimately unsuccessful strategy quarterly strategic reviews based in part on the firms balanced scorecard led executives at store to identify problems with and eventually abandon this strategy over a twoyear period we find that formal statistical tests of the hypotheses underlying the firms balanced scorecard and strategy map reveal problems with the strategy on a timelier basis we also test alternative hypotheses to those underlying the firms formal strategy map and scorecard that are consistent with concerns expressed by some of stores top executives during the initial stages of implementing the new strategy our analysis demonstrates that this firms balanced scorecard contained useful and timely information for distinguishing between these alternatives these results provide some of the first fieldbased evidence on the potential for a firms balanced scorecard to provide useful information for detecting problems in its strategy

article  accounting review organizational design and control across multiple markets the case of franchising in the convenience store industry dennis campbell srikant m datar and tatiana sandino many companies operate units that are dispersed across different types of markets and thus serve significantly diverging customer bases such markettype dispersion is likely to compromise the headquarters ability to control its local managers behavior and satisfy the divergent needs of different types of customers in this paper we find evidence that markettype dispersion is an important determinant of delegation and the provision of incentives using a sample of convenience store chains we show that markettype dispersion is related to the degree of franchising at the chain level as well as the probability of franchising a given store within a chain our results are robust to alternative definitions of markettype dispersion and to other determinants of franchising such as the stores geographic distance from headquarters and geographic dispersion additional analyses also suggest that chains that do not franchise at all may cope with markettype dispersion by decentralizing operations from headquarters to their stores and to a weaker extent by providing higher variable pay to their store managers keywords business headquarters geographic location governance controls
