investor should read the following summary together with the more detailed information regarding the company and the common stock being sold in this offering including “risk factors” and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus   the company   history   forge innovation development corp the “company” or “forge” was originally formed to develop approximately  acres of land in desert hot springs california in march  the company sold that property and is currently looking for other properties both land and buildings in southern california to develop andor manage the company was incorporated in the state of nevada on january   and was formerly known as yougo enterprises llc in november  the company changed its status from an llc to a corporation and changed its name to forge innovation development corp   business   the company’s primary objective is commercial and residential land development including the purchase and sale of real estate targeting properties primarily in southern california we also intend to manage properties we own and properties owned by unaffiliated third parties our activities will include securing acquisition rights to properties obtaining zoning and other entitlements for the properties securing financing for purchase of the properties improving the properties’ infrastructure and amenities and selling the properties to homeowner and commercial owners for restaurants offices and small businesses our first property acquisition was  acres in desert hot springs in southern california due to problems with permits and adjacent landowners rather than get involved in protracted negotiations the company sold the property to an independent third party for a profit   risks and uncertainties facing the company   as a development stage company the company has limited operating history and has experienced losses since its inception the company needs to create a source of revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans as a development stage company management of the company has limited experience in building and selling projects similar to that planned by the company and in marketing and distributing such projects on a broad scale   one of the biggest challenges facing the company is the ability to raise adequate capital to pursue its business plan of land acquisition land development and construction sale or lease of projects and providing real estate management services   due to financial constraints the company has to date conducted limited operations if the company were unable to develop strong and reliable sources of funding it is unlikely that the company could develop its operations to return revenue sufficient to further develop its business plan moreover the above assumes that the company’s efforts are met with customer satisfaction in the marketplace and exhibit steady adoption of its real estate projects amongst the potential base of customers neither of which are currently known or guaranteed   trading market   currently there is no trading market for the securities of the company the company intends to initially apply for admission to quotation of its securities on the otc bulletin board as soon as possible which may be while this offering is still in process there can be no assurance that the company will qualify for quotation of its securities on the otc bulletin board   the offering   the maximum number of shares that can be sold pursuant to the terms of this offering is  the offering will terminate twentyfour  months from the date of this prospectus unless earlier terminated by the company   this prospectus relates to the offer and sale of  shares of common stock of forge innovation development corp offered by the holders thereof who are deemed to be statutory underwriters the selling shareholders will offer their shares at a price of  until such time as the shares are quoted on the otc bulletin board and only thereafter at prevailing market or privately negotiated prices in one or more transactions that may take place by ordinary broker’s transactions privatelynegotiated transactions or through sales to one or more dealers for resale or at prevailing market if a market should develop   common stock outstanding before the offering                 common stock for sale by selling shareholders                  common stock outstanding after the offering                  offering price                 proceeds to the company          based on number of shares outstanding as of the date of this prospectus         table of contents     risk factors   a purchase of any shares is an investment in the company’s common stock and involves a high degree of risk investors should consider carefully the following information about these risks together with the other information contained in the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part before the purchase of any shares if any of the following risks actually occur the business financial condition or results of operations of the company would likely suffer the market price of the common stock would likely decline and investors could lose all or a portion of their investment the company has listed the following risk factors which it believes to be that material to an investment decision in this offering   risks relating to the company   we have a limited operating history on which to judge our business prospects and management   the company was originally formed as a limited liability company in january  and after organizing and developing a business plan it began more formal operations in april  accordingly we have only a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and we cannot assure you that the company will achieve or sustain profitability the company’s prospects must be considered in light of the risks encountered by companies in the early stage of development particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets future operating results will depend upon many factors including increasing the number of affiliates our success in attracting and retaining motivated and qualified personnel our ability to establish short term credit lines our ability to develop and market develop and manage real estate control costs and general economic conditions we cannot assure you that the company will successfully address any of these risks   the company has accumulated deficit as of march   of    as of march   the company has an accumulated deficit of  this deficit may impact on the company in various ways including but not limited to making it more difficult to borrow money sell stock or to maintain a good market price   we are significantly influenced by our officers directors and entities affiliated with them   in the aggregate ownership of the company’s shares by management and affiliated parties and assuming all shares offered are sold represents approximately  of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock mr liang acting alone will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by shareholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations transactions our future performance is dependent on the ability to retain key personnel the company performance is substantially dependent on the performance of senior management the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition   we may need and may be unable to obtain additional funding on satisfactory terms which could dilute our stockholders or impose burdensome financial restrictions on our business   we have relied upon cash from the sale of our assets and financing activities and in the future we intend to rely on revenues generated from operations to fund all of the cash requirements of our activities there is no assurance that we will be able to generate any significant cash from our operating activities in the future deteriorating global economic conditions and the effects of ongoing military actions against terrorists may cause prolonged declines in investor confidence in and accessibility to capital markets future financing may not be available on a timely basis in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us this financing may also dilute existing stockholders’ equity any debt financing or other financing of securities senior to common stock will likely include financial and other covenants that will restrict our flexibility at a minimum we expect these covenants to include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock any failure to comply with these covenants would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations because we could lose our existing sources of funding and impair our ability to secure new sources of funding    many very large and wellfunded companies have or are entering into various aspects of the real estate market that we intend serve or that they are offering real estate products and services that directly or indirectly compete with our proposed products and services these companies will be able to offer products and services that will directly compete with our products  services   forge intends to develop real estate and to build housing commercial and other structures and manage these properties and similar properties for other real estate owners numerous world class companies have entered into various aspects of our market there currently are a number of companies in california that have already occupied a big portion of the market in which we intend to operate as a small earlystage company it is uncertain if and how we will be able to compete with the new competitors and products that are being announced and deployed while we believe that we currently have a competitive advantage because of our proposed marketing strategy we cannot give any assurance that we will in fact be able to successfully compete with the existing or new competitors in this mature and evolving marketplace        table of contents     our future revenue depends on the price of the properties acquired and sold   failure of our future development projects to provide competitive investment returns could significantly impair our ability to finance and market future projects our inability to spread risk among a large number of projects could cause us to be overreliant on our sole development we may be unable to grow our projects which would cause us to fail to satisfy our business strategy   a significant element of our business strategy is the growth in the number of our projects the consummation of any future projects will be subject to raising adequate capital for the investment identifying appropriate assets for acquisition and effectively and efficiently closing the transactions we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and invest in additional properties or will be able to raise adequate capital in the future   if thirdparty developers or contractors providing construction services for our future projects are negligent in their performance of or default on their obligations we may become subject to unforeseen liabilities additionally if some of our contractors are not bonded it may limit our ability to recover for nonperformance if this occurs it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results   we expect to enter into thirdparty agreements with respect to properties we may acquire in the future we do not supervise the personnel of these third parties on a daytoday basis and we cannot assure you that they will construct improvements in a manner that is consistent with their obligations under their agreements that they will not be negligent in their performance or engage in other criminal or fraudulent activity or that these third parties will not otherwise default on their obligations to us if any of the foregoing occurs the relationships with our investors could be damaged and we could incur liabilities resulting from loss or injury to the properties or to persons at the properties if we are unable to sell the properties or we become subject to significant liabilities as a result of thirdparty performance issues our operating results and financial condition could be substantially harmed   to execute our business strategy we or our new projects may be required to incur indebtedness to raise sufficient funds to purchase properties   one of our business strategies is to develop new projects the development of a new project requires the identification and subsequent acquisition of properties when the opportunity arises in some instances in order to effectively and efficiently complete a project we may provide deposits for the acquisition of property or actually purchase the property for resale if we do not have cash on hand available to pay these deposits or fund an acquisition we may be required to incur additional indebtedness which indebtedness may not be available on acceptable terms if we incur substantial debt we could lose our interests in any properties that have been provided as collateral for any secured borrowing or we could lose our assets if the debt is recourse to us in addition our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay these obligations upon their maturity making it necessary for us to raise additional capital or dispose of some of our assets we cannot assure you that we will be able to borrow additional debt on satisfactory terms or at all   our failure to manage future growth effectively may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations   we may experience rapid growth in our operations which may place a significant strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure our success will depend in part upon the ability of our executive officers to manage growth effectively our ability to grow also depends upon our ability to successfully hire train supervise and manage new employees obtain financing for our capital needs expand our systems effectively allocate our human resources optimally maintain clear lines of communication between our transactional and management functions and our finance and accounting functions and manage the pressures on our management and our administrative operational and financial infrastructure we also cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately anticipate and respond to the changing demands we will face as we continue to expand our operations and we may not be able to manage growth effectively or to achieve growth at all any failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   broad indemnification provided to management   the governing documents of the company limit the liability of and provide indemnification for the management and the respective directors officers employees and agents of the company and the management the indemnification provided is to the full extent permitted under applicable nevada law those provisions may limit certain rights of the shareholders against such parties and moreover an indemnification by the company of the management or any indemnified individual may result in substantial outofpocket costs and expenses payable by the company if the company is forced to provide indemnification for any of these indemnified parties it is possible that the assets of the company could become depleted or the company may otherwise suffer a material adverse financial consequence as a result of its indemnity obligations as of the date of this prospectus to the knowledge of the company there is no pending litigation or proceeding that exists involving a director officer employee or agent of the management or the company where indemnification will be required or permitted        table of contents   risks related to the real estate market   our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by real estate economic and other conditions generally   the real estate industry can be volatile and is affected by changes in national global and local economic conditions we may also be affected by events such as employment levels availability of financing interest rates consumer confidence and the demand for housing and other types of construction we are subject to various risks many of which are outside our control including     ● real estate market conditions both in california and in areas where potential customers reside     ● decreased consumer spending for housing     ● changing demographic conditions     ● competitive overbuilding     ● adverse weather conditions and natural disasters earthquakes landslides and fires     ● delays in construction schedules and cost overruns     ● changes in government regulations or requirements     ● increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees and     ● availability and cost of land materials and labor   a negative development caused by any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition   a decline in the general economy or the real estate market would harm our business    our business is negatively impacted by periods of economic slowdown or recession rising interest rates and declining demand for real estate these economic conditions could have a number of effects which could have a material adverse impact on certain segments of our business including a decline in     ● the supply of capital invested in commercial real estate or in commercial real estate investors and     ● the value of real estate which would cause us to realize lower proceeds from property sales   the real estate market tends to be cyclical and related to the condition of the economy and to the perceptions of investors and users as to the economic outlook a downturn in the economy or the real estate market could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations   an increase in interest rates may cause us to lose potential investors to alternative investments   as interest rates rise valuations of commercial real estate properties typically decline a decrease in both the attractiveness of our projects and the value of assets held by these projects could cause a decline in our ability to attract investors which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations   increasing competition for the acquisition of real estate may impede our ability to make future acquisitions which would reduce the sales profit and fees we generate from future property sales and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition   the real estate industry is highly competitive on an international national and regional level our projects face competition from reits institutional pension plans and other public and private real estate companies and private real estate investors for the acquisition of properties and for raising capital to make these acquisitions competition may prevent us from acquiring desirable properties or increase the price they must pay for real estate in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase resulting in increased demand and increased prices paid for these properties if we pay higher prices for properties investors may experience a lower return on investment and be less inclined to invest in our next project which may decrease our profitability increased competition for properties may also preclude us from acquiring properties that would generate the most attractive returns to investors or may reduce the number of properties we could acquire which could have an adverse effect on our business   illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our project properties and harm our financial condition   because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to promptly facilitate sales of our proposed projects in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions may be limited in particular these risks could arise from weakness in the market changes in the financial condition or prospects of prospective purchasers changes in regional national or international economic conditions and changes in laws regulations or fiscal policies fees from the disposition of improvements would be materially affected if we were unable to facilitate a significant number of sales      table of contents     land development permits and approvals are required to develop real property these permits and approvals will vary depending on the land that is being developed   the residential and commercial real estate development industry is subject to substantial environmental building construction zoning and real estate regulations that are imposed by various federal state and local authorities in developing a community we must obtain the approval of numerous government agencies regarding such matters as permitted land uses housing density the installation of utility services such as water sewer gas electric telephone and cable television and the dedication of acreage for open space parks schools and other community purposes regulations affect homebuilding by specifying among other things the type and quality of building materials that must be used certain aspects of land use and building design and the manner in which homebuilders may conduct their sales operations and overall relationships with potential home buyers furthermore changes in prevailing local circumstances or applicable laws may require additional approvals or modifications of approvals previously obtained   timing of the initiation and completion of development projects depends upon receipt of necessary authorizations and approvals because of the provisional nature of these approvals and the concerns of various environmental and public interest groups the approval process can be delayed by withdrawals or modifications of preliminary approvals and by litigation and appeals challenging development rights our ability to develop projects could be delayed or prevented due to litigation challenging previously obtained governmental approvals we also may be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slowgrowth” or “nogrowth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future such delays could adversely affect our ability to complete our projects significantly increase the costs of doing so or drive potential customers to purchase competitors’ products   uninsured and underinsured losses may adversely affect operations   we will obtain coverage that has policy specifications and insured limits that we believe are customarily carried for similar properties we cannot assure you however that particular risks that are currently insurable will continue to be insurable on an economic basis or that current levels of coverage will continue to be available in addition we generally do not obtain insurance against certain risks such as floods   should we sustain damage to any of our proposed projects or a potential occupant sustains an injury we may incur losses due to insurance deductibles copayments on insured losses or uninsured losses in the event of a substantial property loss or personal injury the insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full damages in the event of an uninsured loss we could lose some or all of our capital investment cash flow and anticipated profits related to one or more properties inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it not feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed under these circumstances the insurance proceeds we receive if any might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to the property in the event of a significant loss the remaining insurance under the applicable policy if any could be insufficient to adequately insure the remaining properties in this event securing additional insurance if possible could be significantly more expensive than the current policy a loss or an increase in premium as a result of a loss could decrease the income from or value of our project property any decrease or loss in fees could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations   environmental regulations may adversely impact our business or cause us to incur costs for cleanup of hazardous substances or wastes or other environmental liabilities   federal state and local laws and regulations impose various environmental zoning restrictions use controls and disclosure obligations which impact the management development use andor sale of real estate these laws and regulations tend to discourage sales activities with respect to some properties and by decreasing or delaying those transactions may adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of our business in addition a failure by us to disclose environmental concerns in connection with the disposition of project properties may subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of property   additionally we may be obliged under the debt financing arrangements on the properties owned by us to provide an indemnity to the lenders for environmental liabilities and to remediate any environmental problems that might arise insurance for these matters may not be available   our business is sensitive to interest rates and the ability of consumers to obtain mortgage financing which could reduce our revenues   the ability of the ultimate buyers of our properties to finance their purchases is generally dependent on their personal savings and availability of third party financing as a result demand for housing and consequently the land that we sell will be adversely affected by increases in interest rates unavailability of mortgage financing increasing housing costs and unemployment levels levels of income and savings including retirement savings available to home purchasers can be affected by further declines in the capital markets any significant increase in the prevailing low mortgage interest rate environment or decrease in available credit could reduce consumer demand for housing and result in fewer home sales or lower sale prices   increased development costs beyond our control could adversely affect our profitability   changes in development plans and specifications delays due to compliance with governmental requirements or imposition of fees not yet levied or other delays resulting from adverse weather strikes or energy shortages shortages of material for construction inflation environmental zoning title or other legal matters as well as other unknown contingencies could cause development costs to exceed the amounts produced by any project in the event that costs exceed funds available our ability to complete development of projects will depend upon our ability to supply additional funds we cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds available for that purpose   the extended time frame from the date of an investment in a project until its expected profitability makes our business risky        table of contents     fluctuations in market conditions may affect our ability to sell our land at expected prices if at all which could adversely affect our revenues earnings and cash flows   we are subject to the potential for significant fluctuations in the market value of land we may hold in inventory there is a lag between the time we acquire control of the undeveloped land and the time that we can complete the improvements on a project of the buildings and homes constructed and to be constructed for sale to third parties this lag time will vary from site to site as it is impossible to determine in advance the length of time it will take to obtain government approvals and permits the risk of owning undeveloped land can be substantial as the market value of undeveloped land can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic and market conditions inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing development or market material writedowns of the estimated value of our land inventory could occur if market conditions deteriorate we could also be forced to sell land or lots for prices that generate lower profit than we anticipate and may not be able to dispose of our investment in a timely manner when we find dispositions advantageous or necessary   fluctuating operating results may affect the price of our stock because some of our real estate projects may be long term in nature our business cycle may not correspond to our fiscal year or other reporting periods as a result our fiscal year operating results are likely to vary from period to period even if we were to have a successful project operating as planned and could vary significantly over the life of any given project   a community may generate strong operating results when first presented for sale whether because of local pentup demand or other reasons however during later periods over the life of the same community periods of weaker results may occur in addition to external factors our revenues and earnings are affected by the volume and price of lots that we bring to market at any given point in time which reflect in part our strategy of developing houses in phases as a result the timing and amount of revenues and profits are subject to considerable variation and uncertainty the impact on our earnings and cash flow is not and in the future may not be balanced by results of other operations which could have a moderating effect on the variability of our results   our commercial and intended homebuilding operations may be conducted through joint ventures with local commercial builders and homebuilders and if we are unable to enter into satisfactory joint venture arrangements on favorable terms our business and results of operations may suffer a material adverse effect   we intend to conduct our commercial building and homebuilding operations through traditional contractor arrangements with local builders going forward we may also construct and sell homes in the residential communities that we develop through joint ventures with builders there can be no assurance that we can reach future arrangements with such commercial builders or homebuilders or other builders on terms that are favorable to us or if at all if we are not able to successfully secure adequate arrangements for our commercial building and future homebuilding and home sales operations then our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected   residential homebuilding is a competitive industry and competitive conditions may adversely affect our results of operations   the residential homebuilding industry is highly competitive residential homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable properties building materials labor and capital we compete for our property acquisition opportunities with other local regional and national homebuilders often within larger communities designed planned and developed by such homebuilders any improvement in the cost structure or service of these competitors will increase the competition we face additionally the resale of existing homes including foreclosed homes sales by housing speculators and investors and rental housing may affect the amount of revenue in which we participate with the homebuilders we select for the development of residential lots should the additional parcels be acquired competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry could result in difficulty in acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices increased selling incentives lower sales volumes and prices lower profit margins impairments in the value of our inventory and other assets   general risks associated with investment in real estate   the investments of the company will be subject to the risks generally incident to ownership of real property including but not limited to uncertainty of cash flow to meet fixed and other obligations adverse changes in local employment conditions interest rates and real estate tax rates changes in fiscal policies and uninsured losses and other risks that are beyond the control of the company there can be no assurance of profitable operations because the cost of owning real estate assets may exceed the income produced particularly since certain expenses related to real estate and its development and ownership such as property taxes utility costs maintenance costs and insurance tend to increase over time and are largely beyond the control of the owner   difficulty in retaining qualified trades workers or obtaining required materials and supplies will adversely affect our business and results of operations   the commercial and homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties in the supply of materials and services including with respect to shortages of qualified trades people labor disputes shortages of building materials unforeseen environmental and engineering problems and increases in the cost of certain materials particularly increases in the price of lumber wall board and cement which are significant components of home construction costs when any of these difficulties occur it will cause delays and increase the cost of constructing the homes or other properties in our projects thereby adversely affecting the revenue we receive from commercial home or other builders we participate with on sales of finished residences or commercial improvements on the properties        table of contents     tax law changes in the united states could make home ownership more expensive or less attractive   tax law changes in the united states could make home ownership more expensive or less attractive in the united states significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes generally are deductible expenses for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy if the federal government or a state government changes income tax laws to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions then the aftertax cost of owning a new home would increase substantially this could adversely impact demand for andor sales prices of new homes   risks relating to this offering   the offering price of the shares has been arbitrarily determined and such price should not be used by an investor as an indicator of the fair market value of the shares   currently there is no public market for the company’s common stock the offering price for the shares has been arbitrarily determined and does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the assets operations book or other established criteria of value of the company thus an investor should be aware that the offering price does not reflect the fair market price of the shares   there has been no prior public market for the company’s common stock and the lack of such a market may make resale of the shares difficult   no prior public market has existed for the company’s securities and the company cannot assure any purchaser that a market will develop subsequent to this offering the company intends to apply for quotation of its common stock on the otc bulletin board however the company does not know if it will be successful in such application how long such application will take or if successful that a market for the common stock will ever develop or continue on that or any other trading market if for any reason a trading market for the shares does not develop investors may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so   the company’s election not to opt out of jobs act extended accounting transition period may not make its financial statements easily comparable to other companies   pursuant to the jobs act of  as an emerging growth company the company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the pcaob or the sec the company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies the company as an emerging growth company can adopt the standard for the private company this may not make comparison of the company’s financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used   the company’s stock may be considered a penny stock and any investment in the company’s stock will be considered a highrisk investment and subject to restrictions on marketability   if the shares commence trading the trading price of the company’s common stock may be below  per share if the price of the common stock is below such level trading in its common stock would be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended these rules require additional disclosure by brokerdealers in connection with any trades generally involving any nonnasdaq equity security that has a market price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions such rules require the delivery before any penny stock transaction of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors generally institutions for these types of transactions the brokerdealer must determine the suitability of the penny stock for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transactions before sale the additional burdens imposed upon brokerdealers by such requirements may discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in the company’s common stock which could impact the liquidity of the company’s common stock   finra sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock   in addition to the “penny stock” rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission see above for a discussion of penny stock rules finra rules require that in recommending an investment to a customer a brokerdealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status tax status investment objectives and other information under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers finra requirements make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares   little experience in being a public company   the company is an earlystage company and as such has little experience in managing a public company such lack of experience may result in the company experiencing difficulty in adequately operating and growing its business further the company may be hampered by lack of experience in addressing the issues and considerations which are common to growing companies if the company’s operating or management abilities consistently perform below expectations the company’s business is unlikely to thrive        table of contents   the company is an earlystage company with no developed finance and accounting organization and the rigorous demands of being a public company require a structured and developed finance and accounting group as a reporting company the company is already subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  however the requirements of these laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder entail significant accounting legal and financial compliance costs which may be prohibitive to the company as it develops its business plan services and scope these costs have made and will continue to make some activities more difficult time consuming or costly and may place significant strain on its personnel systems and resources   the securities exchange act requires among other things that companies maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in order to maintain the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on the development of the company’s business financial condition and results of operations   these rules and regulations may also make it difficult and expensive for the company to obtain director and officer liability insurance if the company is unable to obtain adequate director and officer insurance its ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors especially those directors who may be deemed independent will be significantly curtailed   the board of directors could use the issuance or designation of preferred stock to impede or discourage an acquisition of the company that may otherwise be beneficial to some shareholders   the company is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock the issuance of shares of preferred stock or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal for instance the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders in addition under certain circumstances the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock although the company’s board of directors is required to make any determination to issue such preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of the stockholders of the company the board of directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some or a majority of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock the board of directors does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock unless otherwise required by law or otherwise   limited transferability of shares   there is no public market for the shares while the company intends to develop a public market in the future there can be no assurance if or when such a market would be expected to develop in the future even if a potential buyer could be found the transferability of these shares

the following i laws rules and regulations ii regional national andor global economic factors iii the capacity circumstances and relationships of partners of the company or the management or iv

common stock        table of contents   the business and business plan   background   the company is a development stage company and has limited operating history and is expected to experience losses in the near term   overview   the company’s primary objective is commercial and residential land development including the purchase and sale of real estate targeting properties primarily in southern california we also intend to manage properties we own and properties owned by unaffiliated third parties our activities will include securing acquisition rights to properties obtaining zoning and other entitlements for the properties securing financing for purchase of the properties improving the properties’ infrastructure and amenities and selling the properties to homeowner and commercial owners for restaurants offices and small businesses our first property acquisition was  acres in the city of desert hot springs in southern california due to problems with permits and adjacent landowners rather than get involved in protracted negotiations the company sold the property to an independent third party for a profit   business strategy   the company’s business strategy includes the following three main segments of the real estate business    we intend to acquire and develop land for residential and commercial development  we also intend to develop a diversified real estate portfolio by investing in residential real estate including singlefamily housing condos and townhomes and commercial properties including stripmalls and small office buildings  we intend to provide property management for our own properties and for properties owned by nonaffiliated third parties   property development   the company intends to acquire land and develop and sell fully constructed homes and commercial property such as stores offices private schools etc to nonaffiliated third parties our first property acquisition was  acres of vacant land in the city of desert hot springs in southern california our original plan was to build various commercial buildings on the parcels including stores and restaurants however due to problems with permits and adjacent landowners that would lead to lengthy negotiations and possibly additional costs the company sold the property in march  to a nonaffiliated third party for a profit   our principal activities are securing acquisition rights to properties obtaining zoning and other entitlements for the properties securing financing for the purchase of the properties improving the properties’ infrastructure and amenities and selling properties to third parties currently all of our property development activities are centered in the southern california area   investing in development projects   the company intends to invest some of its funds and to utilize funds pooled from investors to directly invest in incomeyielding properties the company will concentrate on investing in properties with longterm leases   we rely on our management’s expertise in identifying residential and commercial real estate assets within our stated target objectives our management makes investment decisions based on various factors including relative value expected riskadjusted returns current and projected credit fundamentals current and projected macroeconomic considerations current and projected supply and demand credit and market risk concentration limits liquidity cost of financing and financing availability as well as maintaining our exemption from registration under the  act   our targeted asset classes and the principal investments we have made and expect to make in each are as follows   asset class   principal investments residential property   ● single family attached single family detached multiunit condominiums townhomes etc partially completed real estate developments residential commercial retail   ●   acquisition and sale of vacant land       reo tape transactions   ●   bulk or block acquisitions of single family detached residential units or homes   our primary business strategy is to seek out and secure real estate properties that may have been formerly subjected to distressed financing terms as a consequence of recent economic factors our focus is on residential singlefamily detached homes throughout southern california made available individually or bulk transfer from various private parties or financial institutions seeking to liquidate nonperforming assets   another business strategy is designed to generate a rate of return by acquiring distressed properties individually or in bulk transactions for investment purposes and eventual resale we believe there is a significant market opportunity to acquire discounted real estate assets or in some instances to lend to or invest with real estate developers and property owners or otherwise participate in real estate related investments where nontraditional financing sources are not available the current credit crisis and economic environment and the strict underwriting standards and length of time required by traditional sources including banking institutions are often prohibitive      table of contents     property management   in many cases we will manage our own properties and market our property management service to others property management involves most of the following duties   ● establishes rental rate by surveying local rental rates calculating overhead costs depreciation taxes and profit goals       ● attracts tenants by advertising vacancies obtaining referrals from current tenants explaining advantages of location and services showing units       ● contracts with tenants by negotiating leases collecting security deposit       ● accomplishes financial objectives by collecting rents paying

marketing   we intend to market our properties through real estate brokers and agents coordinated by company marketing personnel our marketing efforts will target both international and local buyers and builders     competition     we believe there are only limited barriers to entry in our business current and future competitors may have more resources than we have our projects face competition generally from reits institutional pension plans and other public and private real estate companies and private real estate investors for the acquisition of properties and for raising capital in transaction services we face competition with other real estate firms in the acquisition and disposition of properties and we also compete with other sponsors of real estate for investors to provide the capital to allow us to make these investments we also compete against other real estate companies who may be chosen by a brokerdealer as an investment platform instead of us in management services we compete with other properties for viable investors for properties we also believe that our broker dealers compete or will compete with institutions that provide or arrange for other types of financing through private or public offerings of equity or debt and from traditional bank financings         table of contents   real estate development is a highly competitive business we compete with numerous developers builders and others for the acquisition of property as we attempt to expand our operations we will certainly be competing with other business ranging from large multinational corporations to small startup business such as ourselves many of our competitors may have longer operating histories better brand recognition and greater financial resources than we do to successfully compete in our industry we will need to      ● ensure that investments in our projects are affordable         ● that we only invest in properties in wellpriced locations          ● that our investment strategy is simple to understand and          ● that we provide outstanding customer service and rigid integrity in our business dealings   however there can be no assurance that even if we do these things we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry we believe that we have the required management expertise in sourcing properties with good development potential and affordable price    we are committed to work and communicate with our investors and sales consultants to identify their goals and needs which will make it easier to continually provide them with the best products and services    government regulations     real property development     land development permits and approvals are required to develop real property these permits and approvals will vary depending on the land that is being developed    the commercial and residential real estate development industry is subject to substantial environmental building construction zoning and real estate regulations that are imposed by various federal state and local authorities in developing a community we must obtain the approval of numerous government agencies regarding such matters as permitted land uses housing density the installation of utility services such as water sewer gas electric telephone and cable television and the dedication of acreage for open space parks schools and other community purposes regulations affect commercial building and homebuilding by specifying among other things the type and quality of building materials that must be used certain aspects of land use and building design and the manner in which homebuilders may conduct their sales operations and overall relationships with potential renters and buyers furthermore changes in prevailing local circumstances or applicable laws may require additional approvals or modifications of approvals previously obtained these permits and approvals will vary depending on the land that is being developed    timing of the initiation and completion of development projects depends upon receipt of necessary authorizations and approvals because of the provisional nature of these approvals and the concerns of various environmental and public interest groups the approval process can be delayed by withdrawals or modifications of preliminary approvals and by litigation and appeals challenging development rights our ability to develop projects could be delayed or prevented due to litigation challenging previously obtained governmental approvals we also may be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slowgrowth” or “nogrowth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future such delays could adversely affect our ability to complete our projects significantly increase the costs of doing so or drive potential customers to purchase competitors’ products   management services     we and our brokers salespersons and in some instances property managers are regulated by the states in which we do business these regulations may include licensing procedures prescribed professional responsibilities and antifraud provisions our activities are also subject to various local state national and international jurisdictions’ fair advertising trade housing and real estate settlement laws and regulations and are affected by laws and regulations relating to real estate and real estate finance and development    environmental compliance     federal state and local laws and regulations impose environmental zoning restrictions use controls disclosure obligations and other restrictions that impact the management development use or sale of real estate such laws and regulations tend to discourage sales and leasing activities with respect to some properties if transactions in which we are involved are delayed or abandoned as a result of these restrictions our business could be adversely affected in addition a failure by us to disclose environmental concerns to potential investors or third party buyers of the developed property may subject our company to liability and may adversely impact our business or cause us to incur costs for cleanup of hazardous substances or wastes or other environmental liabilities    various environmental laws and regulations also can impose liability for the costs of investigating or remediating hazardous or toxic substances at sites currently or formerly owned or operated by a party or at offsite locations to which such party sent wastes for disposal as a property manager we could be held liable as an operator for any such contamination even if the original activity was legal and we had no knowledge of or did not cause the release or contamination further because liability under some of these laws is joint and several we could be held responsible for more than our share or even all of the costs for such contaminated site if the other responsible parties are unable to pay similarly we are generally obliged under the debt financing arrangements on the properties owned by us to provide an indemnity to the lenders for environmental liabilities and to remediate any environmental problems that might arise insurance for these matters may not always be available or sufficient to cover our losses      table of contents     description of property     the company owns no real estate we currently maintain our corporate office at  castleton st suite  city of industry ca  which we lease on a month to month basis for  per

understanding the company’s financial statements these accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period in the opinion of management all adjustments necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading have been included actual results

the company follows the provisions in accounting standards codification  or asc  “real estate – retail land” to record the sales asc  provides specific sales recognition criteria to determine when land sales revenue can be recorded for example asc  requires a land sale to be consummated with a sufficient buyer’s initial and continuing investment of at least  to  of the sales price depending upon the type and timeframe for development of the property sold and that any receivable from the sale cannot be subject to future subordination in addition the seller cannot retain any material

taxes”  under the asset and liability method of asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs a valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the company will not realize tax assets through future operations   f    table of contents     basic earnings loss per share   the company computes basic and diluted earnings per share amounts in accordance with asc topic  earnings per share basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the company   the company does not have any potentially dilutive instruments as of december   and thus antidilution issues are not applicable   fair value of financial instruments   the company’s balance sheet includes certain financial instruments the carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization   asc  fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between  market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and  an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below     ● level   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities         ● level   inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability eg interest rates and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means         ● level   inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable   fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of december   the respective carrying value of certain onbalancesheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the shortterm nature of these instruments these financial instruments include cash and cash equivalent   operating leases   leases where substantially all the rewards and risks of ownership of assets remain with the leasing company are accounted for as operating leases payments made under

stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values that expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period     f    table of contents     the company accounts for stockbased compensation issued to nonemployees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of asc  “ equity – based payments to nonemployees”  measurement of sharebased payment transactions with nonemployees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable a the goods or services received or b the equity instruments issued  the fair value of the sharebased payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date   the company had no stockbased compensation plans december     impairment of longlived assets   longlived assets are tested for impairment in accordance with asc  “impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the company periodically evaluates potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable if circumstances require a longlived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment the company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value if the carrying value of the longlived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models quoted market values and thirdparty independent appraisals as considered necessary no impairment of longlived assets was recognized for the years ended december     recently issued accounting pronouncements   the company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position and result of operations   note   income taxes   the company has not recognized an income tax benefit for its operating losses generated based on uncertainties concerning its ability to generate taxable income in future periods the tax benefit for the period presented is offset by a valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets arising from the net operating losses the realization of which could not be considered more likely than not in future periods tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts to be more likely than not due to the change in ownership provisions of the tax reform act of  net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations should a change in ownership occur net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as to use in future years   as of december   the company has incurred a net loss of approximately  which resulted in a net operating loss for income tax purposes nols begin expiring in  the loss results in a deferred tax asset of approximately  at the effective statutory rate of  the deferred tax asset has been offset by an equal
