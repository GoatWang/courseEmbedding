stockholder the mexican government will in turn receive the proceeds from the selling stockholder to be used as determined by the mexican government excluding our airports servicing tourist destinations our airports generally are natural monopolies in the geographic areas that they serve and generally do not face significant competition however since our acapulco mazatlán and zihuatanejo international airports are substantially dependent on tourists these airports face competition from competing tourist destinations we believe that the main competitors to these airports are those airports serving vacation destinations in mexico such as los cabos cancun and puerto vallarta and abroad such as in puerto rico florida cuba jamaica the dominican republic other caribbean islands and central america the relative attractiveness of the locations we serve is dependent on many factors some of which are beyond our control these factors include the general state of the mexican economy and the attractiveness of other commercial and industrial centers in mexico that may affect the attractiveness of monterrey and other growing population centers in our group such as ciudad juárez and san luis potosí in addition with respect to acapulco mazatlán and zihuatanejo these factors include promotional activities and pricing policies of hotel and resort operators weather conditions natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes and the development of new resorts that may be considered more attractive there can be no assurance that the locations we serve will continue to attract the same level of passenger traffic in the future the mexican airport and auxiliary services agency currently operates  small airports in mexicos central and northern regions the mexican airport and auxiliary services agency estimates that its airports collectively account for less than  of the passenger traffic in this region in the future we also may face competition from aeropuerto del norte an airport near monterrey operated by a third party pursuant to a concession historically aeropuerto del norte has been used solely for general aviation operations recently the state of nuevo leon has approached the ministry of communications and transportation to discuss the amendment of aeropuerto del nortes concession to allow it to serve commercial aviation operations we understand based on a recent government analysis that aeropuerto del norte is not capable of accommodating commercial traffic as currently configured to date the ministry of communications and transportation has not amended aeropuerto del nortes concession however there can be no assurance that the ministry of communications and transportation will not authorize such an amendment and that commercial aviation flights will not operate from aeropuerto del norte in the future in addition the mexican government could grant new concessions to operate existing governmentmanaged airports or authorize the construction of new airports which could compete directly with our airports any competition from other such airports could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations company description we were incorporated in  as part of the mexican governments program for the opening of mexicos airports to private investment we hold concessions to operate maintain and develop  airports in mexico which are concentrated in the countrys central and northern regions each of our concessions has a term of  years beginning on november   the term of each of our concessions may be extended by the mexican ministry of communications and transportation secretaría de comunicaciones y transportes under certain circumstances for up to  additional years as operator of the  airports under our concessions we charge airlines passengers and other users fees for the use of the airports facilities we also derive rental and other income from commercial activities conducted at our airports such as the leasing of space to restaurants and retailers our operations we operate  airports which serve a major metropolitan area monterrey tourist destinations acapulco mazatlán and zihuatanejo regional centers chihuahua culiacán durango san luis potosí tampico torreón and zacatecas and border cities ciudad juárez and reynosa our airports are located in  of the  mexican states covering a territory of approximately  square kilometers approximately  square miles with a population of approximately  million according to the national institute of statistics geography and informatics and the mexican national population council all of our airports are designated as international airports under mexican law meaning that they are all equipped to receive international flights and to maintain customs and immigration services managed by the mexican government as well as refueling services according to figures published by the mexican bureau of civil aviation our

mexicos ninth largest state in terms of population it is home to many of mexicos largest companies in a wide variety of industries as well as several major universities business travelers account for a substantial portion of passengers at the monterrey international airport we believe that both the economic growth of the city of monterrey and corresponding passenger traffic growth at our monterrey international airport are closely linked to mexicos economic performance the airport is our leading airport in terms of passenger traffic volume air traffic movements and contribution to revenues and ranked fourth among the top ten busiest airports in mexico based on passenger traffic volume in  according to data published by the mexican bureau of civil aviation monterrey international airport accounted for approximately  and  of our terminal passenger traffic in  and the first six months of  respectively three of our airports acapulco international airport mazatlán international airport and zihuatanejo international airport serve popular mexican tourist destinations of these tourist destinations acapulco and mazatlán are the largest with acapulco constituting mexicos seventh largest international tourist destination and mazatlán the fifth largest in terms of visitors in  according to the mexican national institute of migration acapulco is a principal port of embarkation and

tampico international airport agriculture and livestock culiacán international airport and transportation san luis potosí international airport in  and the first six months of  these seven regional

international airport and reynosa international airport serve cities situated along the border of mexico and the united states both ciudad juárez and reynosa are popular entry points to the united

dividing the total revenues for each airport by the number of terminal passengers for each airport we believe that in many developed countries annual commercial aviation passenger traffic volumes can be significantly higher than the total population for example the united states which had a population of approximately  million in  recorded approximately  million commercial aviation passengers during that year in mexico however air transportation historically has been affordable only to the higherincome segments of the population resulting in a comparatively low level of air travel in  mexicos population was approximately  million and mexican airports recorded approximately  million commercial aviation passengers we believe that the recent entry of lowcost carriers into the mexican commercial airline market has the potential to increase significantly passenger traffic in mexico the mexican government recently awarded domestic airline licenses to several new lowcost and other carriers including interjet avolar volaris and click mexicana the discount carrier subsidiary of the mexicana group these carriers recently announced a total of  new routes serving our airports we are in discussions with these and other carriers to add further routes at our airports in addition the lowcost carrier viva aerobus has recently announced that it intends to locate its corporate and operational headquarters and maintenance facilities at our monterrey international airport it has also announced that it expects to begin operating nine routes in december  and to be operating a total of  routes serving  of our airports by april  thirteen of these routes are expected to be to destinations not previously served by our monterrey international airport as of july  mexico and the united states are parties to an amended bilateral aviation agreement that increases from two each to three each the number of mexican and us carriers eligible to operate routes between certain pairs of cities which may include any us city and twelve specified cities in mexico including acapulco mazatlán and zihuatanejo the agreement also provides for a future increase from two each to three each in the number of mexican and us carriers eligible to operate routes between us cities and two specified additional mexican cities including monterrey this subsequent increase is expected to take effect in october  we believe that our business will benefit from an increase in flights to and from our monterrey acapulco mazatlán and zihuatanejo international airports as a result of the amended bilateral aviation agreement our principal executive headquarters are located at carretera miguel alemán aeropuerto internacional de monterrey zona de carga apodaca nuevo león cp  our telephone number
