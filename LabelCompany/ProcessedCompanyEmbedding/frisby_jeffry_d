the audio portion for your use as has now become customary before we get into the slide deck i’d like to make a few opening remarks at the end of the day this quarter was indelibly marked by two significant events and as it transpired these events happened on the same day and it was a day we were all anticipating the process was arduous negotiations difficult and multifaceted and the amount of due diligence performed was massive over a year of effort went into crafting what i have described repeatedly as a winwinwinwin scenario finally on december th of  the culmination of all these efforts was the signing of the agreement to resume production of the gulfstream g and g programs from spirit aerosystems this singular transaction marked a significant step forward for triumph strengthening an already solid position in the integrated wing business and adding key products on growth platforms to replace some of our sunsetting production overall a very positive development the part of that day that we were not eagerly awaiting was boeing’s announcement of a production rate cut on their  program from  to  per month as you know as close to the profitability edge as we were any reduction in rate put us into a loss position on the contract and will require a charge to be taken so when we take the measure of this quarter as i have mentioned we really need to look no further than december th because on that day the two single largest events in the quarter occurred the good news we can all take from these two events is that the negative repercussions of the  rate cut as painful as they are in the immediate term are largely in our rearview mirror jeff mcrae will take you through in detail the composition of the charges that we recorded and while no one can guarantees that there will no future charges on this program you will see that we have taken a number of important steps that lessen the likelihood of recurrence on the flip side the gulfstream wing business in tulsa is in its early stages and will provide benefits to triumph and its shareholders for decades to come the pathway from signing to closing was well executed by both parties and we have now operated in tulsa for just about one month we had hoped for high level acceptance in the labor force although we planned for a more pessimistic case on this front reality was more in line with our hopes and we’ve retained a very high percentage of the workforce in tulsa which should inturn lead to less than planned disruption and a speedier return to the improvement curves already in place the quality of the delivered product remains high and deliveries are being made in accordance with our plan importantly we have aligned cross functional teams of key personnel in place to validate the synergy assumptions we have made and to develop and deploy specific plans to attain them now certainly there is more to this quarter than two events and we will discuss these things in detail as we go one more general comment before we get into the slides triumph group through the years has grown from basically a loose confederation of independent companies to what is now a large group of companies that together are a formidable force in the marketplace we have now reached the point where we at the enterprise level can leverage the strength of our portfolio to add value and to drive growth we have engaged experts in several fields to help us identify and quantify value propositions and develop executable plans to achieve our goals these will include a more robust view of the supply chain across the enterprise the valuation of footprint consolidation opportunities further capitalizing on tax efficiencies as our global footprint continues to expand and using more effective means of driving best practices across the enterprise as these initiatives take form and become measurable we look forward to sharing them with you with that serving as a preamble let’s turn to slide three titled q in review overall the third quarter delivered a strong cash flow performance and jeff will provide color on this in the aerostructures segment and we’ll get into this in some detail revenues were impacted by decreased c production and lower nonrecurring revenue if you recall last year in q we had a significant amount of  tanker nonrecurrent ph the operating results included the  million forward loss charges in  program and jeff will get into that again in detail and i am sure we’ll cover some of the details in the call in the questions as well what i want to make sure we understand is that this charge did not in fact change our commitment to continue to take actions to reduce costs and improve performance performance continues to improve on the program and we will not let up on continuing to drive improvements as we go forward in the quarter we also took  million of charges related to lower than expected performance to triumph structures international jeff will get into some detail on this as well and importantly the red oak transition to premove performance remains on target for the end of the fiscal year and as far as our aerospace systems is concerned we had a very good quarter we experienced positive organic revenue growth with sustainable strong operating margins and the integration of our newest acquisition in that segment to ge aviation hydraulic actuation business continues to progress well currently running ahead of our synergy targets and in terms of aftermarket services we experienced positive organic revenue growth with sustained strong operating margins so lets turn to slide four ive already covered the first bullet and so ill let that speak for itself the transition is in fact progressing well im happy to announce that weve recently been awarded multiyear work packages and multiple triumph sites with combined value in excess of  million from spirit for metallic machine parts and subassemblies and finally we bought back  shares for approximately  million at this time ill turn the call over to jeff mcrae jeff jeffrey l mcrae thank you jeff and good morning everyone i will start with a review of the financial results for our third quarter turning first to the income statement net sales for the third fiscal quarter were  million up slightly from the prior year period operating loss for the quarter was  million resulting in a net loss of  million or  loss per share results for the quarter included a  million of charges in the aerostructure segment the majority of which were related to the forward losses associated with  program in addition there were  million of transaction related cost related to the resumption of the gulfstream g and g wing programs that were included in the corporate results excluding these items net income was  million or  per diluted share the number of shares used in computing diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis for the quarter was  million shares adjusted ebitda for the quarter was negative  million excluding the impact of forward losses associated with  program and the red oak facility transition cost adjusted ebitda for the quarter was  million looking at our segment performance sales in the aerostructures segment for the third quarter declined  to  million primarily due to decreased production in the c program as well as lower nonrecurring revenue on the  tanker program third quarter operating loss was  million and included  million of cost related to red oak facility transition and a net favorable cumulative catch up adjustment on long term contracts excluding the  program of  the segment’s operating results included total charges of  million associated with the  program a  million of which represented forward losses on the balance of units under contract and  million was a negative cumulative catch up adjustment the next slide shows the components of the forward loss provision the magnitude of the loss is larger than we had previously indicated as we fully incorporated the anticipation of future rate variability we also lowered our expectation of labor and cost performance through the end of the contract and we adjusted for lower anticipated pension benefit in future periods based on the incorporation of new mortality tables in the calculation of our pension obligations and we also included incremental overhead absorption resulting from moving non  program out of the existing  facilities the forward loss covers unit deliveries assumed to stretch in to fiscal year  roughly four years of production in front of us and roughly  billion of revenue with actual cash losses being back end loaded due to pricing breaks provided in the last production lot as jeff mentioned we will continue to look for ways to improve performance and drive costs down in the  program this will involve continuing to work with our customers and suppliers to identify opportunities and also engaging thirdparty consultancy to further evaluate opportunities and drive implementation of improvements the segment’s operating results were also negatively impacted by lower than expected performance at triumph structures international our composites manufacturing facility located in farnborough england resulting in  million of pretax charges this company lost its indiscernible certification due to systemic issues within their quality system in late  resulting in unanticipated delays in production and deliveries and delaying our planned transition of work to a sister company in taiwan these issues resulted in charges being taken in the quarter related to current and forward losses as well as an inventory impairment we have installed new leadership into this organization and are closely monitoring recovery plans and would expect full recovery in early fiscal  which would then allow us to reengage in product transfer plans as jeff mentioned we continued to make good progress in ramping up production at red oak and expect to meet our target at getting back to premove levels by the end of the fiscal year the only exception is the c program which has continued to experience delays due to part shortages for which we will see some revenue slippage out of fiscal year  into the first quarter of fiscal year  red oak did deliver the initial test article wing for the global  and is making good progress on this program as jeff mentioned we are also working on several initiatives which are focused on driving performance improvements and reducing costs both within the heritage vought business as well as our tier  structure businesses which will provide a catalyst for margin expansion as we move into fiscal year  and beyond as mentioned earlier on december  we did close in the tulsa gulfstream wings transactions which included the receipt of a  million which is included in the cash flow statement within the line acquisitions net of cash acquired the balance sheet as of december  also included provisional balances for the transaction which will be refined over the next few quarters we are also working to refine our business plans for these two programs but based on early indications we are seeing improvements to our base case performance assumptions we are still confident that we will be cash positive by the end of fiscal  on these programs with the  program being in much better shape today than the  program adjusted ebitda for the quarter was negative  million excluding the impact of the forward losses associated with the  program and the red oak facility transition cost adjusted ebitda for the quarter was  million the segment operating margin for the quarter was  after adjusting for the  program as well as the costs related to the red oak transition and triumphs structures internationals performance moving on to aerospace system segment sales were  million compared to  million in the prior year period an increase of  reflecting  organic growth and the impact of the acquisition of the ge hydraulic actuation business third quarter operating income increased  from the prior year quarter to  million with an operating margin of  organic operating margin for the quarter was  as compared to  in the prior year adjusted ebitda for the quarter was  million and an adjusted ebitda margin of  as jeff mentioned the integration of the ge hydraulic actuation business is progressing well and we are tracking ahead of our synergy realization plan as expected their margins were diluted to the segments margin in the quarter but we continue to develop and execute on plans which will drive segment average margins from this business in the midterm the aftermarket services segment revenues in the third quarter were  million compared to  million in the prior year period an increase of  reflecting  organic growth and the impact of triumph aviation services naas division acquisitions completed earlier in the quarter third quarter operating income increased  over the prior year quarter to  million with an operating margin of  adjusted ebitda for the quarter was  million with an adjusted ebitda margin of  even with the continued softness in the military aftermarket we have continued to drive strong margins in this segment and anticipate holding margins at q levels for the balance of the year during the quarter we repurchased roughly  shares for approximately  million as of december  approximately  million shares remained under the share repurchase authorization and we will continue to tactically repurchase shares as part of our balanced approach to capital deployment and managing our overall liquidity position moving on on the pension front we’ve included for your reference a pensionopeb analysis for triumph aerostructures for the fiscal years  and  which remains unchanged from last quarter as we said last quarter we did complete an initial analysis of the impact of a required incorporation of new mortality tables to our pension and postretirement benefit plans and based on this initial analysis we project approximately a  increase in the pension and opeb liability as of march   we only expect minimal impact to our fiscal year ‘ earnings and anticipate seeing a slight yearoveryear earnings improvement related to our pension benefit as we look forward to fiscal year ‘ although not at the same levels as we would have previously estimated prior to the incorporation of the new mortality tables these calculations are highly dependent on a number of factors such as yearend discount rates and loss amortization methodology and will be finalized as part of our fiscal year end valuation process as mentioned in  discussion we’ve captured in the forwardloss that portion of the mortality table change impact that would be applied to the  program turning now to backlog our order backlog as of december  was  billion a  increase yearoveryear keep in mind that our backlog takes into consideration only those firm orders that we are going to deliver over the next  months and primarily reflects future sales within our aerostructures and aerospace systems groups the aftermarket services group did not have a substantial backlog military represented approximately  of our backlog for your reference we have included the top ten programs by backlog for both the aerostructures and aerospace system segments you will note that with the inclusion of the backlog required with the g and g programs the gulfstream programs in the aggregate are now the top programs in the aerostructures segment boeing remained our only customer to exceed  of total revenue net sales to boeing commercial military and space totaled  of our revenue and was broken down  commercial and  military for your reference we have included in the appendix charts reflecting sales by market and sales trends turning now to the balance sheet for the nine months ended december st we generated  million of cash flow from operations before pension contributions of  million after these contributions cash flow from operations was  million this does not include the receipt of  million from spirit related to the transfer of gulfstream g and g programs inventory at december  reflected an increase of  million during our first three quarters of the year of which approximately  million was attributable to nonrecurring investments in the bombardier and embraer programs and  million was attributable to the acquisition of the ge hydraulic actuation business triumph aviation services naas division and the gulfstream g and g programs capital spending was  million in the quarter and  million yeartodate we continue to expect capital spending for the fiscal year to be in the range of  to  million net debt at the end of the third quarter was  billion representing  of total capital and total debt to trailing  months adjusted ebidta was  times the global effective tax rate for the quarter reflected the fact that the rd tax credit was retroactively reinstated back to january   in addition the effective income tax rate for the quarter further reduced by implementation of state and global tax planning initiatives from a cash tax perspective we currently expect minimal cash to be paid in fiscal  the q effective tax rate will be  and reflects the fact that the rd tax credit expired at december   in terms of financial guidance based on current projected aircraft production rates we now expect our fiscal year revenue to be approximately  billion and q earnings per share to be approximately  per diluted share which excludes red oak facility transition cost and is based on a weighted average share count of  million shares we now project our q adjusted ebitda to be approximately  million excluding the nonrecurring cost associated with the red oak facility transition we expect to generate free cash flow available for debt reduction share repurchase and acquisitions for the fiscal year of approximately  million which represents the incorporation of the cash used on the g and g programs in the fourth quarter and the impact of the  program this does not include the  million received related to gulfstream programs in tulsa we have reduced overall earnings guidance to reflect a number of factors impacting our full year results to include delays in completing deliveries of the c program lower production rates on certain commercial programs continued softness in military aftermarket and the timing of resolution of certain nonrecurring claims with customers and we have incorporated the projected impact of the g and g wing programs which positively impact earnings per share but are currently a drag on adjusted ebitda and cash we are currently in the mist of the planning process for fiscal year  but are not yet prepare to provide full guidance while we are still confidence in the long term top and bottom line growth opportunity for this business we would generally expect fiscal  to be a transition year with production ending and the c program rate reductions on  and a programs and continued uncertainty in the military aftermarket being offset by the incorporation of the g and g wing programs and the ramp on recent wins on the a and a programs while we also complete development efforts and begin initial deliveries on the bombardier global  and embraer e jet programs overall i expect the top line to reflect a  to  growth yearoveryear excluding any benefits associated with future acquisitions while the bottom line will reflect margin expansion driven by the full year benefit related to the red oak facility continued synergy realization on recent acquisition and capturing benefits associated with a number of improvement initiatives we continue to see the business generating positive cash in fiscal  although it will be muted from previous expectations driven by the outflows required on the g and g wings and then lower performance expectations on  program we do plan on providing a detailed view of fiscal year  guidance as part of our fourth quarter’s earnings release and with that ill turn it back over to jeff jeffry d frisby thank you jeff in terms of the outlook for the balance of the fiscal year and i know jeff just went over this in great detail i’d just like to accentuate a few things we have a strong backlog and continue to win new contracts on key growth programs we remain focused on execution increasing profitability expanding our margins and generating strong cash flow our financial guidance is as jeff just outlined and that is that our revenue is expected to now be approximately  billion and the quarterly eps were approximately a  per diluted share is something that weve just laid out this number but i think that you can understand that a number like this indicates that we still have a great deal of confidence in our ability to deliver results  would be in fact a very solid quarter and we remain confident in our ability to do so then as both jeff and i have stated we are absolutely committed to leveraging the strength of our portfolio to drive growth in the near and the midterm so at this time id like to open the phone lines to answer any questions you may have questionandanswer session operator operator instructions sam pearlstein please state your affiliation followed by your question samuel pearlstein wells fargo good morning guys jeffry d frisby good morning sam samuel pearlstein  in the past youve talked about we were   quarter turn or half a turn it would be  million or  million so this is obviously larger so just i mean are you assuming an even lower rate as you go out to  or what are you doing differently than you had in the past when you provided that estimate jeffrey l mcrae yeah sam i mean we are assuming a level of rate volatility on  as we look forward boeing has announced going to  in our analysis we think we’ve fully covered any future rate volatility we would see on this program and as we step back and look at what the magnitude of rate reduction would be it caused us also take to look back at what other impacts that there is potential risk on and we try to provide for those in this analysis so the primary area being in the assumption of where our labor performance and overall cost performance will be on this program through the end and as i mentioned we still have four years of production in front of us and i think what we have done now is taken kind of a more risk adjusted approach of viewing where we think we are in this program through the end samuel pearlstein okay and then just on the cash flow i know in the past you talked about  million to  million on an ongoing basis you said its lower than that because of the  and the gulfstream program but is there any way to size the magnitude of that reduction and how long until you get back on to that kind of a track of  million or so jeffrey l mcrae yeah what i would say and as it relates specifically to the g and g we still see ourselves turning those programs on a net basis cash positive by the end of fiscal year  we know the cash drain early on will be higher and it will wane as we go through the first three years as we think of the first quarter of operation i would look at that being the highest use of cash it is also hurt by the fact that we did not receive receivables as part of the transaction so there is a delay in beginning receipts from customers as we go through  at fiscal year  i would expect the cash use to wane and continue to wane as we get through the end of fiscal year  where we still stay within the balance of the  million weve received on the program on  as we look at the forward loss we have to keep in mind that the cash related to that forward loss is still in front of us and its very much backend loaded to roughly twothirds of the cash would hit us in fiscal year  and  which is driven by price breaks we have on the last lot under contract so as you feather those two things in there the timing of those are a little different but it really creates a greater drain as we think of fiscal    than what we have previously would have anticipated and as we talked in the past as we look forward the other significant headwind that we still have when we begin getting out into fiscal  and  is we will become a cash tax payer so we currently still project zero cash tax in fiscal  roughly  cash tax in fiscal  becoming a full tax cash payer in fiscal  and beyond which we believe is a rate roughly  to  in those years samuel pearlstein okay thank you operator thank you steven cahall please state your affiliation followed by your question steven cahall yeah thank you from royal bank of canada good morning jeffry d frisby good morning steven cahall maybe just to follow up on the  program first i was wondering as we take a look at this im guessing that kind of the big unknownunknown here is the revised labor and cost estimate so wondering if you can give a little bit more color as to how you come about sizing those and then you talked a lot about the ongoing productivity improvement and what sort of the risk and opportunity is there as we think about this longterm estimate jeffrey l mcrae yeah i mean as we proceed on those programs we have historically assumed a certain level of period over period improvements in the labor performance as well as the broader cost performance as we looked at the eacs for the balance of the contract we definitely flattened our expectation around performance and most of that’s driven labor as well as overhead cost we think that there is still opportunity we can drive improvement above what we projected but we thought this was the appropriate time to really scale back our expectation of improvement through the end of the contract so i would say i think we have at least bracketed the risk and are still striving to drive opportunity in  this also assumes that we produce through the end of the contract as we’ve spoken in the past you know we are confident in boeing’s ability to sell planes but as we sit here today they haven’t fully filled out the order book through the end of our contract if they want  they were to end the program before the end of the contract there be some claw back of this loss i would say that the risk at that point would be then around any facility shut down impacts that we would have to factor in steven cahall okay that’s helpful and then on  if we think about this sort cascading to where we are on the a how would you couch that program in comparison to the  airbus has certainly suggested that rates are coming down but could come down further so how does that program sit versus where you are on  jeffrey l mcrae yeah completely different dynamics on  you know  is built in facilities with a number of other programs so the magnitude of impact when we see rate reductions isn’t the same as we see on  where they are pretty much in dedicated type facilities as we have looked at projections on  we have built in the rate reduction expectation that airbus has already communicated and as we build business plans without firm direction from airbus on rate reductions we have assumed continued step down in rates as we get out beyond fiscal ’ as a transition to neo i would say our current margin expectation on  comes down a little bit at lower rates but it isn’t to the same magnitude that we are dealing with here on  jeffry d frisby and i think another key difference in looking at a go forward view of  and  is that if in fact we identified a particular level of capital investment that we might make in order to drive costs down the run rate the quantity of the aircraft in front of us on a is fundamentally different in fact can provide a business case that can help us drive costs down and pay for those things  is not necessarily  does not necessarily have that luxury so it is two totally different scenarios steven cahall and the  looks more like the  or the  jeffry d frisby yeah i would say the general dynamics on  would look like  correct steven cahall so it’s not in a dedicated facility like  jeffry d frisby correct definitely amount yeah  is really the one anomaly where it resides in two they are not fully dedicated but it’s you know  of the work load in the facilities steven cahall thank you i will get back in the queue jeffry d frisby thanks steve operator thank you and our next question is from myles walton please state your affiliation and your question myles walton deutsche bank thanks good morning jeffry d frisby good morning myles walton i think jeff mcrae you had previously had a  billion to  billion cash projection for the five year  going forward i think gulfstream programs are it would seem  million negative to that after tax ahead of the  hit  million so are we now looking at  billion to  billion or is the range even lower than that jeffrey l mcrae yeah i mean at a macro level and i havent run out updated cash flows for five years myles but on a macro level i think those are the two key impacts that were looking at and i would say jeff and i are still very optimistic with some of the other things were doing in the business that well be able to recover that cash by driving improvements and taking cost out of the overall structure within triumph myles walton the mortality assumption hit on the  rather what  that you had here in the quarter is that triggered by the rate decision and should we expect it to roll through the rest of the portfolio at year end jeffrey l mcrae so what happens on  because were in a forward loss position it really what it’s doing is pulling forward the change that we anticipate in the next four years from our previous projection on pension benefit to our current projection on pension benefit so it really is magnifying that impact as we pull it forward in to  we still anticipate some yearoveryear growth in pension benefit as we move forward its just not at the same magnitude that it would have been previously before in corporation in the tables so i think the impact on other programs it bleeds in slower because those are still in positive positions and they tend just to be seeing the impact of a single year versus this situation where ’s pulling in four years of that delta myles walton okay and then this question is kind of the high level it ties the cash back to the portfolio jeff frisby youve had challenges in the aerostructures realistically youll continue to over the next few years look challenges and execution opportunities on the aerostructures aerosystems and aftersystems business dont seem to be encumbered by the same dynamics what if anything would require you to think about breaking the two and also are the two kind of cash independent at this points that is the next five year projection would both be able to function into their projected cash flow streams independently jeffry d frisby well the company operates as one really and i would say that the opportunities that are in front of us as they relate to the aerostructures business are still available to us in the systems business as well some of the initiatives that we are working on are going to benefit the entire enterprise so its going to  its one of those things that yeah weve got some difficulty in trying to drive margins back up to an acceptable level in aerostructures and were working on those issues and well succeed to doing so but it doesnt mean that those same initiatives wont take margins in our systems and aftermarket businesses in fact improve those as well so i think that its not a tale of two companies here we have one company and a lot of our success comes from the fact that we gain a lot of benefit from leverage we can bring across being a  billion company so that really cant be minimized so im not sure if i captured all of the aspects of your question so whatever i missed if you want to reask i will be happy myles walton yeah i mean it does look like that certainly the underlying organic differences are materially different you provide the top  programs and you can see it in the portfolio manifestation so it does seem divergent certainly challenges and then on the cash side i guess the other point to the question was is aerostructures kind of in need of the cash venerability of aerosystems im sorry aerospace systems and aftermarket at this point jeffry d frisby yeah myles i dont think there is great distortion as we look longterm in this business between the segments from a cash generation and deployment obviously with investments required on development programs in the structures world it tends to be larger investments within the longer term returns on those investments so you get a little more lumpiness but we dont view this business as the deployment or generation of cash in systems and aftermarket and just go in to fund structures or vice versa and long term i don’t see a great disparity there myles walton okay thanks operator thank you and our next question is from sheila kahyaoglu please say your affiliation and your question sheila kahyaoglu great thanks it’s jefferies good morning jeffry d frisby good morning sheila kahyaoglu  jefferies llc research division just to follow up on steve’s question a bit how do you get the investment community comfortable that whether it’s the  or the a that this is sort of one of the biggest charge and what changed between today and looking back to september  in terms of cost on the  and head count can you may be talk about production rate is difficult i understand but maybe some of the changes that you’ve made jeffrey l mcrae yeah i mean as we think  from the impacts we saw going back over a year ago a lot of the impact that we realized over a year ago although it related to performance within our shop it was also recognition of the impact of the broader supply chain on the  program a lot of disruption from my quality and delivery standpoint where we were not meeting the expectations of our customers there was a lot of expedited freight type of cost that we were incurring at that point in time i would say as we sit here today and we’ve talked about the forward loss we are now taking we are back on schedule with the customer the quality continues to improve in the product we are delivering the performance has improved overtime it hasn’t been at the rate that we would like to have seen it improve at but i would say overall the  program is much more stable that it was a year ago the variable is as boeing reduces rates and potentially as we look in the future at future rate reductions that has a significant impact on  because of how it’s produced and where it’s produced in dedicated facilities where we don’t have the luxury of being able to take as much cost out as we see from the impact in lower revenue coming in on the program from a risk standpoint and i tried to talk about it with steve’s question we think we have bracketed what is a reasonable expectation looking forward on this program and have fully provided for what we believe would be the impacts of future rate variability as well as a much lower expectation from a performance standpoint i am never going to say never especially on this program but i think we in this charge have attempted to put our arms fully around what we think is in front of us and we think as we look at driving improvement and tracking opportunities we see on this program this is weighted more so towards opportunities then future risks jeffry d frisby and the important statement has already been made that the  is a unique program in our company and that it is the only program that has effectively dedicated facilities we’ve always stated that triumph is far more flexible and resilient in face of rate cuts because of our facilities not being dedicated to individual programs the  is alone in being the exception to that rule and while certainly rate cuts will affect us in some way as they affect most manufactures we in fact will not experience the same kind of impact on other programs as we mentioned in our answer to steve’s question sheila kahyaoglu got it thank you that’s very helpful and then i guess just a quick followup how do you think about normalized margins within structures going forward jeffrey l mcrae yeah i mean you are going to have revenue on  going forward and as we look at through the end of the contract we still have roughly  billion of revenue on that contract that will flow through the pl that will flow through the pl at  percent margin so obviously that is dilutive to margins in the aerostructure segment when we exclude the  from aerostructures we still see ourselves operating with operating margins in the midteens and we think that that is sustainable we will see some impact as the bombardier  program ramps up as well embraer ejets because our expectation with those would be at a lower then segment margin in their first accounting blocks and would grow to above segment margins as we proceed through accounting blocks so we will have some of that dynamic in structures but i still it’s reasonable to look at that business being a midteen operating margin business as we look forward excluding  sheila kahyaoglu thanks operator thank you our next question is from cai von rumohr please state your name and your affiliation  i am sorry your affiliation and your question operator instructions okay are there any additional questions looks like our next question is from kevin ciabattoni please state your affiliation and your question jeffry d frisby she’s not part of the triumph ph operator is there other questions in the queue maybe we can move on and circle back to cai and kevin operator sure okay just one moment looks like our next question is from steve levenson please state your affiliation and your question jeffry d frisby okay it seems a common theme here jeffrey l mcrae try to get this fixed operator okay i am just going to look into this if everyone could please hold for just one moment thank you once again our next question is from sheila kahyaoglu please state your affiliation and your question let’s try kevin ciabattoni please state your affiliation and your question kevin ciabattoni hi can you hear me jeffry d frisby yeah we sure can kevin kevin ciabattoni all right great keybanc thanks jeffry d frisby and we apologize if we were accusing you of not coming off of mute i think there was a technical difficulty here kevin ciabattoni i figured thanks so my first question real quick i just want to touch on the free cash flow i think youve mentioned expectations for next year are a little bit muted relative to your prior thoughts is that including the  million that you guys received from spirit as part of the gulfstream package or are we… jeffrey l mcrae no i mean what we have done with that  as we think of free cash flow weve excluded that  from that equation so as i think of fiscal  my comment really is muted around the known outflows will have on the tulsa programs as well as the impact with the lower expectations on  kevin ciabattoni okay perfect thats helpful and then just want to look at aftermarket a little bit you saw  organic growth there just wondering if you could give us some color on what youre seeing in that market and then on the military side it sounded like youre expecting things to pickup into the back half of this year looking at last quarter and now it sounds like maybe thats not the case just wondering whats changed there jeffry d frisby yeah i mean what were seeing in the aftermarket services segment is most of the organic growth is coming on the commercial side so were still seeing the same what i just take as pentup demand on the military side that we keep expecting to free up when i talked to our aftermarket companies they talked with a level of frustration because they can see the product they have customers on the military side expressing that funding will be coming and things keep getting pushed out its not clear to us if its budget constraints or other factors there but even with that softness we have seen very strong performance within our aftermarket services businesses but most of its being driven by commercial work as opposed to military kevin ciabattoni okay thats helpful and then last one from me maybe if you guys could provide us with any kind of specific changes that occurred at red oak through the quarter in terms of the progress there and then any potential for further footprint consolidation as we look into fiscal   jeffry d frisby yeah i mean red oak specifically i would say as we sit here today we have achieved getting back to expected performance levels on most programs there are a couple of outliers that we were closed on just not there yet c and i talked to really is one anomaly there where primarily because of it coming to its end of production weve been experiencing a number of shortages within the supply chain and thats both our supply chain as well as customer furnished product which has really impacted performance there and has impacted our ability to complete the program here in the fourth quarter so we will see revenue slippage in to fiscal  but we continue to monitor the performance at red oak on a regular basis and have been very pleased with what were seeing there i think all of the kind of instability early on with the workforce has worked its way through and theyre starting to really hit on all cylinders its also where we are building the wing for the bombardier global  and the team there did get out the first wing to bombardier at the end of december and well continue to ramp up that program as we look forward in red oak as well weve also made a decision to produce the fuselage segments for the embraer ejet programs in red oak and that activity will be ramping up as we look into fiscal  and fiscal  as well jeffrey l mcrae and in terms of footprints consolidation that just one aspect of what were currently reviewing and the reason i say that is that while some footprint consolidation just make sense and we have in fact accomplished some of that in this fiscal year and we are continuing to implement the footprint consolidations such as consolidating our two long island manufacturing facilities into one there are still is an opportunity i think to expand what we are doing in other words reducing our footprints only makes sense if in fact we have underutilized capacity that we really have nothing to do with and with the acquisition of the tulsa wing program we have a fair amount of opportunity to drive additional vertical value through the value stream so those decisions that we may have made six months ago may not make sense now with the additional value that we can drive through a far more fully utilized facility that said i’ll go back to the flip side of that and we are continuing to look at where our longterm footprint focus needs to be in terms of being competitive in all of our segments so this is a subject that we are acting on now we are looking at  we are in the process of acting on projects that will run through ‘ and it’s an area of focus for us not only in ‘ but also what is the longterm industrialization strategy of the company kevin ciabattoni okay great thank you guys operator thank you and our next question is from steve levenson stephen e levenson thanks good morning can you hear me jeffry d frisby hi steve stephen e levenson okay great thank you on the cash received as part of the gg transaction are there any restrictions or can you use it you please jeffrey l mcrae we can use it as we please i mean as we review we received it on the th of december it went in and reduced the outstanding revolver we had at that point in time but it it goes into the bucket of deployment from looking at opportunities both organically and inorganically and share repurchase stephen e levenson got it thank you separately can you give us a little more information on the global  when you get some relief on that inventory and can you just give us some idea of how the ejet schedule looks jeffry d frisby yeah so i mean we have delivered the first test articles on the global  most of the deliveries that we have in fiscal ‘ are additional test articles going to bombardier we would expect to start seeing revenue units on global  by the end of fiscal ‘ but really so ramping up in fiscal ’ when we start delivering revenue units is when we start liquidating the development cost on that it’s also when the payments related to development costs flow in the initial few hundred units on that program on embraer you can generally think of being roughly nine to months behind that schedule that we’ve talked to on bombardier we will start delivering test units in midfiscal ‘ but wouldn’t really start seeing revenues until the end of fiscal ‘ and really ramping up then in fiscal ‘ stephen e levenson okay thanks last one is how much more inventory  what additions do you think there will be on the global  program jeffry d frisby so we are effective  but we are not yet done with the development from an engineering stand point but we are closing in on it so i would expect by the end of this fiscal year early fiscal year ‘ that the engineering activity will be concluded we would always expect some level of ongoing activity just as we continue to optimize within the build and design so most of ‘ though is that investment in the test articles i would generally look at the investment required in bombardier in fiscal ‘ to be roughly half of what we’ve seen in the fiscal ‘ stephen e levenson okay thank you very much operator operator instruction and our next question is from cai von rumohr please state your affiliation and your question unidentified analyst it’s lucy dialing in for cai from cowen and company can you hear me okay jeffry d frisby yeah lucy unidentified analyst good morning so just followingup on the previous question i am in interested in learning about cash requirements on new programs in the past you have talked about  million or so for the global  and the e where does that sit today and given it sounds like you are on track for scheduling in cost for those programs jeffry d frisby yeah so if you look at spending today in fiscal ’ we are slightly under that  million mark i still expect full year spending on global  and embraer to be in the  million to  million range i would expect that to diminish significantly as we move into fiscal year ’ where i would look at probably roughly half of that spend in fiscal year ’ unidentified analyst right and i may have missed this earlier you talked about continued softness in military aftermarket are you expecting that to get better at any point maybe next year jeffry d frisby you know we have continued to expect improvement there we have in our mind pushed out that improvement into fiscal ’ so i wouldn’t expect much improvement in the fourth quarter of ’ but we are still optimistic we will see spending come back as we go into fiscal year ’ jeffrey l mcrae yeah that said the commercial side of that aftermarket business it remains robust at this time unidentified analyst great thank you operator thank you and are there additional questions at this time since there are no further questions this concludes the triumph groups fiscal  second ph quarter earnings conference call as a reminder a replay of this call will be available

that day was that the triumph was designed to be different built to perform and positioned for growth for the first time we shared not only shortterm guidance but our longterm vision as well longterm strategic plan that we have been executing for the past  years we shared how through the rest of this decade were going to mold our company into a more balanced enterprise in terms of segments customers and programs characterized by a focus on execution at all levels leading to a predictable  to  yearoveryear revenue growth and  yearoveryear growth in earnings per share in the  weeks since we last spoke we have made good progress on several fronts and have been benefited by a key customer decision shortly after investor day we settled all pending litigation with eaton ending a year legal battle and freeing us from the distractions associated with this type of activity just prior to the close of the quarter we completed the acquisition of the ge hydraulic systems businesses located in yakima washington cheltenham uk isle of man and suzhou china we completed the first quarter with results slightly better than our june  guidance and then were gratified to learn at the recent airshow in farnborough the airbus had decided to launch the aneo effectively lengthening the production life of this important airframe well into the next decade each of these accomplishments and milestones is important individually but together they provide us with solid momentum heading into the balance of our fiscal year and beyond well get into more detail on some of these issues shortly theres one last item id like to cover before i get into the slides there have been many questions asked and there has been much speculation around triumph groups interest in and intentions towards certain assets owned by spirit aerosystems in tulsa i want to make a statement that will serve as the sum total of what we will say on this subject at this time and we have long stated that we would have an interest in certain pieces of spirits gulf tulsa business specifically the gulfstream wings should they become available we have also long stated since winwin agreements are hard to reach that winwin winwin agreements are far more complex and more difficult to achieve that being said we still have interest in reaching such an agreement if possible and we will let you all know if and when we have something to report all right then at that lets turn to page  titled q in review as ive mentioned our first quarter results came in as expected we had a solid start to our fiscal year were slightly above the upper end of our investor day guidance in our aerostructures segment we had a solid quarter in spite of our lower  and  program revenue and the shifting of several c shipments to quarter  which was also mentioned at investor day and importantly the  program is on track in terms of aerospace systems organic sales were impacted by production rate cuts on v program and decrease in military sales but we had continued good performance at triumph engine control systems as well as other companies in the group our aftermarket services business was down revenuewise but we had continued strength in operating margin performance despite military aftermarket weakness i should add that we remain confident that this segment will recover well as the year progresses we successfully completed the acquisition of the hydraulic actuation businesses of ge as i mentioned earlier and we are excited about and we have high hopes for this acquisition as we speak efforts are underway to make the kind of improvements necessary to achieve the margin potential this business has ge operated this business in  locations and as part of the agreement we will be moving out of some shared facilities and will be able to achieve some benefit from consolidating footprint this business is also virtually entirely proprietary in nature and as such should have a more vibrant aftermarket presence than they do we are clearly executing plans to take greater advantage of this position thirdly as in the case of engine control systems this company was and ill use the term saddled with contracts that provided parent company benefit but were in varying degrees detrimental to the individual site and were in the process of shifting course relative to these contracts now these efforts among others plus the natural lift you get from a large dose of autonomy and support will add up to a very successful addition to our aerospace systems segment as i mentioned earlier we settled all pending litigation with eaton and we received  million in cash theres not much more to say about this its over we received their payment and now we can focus on winning more business as you know we successfully completed the refinancing of the highyield debt due  providing us some important interest reductions and we executed a  share buyback for approximately  million and effectively repurchased an additional  shares when we redeemed our convertible notes ill be back to address our outlook shortly but i will now hand over to jeff mcrae jeff jeffrey l mcrae thank you jeff and good morning everyone id like to start with a review of the financial results for the first quarter turning first to the income statement sales for the first quarter were  million compared to  million for the prioryear period a decrease of  operating income for the quarter increased  to  million and included  million of costs related to the jefferson streetred oak facility transition and  million of settlement gain net of legal fees related to the eaton litigation excluding these nonrecurring items operating margin was  for the quarter the prior years first quarter included approximately  million of nonrecurring costs related to the jefferson street move excluding these costs operating margin was  for the prior years first quarter net income was  million resulting in earnings per share of  per diluted share versus  per diluted share for the prior year quarter excluding the nonrecurring items for both periods net income was  million or  per diluted share versus  million or  per diluted share for the prior years quarter adjusted ebitda excluding the net settlement gain was  million resulting in an adjusted ebitda margin of  the number of shares used in computing diluted earnings per share for the quarter was  million shares now looking at our segment performance sales in the aerostructures segment for the first quarter declined  to  million primarily due to the production rate cuts in the  program whereas we were still at  ship sets per month in q  lower revenues in the  program and the shifting of several c shipments into the second quarter first quarter operating income was  million compared to  million for the prioryear period and included  million of pretax charges related to the red oak facility transition most of this is cost that was incurred in fiscal year  that is embedded in block accounting although we did incur some additional cost in the quarter related to the cleanup and disposal efforts at the jefferson street facility we also saw a net unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustment of  the segments operating margin for the quarter was  excluding the red oak facility transition cost the segments operating margin was  ebitda for the quarter was  million with an ebitda margin of  we continue to make good progress in ramping up production at red oak and anticipate being fully back on schedule and recover the preproduction performance levels on all programs by the middle of the fiscal year the overall red oak business case continues to hold in line with previous guidance as we move through the year we will see segment margin enhancement driven by red oak as we get into accounting blocks that are being fully executed in red oak in fy  and beyond as jeff mentioned we also saw a continued stabilization in our  program in line with our expectations which has allowed us to maintain a low singledigit margin on the current accounting block our margin calculation is based on the assumption that we maintain a production rate of  ship sets per month we also continued to make progress with the development of the wing for the bombardier global  and  and are on track to deliver the initial wings in support of the development effort this fiscal year the rudder elevator and fuselage sections of the embraer ejet are also on track and we anticipate making initial deliveries on those during the first half of fiscal year  we incurred  million of development cost on these programs during the quarter moving onto aerospace systems sales in this segment were  million basically flat compared to the prior years quarter organic sales for the quarter declined  primarily due to production rate cuts on the v program and overall lower military sales first quarter operating income decreased  from the prior year quarter to  million with an operating margin of  ebitda for the quarter was  million at an ebitda margin of  and as jeff mentioned we did complete the acquisition of the ge hydraulic actuation business at the end of the first fiscal quarter the financial statements had incorporated a preliminary opening balance sheet for this business while there was no material impact on the income statement due to the timing of the closing of the transaction we still project this business to be immediately accretive contributing approximately  to our fy  earnings per share while it will be neutral from a cash generation standpoint as we make investments to consolidate the overall footprint of the business as we work to consolidate the european elements into our existing actuation and motion control business in the uk we expect to drive segment average margins from this business in the midterm and we will see positive cash generation and ebitda in fy  consistent with our expectations excluding the impact of ge we anticipate improved margins in this segment during the balance of fy  driven by aftermarket which was light in the first quarter in the segment moving to aftermarket services segment revenues here in the first quarter were  million compared to  million in the prioryear period the yearoveryear decrease reflected the timing of completion of certain contracts and continued softness in the military aftermarket first quarter operating income decreased  over the prior year quarter to  million with an operating margin of  ebitda for the quarter was  million with an ebitda margin of  on the commercial side of our aftermarket segment we have seen an increase in the pace of opportunities which will drive a level of recovery in this segment although weighted to the second half of the fiscal year and offsetting some of the softness we are seeing in the military aftermarket we anticipate holding margins at q levels in this segment for the balance of the year with some opportunities for improvement driven by product mix as jeff mentioned during the quarter with did repurchase  shares for approximately  million and effectively repurchased some additional  shares with a redemption of our convertible notes bringing the total number of shares repurchased or effectively repurchased to  shares we will continue to tactically repurchase shares as part of a balanced approach to capital deployment and managing our overall liquidity position for your reference we have included a pensionopeb analysis for triumph aerostructures which remains in line with our previous disclosures during the quarter we did contribute  million to the pension plan in line with our fiscal year assumptions turning now to backlog our backlog take into consideration only those firm orders that we are going to deliver over the next  months and primarily reflects future sales within our aerostructures and aerospace systems groups the aftermarket services group does not have a substantial backlog our order backlog as of june  was just over  billion up  yearoveryear and did include the incorporation of approximately  million of backlog held by the ge hydraulic actuation business which significantly improved our position on the boeing  program and the airbus a and a programs samestore backlog increased  sequentially and  from the prior year military represented approximately  of our total backlog boeing remained our only customer to exceed  of total revenue net sales to boeing commercial mil  and military and space totaled  of our revenue and it was broken down  commercial and  military for your reference we have included in the appendix charts reflecting sales by market and sales trends now turning to the balance sheet during the quarter we did utilize  million of cash flow from operations before pension contributions of  million inventory for the quarter increased  million of which approximately  million was attributable to nonrecurring investment in the bombardier and embraer programs and  million was related to the ge acquisition we also ended the quarter with a significantly elevated level of accounts receivable which included  million related to the eaton settlement  million related to a tax refund due to the completion of the irx  irs examination of our nol carryback claim and  million related to the closure of a claim from a prior acquisition these  payments have all been received in july capex in the quarter was  million and we continue to project capex for the year to be in the range of  million to  million and expect nonrecurring investment in major programs to be approximately  million for the year net debt at the end of the first quarter was  billion a  million increase from the end of the previous quarter reflecting cash use of  million to repurchase shares  million to fund the acquisition of the ge hydraulic business  million used to fund the call premiums related to the  higher notes and the convertible debt as well as financing fees on the new debt issuance and  million in pension contributions net debt represented  of total capital and total debt to trailing  months adjusted ebitda was x although ending the quarter over our targeted leverage position we anticipate bringing this back within the targeted range over the next  quarters based on current interest rates we anticipate a quarterly interest expense including amortization of fees of between  million and  million for the balance of the fiscal year  the global effective tax rate for the quarter was  and reflected the fact that the rd tax credit expired in december  and has not yet been renewed in addition the income tax expense for the quarter was reduced by approximately  million to reflect the additional tax benefit resulting from the completion of the irs examination of our nol carryback claim and the reversal of tax reserves from a cash tax perspective we currently expect minimal cash tax to be paid in fiscal year  in terms of financial guidance we are reaffirming our fy  guidance based on current projected aircraft production rates and a weighted average share count of  million shares we expect full year revenues to be  billion to  billion and earnings per share excluding the nonrecurring items to be  to  per share we have good visibility into our business given our backlog and the anticipated benefit from recent activities regarding the quarterly flow of earnings we expect to see strengthening the quarters as the year progresses with greater weighting towards the second half of the fiscal year driving results will be the realization of the full benefit of the ge acquisition the red oak facility transition recent wins and the general seasonality of a number of our businesses increase in the cadence of opportunities in the aftermarket segment and realizing the full benefits of the share repurchase made to date we expect that q will be higher than q contributing  to  of full year projected earnings excluding nonrecurring items we continue to project our full year adjusted ebitda to be  million to  million which excludes the impact of the eaton settlement and nonrecurring costs associated with the red oak transition and we expect to generate free cash flow after pension contributions for the year of approximately  million which has been increased to reflect the eaton settlement a number of you have inquired recently about the potential impact of further reduction in the  program production rate but we currently do not have any indication that production rates from the  will change if boeing were to direct us to reduce production rates on the program which we believe would most likely take program to a rate of between  and  per month it would have a negative impact on the profitability of the program although we do believe wed be able to maintain a slight positive margin on the current accounting block our greater impact would be on future accounting blocks for which we would be put into loss positions forcing us to recognize those projected losses on a current basis given this scenario our current estimate of the impact would be a pretax charge of approximately  million to  million obviously the impact is highly dependent on the level of rate reduction as well as the duration of any rate reduction we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers and are taking actions to improve our internal cost structure and performance to drive improved margins on these programs and mitigate the impact related to any potential rate reduction and with that i will turn it back over to jeff jeffry d frisby thank you jeff turning to our outlook we remain confident in our fiscal  outlook our backlog remains strong its over  billion now we will remain focused on execution increasing profitability expanding our margins and generating strong cash flow execution is still the key that unlocks our ability to grow even more quickly we reaffirm our fy  guidance based on the current projected aircraft production rates and our weighted average share count of  million shares revenue of  billion to  billion earnings per share excluding the items listed here of  to  per share and as both jeff and i have already mentioned it is weighted towards the second half of the fiscal year with q slightly higher than q our adjusted ebitda of  million to  million remains intact and we should have cash available for debt reduction acquisitions and share repurchases of approximately  million although there are certainly challenges ahead our future remains bright with that id like to open up the phone lines for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from noah poponak omear khalid  goldman sachs group inc research division this is omear filling in for noah i believe you have noted in the past that the red oak costsaving targets only incorporate tangible and visible achievable opportunities and that potential upside could exist from higher efficiency savings once the facility is live and in operation are you now able to better quantify or describe those potential opportunities for us possibly jeffrey l mcrae yes omear i would say we are still very confident in being able to achieve greater performance in what we built into our business case we as we said in our statements see the facility getting back up and being back at the performance levels that we exited jefferson street at by the end of the second quarter middle of the year from that point forward we would expect to be able to see continued performance improvements i dont know that i would be in a position right now to start quantifying additional benefits above the  that weve previously communicated around red oak but we definitely are  continue to be optimistic of being able to drive additional performance improvements omear khalid  goldman sachs group inc research division great and just a separate followup can you spend some time discussing your overall airbus strategy you have mentioned it a little bit in your prepared remarks there what type of content would you guys be potentially interested in in going for on airbus products going forward is it more on the systems side more on the structure side or you guys have a preference or how are you guys thinking about that jeffry d frisby were really aiming for profitable work on airbus and i actually say that for a reason there are an awful lot of companies particularly due to the fragmented status of the aerostructures business in europe there are an awful lot of companies in the business not many of them making money so we are looking for the right aerostructures opportunity that fits our capabilities and allows us to perform in a way that will benefit not only airbus but ourselves and were also at the same time were looking in and succeeding in achieving systems business wins as well so one of the reasons we really were favorably viewing the ge acquisition because it had such a significant percentage of airbus content on the actuation side so its a blend i think that were not really looking at one segment in preference to the other but at the same time airbus is just one piece of our rebalancing strategy they happen to be the one of the  of the duopolies in commercial aircraft production that we dont have as significant a presence in so it becomes most prominent but its just one of our targeted customers that we are looking at in order to advance our cause of rebalancing our customers operator our next question comes from joe nadol seth m seifman  jp morgan chase  co research division its seth seifman on for joe this morning from jpmorgan just to dig in to the cash flow a little bit further thanks for the outline of the receivables i just wanted to follow up last year it seems like we have been waiting for a receivable from a large customer and receivables continue to increase through the second half of last year and then you outlined what drove the increase in q and that we should see that reversed is there a bigger reversal happening there did we see the receivable i think it was probably about  million from a major customer in the second half of last year and it got drowned out by other increases or is there a bigger reversal of that receivable  of that than what should lay out in q jeffrey l mcrae yes seth i think what youre referring to is at the end of q  we had a significant deferral of payments related to a customer that would have cleared out in q of fy  as we said at the end of q i would say that there is a level of i wont call it slow payments but timing around payments that we would have hoped to have received in q that are drifting into q i wouldnt say its a specific customer that were concerned on there it was just a general drifting on collections so from a timing standpoint i called out  large items that are sitting in that receivables balance at  those have all been received so the total of those is roughly  million that came in here in the first few weeks of july i would say that we should see continued improvement quarteroverquarter from a cash perspective in receivables but its nothing specific to call out seth m seifman  jp morgan chase  co research division okay and then i guess just in terms of getting to the guidance probably work through it but you could tell us a little bit about the receivables about the investments in capitalized inventory taxes pension any other working capital adjustments to be aware of in terms of how you get to the guidance for the year jeffrey l mcrae no i mean in our guidance we have built in a level of improvements from a working capital standpoint outside of the investments in the nonrecurring programs that are hitting inventory part of that improvement comes at we have  we begin to see some additional offsets to the investments as we have milestone payments on those nonrecurring programs that will be inflows from customers which helps us offset some of the impact there and ultimately gets reflected as a net inventory balance but we see opportunity broadly primarily in inventory as we go through fy  to continue to drive down and see improvements that will drive some of that working capital that were depicting operator our next question comes from sam pearlstein samuel j pearlstein  wells fargo securities llc research division wells fargo can you just help me i mean how should i think about the proceeds from the eaton lawsuit should that go towards buyback or any other purpose just because im a little surprised it doesnt look like you bought back much stocks since the investor day didnt know if you were blocked out for certain periods or how should we be thinking about that the extra  million jeffrey l mcrae yes i think theres a couple dynamics sam that came into play in our mind one as we think of that  million we view it in line with our broader capital and capital generation were seeing in fy  and wed look at a balanced approach to deployment of that capital so i think we continue to see a very robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities obviously we are also viewing share repurchase favorably as we look at where our share price is right now as you think of activity as we evaluated capital at the end of the first quarter we knew we had allowed our leverage ratio to creep up with the share repurchase that we had completed with the expense we incurred with the takeout of the debt and with the ge acquisition as we looked at it we felt comfortable at a leverage ratio of  and a debt to capital above  we really do want to manage that into the target range on leverage of between x and x and really keep that debt to capitalization below  so we really looked at it and balanced and didnt feel it appropriate to continue to extend ourselves in the first quarter we also knew we were going to have a strong cash generation quarter in q and we look at deployment of capital into q pretty strongly jeffry d frisby and just a  your other observation is right on since june  our investor day we had about  days i think of  even if we wanted to buy stock back until we entered a blackout period which were still in so at that point we could not act so now were in as jeff said were in a position that if in fact we think its the right opportunity well have the ability to participate samuel j pearlstein  wells fargo securities llc research division okay thats great and then just on some of the adjustments between the adjusted eps and the gaap eps it looks the jefferson streetred oak transition cost moved from  to  and then the refi cost looked like they moved down from  to  so i dont know jeff if you can help with that jeffrey l mcrae yes on red oak we did see some additional cost that we had not anticipated in the first quarter all of it was related to relocation activities primarily additional cost around cleanup and disposal of assets at jefferson street that we thought we had fully captured that cost in fourth quarter and we had a couple of additional activities we had to take care of there no additional growth in the depiction from a disruption standpoint we think all of that is behind us but some additional onetime cost on getting out of jefferson street on the refi it really is the final calculation based on the timing of taking out of those  notes where there was a dynamic on the call premium based on timing that came in a little lower than what we had been providing guidance to samuel j pearlstein  wells fargo securities llc research division okay and if i could just ask one last one i appreciate you giving us the top  programs by the different segments but is there any way to look at how those have changed since all the prior quarters would have been in aggregate so if i just look at it from  months ago to now what were the major changes amongst the top  jeffrey l mcrae yes on the aerostructures group not a whole lot of change the bombardier global  had moved into the top  i believe last quarter it is still there we saw the  program move a little bit but it really was just changing the positions i wouldnt say anything of great significance on the aerostructures side on the aerospace systems side the  program moving to the top of that list is driven by the ge acquisition with a significant content on  that also allowed the airbus a to move up the list and also move the a up the list on the aerospace systems side and i would say those were really the significant movements we saw in the quarter operator our next question comes from steven cahall steven cahall  rbc capital markets llc research division royal bank of canada maybe just one first on the  i think the quantification of some of the potential forward loss is very very helpful is just the right way to think about the range the amount of visibility you have and then also the difference between  versus  is that really the main swing factors or is there anything else we should be thinking about from a sensitivity standpoint jeffrey l mcrae yes as we went through this analysis obviously a lot of variables in play one being if there was a rate reduction what is the timing of that rate reduction and then what is the magnitude of that rate reduction and then for how long does it  do we move forward at a lower rate i would say the biggest dynamic impacting the range is really rate so between  and  drove most of the dynamic between the  million and  million that we depicted keep in mind on this contract were under contract through unit  we know boeing hasnt sold all those planes our analysis assumes that we run out through the end of the contract steven cahall  rbc capital markets llc research division thats great thats very helpful and then just a followup maybe on the ge acquisition i think if i heard correctly you said you expect that to be positive ebitda by fy  so maybe kind of  questions is there much risk to that transition process or is this really the big contract that you talked about rolling off and so theres not a lot of operational risk there and then with the  moving up in aerospace systems is this part of the issue there is either coming to a learning curve or moving to a development contract on the  that rolls off next year jeffry d frisby okay so ill try to remember both parts of the question ill answer the second one the  program is fully developed there  in any program like this you typically develop the system and get it qualified get it delivered and then theres typically a period of time where you go back and see if theres anything you can do to increase the value engineering possibilities in terms of cost reduction or in terms of weight reduction and so there will be minor tweaks to this system in terms of improving it but any kind of development activity on this program is well behind it on the  let me see on the first part talking really about operational risk and the integration of this company the risks involved here are just those inherent with moving a  anytime you move product from one place to another we have to move out of suzhou china for example and we have to move our operations out of cheltenham out of the facilities that we share with ge there are some risks inherent in moving any of those types of things we have a lot of experience in doing that so we dont really expect a great deal of downside to that we plan for certain capital expenditures and other operational expenses in order to do that but at the end of the day we end up with i think a far more costeffective footprint as we better utilize some of the facilities that were moving this product to so i think on balance were looking at a pretty positive experience here operator our next question comes from yair reiner yair reiner  oppenheimer  co inc research division oppenheimer just going back to aerostructures for a bit if i take out the impact from the cumulative catchup adjustments it looks like margin in the first quarter was a touch over  which is actually a bit below where youve been trending over the last year maybe you can talk about whats driving that and why you expect it to improve as we move through the year jeffrey l mcrae yes i think the main driver that we will see from an improvement in margin will be associated with realization of the red oak investment and the dynamic were in right now is most of the product that were shipping out of red oak today are in accounting blocks that straddle fiscal year  and fiscal year  so many of those blocks are still burdened with the cost structure at jefferson street thats being averaged over the accounting block as we get to the second half of the year and start completing the blocks that had jefferson street impacts well get into pure accounting blocks that are just red oak and straddle fy  and fy  and well get the full benefit of the cost structure in red oak that will be the primary driver of improvement as we look forward to the second half of the year the only other nuance dynamic i would say in the first quarter that we saw is we did see a number of shipments on c shift out of the first quarter into the second quarter c tends to be a program that we would generally see at or above average segment margins on so what we have a little bit of a mix going on in the first quarter and that should correct itself in the second and third quarters yair reiner  oppenheimer  co inc research division and then just as a followup you mentioned in response to an earlier question that you expect that kind of by the middle of the year towards the second half of the year the red oak facility should start to have jsftype margins i was hoping youd maybe give us a little more detail on that because where to draw the line on what the jsf margins really were is a bit difficult given some of the disruptions that have happened over the last year jeffrey l mcrae yes let me correct my statement if i said margins i meant to say performance and performance really is recovery of the labor performance back to where we were what i would depict as premove activity so as we transitioned to red oak getting tools set up getting employees back on the tools and back up to fully up the learning curve were still working through that here in the first half of the year but we definitely anticipate and id say that were on  were there on many programs today well be there on all programs by the middle of the year where our performance levels is at least at the level before the move activity started which is  has a relationship to margin the bigger margin driver around red oak is really the cost structure in red oak versus jefferson street there yair reiner  oppenheimer  co inc research division got it you did say performance i misread it to mean margin my last question then ill get back into queue it looks like your guidance assumes that theres going to be some improvement in organic sales for the balance of the year can you give us kind of a rough sense of what you anticipate organic growth will be in the final  quarters jeffrey l mcrae yes it definitely i would say as we look at the first quarter it was light from a revenue standpoint part of that was just timing of deliveries around c that we will see come back in the balance of the year i would say other than the c dynamic we wouldnt see much additional growth from the aerostructures standpoint in aerospace systems we will see the inorganic benefit of the ge acquisition come in so we will get  quarters of revenue generation there we had anticipated full year revenue out of ge in the  million range we would anticipate in the last  quarters between  million and  million of revenue generation out of that business and we would expect to see what i would depict as low to mid singledigit organic growth within systems much of that is we would expect some pickup in the aftermarket element of aerospace systems in the balance of the year that tends to be a bit seasonal for us and we definitely saw a light quarter from an aftermarket element of aerospace systems so that will drive a lot of the pickup there and then in aftermarket services there i think we are still anticipating a significant improvement from a top line standpoint and being able to hold bottom line margins we still believe we will return to  closer to fy  top line levels in aftermarket services the cadence of opportunities were seeing primarily in commercial aftermarket has increased significantly in that business turning opportunities to revenue happens pretty quickly and we dont have a long lead like we do in our other segments operator our next question comes from david strauss david e strauss  ubs investment bank research division ubs i want to talk or ask about the c so last quarter you had a negative in cash this quarter there was nothing but can you just talk about your ability to kind of manage that program down in risk jeff you mentioned the margins there are above average risks that kind of the margin profile as you manage that program down and how youre thinking about it given that i believe boeing still has about  unsold airplanes jeffrey l mcrae yes i mean on c obviously were paying close attention because we definitely would expect a deterioration in labor performance as you get close to the end of production and its not necessarily folks arent working as hard it s that you tend to run into more issues with the parts flow and if you scrap apart trying to get another part from a supplier ends up creating disruption within the line so were definitely looking at kind of broad performance to degradate that said contractually we believe we have a strong position to ensure that were at least being kept whole for the dynamics of bringing a program to an end so i wouldnt expect significant degradation in margin i would expect some degradation in margin but we think ultimately and we will work with the customer very closely to ensure that were being compensated as this comes to on end you also get that dynamic of as it comes to an end we still are optimistic of seeing a level of postproduction spares requirements that will allow us to at least help keep the line hot so to speak that will help us get through some of the tailup issues we would see as the production units come to an end david e strauss  ubs investment bank research division and jeff when would you expect revenues related to new aircraft builds ending jeffrey l mcrae on the big structure side it will end at the  pretty much in line with the end of the fiscal year it starts bleeding in in early in the third quarter fiscal year when we get into the detailed parts that we supply into c so youll start seeing a slow diminishment in revenue q q and its completely done from a production unit by the end of q david e strauss  ubs investment bank research division okay then my last question on gulfstream the expectation is that gulfstream is going to announce a refresh update whatever you want to call it on the g program sometime in the near future and obviously you have a very large role on those programs can you just talk about kind of how you see your role on whatever the future g looks like jeffrey l mcrae yes i mean let me start i mean expectations  and i think we have said this publicly if not we will now is our expectation is we wouldnt see the same level of content on nextgeneration gulfstream aircraft that we see today on the g where we deliberate fully integrated wing to gulfstream that said with our structure we can play at many levels of the supply chain feeding gulfstream wings from a tier  tier  tier  and i fully expect to have a high level of participation on any program gulfstream launches and although it might not be at the same level of supply that we have on the g i would fully expect it to look more like what we do on g where we supply a full wing box to savannah not to say that we would be supplying a wing box but i think revenue stream would look much like what we have on g and i think we will see a lot of opportunities to play at lower levels of the supply chain in the structures world and i think therell be a lot of opportunities for us to play on the systems side jeffry d frisby yes i think all that goes to say that each customer as they approach each new airplane and assuming that gulfstream actually has an airplane as you described is they tend to go through kind of cycles in terms of what they want to do internally what they  they go through their own make buys and our structure enables us to participate at whatever level is appropriate for that customer at that time and our relationship with gulfstream is a very positive one so we are very confident that we will play a significant role in whatever new aircraft they come up with operator our next question comes from kim  ken herbert kenneth herbert  canaccord genuity research division its canaccord i just wanted to ask first within the aerostructures business as you look at your footprint i know youve got a number of other facilities hawthorne marshall street other areas that are very  dependent as you look out a couple of years whats the opportunity within aerostructures for perhaps additional cost savings either leveraging red oak or maybe some adjustments as some of these other programs like the  especially sunset jeffry d frisby ken were not just thinking about a couple of facilities we continually look at our entire portfolio of facilities and equipment and were continually looking to optimize that i would say that kind of all options have always been on the table and one of the things i was just thinking about when jeff was answering a question on c was the fact that while our revenues some of structures individual structures companies kind of tier  guys are going down relative to that program they are also winning new products on other platforms in order to replace that but at the same time were looking at optimizing our footprint relative to that programs decline so its something that we go over on a regular basis and so id say that your assumption is correct that were going to continue to evaluate facilities like hawthorne and marshall street but that just goes for every one of our other facilities as well kenneth herbert  canaccord genuity research division okay okay thats helpful and then if i could on the aerospace systems segment now with ge completed can you just remind us how much of that business now is aftermarket and specifically maybe the split there between commercial and military i know you talked about strengthening on the commercial aftermarket within that segment jeffry d frisby im not sure im remembering it i think the aftermarket business is relatively light i know the repair business is virtually nonexistent and i would say its the overall aftermarket business is probably in the teens in terms of a percentage which it needs to be quite a lot higher than that and the military the commercial breakdown do you remember what that is jeffrey l mcrae yes its weighted more heavily towards commercial with   and  being the largest dynamics there the content on the military side largest program is v i would say the overall weighting in the business is probably  commercial and military jeffry d frisby maybe  something like that jeffrey l mcrae  kenneth herbert  canaccord genuity research division okay so within the whole  within the entire segment though so this  the ge business pulls the aftermarket mix down a little bit for the entire segment then jeffrey l mcrae yes the overall segment still runs about  oem to aftermarket so you might see initially a slight reduction to that to jeffs comments earlier were very optimistic we can drive a higher level of aftermarket into this ge business and so i would fully expect it in the midterm not to be a reducer of content from an aftermarket standpoint jeffry d frisby yes and remember that in our aerospace systems group we have companies that are more built to print this is  those companies that are more proprietary we would normally expect to have a higher percentage of aftermarket and this is clearly one of those and so we believe that overall we can  those companies that are highly proprietary we can in fact drive more benefit from the aftermarket and we intend to do so kenneth herbert  canaccord genuity research division okay and then just finally so the pickup youre seeing within the segment on the aftermarket in the near term within aerospace systems its obviously the ge acquisition helps because youve got runway there to build that side of the business but with other parts of the segment can you point to any specifics whether it be geographically or other areas where youre seeing some of the pickup or maybe i think you referenced a step up in cadence of quote activity and other activities that give you confidence on the second half recovery jeffrey l mcrae yes in aerospace systems definitely expectation of a pickup on the aftermarket side in the balance of the year we tend to see a level of seasonality in the aftermarket in this business we also know we have a couple of what tend to be onetime sales each year that are falling in the second half of the year in that segment that that will get us to where i think you would expect us to be in this segment and we also have decent positions on programs that continue to  youll see pressures on ramping up such as  operator our next question comes from julie yates julie yates stewart  crédit suisse ag research division crédit suisse jeff just on gpecs i think last year you talked about seasonality in aftermarket and last year you saw a big chunk of that in the fiscal first quarter are you seeing similar lumpiness this year or are you seeing a smoother profile through the year and then just broadly how are margins progressing now that you owned the asset for  months jeffry d frisby well im not sure which  well i guess we can  since were both jeff we can both answer it i think that inherently in our aerospace systems group we have some lumpiness we generally see fourth quarter strength in some of our companies because there are some fairly predictable foreign military spares activities that happen at that time in the earlier quarters they usually  the orders generally come in and the shipments usually come in in big big bunches so we may not always see in the first quarter some great strength but we will see some lumpiness in that and so were confident we are going to see that that we will have strong quarters in terms of that aftermarket business in aerospace systems overall the question on the margin growth jeffrey l mcrae yes i think overall julie as it relates to the engine control business as we had talked in the latter half of fy  we were very pleased with the level of margin improvement we had seen in that business and we continue to see strong margins what i would depict as abovesegment margins coming out of that business much of that ends up being related to aftermarket so you do end up having some lumpiness but our expectation for fy  is we would see a continuation of abovesegment margins coming on that business julie yates stewart  crédit suisse ag research division okay great very helpful and then any more color on the military aftermarket its been a source of weakness for some time now and i think the last few quarters youve talked about there being pent up demand are you starting to see  do you have visibility on any of that demand starting to break free jeffry d frisby while we see the demand julie its not  for example the reason we see the demand will give you  we have one of our companies that supports the c repair business and our customer in this case has in fact delivered us all the  all their stored units to  that they were holding for repair so we now we have them all the trouble is is that they have not authorized us to repair them because the funding has not been turned loose for that so its  we see what the demand is which is significant its just going to be a question of whether or not  whether or not the need for the reentry of these products into the marketplace which may be driven by flight hours on certain aircraft such as c whether that drives a faster pace or whether were just going to see kind of a normal ramp back up but there is quite a lot of work out there to do we just have to find what those triggers are to really get the funding moving julie yates stewart  crédit suisse ag research division okay and then just last question is there any update on the pipeline of programs that you guys are bidding and any color on win rate that you can offer jeffry d frisby well i dont think we have a lot of color on win rates i would say that the pipeline is still robust and that we are still i think participating successfully we have continued to win things of market share gains things of this nature and continued  continuing to maintain our position on most of our programs we have a lot of discussions going on and we would look forward to announcing those large wins when we get them and in opportunities such as this a lot of the wins we get are not  usually dont enter the realm of really being worthy volumewise of a press release but when you multiply them x they get to be pretty significant so i guess when we get to quarterly opportunities its a good time to talk about some of those as we roll them up so hopefully well be able to do that so i guess the answer in a nutshell is that the pipeline remains robust we are still winning our  at least our fair share and were confident that well continue to so operator our next question comes from chris mecray christopher mecray blackrock could you just help us maybe just aggregate the cash flow forecast just a little bit given all the moving parts if you take the eaton settlement out and the other receivables that you got have you in fact adjusted your outlook for the year and what if anything went into that jeffrey l mcrae as far as cash flow generation we have not  we have updated and reconfirmed what we had depicted previously of generation of roughly  million of free cash flow obviously the first quarter was not a strong cash quarter for us we definitely see the second quarter being much stronger with some of the elements we talked about that were held up in receivables at the end of the first quarter and as we look at the balance of the year similar to earnings we would generally see the second half of the year from a cash generation standpoint being a much stronger half than the first half but i would fully expect to see the second quarter being a strong cash generation quarter christopher mecray okay so the weakness in the first quarter which i do recognize is seasonally normal isnt any worse than you would have necessarily expected jeffrey l mcrae no no christopher mecray okay and one other thing sorry go ahead jeffrey l mcrae no no go ahead  i hate to call it timing but theres a lot of timing dynamics in that and with the lower revenue in the first quarter theres a little seasonality impact to it christopher mecray yes okay the  i dont know if its material or not but i assumed you had not anticipated the elimination of legal cost as of your analyst day and i wonder what kind of tailwind that may provide for the balance of the year next year jeffrey l mcrae yes if you remember what we talked about in the fourth quarter was the expectation that if the eaton activity continued we were reevaluating alternative fee structures with our legal counsel which really in our mind was going to make legal fees associated with eaton  for the year because we would have moved to some form of contingent basis on settlement ultimately we never had an agreement in place there as you can see with the netting that we did between  and  that were showing we did have that legal fee that were netting out against the settlement so ultimately you should see  impact related to legal fees in eaton in fy  that is also how our guidance was built operator our next question comes from stephen levenson stephen e levenson  stifel nicolaus  company incorporated research division stifel just to expand a little bit on the future opportunities do you see opportunities for increased content on a neo i know youre pretty happy about the life extension but with the bigger engine will the parts that you make require strengthening or is there something in addition jeffry d frisby we do see that there will be some change we think that well be able to protect the work statement that we do have but there are going to be some additional packages that will invariably come out and we like our chances of increasing our scope of work on that aircraft stephen e levenson  stifel nicolaus  company incorporated research division okay and can you give us a little bit more detail on not necessarily what you expect to get but timing on things like  max and x jeffry d frisby well  max were already winning content on that and have announced several things on the systems side the structures pieces are  theyve announced on x for example boeing has announced some substantial awards to some of the japanese suppliers for example we have strong relationship with those japanese suppliers and invariably those types of decisions as to who is going to supply product in through that channel comes a little bit later so i would say what were thinking about that weve got maybe within the next year  months to a year something like that where we will expect to be able to announce what were going to be supplying on the x i would suspect that we are going to continue to supply whatever is applicable that were currently doing on a  i would think we would carry that over but what were really looking for is additional opportunity on x now we have won systems products on x as well so we are continuing to make inroads there operator our next question comes from j b groh j b groh  da davidson  co research division da davidson i just had a quick followup on the backlog slide there is the total backlog between those  buckets sort of proportional to the revenue they generate jeffrey l mcrae yes j b groh  da davidson  co research division so structures is like plus percent and aerospace systems is some percent of the total backlog is that fair way to look at it jeffrey l mcrae yes if you think of backlog being really those  segments with little coming out of aftermarket services it should be pretty proportional between the  jb j b groh  da davidson  co research division okay so structures backlog isnt necessarily disproportionately higher jeffrey l mcrae no no operator our next question comes from yair reiner yair reiner  oppenheimer  co inc research division oppenheimer just a quick housekeeping question what is the amortization expense within interest and also what is the interest rate youre paying out on the revolver jeffrey l mcrae yes the total amortization flowing through interest is that the question yair reiner  oppenheimer  co inc research division exactly and then also the interest rate on the revolver jeffrey l mcrae the revolver is running right around  today the amortization flowing through interest  i want to say its in the  million to  million range but i probably need to come back specifically on that operator since there are no further
