business systems llc mbs protests the award of purchase order no cnshqg for  copiers to ameritel corporation a dealer of canon copiers issued by the corporation for national  community service under ameritels general services administration gsa federal supply schedule fss contract we deny the protest b metro business systems llc july   decision matter of metro business systems llc file b date july   jerry allen for the protester andrea s grill esq corporation for national  community service and thedlus l thompson esq general services administration for the agencies sharon l larkin esq and james a spangenberg esq office of the general counsel gao participated in the preparation of the decision digest agency that purchases copiers using federal supply schedule procedures is not required to disclose its requirements for network compatibility and security features where agency did not shift the burden to vendors to select what to quote agency may consider special copier features discernable from product literature when selecting vendor for award decision metro business systems llc mbs protests the award of purchase order no cnshqg for  copiers to ameritel corporation a dealer of canon copiers issued by the corporation for national  community service under ameritels general services administration gsa federal supply schedule fss contract we deny the protest the agency sought to procure through a leasetoownershipplan  multifunction copiers from a single fss vendor to replace their existing fleet of  copiers  the agency did not issue a solicitation to acquire these copiers instead it conducted market surveys in february march and april of  with five vendors and requested quotations from these vendors vendors were provided the model numbers and usage charges for the existing copiers the market surveys consisted of discussions with the vendors about their products and the agencys requirement to replace its entire fleet of copiers a review of copier brochures and equipment manuals and consultation with the agencys office of information technology oit to make sure that the copiers were compatible with the agencys network and security requirements declaration of agencys support services specialist june   paragraphs  recorded tel call june   although not specifically disclosed to the vendors the record indicates that the agency sought copiers that would fill five critical needs of the agency  acquire new highquality copiers with multifunctioning capabilities at a fair and reasonable price  acquire copiers from one consolidated vendor  acquire copiers that were entirely compatible and seamless with the agencys local area network lan  acquire multifunctioning copiers that had seamless and easy to use security features and  acquire contractor services that would most efficiently and economically in terms of performance and cost dispose of the current fleet of all  copiers three of the five surveyed vendors submitted quotations one of those vendors ameritel submitted a quotation for canon brand copiers and mbs submitted a quotation for konica minolta brand copiers on april   the agency issued a purchase order to ameritel for the copiers for a base year with four year options concluding that the quotation of per year provided the best value to the government at the lowest overall price in making this determination the agency found that the canon copiers quoted by ameritel contained added features    that make them a standout for example the agency noted that the canon copiers included integrated scanning capability and functions that could be accessed directly from the copier or the desktop provided better security capabilities and were optimized for integration with the agencys lan environment better than the other vendors products furthermore ameritels quotation included tradeins on all of their units other vendors offered fewer or no tradeins   and included unlimited training toner and supplies at no additional cost to the government the firm also provided excellent references and was found to have experience and technical knowledge to support the agencys requirements agency report tab  best value justification at  in addition ameritels quotation was the overall lowest in price lower per year than mbss next lowest priced quotation agency report at  n mbs protests to our office the issuance of the purchase order it contends that the agency did not provide adequate information concerning its requirements evaluation and basis for award  specifically it complains that it was not advised of the special copier features such as lan compatibility and security features that the agency evaluated and considered to be a critical need or requirement or that the agency would consider past performance as a result mbs argues its quotation could not be fairly considered for award the fss program directed and managed by gsa gives federal agencies a simplified process for obtaining commonly used commercial supplies and services the procedures for making purchases under the fss program are set forth in federal acquisition regulation far subpart  when using these procedures an agency is not required to issue a solicitation to request quotations but rather may simply review vendors schedules and using business judgment to determine which vendors goods or services represent the best value and meet the agencys needs at the lowest overall cost may directly place an order under the corresponding vendors fss contract far section   kpmg consulting llp  b b sept    cpd paragraph  at  this is contrasted with situations where an agency issues a request for quotations rfq and thus shifts the burden to the vendors for selecting items from their schedule in those instances an agency must provide guidance about its needs and selection criteria sufficient to allow vendors to compete intelligently see  eg  kpmg consulting llp  supra  at  however when an agency reviews competing vendors schedule offerings but does not shift to vendors the burden of selecting items to propose there is no requirement that vendors be given notice of the agencys needs or the selection criteria  see merck  co inc  b  may    cpd paragraph  at  comark fed sys  b b jan    cpd paragraph  at   here the agency did not issue an rfq to fss vendors or shift the burden to vendors to determine what to quote in selecting the vendor with which to place the order the agency merely distinguished between vendors products based on special features that were discernable from product literature reviewed although the protester disagrees that lan compatibility is discernable from the product literature the agency provided our office with the product literature that it reviewed and explains how the oit was able to determine lan compatibility from these copier manuals the agency also notes that the brand of copiers quoted by mbs is not compatible with the agencys lan network and mbs has provided no evidence that they are compatible furthermore mbs admits that it can provide no other brand copiers as gsa explains far section c specifically states that an agency may consider among other factors past performance special features tradein considerations and delivery terms in selecting among competing vendors  and as discussed above an agency is not required to disclose the nature of these desired or required special features when it requests quotations from vendors where as here the agency does not shift to vendors the burden of selecting items to propose therefore the agency did not act improperly by considering special features such as lan capability security capabilities or past performance here the protest is denied anthony h gamboa general counsel  of the current fleet  were canon brand copiers and  were kodak brand  for example mbss quotation only provided to take away  of the  copiers  mbss initial protest raised multiple other protest grounds which our office dismissed because they failed to state valid bases of protest  as indicated a requirement to identify selection criteria arises when vendors are called upon to select a particular configuration among multiple possibilities with no guidance about how to do so intelligently  mbs initially raised other violations of far section  but then later conceded that this provision was followed without deviation mbs
