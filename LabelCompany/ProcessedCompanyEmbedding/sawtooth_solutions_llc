sawtooth solutions  questions  questions with thomas rozman of sawtooth solutions by cindy  january   finteknews is pleased to offer our weekly feature column “ questions” each week we feature a thought leader within a unique sector of fintech and ask them to answer just  questions for our audience in their vernacular this week we’d like to introduce you to thomas rozman  chief investment office of sawtooth solutionss a leading provider of unified managed account services for overseeing the entire wealth management process  prior to sawtooth solutions tom was cofounder  ceo of investigo corporation a wealth management software firm in data aggregation performance reporting and the delivery of holistic investment advice that was later acquired by broadridge financial solutionsname  thomas j rozman cfa title  chief investment officer company  sawtooth solutions llc web address  wwwsawtoothamcomhow did you personally become involved in fintech technology and financial services have been interconnected since i began my career as an investmet professional almost  years ago  at that time an advisor’s desktop consisted of a quotron machine that could deliver stock quotes market commentary and intracompany product information  most advisors also had in their offices a small decorative speaker better known as a “squawk box” that was a companywide intercom used to communicate sales priorities new stock issue updates and other timely dealrelated items for the day  the advice business was in it’s nascent period and consisted of “wrap fee” and separately managed accounts but technology to onboard new client relationships was rudimentary with account information being keyed into wire room green screens  many brokerage investments for clients were also processed via “check and app”with the account held directly with the product sponsor  the disparate institutional custodians transfer agents and accounting systems holding client investment accounts created a need within the industry for one source of accurate record and a consolidated client statement for the delivery of holistic advice  as they say necessity is the mother of invention and thus was born the data aggregation and performance reporting fintech niche that i spearheaded with investigo  fast forward to present day and my involvement with fintech is related to my role as chief investment officer at sawtooth solutions a leading provider of unified management account uma services that allows investment advisors at broker dealers ria’s and regional banks to leverage technology to create scalable operational processes  what does your firm dooffer within the fintech sector sawtooth solutions is a leading turnkey asset management platform tamp that provides comprehensive flexible technology for overseeing the entire wealth management process across all account types delivered through a unified managed account uma program and managed within our extensive salesforcecom integration our collaborative approach enables advisors to easily implement their wealth management offering while embedding the pillars of an institutional framework  definable and repeatable investment sales and operational processes at a highlevel we work with two constituents  investment strategy providers on the one hand and investment advisors on the other  investment strategy providers can be categorized primarily into two categories   separate account managers sma and fund strategists  both provide vehicles for investment portfolio construction and the deployment of capital  separate account managers choose securities within asset classes or traditional style boxes  with sawtooth’s uma capability an advisor can utilize multiple managers within one account to create a tailored solution unique to the client’s financial situation a critical requirement for the impending deparment of labor dol fiduciary rule  fund strategists serve the same role but deliver a preassigned asset allocation model that serves as a wellrounded solution for the investment portfolio  our other constituency investment advisors utilize the sawtooth platform to leverage their time and to ensure that their focus is on the client’s needs and best interest matching the client’s risk profile with the most appropriate investment strategy what fintech leader do you admire the most and why i am a big fan of bob curtis ceo of pietech and the makers of moneyguidepro a leading financial planning and advice platform  bob is a true visionary and was way ahead of the industry in understanding the need for goalsbased planning that was approachable interactive and timeefficient  i’ve always been impressed by the mission of the company and the intent of the software  planinvestenjoy thus the acronym “pie” their focus on the financial planning process is admirable and the company salesmark says it all – everyone needs and deserves a quality financial plan
