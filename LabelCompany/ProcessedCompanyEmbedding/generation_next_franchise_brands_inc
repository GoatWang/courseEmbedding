inc frozen yogurt hot franchise cool your jetsapr  about generation next vend gains on gains longshort equity microcap smallcap nanocapsummarynew frozen yogurt concept has saved the companyfast start could be leveling offbe careful of confusing company goals with expectationsthere is no guarantee deferred revenue will be recognized quickly or at allgeneration next franchise brands otcqbvend has been revitalized by a new business but whether it can deliver on promises and ultimately recognize revenue is uncertain previously i covered this business when it was called fresh healthy vending i cautioned that the company had sketchy management cash issues and a product that was something of a commodity while noting positives including a trend toward healthier eating and recently secured legitimizing relationships with organizations like the american diabetes association the positive factors ended up not being enough and the share price sank as revenues never rose to anywhere near a level that would allow the company to turn a profit then just in time management found a new product to promote generation next now sells robotic frozen yogurt called froyo in most company literature kiosks under the reisirvy brand name and franchisees are lining up anyone lucky enough to purchase shares near their fiftytwo week lows has seen returns rocket toward  the pitch to franchisees is essentially that the startup costs are low and the maintenance level is even lower kiosks cost  each with a minimum fleet size of four for their  investment owners become part of an ecosystem that generates a higher yield per square foot than any other frozen yogurt retail model and operates  the majority of the work for the franchisee is in restocking which may take a few short visits a week the company has a strategic partner in honey hills farms that supplies ingredients and streamlines the process initially the vast majority of generation nexts revenue from this venture will come from the sale of machines and critically as will be discussed later recognition of these can only occur after the company has found a location for the franchisee the exact margin on kiosks is not known but a very good estimate can be gained from the most recent quarter after backing out the relatively cost free revenues of franchise fees and other which represents royalties the remaining revenue represents kiosk sales and sales from company owned fresh healthy vending machines since the former makes up the overwhelming majority of the sum of the two its safe to say that comparing that figure to cost of revenue will yield a reliable range within which the gross margin for kiosk sales must fall in this case that range is between forty and forty five percent the dream is that eventually an installed base of froyo slinging robots yielding  royalties will shift generation nexts revenue mix and push margins upward however that never really happened with the fresh healthy vending product so it is too soon to assume it will come to fruition here a january letter to shareholders from management was the first indication that the frozen yogurt concept was gaining traction it disclosed booked our first reis  irvys froyo robot in april  booked our th froyo robot in july  booked our th froyo robot in september  booked our th froyo robot in december  and stated that for the year goals included booking our th froyo robot and th franchisee launching our corporateowned operating model and partnering with a national retail chain turning cash flow positive generating positive reportable net income seeking up to an additional  million in investment capital an update immediately following the close of the third quarter the company yearend is in june provided another crucial data point for the company stating our franchise platform is completely built we have begun securing premium locations for our franchisees and we are eager to see this technology successfully launched in the coming fiscal quarters with the intention of installing most if not all of the  units sold to date and recognizing the  of estimated deferred revenue on our books well before fiscal  ends there is a lot there to talk about in those two press releases first it cannot be overstated how important share price is given the amount of capital it is looking to raise at todays prices raising close to  million dilutes shareholders by  but had that raise been overtaken a few months earlier the situation would have been much worse potential dilution base shares   share price shares for m dilution rate                                     conversely if a down quarter comes into the mix suddenly generation next may be back to proposing something that looks very similar to death spiral financing the next item to consider is the growth rate of bookings are sales progressing linearly exponentially or flattening out initially the growth looked linear and when compared to the companys stated goal of booking fifteen hundred units by yearend im assuming management meant calendar yearend as the statement was made in its calendar year in review letter to shareholders it appears that it hopes this trend continues however generation nexts third quarter cast doubt on the issue as the company fell off of its early pace at this point it is important to note that generation nexts letter to shareholders included goals for the following year not guidance the numbers provided by the company are essentially the best possible outcome and therefore necessarily should be viewed with skepticism this distinction underscores the uncertainty of the operation and is especially important in light of the goal of having positive net income for the year growth prospects aside generation next is certainly racking up bookings for its frozen yogurt machines however there is a long possibly indefinite delay between when bookings occur and when revenue can actually be recognized and if revenue isnt recognized in a timely manner there is no hope for a profitable annual report recognition occurs once generation next secures a location for a franchisee and delivers the robot a release on february nd updated shareholders by reporting  reis  irvys has secured over  premier locations to date with nearly  outstanding agreements going through the various channels for approval about a month later the companys q update stated we have begun securing premium locations for our franchisees and we are eager to see this technology successfully launched in the coming fiscal quarters with the intention of installing most if not all of the  units sold to date and recognizing the  of estimated deferred revenue on our books well before fiscal  ends much of the case for or against generation next comes down to the likelihood of that last claim can it execute on franchise placements if bookings have leveled off but time to revenue recognition is short the company is in great shape conversely it could have two thousand robots booked by yearend and be in terrible shape if only a few hundred have made it to the top line of the income statement so what does evidence suggest so far on the one hand it has had a year postlaunch and has only come up with sixty locations plus one hundred more that are in progress in the subsequent year it needs to secure five hundred to meet its goal additionally it is likely that the highly desirable low hanging fruit will be disposed of during the first wave of placements making each successive one more difficult for generation next and potentially less profitable for franchisees on the other hand its probable that building the franchise base rather than recognizing revenue was its initial focus plus deals with management that own many pieces of commercial property could rapidly boost placement figures the froyo robot endeavor is still relatively young but one item from the business segment that can be examined is the corporate partnership portion of its kiosk business called  degrees despite the company website still touting the segment as launching in september of  this was not the case and the corporate press now states  thats one concrete example of a missed deadline from the company looking backwards at the fresh healthy vending franchise gives additional hints on why caution may be warranted for june  yearend the company k disclosed that  of deferred revenue from franchise bookings had been on the books in excess of one year total deferred revenue at the time was over  million but  million was related to the newly launched froyo concept this means that almost a third of deferred revenue from fresh healthy franchising was unrecognized and potentially never would be these franchises are not the same of course healthy vending has many more potential placement locations i imagine for example most elementary schools being open to hosting a healthy snack unit while more hesitant about a frozen yogurt dispensary however the healthy vending was also more of a commodity product anyone can buy healthy food and put it in a box the robotic arm and display although hardly a major feat of modern technology is a differentiator as a result froyo kiosks may have a higher conversion rate despite their smaller base third party research appears optimistic that the froyo and fresh healthy vending concepts are distinct seethruequity has a  price target on the stock and is encouraged to the point that it is talking about the potential of the  royalty that generation next will be receiving from placed machines mentioning royalties is putting the cart before the horse though as is any discussion of the company launching additional concepts based on intellectual property it recently acquired there are no significant royalties if units arent placed and theres probably no money for additional concepts either in other words seethruequity seems to be imagining a bestcase scenario and is applying a reckless valuation if vend still traded at a dime or even a quarter that would be low given recent developments but the company no longer trades there generation nexts market capitalization is now around  million hardly chump change for a company that has failed in a similar arena before and in a bestcase scenario may squeak out a small profit this year if you see the product in person and have to own a piece of the company id wait to see the terms given to the potential capital partner since itll reflect what someone with the ear of management is willing to pay until then this one

cash in the process all transactions are managed by third parties to facilitate compliance with local and national laws and regulations the industry and the overall market we are both a franchisor and operator of vending machine and micro market and frozen yogurt robots in the franchise market  saw the first positive growth in the number of franchise establishments since  according to the ifas

advantages including the following table of contents  we focus on healthier food included in school and other healthconscious vending locations federal guidelines have been established that aim to counter youth obesity while improving student nutrition such rules work to discourage our competitors fare to be marketed to schools  we outsource noncore functions to thirdparty vendors outsourced

of our financial resources to investing in new services our principal suppliers the company currently purchases substantially all of its vending machines as needed from a sole supplier automated merchandising systems inc ams or its designated distributor we believe that our relationship with ams is excellent and likely to continue in our view the loss of our relationship with ams should it occur may result in short term disruptions not likely to be material the company has identified at least four other suppliers with comparable vending equipment the company also purchases its micro markets from a single manufacturer and believes the loss of its supplier may result in short term disruptions not likely to be material additionally primarily on behalf of our franchisees the company has negotiated discounts with a product distribution chain united natural foods inc unfi we believe that our relationship with unfi is excellent and likely to continue in our view the loss of our relationship with unfi should it occur may result in shortterm disruptions not likely to be material the company has identified several other suppliers that stock the same or comparable products furthermore our franchisees are able to purchase directly from unfi however without our negotiated discount governmental regulation we are required to comply with regulations governing the sale of franchises  the primary component of our business thirteen states directly regulate franchising and require presale registration of a franchise disclosure document fdd or offering prospectus by the franchisor normally with the state agency that oversees the sale of securities in that state and presale delivery of an fdd to a franchise candidate by a franchisor before the signing of a binding agreement or the payment of any money to the franchisor franchise sales in the remaining  states are generally subject to the franchise rule promulgated by the federal trade commission ftc which requires the presale delivery of an fdd to a franchise candidate before the signing of a binding agreement or the payment of any money to the franchisor a franchisor that fails to properly register and maintain the registration of its fdd and disclose its franchisee candidates in the  registration states unless exempt from registration under a few narrowly drawn exceptions to the registration requirements is subject to legal action by its franchisees for damages and under certain circumstances for rescission of the franchise agreements and to administrative civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed as well the ftcs franchise rule does not require registration of an fdd with the ftc however a franchisor that fails to properly disclose its franchisee candidates is subject to claims for breach of contract fraud damages sanctions and the like table of contents our employees we had approximately  fulltime employees as of december   seasonality we do not expect that our
