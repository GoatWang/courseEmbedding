perspective enabling us to deliver products which harness and activate all aspects of the plants’ composition and environment – genetics biologicals and chemicals learn about our technology seed traits the global seed market is a b market as of  of which  is attributed to available biotech seeds seeds which have been improved by gene transformation in crops such as corn soy and cotton currently available biotech seed traits capture approximately b and it is expected that as additional traits become available the market may reach b thus attempting to provide a solution to improve traits such as yield abiotic stress disease resistance insect control and herbicide tolerance as global seed companies constantly aim to reach beyond current limitations to address the world’s growing need for feed food and fuel evogene forges collaborations with these global companies to discover genes and genomic element to develop improved seed traits the key traits evogene targets are improved yield resistance to abioticenvironmental stress eg drought… nutrient uptake n insect control disease resistance at evogene we discover and develop improved seed traits focusing on the world’s major field crops corn soy wheat rice cotton canola and more following over a decade of discovery and research into seed traits evogene now aims to provide a comprehensive solution of an overall package to enhance the performance of various crops evogene utilizes proprietary computational platforms athlete geneproduct planet ng and biomeminer to identify target genes and additional genomic elements leveraging both plant and microbial gene pools including metagenomic approaches likewise evogene has put into place stateoftheart validation systems for each of its key traits to support various product development stages evogene’s rd facilities in israel and in its st louis us site conduct discovery and validation with multidisciplinary scientific teams to address global agricultural challenges constantly evolving innovation – genome editing the next frontier in genomics value capturing gaining high traction in multiple areas in both pharma and agriculture is genome editing technology which allows the specific modification at the molecular level of essentially any given genome in a highly precise and targeted manner leveraging on evogene’s unique technological infrastructure and significant accumulated big data allows the company the ability to precisely identify required edits in the genome thereby opening a new spectrum of opportunities for seed trait
