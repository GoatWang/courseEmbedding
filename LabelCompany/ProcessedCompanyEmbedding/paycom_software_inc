executives and hr managers in the us with its allinone human capital management hcm software solution a convenient alternative to cobbling together products from multiple vendors instead of running one system to manage payroll and another to manage time entry and tracking and still another to assist with tasks such as recruiting training and performance reviews paycom customers can log on to one integrated system  running on a single cloudbased database  that handles it all including compliance with government regulations this lets companies focus on their own business instead of the everchanging complexities of the tax code or various labor laws with that as a backdrop lets dive into why paycom has the look of a longterm winner image source paycom software a profitable company with gangbusters growth the total addressable market for the us hcm industry will be  billion by  according to markets and markets with its  billion market cap paycom is a small fish in that big pond with plenty of room to grow and nearly any way you want to measure it paycoms current rate of growth is mighty impressive over the last two full fiscal years  and  revenue net income and free cash flow have been on an absolute tear revenue grew from  million to  million  a  compound annual growth rate net income grew from  million to  million starting from such a low number renders a cagr calculation fairly meaningless but for the record its  after turning freecashflowpositive in  the company more than tripled free cash flow from  million in  to  million in  and the companys strong performance continued throughout  in its most recent earnings report for the third quarter which was released nov  thirdquarter revenue was up  yearoveryear to  million adjusted ebitda was up  to  million management increased its fullyear  revenue guidance to a range of  million to  million the midpoint of which represents  yearoveryear growth fullyear adjusted ebitda guidance was also raised to a range of  million to  million which represents  yearoveryear growth at the midpoint management increased its longterm adjusted ebitda margin target to a range of  to  commenting that this will still allow the company to pursue robust growth while making substantial rd investments satisfying customers the hcm industry is crowded youre probably familiar with the larger competitors including adp paychex oracle and sap but plenty of smaller nimbler companies such as workday have entered the field as well with so many players offering overlapping solutions price is of course a big factor but its not the only factor the idea of an allinone offering is especially attractive to the smallersized businesses that paycom targets generally between  and  employees since traditionally those businesses rely on multiple vendors to create their own patchwork solution or attempt a portion of it themselves with most of its competitors focused on the larger end of the market paycom also prides itself on providing superior service to companies that  being on the smaller side  wouldnt receive as much attention from industry giants so far this approach is paying off big time from  to  the companys number of clients  currently  and counting  increased at a  compound annual growth rate paycom also claims it leads the industry in customer satisfaction evidence of which can be seen in the companys fantastic retention rates for the past three full fiscal years the companys retention rate percentage of revenue retained from existing clients has held steady at  just as impressive recurring revenue for the third quarter increased  to  million making up  of total revenues with numbers like that every new client the company signs increases not only the current quarters sales numbers but  at least in theory  all future quarters as well the biggest risk paycoms rich valuation payc data by ycharts make no mistake paycoms stock is expensive  currently trading above a pricetoearnings ratio of   and is already pricing in many years of strong growth ahead thats a little more palatable when you look toward the future with the stock trading at around  times next years earnings estimates as long as paycom maintains its torrid rate of growth its valuation should come into a more reasonable range over the next couple of years but at todays prices even a whiff of disappointment can cause serious volatility in fact last quarter revenue and eps both beat analyst estimates but the stock dropped like a stone anyway the best i can figure is that the companys previous two quarters featured incredible yearoveryear growth rates of  and  fueled largely by new billings from affordable care act regulations with that tailwind gone perhaps thirdquarter revenue growth of only   coupled with guidance for fourthquarter revenue growth of   looked like a letdown by comparison one other potential overhang is the pending repeal of the aca the company has said that  of its revenue would be at risk if the aca were to disappear overnight but if the aca is replaced by something else that also requires regulatory compliance businesses would continue to require paycoms services to navigate this transition lessening the overall impact the stock has already run up more than  from its postearnings low of  or so those looking to add a promising growth story to their portfolios may want to put paycom on their watch list or if you can stomach the inevitable large swings that come with the territory even todays prices may turn out to be a decent entry point in

increasing number of those employers have been switching to paycom softwares nysepayc solution paycoms cloudbased software helps human resources departments with basic tasks such as hiring training payroll processing and more the companys allinone solution has been attracting new customers at a breathtaking rate which has allowed paycoms revenue and profits to soar coming into tuesdays firstquarter earnings report shareholders wanted to see paycom meaningfully expand its revenue and profits yet again was the company able to live up to those lofty expectations lets take a closer look at the companys results to find out image source getty images paycom software q the raw numbers metricq q yearoveryear change  revenue  million  million  adjusted ebitda  million  million  nongaap net income   million  million   nongaap eps    data source paycom software what happened with paycom this quarter recurring revenue increased  year over year to  million while implementation and other revenue grew  to  million  margin expansion drove  growth in adjusted ebitda which came in at  million for the quarter nongaap net income was  million or  per diluted share these figures rose  and  respectively when compared to the yearago period paycom ended the quarter with  million in cash on  million in debt  during its last earnings report paycom had forecast that revenue this quarter would land between  million and  million while adjusted ebitda was projected to come in between  million and  million meanwhile wall street had expected paycom to report  million in revenue and  in eps this quarter as you can tell paycom managed to handily beat all of these expectations what management had to say ceo chad richison was thrilled to report that the companys quarterly revenue surpassed the  million mark for the first time he credited the achievement to the companys unique product solution and terrific execution stating we continue to execute at high levels across our organization and as a result we are helping more companies than ever run their businesses more efficiently with our cloudbased payroll and human capital management solution on the companys investor call richison provided several examples of companies with thousands of employees that decided to switch to paycoms platform during the quarter while he didnt call them out by name the victims of that clientstealing activity are likely to be payroll processing giants such as automatic data processing and paychex looking forward management believes that the companys momentum will continue into the second quarter as a result management expects the company to post yet another quarter of strong revenue and profit growth specifically paycom expects revenue to land between  million and  million the midpoint of which represents  growth year over year meanwhile adjusted ebitda is expected to come in between  million and  million the midpoint of this range represents growth of approximately  the companys strong start to the year also allowed management to raise its fullyear guidance for  the company now expects revenue to grow approximately  and come in between  million and  million that represents a  million bump over its prior outlook adjusted ebitda guidance was also raised by  million and the new range is  million to  million representing growth of roughly  at the midpoint the betterthanexpected quarterly results and bullish outlook caused wall street to bid up paycoms stock to a fresh alltime high in early morning trading following this release with paycom continuing to

technical and nontechnical roles jobs span from both technical and nontechnical roles such as software developers network administrators human resources and marketing global revenue within the it industry is expected to reach  trillion up from s  trillion with the united states accounting for nearly  the driving force within the industry is cloud computing software paycoms cloud computing software increases efficiency has a disaster recovery system and allows associates to work from anywhere paycom has many wellknown competitors of similar size and revenue that provide a similar service such as adp workforce now paylocity holdings nasdaq pcty and workday inc nyse wday sourcecomptia  here business modelproduct differentiation paycom provides a comprehensive cloud oriented payroll and human resources software solution that was created for companies to aid in the everyday operation of their business with paycoms key advantage being that their software operates on a single server base  this allows their customers to access all their data in one area rather than multiple databases paycom currently has  sales offices across the country that act as their main source of communication for demos or any errors management strategically places various paycom locations in areas where their software is highly used they plan to open more storefronts within  and increase overall client numbers paycoms target market is midsize corporations with approximately  employees in the future they hope to appeal to all size corporations source paycom company website  here with the it sector and software industry growing rapidly each year it is extremely crucial that paycom software differentiates itself from their competition most of paycoms competition have a similar payroll processing software but not all of them have an hcm human capital management solution paycoms software offers a program that truly completes employment life cycle management making the everyday tasks of running a business much more efficient and easier talent acquisition provides convenience when screening for new employees payroll time and labor management aids in clocking employee hours and their duties talent management and hr management helps support overall business goals many of paycoms competitors do not offer all of the above services and because of this paycom easily differentiates them from their competition according to value investors club its proven that paycom differentiates themselves from their competition by maintaining their  revenue retention rate over the past three years source here profit marginscompetitor comparison paycom software is financially healthy theyve continued to increase return on invested capital from  and have continued to grow each quarter of  gross margin has steadily increased year after year and although ebitda margin took a dip in  theyre on track and continue to grow going in the final quarter of  paycom also increased their operating margin year after year showing that paycom is earning more per dollar of sales source bloomberg when compared to competitors with various tools such as palo alto networks nasdaq panw adobe systems nasdaq adbe intuit nasdaq intu paylocity holdings nasdaq  and workday inc nyse  paycom software is outperforming the comparative analysis of paycom to top competitors shows how they outperform moving across the chart its clear paycom is well above the average in each column source bloomberg source sp capital iq paycoms roicwacc is  whereas historically it has been  although the companys roicwacc is lower than its historical average it remains well above the industry which suggests there is more added value than its competitors its current roic is  which is nearly five times that of its competitors this can suggest that paycom software uses their funds more efficiently to generate returns strong q results paycom softwares q earnings came out on november  and showed huge signs of success third quarter revenue of  million up from prior year q by  third quarter gaap net income up  million  from prior years quarter third quarter adjusted ebitda up  to  million from q  projections for the quarter ending december  are revenues between  million to  million and adjusted ebitda between  and  million longterm plans increase relationship with current software users and seek new clients develop more storefronts throughout the country increase employment one of paycoms biggest issues is the number of software engineers paycom has a great staff however most of the employees installing the software through the country are not developers theyre just associates by increasing the number of software developers this will increase the efficiency of the installment of the software in corporations providing their customers with ease and adding to their accredited name keep up with equal employment opportunitys annual report as corporations throughout the country continue to grow theyll need to employ and categorize their employees based on raceethnicity job category and gender as more rules and regulations come into effect i believe that more users will seek a simplified solution to keeping these records like paycom software the software helps scan potential employees which will provide ease to human resources risk as mentioned earlier by comptia the it industry has grown through  and is projected to increase moving into the future with increasing labor rates the potential to create a better or more affordable software is high investing in paycom can be very risky paycom has five main services but they do not specialize or dominate one of the five paycom software is not the leader of its industry and has a lot of big companies to compete with since their main client size is  or less as companies expand they will not be searching for paycom they will take their business elsewhere today paycoms short interest skyrocketed up which could indicate that investors believe the price will decrease these next few weeks source bloomberg conclusion i believe that paycom software is a growth company and that theyre currently undervalued paycom provides a single server software that offers an extremely useful system to many complicated problems theyre financially stable and have meet past quarter goals and are on track to exceeding goals for quarter  moving into the future i expect the corporation to grow and take on larger clients leading to an increase in value and revenue disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no
