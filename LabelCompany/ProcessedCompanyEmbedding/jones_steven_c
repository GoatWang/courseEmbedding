authenticwebxxx are safety restraints safe advanced product liability seminar houston texas – january  steven c laird russell turner laird  jones  th avenue fort worth tx   i introduction since lap belts were first offered by ford motor company in  automobile manufacturers have been developing and refining a variety of methods for restraining occupants in the event of a collision these have included manual systems that require the occupant to buckle up as well as passive systems that require no action by the occupant although the auto manufacturers impeded efforts to mandate passive restraint systems and delayed the effective date of regulations beginning in the  model year federal motor vehicle safety standard fmvss  required a phasein of passive restraints by  all new passenger cars were required to have passive restraint systems and light trucks utility vehicles and vans will undergo a phasein of passive restraints from september   through september   on september   the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa issued a final rule which mandates that every passenger car manufactured after september   and every light truck manufactured after september   must be equipped with an airbag and a manual lapshoulder belt at both the driver’s and light front passenger’s seating positions as of july   states the district of columbia and puerto rico had mandatory seatbelt use laws in effect and usage rates have dramatically increased from their previous low levels this has resulted in a decrease in motor vehicle fatalities and serious injuries however a number of the older occupantrestraint systems on the road today including some currently used in new vehicles are defective and can actually enhance injuries in the event of a collision what follows is a summary of some of the more common defect theories in occupantrestraint system litigation and the typical defenses asserted by manufacturers ii defect theories a rearseat lap belt systems although valuations of the threepoint lap and shoulder system have been around since the s until they were recently required to do so many manufacturers were equipping rear seats of their vehicles with only lap belts there is an extensive body of scientific and industry literature going back to the mids which demonstrates that without a shoulder harness the use of a lap belt can cause serious injuries in the absence of a shoulder harness to distribute loads over the body the upper torso can jackknife over the lap belt causing severe abdominal and spinal injuries as well as severe trauma to the head for decades there has been a growing body of evidence that shoulder harnesses will prevent such injuries the history behind the failure of most of the industry to voluntarily equip rear seats with threepoint systems is enlightening even though manufacturers delayed putting the inexpensive threepoint harnesses in rear seats of most vehicles sold in the united states until fmvss mandated them many of their identical vehicles and model years sold in other countries were equipped with threepoint systems in the united states some manufacturers had rearseat shoulder harnesses as standard equipment in only topoftheline vehicles while others put them in several or all car lines in the mids when the government asked manufacturers to make rearseat lap belt retrofit kits available to the public through dealerships and to promote their availability manufacturers were slow to do so and many dealers did not stock the kits as a result the vast majority of car owners were unaware of this important safety feature the following is a brief chronology of events relating to rearseat restraint systems  – us manufacturers provide lap belts at rear outboard locations volvo introduces threepoint belt in rear as standard in certain markets  – mercedesbenz adds threepoint belt in rear outboard seats as standard in all markets japan requires seatbelts front and rear  – victoria australia requires threepoint belts front and rear and mandates use front and rear sweden requires belts in reardiagonal and static allowedlap belt only not approved  – west germany requires threepoint belts front and ream nhtsa requires anchorages for detachable shoulder strap for rear outboard positions fmvss  volvo makes threepoint seatbelts in rear outboard seating positions standard equipment on all vehicles all markets  – sweden requires threepoint emergency locking retractor belts in rear  – france mandates seatbelts in rear either three lap belts or three points at outboard positions new zealand requires threepoint belts front and real outboard positions  – saab introduces threepoint in rear on all models sold in the united states which it had provided for years in scandinavia and europe  – national transportation safety board ntsb recommends that any manufacturer of passenger vehicles with only lap belts at rear outboard positions provide aftermarket retrofit assemblies to convert belts to integrated continuous loop selfstoring lapshoulder belt systems and make the availability of these retrofit systems widely known to us vehicle owners  – bmw volkswagen audi honda and saab all use standard rear seat shoulder harnesses on all models manufacturers using standard rearseat shoulder harnesses in only some models include chrysler with six models ford with five general motors with  toyota with two nissan with one  – all passenger vehicles sold in united states required to have shoulder harnesses with lap belts in rear outboard seating positions b automatic belts just as a system with only a lap belt can cause enhanced injury a twopoint shoulder harness system used without a lap belt is also a serious safety hazard occupants can be subjected to severe neck injuries due to being “clotheslined” by the shoulder harness when the lower body moves forward this is true especially for small adults and children also with all of the load being taken up by a single harmless there is an increased risk of the head spiking the interior of the vehicle in the event of a rollover due to the free movement allowed by the absence of pelvic restraint an occupant can be ejected or in some circumstances decapitated by the heavily loaded harness slicing through the neck there are two types of automatic belt cases the first involves a passive restraint system which is provided with an independent lap belt this system which has been used in millions of cars since  uses a nondetachable motorized shoulder harness and a manual lap belt when the door shuts the shoulder harness moves into place across the occupant’s body however the vast majority of occupants unaware of the serious risk involved do not latch the lap belt either forgetting to do so because there is a harness across their body or intentionally failing to do so because they believe that they are adequately restrained by the automatic shoulder harness recent studies have shown that even though motorized shoulder belts are worn in  percent of these cars they are used with the manual lap belt in only  percent a second type of case involves vehicles that were surprisingly manufactured without any lap belts due to an apparent loophole in fmvss  certain hyundai and volkswagen vehicles were produced with a system that has a shoulder harness and a “knee bolster” a padded area below the dash this system was first used by volkswagen in  the knee bolster allegedly acts as a lower body restraint and replaces the lap belt in reality it does neither unless a person’s knees are right up against the bolster there is lower body movement forward and sometimes under the bolster this dangerous system which was considered and rejected by other manufacturers long ago is no longer in use in new vehicles but was still being manufactured into the late s there are tens of thousands of these vehicles still on the road with the twopoint system the occupant kinematics are dramatically altered by removing the lap belt and relying upon the knee bolster for pelvic restraint a lap belt which is in constant contact with the pelvis begins to restrain the body almost immediately upon impact however a knee bolster only begins to work if at all in a straight frontal collision when the occupant’s knees have moved forward far enough to contact the bolster depending upon the position of the seat and the length of the occupant’s femurs the knees may travel several inches forward relative to the seat back consequently the pelvis and lower body will also travel forward the same distance this results in additional excursion of the body forward a phenomenon known as “submarining” which can occur in any automatic system without a lap belt in place submarining changes the position of the occupants body as well as the location of the shoulder harness on the body as the occupant moves forward the position of the shoulder harness will be higher on the upper torso and in some circumstances will be located directly on the neck when this occurs the occupant is no longer in a position where his or her body can be efficiently decelerated and the forces of the restraint system upon his body can no longer be distributed safely additionally significant loading is placed directly upon the neck which is much less capable of withstanding direct forces than the chest if the knees strike the bolster but glance under it the problem is magnified the resulting trauma or postimpact pressure on the neck can result in fatal injuries quadriplegia from neck injury decapitation or anoxic brain damage another danger inherent in these systems is that they allow not only improper movement of the occupant and forces on the wrong areas of the body but also put excessive loads on the belt itself the webbing which is the actual belt component stretches to a certain extent during dynamic loading if the harness is forced to do the work of restraining the portion of the body that is normally held by the lap belt the amount of potential stretch and upper body excursion will increase thus even if an occupant remains uptight the risk of his or her head striking the dash increases finally these systems are completely ineffective in the event of a rollover a threepoint system with a lap belt may prevent an occupant from being ejected which is critical because the risk of fatal injuries increases several times in the event of ejection without a lap belt there is a much greater chance of the occupant’s body moving out of the system and leaving the vehicle particularly if the door comes open in a nonmotorized system that anchors at the door frame moreover while a threepoint system can sometimes prevent an occupant’s head from striking the roof in a rollover thereby preventing neck injury if the roof does not collapse there is a greater potential for a head strike without a lap belt also if the pelvis is allowed to move freely during a rollover significant loads can be placed on the neck by the belt in some cases this has been sufficient to cause quadriplegia and even decapitation the following is a chronology relating to the use of shoulder harnesses without lap belts  – volvo introduces the twopoint diagonal shoulder belt as an accessory  – volvo finds the twopoint diagonal shoulder belt unacceptable and replaces it with the threepoint belt  – “   a good safety belt should    be designed in such a way that   there should be no risk of the belt forming a loop around the occupant’s neck     – “with a diagonal shoulder belt the cg of the body is usually below the line of the belt and in a forward impact there would be a tendency to slide out from under the belt”  – “   with diagonal chest straps alone the wearer may slide out from under the belt or suffer severe internal injuries   ”  – “the diagonal belt has no strap to decelerate the lower part of the body and therefore    the occupant’s body can submarine under the belt     – “this report describes three cases of fatal neck injuries in subjects wearing the diagonal safety belt probably caused by the lower jaw being temporarily caught in the belt when the subject slipped out of the belt and was ejected from the car”  – “   the single diagonal belt only    does not provide pelvic restraint which allows the subject’s lower torso to swing forward and rotate out of the belt at impact     – “   the diagonal belt has been utilized in three tests    in each case the subject was not restrained by the belt and was flung from the seat literally hanging himself as rotation occurred about the inferior axis of the belt    “  – “   this type of strap can cause injuries to internal organs or the neck when the wearer slides out of the belt even a lap strap alone was considered preferable since at least it put the pressure on the wellprotected pelvic area”  – volkswagen introduces the passive twopoint restraint system with a knee bolster  – general motors rejects the passive shoulderbeltonly system because of “   reservations about the appropriateness of depending on a knee impact surface instead of a lap belt to provide lower torso restraint we cannot be sure for example that a knee impact surface used in conjunction with a passive shoulder belt will adequately protect an outofposition occupant a small adult or a child occupant in frontal or angular accidents   ”  – “as was to be expected ejection is significantly more frequent with two point shoulder belts that with three point harnesses”  – “   the foregoing discussion implies that the effectiveness of the twopoint automatic belt is lower overall than that of the conventional threepoint belt system a conclusion consistent with official estimates published by the us dot   ”  – hyundai introduces the twopoint passive shoulderbeltonly restraint system in the united states  – nhtsaodi investigation ea of automatic shoulder belt failures for  through  hyundai excels –  accidents –  injuries –  fatalities “a preliminary analysis of the odi complaint database shows that the complaint rate is higher for the subject vehicles than for the excels equipped with the threepoint manual belts   ’ c intermittent locking failure“skiplocking” a common source of injury is a defect in the design of the retractor mechanism the component of the restraint system that winds the belt and locks the belt in place during a collision there are numerous types of retractor mechanisms in use today and their effectiveness in preventing injury ranges from excellent to adequate to dangerous some retractor mechanisms use an inertial locking mechanism such as a pendulum or a caged ball which locks the webbing when the vehicle is subjected to a certain rate of deceleration other retractors use a webbing sensing device which locks when the webbing is moved relative to the vehicle at a certain speed some systems use a combination of the two as well as a pretensioning device to eliminate initial belt slack in the event of a collision fmvss  requires that emergency locking retractors must lock before the webbing extends one inch when the retractor is subjected to an acceleration of g certain retractors are prone to failure due to the use of inadequate materials or poorly designed internal components which will fail when subjected to reasonably expected load forces one example of this is a phenomenon known as skiplocking skiplocking has been defined as the failure of the retractor to lock under dynamic loads or intermittent or late locking during the crash pulse in a typical retractor design that utilizes a rotating wheel with teeth there are one or more pawls designed to engage the teeth and lock the belt however some designs utilize plastic or soft metal that can break or chip preventing the pawl from engaging or causing it to engage intermittently if this occurs the belt can spool out and turn a threepoint system into a two point system in the mid to lates nhtsa investigated certain refractors which were failing when subjected to testing requited by fmvss  it was discovered that some of the retractors had failure rates as high as  percent this resulted in design changes that were incorporated in an attempt to eliminate skiplocking however some manufacturers are putting out new vehicles with retractors that are still prone to skiplocking when such a failure occurs occupants sustain injuries similar to those involved in rearseat lap belt cases including head trauma and spinal cord injuries d tensionrelieving devices another defective occupantrestraint system design involves the use of devices designed to allow the occupant to introduce slack by pulling on the belt or leaning forward these have been called “tension relievers” and “comfort features” they are more commonly known as “window shade devices” since they operate much like a window shade this feature was introduced by some manufacturers for passenger comfort in the s in  general motors began equipping most of its vehicles with these slackinducing devices and other domestic manufacturers followed suit however no foreign manufacturers adopted these features the problem with slackinducing devices is that they allow several inches of slack to be introduced into the belt either intentionally or unintentionally which allows more forward movement by the occupant in a collision unintentional excessive slack can be induced from normal movement within the car such as reaching for the radio or the glove compartment excessive slack in seatbelts undisputedly will reduce the effectiveness of a restraint system the additional excursion results in an increased risk of head contact with the interior of the vehicle higher values of head injury criterion and greater chest g’s also increased peak loads are placed on the occupant due to the greater distance from the seat when the restraint is contacted by the body in  nhtsa proposed a ban on tension relieving devices which was never implemented because of the strenuous objection of the manufacturers the manufacturers defended the devices by arguing that they encouraged belt wearing and increased usage rates by occupants who were irritated by belts particularly children and adults of smaller stature in  the ntsb concluded that “permitting additional slack in the shoulder belt is not an acceptable way to deal with belt geometry generated by poor anchor design and location” and that slack introduced can “permit dangerous head contact in a crash” in january  a nhtsa analysis concluded that “in the real world most tension relievers automatically introduce slacking of the belt with normal movements of the occupants” most manufacturers have since eliminated tension relieving devices from their models manufactured in the s general motors announced in february  that it was phasing out the devices to “reduce the potential for occupant misuse” chrysler eliminated the devices in their united states built  models research has shown that the devices did not result in increased belt use and that occupantrestraint systems that utilized these devices were consistently less effective in reducing injury than systems without them safer solutions to the problem of seatbelt irritation include adjustable anchorages that change the location of the shoulder harness to account for variations in height and seat position e inadvertent unlatching because of the poor design of some types of buckling devices the deceleration and other forces generated in a collision axe sometimes sufficient to cause unlatching of the seatbelt certain buckle pawls can be depressed by sharp blows or sudden deceleration allowing the latch plate to pull away and rendering the occupantrestraint system useless the phenomenon of inertial unlatching has been demonstrated in crash testing done by the auto manufacturers themselves in the late s nhtsa opened an engineering analysis based on allegations that some buckles would release when they were subjected to a sharp blow on the front or back subsequent testing by the nhtsa office of defect investigation was conducted to determine the vulnerability of seatbelt latching mechanisms to inadvertent latching tests of  american cars manufactured over an eightyear period showed that  buckles opened inadvertently where an individual has been injured in a collision and it appears that he was not wearing the belt postcrash yet eyewitnesses confirm he had buckled up he may be the victim of a poorly designed latching mechanism f integrated seatbelt systems an inherent problem with occupant restraints presently in use is that their effectiveness is highly dependent upon seat adjustment because the anchorage is attached to points on the floor door and bpillar as the seat is adjusted relative to these points the position of the belt on the occupant’s body and thus its effectiveness can change significantly variations in occupant height and body size will affect the location of the belt as well on persons of smaller stature and children the upper portion of the belt will tend to locate much higher on the body and on the neck since at least as early as  manufacturers have been studying the concept of an “integrated” seatbelt system where the belt is attached directly to the seat thus all anchorage points move with the seat as it is adjusted or moved some manufacturers including audi mercedes and bmw have incorporated integrated seatbelt systems into current models promotional materials claim that the integrated seatbelt system will “provide maximum protection to people of all sizes and in all seat adjustment positions” and that they will provide “optimum belt alignment in all seating positions” not only will integrated seatbelts eliminate problems relating to poor belt fit caused by seat adjustment and height but they will provide much greater protection in the event of a rollover an occupant will be held in the seat more effectively and greater separation between occupant’s head and the ceiling will be maintained additionally with an integrated seatbelt unlike belts that are attached to doors or bpillars the restraint system will remain effective even if the door opens or if the seat or bpillar are moved relative to each other iii defenses a federal preemption in the area of occupantrestraint system litigation this defense is becoming extremely popular there are essentially three fmvss that concern seatbelts and their performance fmvss  – occupant crash protection fmvss  – seatbelts and fmvss  – seatbelt assembly anchorages the cases rejecting preemption and the arguments against preemption are too numerous to list here but there is a body of authority holding that fmvss  which provides manufacturers three different options for occupant protection systems in terms of performance requirements was intended by the federal government to preempt commonlaw liability for failure to install airbags or passive restraint systems although this is contrary to the savings claude of the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act which preserves commonlaw liability in most jurisdictions a plaintiff is not permitted to base a claim on the fact that a manufacturer did not install an airbag the rationale advanced is that the government adopted a scheme to slowly phase in passive restraint systems and that to require installation of airbags or passive restraint systems would frustrate that intent some manufacturers have attempted to stretch this concept to encompass any type of occupantrestraint system litigation so far there are no reported decisions accepting such an extension of the defense moreover appellate courts have made it clear that fmvss  only sets forth minimum standards of performance and although a manufacturer cannot be forced to select one of three options for occupantrestraint under fmvss  it may still be liable for defectively designing the option it does select there are numerous cases at the state and federal level concerning preemption arguments which would support both plaintiff and defense anyone having a question on preemption in restraint cases should immediately consider contacting arthur bryant at trial lawyers for public justice   he is considered to be one of the leading experts in the nation on pre emption and should be consulted before mapping out a legal strategy which could inadvertently result in bad case law b superseding cause in any crashworthiness litigation manufacturers inevitably argue that the plaintiff’s injuries were not enhanced by the design and that the force of the collision was so great that the plaintiff would have sustained the same or worse injuries irrespective of a different design in an occupantrestraint system case defendants will argue that stateoftheart occupantrestraint systems are ineffective over  mph and that at such speeds any design will permit serious injuries if the plaintiff has sustained a severe brain injury a new defense tactic is to argue that the plaintiff sustained what is called diffuse axonal injury caused by rapid rotational acceleration or deceleration of the brain the defendant will contend that even if the occupant had been prevented from striking the interior of the vehicle by a better restraint system the rotational forces were so high that the occupant would have sustained permanent brain damage under such circumstances the defense will dispute not only the cause of the injury but the nature of the injury itself proof of causation will require an analysis by an accident reconstructionist a biomechanic and physicians it therefore becomes critical for the plaintiff’s attorneys to thoroughly document the care and treatment of the plaintiff from the scene of the accident forward this should include not only acquisition of all pertinent medical records and interviews with treating physicians and other medical personnel but interviews with eyewitnesses paramedic personnel firemen ambulance drivers and anyone who could possibly have any information concerning the physical condition of the plaintiff at any point in time following the accident c unforeseeable misuse manufacturers will frequently argue that the occupantrestraint system was being used improperly thereby defeating the belt’s effectiveness a common contention is that the injured plaintiff did not follow the instructions in the owner’s manual concerning use of the restraint system manufacturers will also contend the occupant was not seated correctly or that the seat or belt was positioned improperly in some cases this may be the result of the often confusing and ambiguous statements in the written materiels provided however even where the plaintiff has not followed the owner’s manual to the letter counsel for plaintiff should determine if there is a defect based on failure to warn while manufacturers usually give a list of do’s and do not’s in their owner’s manuals in many cases there is no information given as to the consequences of the failure to follow those instructions if a person is advised that serious injury or death is a potential result he or she is much more likely to follow specific instructions as to belt adjustment and seat position nonuse or misuse are easy arguments for defendants to make since belts are often unbuckled postcrash by other passengers or people arriving at the scene also when vehicles come to rest after a collision even a properly seated and belted occupant is rarely in a normal seating position this defense should be anticipated and taken out by early thorough investigation statements from witnesses should be obtained to document the plaintiff’s position and use of the belt preimpact as well as position postcrash bruises and lacerations on the body left by the webbing will identify the precise location of the belt at the time of the collision these should be extensively photographed and videotaped immediately before they disappear the restraint system itself may contain critical evidence regarding the belt’s position and how it performed such as marks on the webbing from retractor components or even skin tissue or honed iv conclusion even with the availability of research and literature demonstrating the defective nature of many occupantrestraint systems and the welldocumented history of the failure of auto manufacturers to remedy known defects in their restraint system designs these are extremely difficult cases to win taking on an auto manufacturer in a major injury case involving a restraint system design defect is expensive the plaintiff’s attorney must be prepared to spend up to and above a sixfigure amount to work up and try some of these cases and should expect that the manufacturer will spend two to three times that amount certainly not every case represents this type of expenditure but the problem is that the attorney never knows at the outset what the ultimate necessary costs will be the plaintiff’s attorney must be committed to obtaining the best experts from around the country in accident reconstruction occupantrestraint system design and testing biomechanics automotive engineering and casespecific fields of medicine a stateoftheat demonstrative evidence presentation at trial is essential and may require fullscale mockups and crash testing despite the financial and legal hurdles facing the plaintiff’s attorney these cases can be successful provided they are worked up properly and afforded sufficient time and resources
