springdale arkansas  httpwwwtysonfoodsinccom ■ expectations were not particularly high when in  john h tyson was confirmed as chairman and chief executive officer of tyson foods the giant poultryprocessing company founded  years earlier by his grandfather tyson had a somewhat checkered past having been effectively sidelined from business by nasty twin addictions to cocaine and alcohol in the late s although he had worked in the family business since his teens through much of his early career he had been given relatively marginal responsibilities tyson had been named chairman of the company in  but had shared responsibilities for leading the company with the then ceo wayne britt it was britt who won praise for leading tyson foods to a sharp jump in earnings in the late s to some outside observers it seemed that tyson had little more going for him than the family name the skeptics and naysayers were in for a surprise under tysons direction tyson foods emerged as the worlds largest john h tyson apwide world photos  proteinprocessing company largely on the strength of its  acquisition of the south dakota–based ibp a giant processor of beef and pork that acquisition as engineered by john tyson accomplished what his father donald j tyson had attempted but failed to do during his tenure as chairman and ceo—namely to successfully diversify beyond the confines of the poultry business as of early  tyson foods was producing roughly  percent of all the meat products consumed in the united states according to greg lee the companys co–chief operating officer and group president for food service and international business company profits climb in wake of acquisition even more impressive especially for company shareholders was the impact of tysons achievements on the companys bottom line in the fiscal year ending september   the companys sales more than doubled to  billion from the roughly  billion of the previous year profits for fiscal  totaled  million more than three times the companys profits of  million in fiscal  in fiscal  despite a  percent jump in fourthquarter earnings profits for the year totaled only  million or  a share down from s  million or  per share however revenue in fiscal  was up topping  billion as compared with the  billion of the year before john h tyson grandson of the tyson foods founder john w tyson was born in springdale arkansas home of the family business on september   at the time of tysons birth his father donald j tyson was manager of the companys springdale plant his mother twilla jean devoted her energies to raising tyson and his sisters cheryl and carla two years after tysons birth his father was promoted to president a post he held until  when he succeeded john w tyson who had passed away as chairman and chief executive officer while attending springdale high school john h tyson began working weekends in the family companys plants in the summer of  donald tyson arranged for his yearold son to spend the summer working at a company poultryprocessing plant in green forest arkansas according to a  profile of john h tyson in fortune  part of his responsibilities involved the unloading of chicken coops from a truck and placing them on a conveyor belt after watching a longtime plant employee demonstrate each step in this process tyson noted i said to myself that didnt look difficult when the teenager attempted to replicate the task he grabbed onto a coop and hefted it headhigh but made the mistake of tilting it the wrong way as a result the chicken excrement lining the bottom of the coop slid in his direction it hit me right in the face tyson recalled and slid down the front of my shirt may   studies business administration at smu after graduating from high school tyson enrolled at southern methodist university in dallas texas to study business administration when he received his bachelors degree in  he returned to springdale to take his place in the family business over the next several years he worked his way through a series of farm sales and purchasing positions none of which were particularly demanding from a management standpoint largely on the strength of his family ties tyson was appointed to the companys board of directors in  the latter half of the s found tyson in the grip of a double addiction to alcohol and cocaine fortune reported that during a  legal proceeding tyson acknowledged the magnitude of his substanceabuse struggle the only reason i was on the payroll was because i was the son of the boss any other corporation i would have been thrown to the wolves may   with the support of his family tyson entered a drug rehabilitation program where he successfully conquered his addictions he returned to tyson foods with renewed energy and determination to succeed in  as a measure of confidence in his son donald tyson appointed john as president of the companys fledgling meat and seafood businesses segments in which the older tyson placed great hope for the future according to fortune  tyson foods early foray into nonpoultry processing was abandoned by the late s as impractical the company ran into problems adapting its timetested poultryprocessing techniques to other meats and seafood despite this disappointing failure donald tyson remained confident that his son was ready for greater responsibility effective october   john succeeded the outgoing leland tollett as chairman at the same time the company tapped the chief financial officer wayne britt to assume tolletts responsibilities as ceo tollett expressed confidence that both of his successors would carry the company to greater heights according to a corporate press release after citing the achievements of john h tysons grandfather and father tollett observed i believe that our shareholders team members and associates will continue to prosper and grow with continued family leadership at the highest level september   succeeds britt as ceo roughly  months after taking over as chairman tyson succeeded britt as ceo when the latter abruptly resigned in april  according to a report by kyle mooty in arkansas business  britt said that although his adult life had been dedicated exclusively to tyson foods i am leaving because our transition to a new generation is complete and frankly i would like time to pursue other interests april   britts resignation ended the split management of the company and gave tyson complete control assessing the companys future prospects for arkansas business  the new york–based security analyst john mcmillin said he thought tyson would turn in a creditable performance as ceo i think hell be highly motivated and hes walking into the job at a good time in the cycle there should be less competing proteins around next year april   in october  britt was named nonexecutive chairman of spectral fusion technologies based in the united kingdom although it was originally his fathers dream to successfully move tyson foods beyond the boundaries of the poultryprocessing business it fell upon john to get the job done only months after he took over as ceo of tyson foods word spread through the foodprocessing industry that ibp the giant meatpacker based in south dakota was entertaining acquisition offers the first bid for ibp came in the form of a leveragedbuyout proposal from a coalition of ibp executives and investment bankers from the wall street firm of donaldson lufkin  jenrette that offer valued at  billion  billion in cash and stock plus  billion in refinancing of ibp debt was soon topped by an offer of  billion from the virginiabased smithfield foods the countrys largest pork producer tyson foods was the last prospective buyer to join the bidding for ibp on december   it brought to the table what was then the most attractive offer valued at a total of  billion including  billion or  a share in cash and stock and  billion in assumed debt not surprisingly tysons entry into the fray set off not only a war of words but an allout bidding war between the two leading contenders smithfield foods publicly characterized tysons bid as a hostile tender offer despite the decision of ibps board to consider it by the end of december  tyson had sweetened its bid to a total of  billion preemptively topping an anticipated bid increase from smithfield bidding war intensifies over the – new years holiday smithfield increased its offer to  in stock for each share of ibp however ibps board opted for the final bid from tyson at  a share in equal parts cash and stock which was considered more attractive because of the cash another factor in ibps decision was the fear that a merger into smithfield would be closely scrutinized by federal regulators because of implications for the us pork market a few days into the new year smithfield publicly acknowledged that it had been outbid tyson foods final offer was valued at a total of  billion in early spring the muchanticipated marriage of tyson and ibp hit a snag that for the next few months threatened to tear the companies apart on march   john tyson alleging that ibp had supplied misleading information announced that tyson foods was terminating its merger agreement and filing suit to collect damages at the center of the controversy was ibps announcement days earlier that an internal probe of its dfg foods subsidiary had uncovered mismanagement possible manipulation of financial records and product theft in response to tysons announcement ibp declared that it was filing its own lawsuit in a delaware chancery court to force tyson foods to complete the acquisition in the end ibp prevailed in midjune  a delaware judge handed down an order requiring tyson foods to follow through with its acquisition of ibp tyson foods quickly made clear its intentions to obey the judges order during the trial in delaware both john tyson and bob peterson ibps chairman and ceo testified that the combination of the two companies still made strategic sense after the court proceedings according to a report by victor epstein in the omaha worldherald  tyson said despite the trial we believe the management teams of ibp and tyson can work together june   focuses on integrating ibp into company for tyson one of the first orders of business after the finalization of the ibp acquisition in the fall of  was the streamlining and rationalization of the newly combined company by early  john tyson seemed satisfied that most areas of redundancy had been—or were scheduled to be—eliminated at the companys annual shareholders meeting in february  tyson reported that  million in savings had been achieved during  with another  million in savings expected to be realized before the end of  he told shareholders that the companys focus for the short term would be on paying down its debt which had jumped sharply in the wake of the ibp acquisition twice in the early s tyson foods came under the close scrutiny of federal regulators in december  the company and three of its managers were indicted on charges that they had conspired to smuggle illegal immigrants into the united states for work in company plants the case went to trial in federal court in chattanooga tennessee in early  the company and the three executives were acquitted of all charges in march  the company revealed that it was under investigation by the securities and exchange commission over benefits paid to top executives including john h tyson tyson and his wife kimberly lived in northwestern arkansas with their two
