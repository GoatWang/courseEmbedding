global competitiveness of chinese and american firms seeking to establish a presence overseas   meanwhile we have not generated meaningful revenues and our limited assets consist solely of cash   the unaudited condensed financial statements of the company for the six months ended june   and  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” for interim financial information applied on a consistent basis and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on form q and the requirements of regulation sk and regulation sx promulgated under the securities act of  as amended the “securities act”  accordingly they do not include all the information and footnotes required by us gaap for complete audited financial statements however the information included in these financial statements reflects all adjustments consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments which are in the opinion of management necessary for the fair presentation of the company’s financial position and the results of operations results shown for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be obtained for a full fiscal year or any future annual or interim period the balance sheet information as of december   was derived from the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended december   included in the company’s annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” on april   these financial statements should be read in conjunction with that report   note   summary of significant accounting policies   the management of the company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain the company’s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles   management estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period significant estimates reflected in the financial statements include but are not limited to valuation of deferred tax asset and sharebased compensation costs changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates actual results could differ from those estimates            fair value of financial instruments   the company follows paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification “paragraph ” to measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments paragraph  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures paragraph  establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three  broad levels the three  levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph  are described below   level    quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date       level    pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date       level    pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data   financial assets are considered level  when their fair values are determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable   the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs if the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument   the carrying amounts of the company’s financial assets and liabilities such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments   transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an armslength basis as the requisite conditions of competitive freemarket dealings may not exist representations about transactions with related parties if made shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in armslength transactions unless such representations can be substantiated   revenue recognition   the company follows paragraph s of the fasb accounting standards codification for revenue recognition the company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured the company derived no revenue during six months periods ended june   and    stockbased compensation   the company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and nonemployees in capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs the company accounts for sharebased payments under the guidance as set forth in the sharebased payment topic of the fasb accounting standards codification which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees officers directors and consultants including employee stock options based on estimated fair values the company estimates the fair value of sharebased payment awards to employees and directors on the date of grant using an optionpricing model and the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the required service period in the companys statements of operations the company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to nonemployees in accordance with the authoritative guidance where the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a the date at which a performance commitment is reached or b the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete stockbased compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised as necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates             the fair value of the company’s stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the blackscholesmerton option pricing model which uses certain assumptions related to riskfree interest rates expected volatility expected life of the stock options or warrants and future dividends compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the blackscholesmerton option pricing model and based on actual experience the assumptions used in the blackscholesmerton option pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods   income taxes   the company uses an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes that allows recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years under the asset and liability approach deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the company is able to realize their benefits or that future deductibility is uncertain the company’s policy is to recognize interest andor penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense   net income loss per common share   basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year diluted earnings loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued using the treasury stock method potential common shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is antidilutive   there were no potentially outstanding dilutive common shares for the reporting period ended june   and     recently issued accounting pronouncements   in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  revenue from contracts with customers  asu  is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current us gaap and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition asu  will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract the asu also will require additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract asu  is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods therein entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of asu  on the company’s financial statements and disclosures   in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern  which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose goingconcern uncertainties in the financial statements asu  requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued  an entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern  asu  is effective for annual periods ending after december   and interim periods thereafter early adoption is permitted the company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of asu  on the company’s financial statements and disclosures   in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  leases  asu  requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than  months asu  is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   early adoption is permitted a modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements with certain practical expedients available the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of asu  on the company’s financial statements and disclosures             in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities  the new guidance will impact the accounting for equity investments financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments all equity investments in unconsolidated entities other than those accounted for under the equity method of accounting will generally be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through earnings there will no longer be an availableforsale classification for equity securities with readily determinable fair values in which changes in fair value are currently reported in other comprehensive income  in addition the fasb clarified the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on availableforsale debt securities  in general the new guidance will require modified retrospective application to all outstanding instruments with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings this guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years the company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on our financial statements and related disclosures   in march  the fasb issued the asu  compensation  stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting the amendments in this asu require among other things that all income tax effects of awards be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled the asu also allows for an employer to repurchase more of an employees shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period the company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its financial statements and related disclosures    note   going concern   these financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future as reflected in the financial statements the company had a stockholders deficit of  at june   and incurred a net loss of  and used cash in operating activities of  for the reporting period then ended these and other factors raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern in addition the companys independent certified public accounting firm in its report to the december   financial statements has raised substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern    the company is attempting to generate sufficient revenue however the company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations while the company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds there can be no assurances to that effect the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds   note   related party transactions   advances from shareholder   from time to time a shareholder of the company advance funds to the company for working capital purpose those advances are unsecured noninterest bearing and due on demand   as of june   and december   the balance of amounts advanced by a

concern if we are unable to satisfy our cash requirements our major shareholders have indicated their willingness to provide additional funds to the company to cover any shortfalls however no written agreement or guarantee exists to this effect critical accounting policies and estimates fair value of financial instruments the company follows paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification paragraph  to measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments paragraph  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures paragraph  establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three  broad levels the three  levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph  are described below level  quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date level  pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date level  pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data financial assets are considered level  when their fair values are determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs if the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument the carrying amounts of the companys financial assets and liabilities such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an armslength basis as the requisite conditions of competitive freemarket dealings may not exist representations about transactions with related parties if made shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in armslength transactions unless such representations can be substantiated revenue recognition the company
