brand is a legacy left by john johnnie walker after he started to sell whisky in his grocers shop in ayrshire scotland the brand became popular but after walkers death in  it was his son alexander walker and grandson alexander walker ii who were largely responsible for establishing the whisky as a popular brand under john walker whisky sales represented eight percent of the firms income by the time alexander was ready to pass on the company to his own sons that figure had increased to between  and  percent during that time john walker sold a number of single malt whiskies—notably his own walkers kilmarnock in  he launched johnnie walkers first commercial blend and called it old highland whisky he then made the astute move of engaging ships captains as his agents to carry his whisky wherever ships could sail before long his unique blend was available around the globe alexander walker introduced the iconic square bottle in  this meant more bottles fitting the same space and resulted in fewer broken bottles the other identifying characteristic of the johnnie walker bottle is the label which is applied at an angle of  degrees and allows text to be made larger and more visible from  to  johns grandsons george and alexander ii expanded the line and introduced the colour names in  when james stevenson was the managing director the rebranding was finalised and in  special old highland whisky was renamed johnnie walker red label while the extra special old highland whisky was renamed johnnie walker black label in addition the slogan born —still going strong was created along with the striding man logo a figure used in their advertisements to this day created by illustrator tom browne in honour of the founder and given the same name johnnie walker white was dropped during world war i in  alexander ii added johnnie walker swing to the line the name originating from the unusual shape of the bottle which allowed it to rock back and forth the company joined

expensive blended scotches on the market with prices in the range of us – johnnie walker swing supplied in a distinctive bottle whose irregular bottom allows it to rock back and forth this type of bottle design was originally used aboard sailing ships it was alexander iis last blend it features a high proportion of speyside malts complemented by malts from the northern highlands and islay and
