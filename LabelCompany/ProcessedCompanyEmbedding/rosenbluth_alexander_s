fort lewis on october   by duane colt denfeld phd posted  historylinkorg essay  share email share tweet on october   major alexander p cronkhite  is shot and killed during a training exercise at fort lewis an army board of inquiry rules the death accidental finding that cronkhite shot himself while firing at a target his father major general adelbert cronkhite does not accept this result and challenges the army’s conclusion believing that his son could not have shot himself the case will gain national prominence and lead to three civilian investigations two soldiers with major cronkhite at the time of his death eventually will be charged with murder finally six years after the shooting both men will be acquitted in a tacoma federal trial but this court outcome does not end the mystery and researchers will continue to write about the incident and debate what really happened a concrete obelisk on a joint base lewismcchord training area remembers major cronkhite monument to a mystery the cronkhite monument located on a joint base lewismcchord training area recalls the greatest mystery in the yearplus base history  the concrete obelisk has a small bronze plaque stating that “major ap cronkhite ce corps of engineers died  october  ” the monument marks the spot that major cronkhite fell from a gunshot wound placed here by the th engineers the simple monument does not suggest the long and complex history concerning the major there would be an army board of inquiry and three civil investigations over a sixyear period to determine whether the major accidentally shot himself or was murdered the investigations would include the participation of the president of the united states the us attorney general pierce county washington and the federal court tacoma  six years after the event a sensational federal trial in tacoma would end the legal case  however the case has since received further national and local interest   routine training for combat the th engineer regiment arrived at camp lewis october   to train and prepare for combat duty in france the recently formed regiment had to learn engineering tasks and combat skills they practiced river crossings constructed pontoon bridges built fortifications and became weapons proficient major alexander p cronhkite  was assigned to lead a battalion and serve as the regimental training officer the highly respected major cronkhite had arrived on october   the only son of major general adelbert cronkhite  he had graduated west point in   he was a brilliant student graduating seventh in his class dwight eisenhower and omar bradley were st and th respectively in this class described as the one that stars fell on so many became generals upon graduation cronkhite became an instructor training engineer units preparing for war  in recognition of his exceptional training skills he advanced rapidly up the ladder from lieutenant to major in just three years on october  major cronkhite came down with influenza and reported to the camp lewis hospital on october  the hospital released him to his quarters for further rest and recuperation during his illness the th continued its intensive training captain robert rosenbluth  assumed some of the training responsibilities on october  rosenbluth led the regiment in a field tactics exercise  this exercise involved  engineers hiking to an advanced guard position about four miles south of the regimental headquarters today lewis main base this combatreadiness exercise had this force moving overland to a forward position to prepare defenses for a main force to follow   shooting and the shooting the regimental advanced force stopped for lunch at an abandoned farm and orchard major cronkhite decided that morning to join the exercise he left his quarters at  am  minutes later than the regiment and joined them at the farm at  pm while the  troops relaxed in the orchard about  yards away major cronkhite decided to do some shooting he was an excellent marksman and proud of his quick draw the major could draw cock and shoot in one motion accompanied by captain robert rosenbluth and his orderly sergeant bugler roland pothier b   the major would demonstrate his shooting ability however major cronkhite was violating a strict army regulation that prohibited target practice outside an official range also having ammunition off range violated regulations major cronkhite still weak fired several shots and turned to comment on his shooting excellence one shot rang out and he fell saying that he had been shot he died about two minutes later ruled an accident captain ernest a sommer  a highly respected portland oregon doctor stationed at the camp performed an autopsy and described the wound as entering three inches from the right nipple and exiting his left side at the waist line a camp lewis board of inquiry studied the autopsy  this military board declared it an accidental death believing that a weakened major cronkhite lost his grasp on the handle of his army pistol when it kicked and inadvertently turned it upon himself  camp lewis had an impressive funeral with a ceremony in the chapel this was followed by a procession lead by colonel rs thomas th engineer commander a band and a caisson carrying the casket behind the caisson was major cronkhite’s horse with boots across the saddle and reversed to show last ride his body was shipped to west point for burial        ruling challenged major cronkhite’s mother and father rejected the finding that their son had shot himself his father major general cronkhite remained on duty in france while mrs cronkhite pursued answers to her son’s death she came from a family with a long military tradition as had the general  mrs cronkhite could not believe that her son could accidentally shoot himself once major general cronkhite returned from france where he commanded the th division he committed himself to proving that his son had not died an accidental death the general had his son exhumed a medical examiner investigated the body and determined that the wound was not selfinflicted the investigator asserted that the righthanded cronkhite could not have shot himself in the right chest additionally the general hired private detectives who interviewed soldiers who had been at the scene with the evidence collected major general cronkhite appealed to president warren g harding  and secretary of war john w weeks  to investigate his son’s death he pressured the war department and army for a new investigation and hearing suspicions and interrogations the united states justice department launched an investigation based upon the findings of special agents roland pothier was arrested on march   during long interrogations pothier provided five different accounts he confessed that he was cleaning his weapon and accidentally shot the major involuntary manslaughter in a later confession he implicated captain rosenbluth saying that the captain had ordered him to kill major cronkhite the alleged motive was that rosenbluth feared that major cronkhite was investigating him for demotion because of poor performance captain rosenbluth was arrested march  he protested his innocence saying that major cronhkite had accidentally shot himself the finding of the  army board of inquiry   on april   major general cronkhite commanding the army third corps in baltimore maryland received orders to assume command of the panama canal zone he requested and received a departure postponement he stepped down from the third corps command so that he was without formal duties this left him free to follow the us attorney general proceedings he actively pressured the attorney general and the army to go to trial the potential suspects were pothier and rosenbluth the only two who had been with major cronkhite at the time of the shooting       during the investigations pothier was held in custody captain rosenbluth had been released on bail us attorney general harry daugherty  personally investigated the shooting of major cronkhite reviewing all the evidence during june us attorney w c herron called rosenbluth in for questioning however the attorney general made an important finding that the event took place on land that was not yet government property pierce county had donated the land but the deed had not gone to the government on july   the us attorney general dropped all federal charges against pothier and rosenbluth  the evidence and interview records were turned over to the pierce county prosecutor james w selden d   prosecutor selden remarked that the papers he had seen did not convince him that rosenbluth and pothier should be tried on charges of killing major cronkhite  however he said he would study all the evidence sent him by the federal government having reviewed the evidence prosecutor selden on december   said there was not a case       federal grand jury and tacoma trial         by the fall of  four years had passed since major cronkhite’s death and it remained an unsolved mystery on september   a federal grand jury in the washington district issued a list of people to be called to testify it included   veterans and six physicians thomas p revelle  the us district attorney hoped to reach a final and conclusive answer  robert rosenbluth wished it would end the cloud of suspicion    on september   the grand jury heard testimony from major lee o wright  us army ordnance department a leading small arms expert  small arms experts would be critical in determining whether major cronkhite could have shot himself the grand jury at the end of the month visited the site a farm clearing in the camp lewis training area it had changed some since  as the four farm buildings had burned down on september  major general adelbert cronkhite appeared before the grand jury he reiterated his belief that his son could not have shot himself and that he had been murdered the deceased’s father also visited the site and said his son had not died at the monument location however he did not indicate where he had died or how that would have any bearing on the case       in september  veterans of the th engineer regiment erected a small monument at the shooting site this monument survives today and continues to honor major cronkhite on october   the federal grand jury in tacoma indicted robert rosenbluth and roland porthier on murder charges captain rosenbluth was arrested in new york on october  he posted bail porthier then a railroad brakeman was arrested in providence rhode island major general cronkhite had increased his criticism of the army charging coverup and failure to properly investigate the event on april   the secretary of war reprimanded the general for his public charges     decisions and delays there were trial delays during  the government considered the issue of jurisdiction the question of land transfer from the county to the federal government remained sticky finally the resolution of this issue was left to the assigned court next the federal authorities in tacoma separated the trials of pothier and rosenbluth pothier went to trial on september   judge edward e cushman  directed the jury that they would only consider the murder charge too much time had elapsed to consider manslaughter charges during the trial the prosecutor called a small arms expert who testified that major cronkhite could not have shot himself there was also an effort to discredit rosenbluth and support the theory that he ordered pothier to shoot the major  the most dramatic and turning point in the court occurred when captain eugene m caffey  who served with cronkhite at camp lewis was asked if he could have shot himself answering in the affirmative he was handed a pistol and he stepped down from the witness stand captain caffey then easily demonstrated how cronkhite shot himself this demonstration became the trial turning point the jury acquitted pothier on the first ballot and the court then acquitted rosenbluth       an american dreyfus americans in  considered henry ford  among the greatest men of history the industrial giant was considered a potential presidential candidate however he had a dark side and that was his hatred of jewish people ford blamed jews for societal problems he believed they had killed president lincoln and controlled the banks to steal from hardworking people soon after the cronkhite shooting ford purchased the dearborn independent paper this paper became his vehicle to inform readers as to the jewish threat as ford saw it starting in december  the newspaper identified rosenbluth as part of a jewish conspiracy the paper rallied against captain rosenbluth who they described as a “german jew spy” and also a bolshevik agent the paper never explained how the murder of cronkhite would advance any spying effort or any socialist agenda some other newspapers across the nation repeated the antisemitic attacks    these newspaper attacks encouraged a number of prominent people to rosenbluth’s defense they put up his bail money his fellow yale forestry school alumni supported him rosenbluth being a  graduate of the program herbert hoover  head of the american relief administration provided a character reference rosenbluth had served in the relief program in russia following his discharge from the army in      the mystery lingers major general cronkhite was forced to retire early in  this followed his reprimand from the secretary of war his charges against the army had become troubling among those most annoyed included the army’s chief of staff general of the armies john j pershing  he had also irritated the justice department with serious charges that they had not pursued the case major general cronkhite retired died in june  the next year on december   a san francisco coastal defense post was named in his honor this fort survives as a national park service historic area within the golden gate national recreation area    robert rosenbluth left the army in  and served in overseas relief work although he had graduated in forestry an earlier experience directed him to social welfare he had done volunteer work in a new york prison teaching inmates wood carving this experience convinced him that social work would be his career roland pothier returned to providence rhode island and worked as a laborer captain eugene m caffey who had a major role in the acquittal of pothier and rosenbluth remained in the army he was admitted to the virginia bar in september  and received a law degree from the university of virginia in june  he entered the army judge advocate general corps prior to world war ii he returned to the us army engineer corps and saw
