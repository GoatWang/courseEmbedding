property in and may be found in tulsa oklahoma     iv factual background  on december   an explosion and fire the incident occurred at one of enogexs natural gas cryogenic processing facilities located at  county road  rush springs oklahoma cox city facility enogex acquired the cox city facility from transok inc transok as a result of an acquisition and merger  the cox city facility includes four separate gas processing plants consisting of various skids containing different components as well as other piping and equipment the incident originated in what is referred to as plant   plant  was designed specified assembled installed and sold by proquip to transok in   the fire and explosion originated in the e heat exchanger chart exchanger that was a part of and located in plant  this exchanger was approximately  feet tall and almost four feet wide standing vertically although a separate piece of equipment designed to carry out a separate function of taking heat from some gas and transferring it to other gas the chart exchanger worked in conjunction with other pieces of equipment and piping to process natural gas  the chart exchanger was designed and manufactured by altec then a wholly owned subsidiary of chart and delivered to proquip in  defendant william j leathen acted as an engineer or engineeringrelated professional approving and signing the asbuilt engineering drawing for altec certifying the chart exchanger for production  proquip installed the chart exchanger in plant  the chart exchanger was installed as a piece of equipment that was distinguishable from the rest of the equipment installed in plant      defendant donald r allen was proquips project manager and engineer for the specification approval assembly and installation of plant  and the chart exchanger he approved the chart exchanger for construction  the incident resulted from the catastrophic rupture of the chart exchanger which occurred when highly pressurized hydrocarbons leaked into an inactive zone located between two halves of the chart exchanger that had been welded together inactive zone by altec the inactive zone served no useful function for the processing of natural gas it was not accessible from outside the chart exchanger so the end user in this case enogex had no way of understanding its defective and unreasonably dangerous nature this design was defective because the streams on either side of the inactive zone were designed to contain between  psig and  psig of pressure yet the inactive zone was designed to withstand only  psig of pressure when the highly pressurized hydrocarbons entered the inactive zone the chart exchanger was violently ripped apart without any warning as a result large amounts of pressurized hydrocarbon gas escaped causing a large explosion and fire  the incident resulted in damage to the chart exchanger the other equipment of plant  and other parts of the cox city facility outside of plant   the incident resulted in significant damages to enogex in excess of the amount required for diversity jurisdiction pursuant to  usc §  v causes of action count i strict liability  design and manufacturing defects against altec and chart  plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs  through  as though fully pied herein      altec designed and sold the chart exchanger  at the time of the design manufacture and sale of the chart exchanger altec was in the business of manufacturing and selling heat exchangers  the chart exchanger was defective because the inactive zone was not designed to withstand the normal operating pressures of the chart exchanger altec should have either designed the inactive zone to withstand the normal operating pressures of the chart exchanger properly vented the inactive zone or eliminated the inactive zone altogether  the chart exchanger failed certain hydrotests prior to its sale and installation indicating a manufacturing defect with certain portions of the exchanger creating the potential for internal leaks that could reasonably be expected to release pressure into the inactive zone and lead to catastrophic failure  the chart exchanger was defective at the time it was designed manufactured and left the control of altec  the chart exchanger was expected to and did reach enogex without substantial change in the condition in which it left the control of altec  the chart exchanger was unreasonably dangerous to an extent not contemplated by enogex in that it was defective in a number of ways including but not limited to design workmanship construction manufacture marketing and testing  enogex used the chart exchanger as intended and as a result of these design defects the chart exchanger was not reasonably fit for the ordinary purposes for which it was intended to be used by or could have reasonably been expected to be used by enogex  the defect in the chart exchanger was a direct and proximate cause of the incident     without the design defect described above any failure of the chart exchanger would likely have been noncatastrophic that is a leak in a heat exchanger without this particular design defect would not result in a violent fire and explosion it was the particular characteristics of this design defect in the chart exchanger that caused the catastrophic fire and explosion  the incident resulted in significant damages to enogex  chart is liable for the acts and omissions of altec count ii strict liability design and manufacturing defects against pro­ quip and linde  plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs

exchanger the inactive zone should have been designed to withstand the normal operating pressures of the chart exchanger been properly vented or eliminated altogether  the chart exchanger failed certain hydrotests prior to its sale and installation indicating a manufacturing defect with certain portions of the exchanger creating the potential for internal leaks that could reasonably be expected to release pressure into the inactive zone and lead to catastrophic failure   ˇ  the chart exchanger was defective at the time it was specified installed and sold by proquip  enogex used the chart exchanger as intended and as a result of these design defects the chart exchanger was not reasonably fit for the ordinary purposes for which it was intended or could have reasonably been expected to be used by enogex  the defectively designed chart exchanger was dangerous to an extent not contemplated by enogex  the defect in the chart exchanger was a direct and proximate cause of the incident  the incident resulted in significant damages to enogex  linde is liable for the acts and omissions of proquip count iii strict liability  failure to warn against altec and chart  plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs  through  as though fully pled herein  altec knew or should have known of the unreasonably dangerous condition of the chart exchanger resulting from its defective design  the unreasonable risk of harm was not one that an ordinary user such as enogex would reasonably expect from the intended use of the chart exchanger  altec did not provide adequate warnings of the chart exchangers dangerous condition or instructions for the safe use of the chart exchanger  the inadequate instructions that were provided did not describe the danger created by the design defect so the end user would understand and appreciate the danger     the inadequate instructions contained in the chart exchangers user manual did not provide any method for avoiding or mitigating the danger created by the design defect  when chart revised the user manual that applied to the chart exchanger in  it knew or should have known of the unreasonably dangerous condition of the chart exchanger despite this knowledge whether actual or constructive chart failed to revise the user manual to adequately warn or instruct end users such as enogex regarding the safe use of the chart exchanger in the new manual or take any other steps to warn enogex regarding this dangerous condition further chart knew or should have known that enogex was an end user of its exchangers and that enogex was unaware of the nature of this danger chart should have taken appropriate measures to warn enogex of the danger and instruct it on how to mitigate the danger  had adequate warnings andor instructions for the safe use of the chart exchanger been provided by altec or chart or both those warnings andor instructions would have been heeded and followed by enogex  the failure to provide
