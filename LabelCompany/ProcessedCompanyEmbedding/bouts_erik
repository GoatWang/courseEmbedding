glass excitements   industrial processes generally fail to be the most attractive settings – often grimy grey and dull – with brewhouses the aesthetic exception to the rule yet there is something that captures the imagination when it comes to glass bottle plants the redhot preforms shaped into slowly cooling bottles in a matter of moments the dance of these shafts of light against a dark hulking mechanical background is a truly mesmerising sight akin to a scene from some futuristic science fiction epic and so it was last week in leerdam the netherlands where there gathered the european leadership of owensillinois and their invited guests on hand to celebrate the completion of a  million euro investment in the city’s glass plant leerdam is oi’s specialist beer bottle plant for benelux capable of producing a billion green and amber bottles annually with  staying within the three markets the key upgrades were for furnace no  the plant has three furnaces with new thermic isolation equipment and new process control for the combustion process with up to  of raw material for glass composed of ‘cullet’ – recycled waste glass suitable for melting – there is a lower temperature required and as such a shorter dwell time equipment and process changes have resulted in a  per cent reduction in co emissions brewers’ guardian spoke to oi europe president erik bouts on the day concerning not only the leerdam investment but also regarding issues the use of glass packaging by the brewing industry bouts is a newcomer to oi having joined in january of this year from his role as ceo of the glidden company part of akzonobel architectural paints division in the united states a dutch citizen bouts will be based at oi’s european headquarters in bussingny switzerland you’ve mentioned oi’s environmental credentials this morning the fact that you can use so much recycled material in glassmaking is something of a surprise “i think glass always has been a very natural packaging product probably the most natural product in all of packaging history the nice thing about glass is that it is really recyclable from bottle to bottle nothing gets lost everything that’s been used in making the bottle can be reused – if you do the collection properly and upgrade the quality of the cullet – in the production processes  “and that’s what we have been doing in recent history trying to upgrade first of all the quality of the cullet through better partnering with our recycling partners and secondly we have been investing in furnace technologies to be able to use a larger content of cullet in our manufacturing processes” the cold end now has better inspection equipment what does that allow you to do in terms of design – does it add value “it’s the integrity of the design that is protected by good topnotch inspection equipment it’s also the feedback you get in the whole manufacturing process so you can detect design flaws at an earlier stage and make process improvements where they need to be and that’s at the very beginning of a glassmaking process  “there’s also feedback to designers if you want about further opportunities and possibilities of the bottle design the more information you have in the manufacturing process – information is power in making a product and designing a product” it’s early days in your role but could you comment as to what brewers are looking for at the moment lightweighting is an established trend and now it has an environmental sheen but i am assuming embossing and other ways to add brand value are ongoing requests  “a few things in my early discussions with customers are evident i think there’s a big trend towards differentiation within the brewer community one bottle fits all brewers – i think that’s history everybody tries to differentiate through brand experience from their competitors and the bottle the design of the bottle the functionality of the bottle is an important part of it  “i think all brewers are looking for a top quality product – the functionality of the product in terms of production and energy use lightweighting shorter transportation times they are looking for flexible partners flexible suppliers because their demand patterns change quickly and they change a lot so they need partners that quickly follow the new demand patterns in the marketplace and thirdly i think they are looking to partners that are financially stable and are looking to invest in the future “ it means for a company like oi with a global footprint you are more likely to match up with a multinational say heineken than a smaller competitor with a regional basis “craft beer is an important segment for us typically you differentiate your plants to serve different segments in the brewing market so a plant like leerdam is more catered to the big multinationals but we have other plants in the network that are specialised in shorter runs “part of our investment strategy is to upgrade our capabilities to do fast prototyping and to make more bespoke or designed bottles for these guys the important thing is to be able to make those prototypes in a faster and more custom way and reduce that whole design process from idea drawings all the way to mouldmaking” there’s often an issue on procurement for any brewer of any size about sticker price there’s a tension between unit price and design innovation so to what extent can you help them realise that a bit of extra investment will result in increased sales  “most of our brewers most of our customers they have a broad portfolio of brands and products it’s not one size fits all overall they will have the speciality brands which require more of an innovative bottle with more embossing and all the good stuff you are talking about but also they operate in volume segments where it’s all about long runs and a low price  “and i think the name of the game is to balance those needs and to make sure that you create winwins for both companies of course we have to guarantee a return on our investment we are an american company and publically owned so it’s high standards for return on investment so that’s my responsibility to match the needs of the shareholders and of the customers and to find the right balance between what the market wants and what the shareholder needs”     add to delicious  digg print version plain text rate
