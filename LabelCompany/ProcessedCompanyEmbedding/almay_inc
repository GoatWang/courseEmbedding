keep in mind that repetition is essential when it comes to skin care products so it is important to establish a daily routine do your research before buying a moisturizer by reading the labels to find out the active ingredients and what they claim to do for your skin if you have sensitive skin you should always go for products that are hypoallergenic and free from fragrances and dyes a day moisturizer with a  spf range is a good choice for those with fair skin that gets sunburned easily consider your age when choosing a night moisturizing cream a cream with natural ingredients such as
