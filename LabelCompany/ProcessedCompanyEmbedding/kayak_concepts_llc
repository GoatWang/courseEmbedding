financials project updates communication closed business plan team  ownership offering details issuer information target customers commercial customers in our first year of operation our customers are municipalities and marinas who will purchase our product at the wholesale prices listed on our website and either lease or rent kayak condos to those willing to pay a bit more for convenience weve been talking about – the ability and benefit of accessing ones kayak more easily and therefore being able to use it more often   retail customers as we evolve and gain distributors the private individual kayaker becomes a customer  at this time kayak condos are only sold wholesale on pallets of   as our manufacturing costs decreases with greater volume a retailers markup emerges  ideal distributor profile would be lumber and building supply centers who will profit from a  retail markup  proper installation labor and  substructure lumber and tiedown cable or strapping materials  more regarding proper installation is on our website the problem or challenge we solve we solve two major problems  the inconvenient nature of transporting kayaks to water loading hauling and unloading a kayak can be a pain  and doing it twice in one day is even worse our kayak condos provides an easy solution visitors to the waterfront can rent or lease a kayak condo to store their kayaks and all their equipment that way they can not only spend more time in the water that day but their incentivized to visit more because of the convenience of it  thousands of kayaks are stolen every year which breaks our hearts we offer a safe and secure way to store kayaks and gear to prevent theft the following is an excerpt from a letter was written by a customer operating substantial kayak rental operations in both boston and washington dc and plans to move into the florida market  in the areas we operate in there is also a high demand for private storage of personal kayaks however the racks we use now are made of wood unsightly and not very secure kayak condos solve this problem we envision working with buddy and his team to provide over  kayak condos for rent in the dc metro area alone we currently have  spots on our wood racks and there is a waiting list its been great to see buddy take his idea from concept to actual execution i was lucky enough to meet buddy over  years ago and give him feedback and see this idea grow thanks michael our solution details selfcontained convenient safe and secure kayak storage modules  think gym lockers for kayaks  kayak condos will also help our initial target customers the site managers who will lease or rent kayak condos will be able to enhance their waterfront locations and drive frequency of visitation  no public waterfront in the world doesnt want more visitor activity – simply because they buy things while they are there  they rent boats buy drinks and refreshments perhaps other merchandise  now they can also rent a kayak condo and keep their kayaks there so as to access and use them more often and buy those aforementioned items more often  all this goes to enhancing waterfront revenue  we are also introducing the concept of paddleparks to our commercial customers offering planning and design services as a solution to help them boost visitation and revenue  these paddleparks are areas dedicated to kayakers  similar to a dog park for dogs and their owners  a comfortable place for kayakers to come to relax enjoy their kayaks and connect with other kayak enthusiasts  the market opportunity our market opportunity is global  we have had inquiries from as far away as australia and as romantic as ireland  this past summer i even received an inquiry from baghdad our competition none – there is no competition for our product anywhere  we need to market aggressively and move as quickly as we can to become the bell cow the first word the leader  in convenient safe and secure kayak storage how we make money details are inherent within our proforma statement we feel we have outlined a very reasonable picture of operating expenses as well as sales predictions  our overhead is practically nil we work out of a home office – a tremendous advantage in the heart of a maine winter  part of how we make money is selling a product that makes the buyer money  the buyer sets rental or lease fees predicated on his location  a kayak condo on a small lake in maine is going to lease for less than a kayak condo on biscayne bay  we only wish we could sell kayak condos commensurate with where they will be rented  but by positioning kayak condos to our core customer as a moneymaking tool well do well  add to that the idea of increasing foot traffic on waterfronts and we have a unique selling proposition to propose and offer longterm plan our goal is to get more people into more kayaks and in the water more – everywhere  eventually wed like to build relationships distributors  our ideal distributor would be a lumber building materials company who would profit from a fair markup on our product the proper installation labor team to install our product and the building materials on which kayak condos must be placed for proper installation and performance  initially we need those commercial public and private venues and perhaps a few resorts to get the product in front of the public to see and experience then we can move to sales to individuals through dealers distributors  return on investment our financial forecast included in the offering is a very conservative estimate of how many kayak condos would be sold in the united states canada and other countries who have expressed an interest in our unique modular storage system   units in our first year  in year  and  in year  is certainly not a farfetched unrealistic goal yet we show a significant profit  income that is not shown in the projections are income derived from designing paddleparks  as we are able to communicate the feasibility and desirability of community paddleparks i would like to get involved in many of these efforts  for example the city of welland ontario is exhibiting interest in developing such a site  i will be visiting them in midseptember for that express purpose  milestones a significant milestone was reached this summer when we engaged a manufacturer in north carolina  because they also manufacture their own proprietary brand of kayaks they get what we are about and share our enthusiasm  another milestone was acquiring a significant customer  the niagara peninsula conservation authority in welland ontario which is essentially a state park they recently purchased and installed  kayak condos on one of their  properties  next spring we anticipate seeing hundreds more kayak condos in ontario with other canadian provinces keeping a close eye on our progress  god bless the canadians within the next few weeks we anticipate another big milestone  a significant order from boating in boston and boating in dc  the parent company of these two entities like the canadians is heavily invested in boat rental operations and resorts nationwide the success of this crowdfunding raise will but us in a significantly better position to seek and secure these types of customers with multiple locations either government or private entities buddy doyle full
