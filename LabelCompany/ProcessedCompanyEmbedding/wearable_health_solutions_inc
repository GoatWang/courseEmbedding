play   friday   am re none post  of   life alert very bad product consumer complaints  reviews for example lifealert customers tell us that the company holds them to the threeyear contract even if the elderly individual dies before the term is up a few recent complaints  httpwwwconsumeraffairscomagelifealerthtml it is very difficult to cancel after my mother died they continued to bill they never told us about returning the equipment when we canceled service we live  miles away and had to get the neighbor to help return equipment they billed us for a supposed pendant that was missing and they are very argumentative on the phone they are not a good company to do business with bad product life alert has an extremely poor performance rating for me its not even worth a  star my mother who lived alone was a life alert customer who never needed their service for any reason a malfunction with their unit caused the local police to arrive one time in the last  years now that my mother lives with me in a different city she has no use for the life alert system when i contacted them to cancel the service i was told that she had to remain a customer for another year and deductions from her bank account would continue whether she uses the unit or not i promptly contacted the bank to have the automatic withdrawals canceled and i was told that life alert would have to grant permission for the deductions to stop life alert is taking advantage of senior citizens after using high pressure tactics to entice unsuspecting seniors to engage their service they then impose unrealistic measures and penalties when an elderly person wants to discontinue their services life alert charges  months worth of service charges as penalty on a population of our senior citizens who have the least amount of resources available to them if they choose to cancel their service in addition i was later told by one of their officers that they require a minimum of  years service in order to terminate their service without penalty this information is not explained upfront or posted online in any of their advertisements i was told over  weeks ago that they would mail a copy of their contract and they have not sent it to date  in addition i was told by one of their customer service representatives that the information about a mandatory  years service or requirement that a person be deceased or enrolled in an approved nursing facility before any termination can take place without penalty is not written in their contract life alert has been fined in excess of  million dollars by the california state consumer protection agency regarding the high pressure sales practices they use on the most vulnerable of our seniors it is my opinion that life alert needs to be fined additionally for this unreasonable pricegouging of seniors if seniors choose to discontinue their service in less than  years further they seem to have power over the seniors bank account as well if the consumer wants to stop automatic online payments to life alert from their bank they are told they would need to contact life alert to get permission to do so if a bank customer can stop payment on a check why cant the customer stop payments on automatic deductions especially when they are not satisfied with the vendors service and no longer needs their service or the equipment which has proven to be faulty ihub
