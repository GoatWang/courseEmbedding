alpha natural resources october      print this page vb tell us a little about yourself  how did you get in the coal business quillen it’s kind of an interesting story  i’ve got a bachelor’s and master’s out of virginia tech and the masters was in engineering but with a concentration in transportation  and i had worked for southern railway at the time which of course now is norfolk southern  but when i got out i went to richmond with the highway department … and my dad who was an insurance agent and another gentleman who was a high school principal and another gentleman who was an electrical contractor decided they were going to get in the coal business and formed a little company  at that time they needed somebody to be the foreman and someone to do the engineering  so they called me up in richmond and offered me  a month this was like in  or ’ and i said “i can live forever in gate city for  a month’”  so i left the highway department and came down and bossed the surface mine during the daytime did the engineering work at night  dad sold out in nine months i’ve been in it   years vb and you’re originally from gate city quillen gate city vb alpha natural resources has grown primarily through acquisitions  is the company still interested in acquiring a stake in whitehaven coal  if so why would this be a strategic buy for alpha  if you can’t comment on that could just talk with us about any other expansions or why you feel like this is the way to go in the future quillen well obviously i can’t talk about any particular opportunity that we might be looking at and in particular that one because i’m also a shareholder in whitehaven … i started that company in australia back in i guess the early ’s when i was running australia operations  but i think it’s a wellknown fact that alpha continues to look at expansion opportunities either through internal growth or through acquisitions  and obviously they’ve got dual interests not only within the united states but also outside the united states  i think they’re going to be more interested in countries that are stable not areas that are volatile or don’t have stable governments  so i think particularly australia canada parts of south america are going to be more attractive when they look off shore … alpha is certainly the size right now that there’s no push or rush to continued growth  i think it’s something they would look at primarily from “is that the right thing for shareholders’ vb how is the merger with foundation coal working out for the company quillen very well  when you put two companies together ones that are that large individually and they’re both approximately the same size you’ve got integration issues  it has gone better i think than anyone anticipated … i think there’s obviously some nervousness maybe on foundation’s side because a majority of the work was moving down here to abington  the mines went together very quickly and very easily  i guess if you ask the accounting and computer departments they would probably still be feeling some stress because that’s one of the more difficult things to do for companies this size  but it has gone very well i think actually the company publicly reported that the synergies  million annually exceeded what was originally forecast  million vb did the company have to let anyone go  did the merger result in any loss of jobs quillen well obviously me  i moved up to chairman  and the ceo of foundation is on our board  but very few  there were a few at the top  most of them changed that could have changed jobs  not many left  … i guess there were about  people in the baltimore office and i think there were  or  of those who were offered positions down here  and most of them accepted that  there still is an office in baltimore and that will be reduced again at the end of this year  i think they’re going to retain a smaller office up there  and then some people chose not to relocate because of spousal situations or whatever vb was it a difficult transition for you to move from ceo to chairman quillen not really … i didn’t step aside immediately  that transaction closed on june th of last year and i stayed on as executive chair for six months and worked with kevin and kurt and the other executives on a daily basis up until the end of the year  i’m not at all bored  i’m still in here two or three days a week  a lot of what i do now has more to do with the regulatorypolitical arena … so i’m certainly not bored at all vb mine safety has been a big issue following the fatal explosion this year at a massey mine  what impact is this having on the industry quillen well certainly it’s impacting the whole industry  it was a tragic event and i guess we’re still looking to see what the final result of the analysis is — if they can determine what happened  but obviously it has brought a spotlight on the industry  it has gotten the politicians more involved who want to solve the problem so that it never happens again which is certainly the industry’s desire  we’re having more inspections  we were already having a lot more inspections after sago and darby and aracoma mining disasters that occurred in  and the other accidents we had two years ago  that has been enhanced now  a lot more violations are being written that before you probably would have worked out in other words if an inspector was there and he pointed something out and you corrected it before he left he might not write that  today they’re under so much pressure that they’re writing just about everything so you’re seeing a lot more numbers come out in terms of violations being written … additional legislation is being considered most of which we’re somewhat concerned about we really don’t oppose legislation that we think is going to enhance safety but some of these things we really are not seeing where the safety side is going to come out of that  an example would be … actually this came out of the financial review act that public companies now are required to report either in their proxy or their k or k filings any violations that they get of a certain degree  that’s already available for all coal companies under the msha mine safety and health administration reporting system  so it’s double reporting  it’s going to require a lot more work that doesn’t change anything at all vb that was already in the works you said with the financial review act  it was not a result of the massey accident quillen well no it came in after massey but it got put in at like  am  we didn’t even know it was in there in fact we asked our senator if he knew it was in there when he voted for it and he didn’t know it was in there vb somebody slipped it in quillen yes we think we know… i think the pattern of violations is another area they’re trying to look at… companies could end up being closed down for things that really aren’t that … you don’t want to say any violation is not significant but some of them are certainly … like paperwork violations those types of things are not dangerous in terms of harming employees   … so many are being written now there’s a lot tied up in administrative court or in the court system  and you hear these politicians complaining a lot about that  but the fact is our statistics — we’re winning  percent of those  so they’re writing violations that once we get into the administrative process are being revoked you don’t put out a report and say they were turned over again  so it’s really consuming a lot of time  and the small operators are struggling with this environment  obviously we’re fortunate enough to have a lot of professional safety people and people that can handle these types of things  but a small operator his safety guy may be his hr guy may be his purchasing agent  they are really struggling in this environment vb what is alpha doing to make mines safer quillen …the advantage of alpha in a lot of things is when we formed the company we had decades of experience in the industry so we wanted to put together a company that that learned from the things we had seen positive in our prior history so we came out with a very strong safety culture when the company was first formed  and we said from day one we would not start any meeting … without talking about safety whether it’s the board of directors whether it’s an earnings call whether it was a mine site visit or whatever  so we feel strongly and we study — we have statistics breaking down every accident the time of the day shift whether the guy worked the day before parts of the body all of these things  but it’s really behavior based  this industry has a long history of regulation and safety analysis … i see all the accident reports and i require them to notify me if there’s a serious accident  when you look at these it’s pretty frustrating when almost all of them are somebody doing something that they knew not to do they’d been trained not to do they had the equipment to do it in the proper way and they still do it  and that’s the thing  we’re seeing significant change  when i first got in the industry in the ‘s it was more of a macho type industry where there were a lot of things done that certainly weren’t right but you didn’t think much about it  i think today coalminers even the coalminers that have a lot of experience their attitude has changed as well  we shouldn’t get in a hurry  we shouldn’t take the shortcut  we shouldn’t do that  so what we’ve implemented it’s a card check thing where we require every mine to turn in on a monthly basis where miners have reviewed other miners positive or negative  now it’s obviously anonymous but if they see somebody doing something that they shouldn’t do they’ll write it up then they’ll have a safety break and talk about what they could do  or somebody is doing positive they’ll write it up  and we have proven now — i guess we’re in our eighth year — that there’s a direct correlation between those observations which is what we call them between those safety observations and that particular mine’s safety performance there are direct correlations  the more observations and the more they’re thinking about that every day the better the safety statistics for that particular mine  so we’re a firm believer that it’s not fines … i have never been influenced don’t even know … how much we pay in fines  that’s not what motivates me for safety you’ve just got to do the right thing  when we have a major accident my motivation i always go to the hospital and meet with the family and the individual  certainly in the case of a fatality you have to meet with the family  those people’s lives are changed forever … a week later you’re back doing your regular job but you understand that accident changed that individual’s life and his family’s life maybe forever — that’s a heck of a responsibility  so it’s not hard to motivate people it was interesting when we first went public and started doing our investor calls on a quarterly basis we always started every call with discussion of safety  and there really wasn’t a lot of interest from the financial people and the analysts on that topic until those accidents three years ago and when that happened then they began to realize that is a topic that maybe investors should be somewhat conscious of … the first couple of years that we did those you could really sense that the people that were on that call were just saying “okay hurry up and get through this” but we never varied from that and of course we still do it today vb if we could go back to the card check that’s an innovative idea quillen card check is probably not the right word we want to use it’s observation cards vb so you’ve implemented this in all of your mines how frequently do they the miners do the observation checks quillen they do it daily vb are they anonymous quillen they are anonymous yes  in other words you don’t want to finger point at somebody what we’ve found out  as we’ve made acquisitions is there’s certainly a learning curve even with foundation i think there was a learning curve to get people to have confidence that it wasn’t some way to get somebody in trouble or build a record to fire someone or take disciplinary action  so you’ve got to walk the walk  you can’t just put that out there  and our safety group has done an excellent job of follow up  and people have seen that there’s positive reaction to these types of things  … i saw one friday where if we have a near miss at any operation then that safety professional will write up that near miss and say “this is what could have happened” or even if we have an accident he’ll write up what happened and send that throughout the company for everyone so it’s like any other thing  communication is such a key  let’s openly talk about it  the observation card like the first companies we bought they’re so used to it it’s just routine  the newer companies it takes them a little bit longer to have confidence that you’re not doing something that is in some way a detriment to them vb can you give us an example  did anything ever surface as sort of an early warning as a result of the observation card where you implemented a change quillen oh well again it’s people doing things they know not to do … like somebody getting in a hurry and not putting support under something that may end up falling on them  my pet peeve … somebody cuts themselves with a knife  of course in the mines you’ve got cables you’ve got to do  and it’s very simple — cut away from yourself  but it’s so frustrating after we’ve known this for decades in fact they’ve got a poster out there “we’re going to have to tell mike if you cut yourself with a knife”  but they get in a hurry and they cut and next thing you know they’ve cut themselves obviously publicity wise the major accidents get it  but when you look at statistics it’s the smaller repetitive stuff where someone got in a hurry and didn’t use a safety situation  electrical people have really learned that  used to i’m thinking back decades ago people would try to take a short cut and not lock out something  those they don’t do anymore  but it’s trips and falls standing up on a bucket instead of going to get something more stable  same things you do around your house a lot of times  and the other thing the workforce is older  they’ve got to realize which i certainly do you’re not as limber as you were when you were in your s  so we have some sprains back injuries things people have to watch and get somebody to help them lift it rather than trying to lift something vb before we leave safety there is one other thing we wanted to ask about  right after the massey mine disaster the government had a blitz of inspections  and they did check some of your mines  there were two alpha mines on a list of  and there were some citations  was that all taken care of  i kind of get the sense that what you’re saying the nature of the beast  is people are going underground every day and there’s a lot of room for things to happen  it’s a dangerous profession quillen let me answer the second part first  what a lot of people don’t understand … is if you don’t fix it you don’t go back to work  it’s not like they write something and you just decide not to fix it and get fined you have to fix it  it’s not an option of whether you fix it  and they give you a time period depending on what the violation is  they say it has to be closed by business today or the start of business tomorrow or if it’s something else it may be three days  but you have to fix it  and if you don’t fix it then it becomes a real issue where you can get shut down  vb the mines we’re referring to are cumberland and emerald mines quillen that’s our two longwall mines  ubb upper big branch the massey mine in west virginia where  miners died last april was a longwall mine …  i don’t know whether they went to all the longwall mines because there are not that many of them left  really but those two were different than our other mines vb  i don’t know what a longwall mine is quillen it’s an underground mine  underground you have two types of mines  a continuous mine where you basically go in  feet then you pull back out and go in and roof and bolt that  a longwall mine has these large structural things … and you’re under them all the time mining you take the coal out and just let the roof fall behind you and you keep moving forward that was what upper big branch … the accident was on the long wall  so we presume that the reason those two mines were there is because they were large longwall mines like upper big branch there was nothing statistically that would have said those mines would have been selected vb so you didn’t have to go in and make fixes as a result of the investigation quillen no vb you’re building a new headquarters in bristol and this is going to be a green headquarters  why did you decide to move from abington to bristol quillen when we built this building back four years ago we thought we had  percent extra capacity  but we’ve continued to grow now including this office we have four other offices rented in abington today  and we’ve still got people to move down from baltimore  so we need more space … we looked at this space to add on to this building but there is a rock quarry directly across the interstate  we’re sitting on some of the hardest rock … we did the cost — actually we did geothermal drilling here — and looked at some things but it wasn’t practical to expand on this side  we looked at possibly trying to buy the site across the street from us and have a campus type thing but that lot wasn’t available  so we had to start looking outside the other thing that a lot of people don’t understand was half of our board of directors are from foundation not half but i guess four out of ten are from the foundation side  we had to look at where it was the most economical for our shareholders to put the corporate headquarters and where it was the most efficient  there was certainly interest out of maryland to come there and they looked at incentives  tennessee was very aggressive … if you did a survey in this building probably  to  percent would have voted for tennessee because tennessee doesn’t have income tax  so even though they live in tennessee when they work here they have to pay virginia income tax  so there was certainly some motivation to look at tennessee  and it basically came down to where it made sense from an operational standpoint  there is a lot of coal talent administratively around here because this has basically been a coal area for   years then the state of virginia did put a package forward that made the business decision that from our shareholders’ point of view this was the right place to be  and that it was home … certainly wasn’t a negative when we first formed alpha in  there was tremendous pressure on us by our original investment group to not put the corporate headquarters of a public company in southwest virginia  new york pittsburg even richmond they thought this was not the right place to be  we won that debate primarily because we wanted to be close to the operations  … we knew there was a lot of talent around here  and the cost of living is great  we don’t have any trouble recruiting here  actually when we get somebody to move from an urban area here with a family they love it  so we weren’t at all concerned about that … there are only two publiclylisted companies in southwest virginia it’s us and advance auto in roanoke … the cost of living is so economical for the quality of life down here  i’ve been here all my life in and out and i’ve always come back so i’m prejudiced it’s a great area vb let’s go back to the aging of the workforce … can you tell us what alpha is doing with its worker retention program  a couple of years ago you offered workers stock and there were other incentives to keep people on quillen  the thing that i think — particularly the national media misses — i compliment our local media because i think they certainly understand  but it’s irritating to me when i see particularly when we have an accident the media portraying that coalminers only do this because they have to  if they could get out of it they would or they can’t do anything else  that’s totally erroneous because this industry is very much like being in the military or being on a sports team  there is so much camaraderie depending on each other you just if you’re in it a year you’re probably in it   very few people leave this industry … obviously it’s not for everybody particularly if you’re claustrophobic  … it’s something that not everybody is going to do so there’s a little bit of machoism in it maybe that you recognize you’re doing something that everybody is not going to do it’s not a physical labor job anymore everything is mechanized  we tell the prospective candidates that we’re recruiting now if you don’t have a high school education you’re not going to make it as a coalminer today because it’s so technical with ventilation and electrical and all the things they have to have knowledge in — it’s not just a strong back like it would have been back in the ‘s and ‘s  with that being said the industry is struggling right now with getting young people … most of our hires are legacy  in other words their family was somehow involved in coal mining whether their father or their grandfather their uncle or they were a contractor or somebody was selling services most of them are that  we have not been able to yet really have a strong acceptance of just a young person — and we’re obviously not going to be discriminatory — but from a new hire that has no affiliation with this coming into this industry because almost all of the publicity we get is either something negative environmentally or something negative about safety we were making progress as an industry talking about the benefits of being in the industry  and then upper big branch happened so that’s a set back … we had just gotten through i guess a couple of years of trying to get past sago and aracoma  and we were having the best recruiting that we’ve had … we’ve had a lot of success with military people because one a yearold out of the military is more mature than a yearold from anywhere else … and they understand safety  they understand teamwork  they don’t mind getting dirty  actually we’ve got a program  it’s kind of a funny story … we’ve got a lot of young people working in our recruiting and they said “we need you to come and talk to a group of millennials”  and i said “well that’s great but you’re going to have to tell me what one is because i didn’t know what it was”  they said “oh that’s the new generation coming on”  so certainly not my age group but we’ve got facebook and twitter accounts and blogs and all these new communications tools that the current generation is more understanding of  but when we look at i mean our interns … how many interns did we have this year  close to  wasn’t it particularly the engineering side it’s like recruiting an athlete right now  we work hard to try to get a new hire  it doesn’t necessarily have to be a mining engineer  it could be an electrical engineer mechanical engineer  that’s a very competitive environment right now  we work them sometimes two and three summers before we actually offer them a job when they graduate  and you’re down here taking them to dinner and doing a lot of things that you just didn’t used to do what happened in the industry — because this industry kind of was stagnant from the early ‘s until about — this industry really didn’t grow in terms of people  productivity picked up a lot of mines smaller mines consolidated into bigger mines  so there was a lot of opportunity we probably lost a generation of coalminers  so now we’ve got a lot of people who are in their s and s that are going to be moving out of the industry … there is going to be a real opportunity … to move into upper management if they’ve got the skill set because the openings are going to be there in the next  years  there is going to be a huge turnover in this industry in the next  years  i think when we first did the consolidation of the three companies with alpha we were running close to a yearold average workforce  it’s lower than that now but when we made the acquisitions with the first three companies i think it was  or  which is pretty old for this industry as you start trying to work in particularly underground conditions vb what is the average or a typical salary for a coalminer with alpha quillen it varies a little bit between states and type of mining — whether it’s surface mining or underground the number we use is around  to  the figure is  in the virginia counties of buchanan dickenson russell and wise  now that includes a little bit of benefits but after about a year most of them are making in that range  we have a lot of people who are hourly that make  to  that work overtime  the industry right now we are down a little bit on overtime  normally you would work five days a week and every other saturday  if times are good you work that other saturday if it wasn’t you backed off some  but in this economy rather than have layoffs we’ve cut back working hours a little bit … in some states we’re up as much as three times the average salary the mining industry is  that’s obviously in these areas very good income  … i don’t want to get on the stump about this but i do get irritated to have coalminers portrayed … these people are your sunday school teachers your little league coaches  they’re living in nice brick homes  their kids are going to college  they’re up there with any type of occupation out there  … i can remember when walmart first came down here this was years ago i was working in economic development on a committee  and it said “why do you want to come here”  they walmart said “you guys have more disposable income than most urban areas” vb we talked about your new green corporate headquarters  can you tell us about some of alpha’s other major environmental initiatives how is your department of sustainability going  quillen on the building we learned a lot  it was interesting and we do a lot of those things whether it’s wind or solar or biomass we try to get involved in those because not only are we interested in diversifying if it’s right for the shareholders but it’s also educational  when we got into these green buildings we learned the different categories of green building  we also learned we are never going to get platinum because we don’t have mass transit here … we also did a lot of work with the architect about the different costs  you hear a lot of numbers but we know particularly in this building what it costs to move from each level so we learned a lot on sustainability we’ve been working on that … we were doing this before sustainability became a catch word  for the last five or six years we’ve had a group of individuals very intelligent individuals that basically are not coal background type of people – mbas and that type people – that we have looking at alternative investments for the company looking particularly at energyrelated alternative investments  and again they’ve worked on about everything you can think of … i don’t know how many projects come through here a week but it’s several a week … most don’t make the check list criteria on something we’re going to spend a lot of time investigating  right now i think we’ve got about a dozen projects half of which are potentially favorable half are questionably favorable that they’re continuing to look at …  … we’re not naïve as to how carbonbased fuels are being looked at by certain segments of society and where are we going to be in  or  years  we obviously want to have an alpha down the road and how that alpha looks we’ve got to be intelligent of what the future holds for us coal research is something we’re very interested in whether it’s carbon capturing storage or whether it’s coal to liquids or coal to gasification because that’s our primary business  but we’re involved in a lot of other things too …  we have an rd group  we invest with virginia tech and other universities on research which is maybe more speculative than what this group is looking at from a purely business standpoint  what we find is it’s very difficult to find a renewable energy project that’s going to pay back your costs to capital … there are very few projects today that we’ve seen that really can meet the criteria that we could take to shareholders and say “this is a good investment opportunity”  we’ve learned a tremendous amount  the sustainability group they’re looking at a lot of things  they certainly are involved in the regulatory side  but we certainly haven’t found any homerun yet in terms of what else to do … vb coal ash has become a hotbutton environmental issue with the epa is considering tougher regulations  how does alpha dispose of ash  do you favor state versus federal regulation quillen coal ash is a utilities issue  we have refuse we deal with but it’s not the same thing  coal ash is a result of burning  if you’ve ever burnt coal you’ve got ash  the thing that gets everyone’s attention — whether it’s the dirt right out here in the front yard or whatever — it’s going to have heavy metals in it  that’s a fact of life that you’ve got arsenic and heavy metals … when you’re talking to the public and you mention arsenic they don’t want any of it the issue that brought this to the forefront of course was the dam collapse down at tva tennessee valley authority the standards on the dams that we have around our mine sites are significantly more stringent than what the utility is required to do  under the mining law our dams have to be inspected on a monthly basis have to be certified by a professional engineer on a quarterly basis have to have a safety factor  ½ times  so if that dam had been to our standards that dam would not have failed  so people get confused a little bit over that  that wasn’t a coal industry issue  if you ask the average citizen they didn’t really see it that way because of the way it was written but those dams were a separate issue  and it’s going to have an impact a lot of that fly ash goes into … wallboard … and there’s not enough wallboard demand to use all of it so it gets deposited  and it’s kind of interesting that epa has decided that if it’s used for productive use it’s not environmentally a problem but if it’s not it is  well you’re going to tell a mother that if you’re going to put that on a wall in her nursery it’s ok but you can’t put it in a landfill and dispose of it properly so there are a lot of semantics in that but it’s a major issue to the utilities  i think the end result … it comes down to the proper analysis and look at the numbers  now i think the standards on how they dispose of it have got to be brought up some  and there will be an increased cost to do that  but our industry adopted that when the federal surface mining law came in ’ ’ we went under new standards and we know how to do it now so it’s not new technology that’s going to solve this problem  that should not be a problem vb getting back to what you were saying about coal capture and clean coal technology do you see that as the future of coal  or is it just too much pie in the sky quillen no i don’t think it’s pie in the sky at all … technologically capturing it there’s an economic issue and i think it can be commercialized very easily  transportation is not going to be an issue in terms of technology because you put it in a pipeline just like you would natural gas  there’s obviously a cost issue there storage the issue is going to be again not the technology of it … there are certain geological formations that absorb co like a sponge  now it’s hard for the average person to recognize how you are going to put this gas down in a rock and it’s going to absorb it  but we know geologic formations actually attract it and will release other gases to hold that  so saline aquifers and some of these other coal seams will do it  so technically we know what will do it and we know it will hold it the thing our industry has to do is we have to prove … that it’s not escaping  because when you hear people that complain about this say “well we understand it will hold  but what if there was an earthquake that released all this co at the same time”  well that wouldn’t be good  but if you have an earthquake that’s probably not going to be a good event either  technologically that’s not i think the issue  the issue is certainly economics versus what other alternatives are available whether that be nuclear renewables … but the real issue i think is political  the real issue is … and we as an industry push this on the state level and on the national level — that there needs to be legislation if you have a sequestration site you do it and document that you’ve done it by the engineering standards you’ve met whatever standards or you exceeded whatever standards are set there so that after a certain period of time you are somewhat related to that liability because it’s very difficult on any company to have liability for infinity for something they don’t know what’s going to happen  illinois … they actually passed legislation and texas i think has some now where after a certain period of time the state assumes that liability  we all know human nature  if you put something down in the ground that somebody is breathing every day —  we’re putting it out in this room right now — but in a litigious society you’re going to have headaches you’re going to have a potential increase of cancer allegations  you’re going to have lawsuits  that’s just the nature of about anything today  so i think that part of it is going to be the most difficult to get resolved …  because if you’re going to borrow a billion dollars to put a facility in like this and you’re financing that the banks or the finance institutions want to know something about where that liability is going to go there is some welldrafted legislation in some states now  it certainly was proposed in some of the federal legislation that was looked at  but i think that has got to be resolved to really make this practical down the road …  i’m not sure how we’re going to solve climate change but it will be through technology  it won’t be through politics vb but you think it’s doable it’s just a matter of time of how far out maybe  years before it will be commercially viable quillen yes  we even participate in a well just over here in tazewell county and actually the absorption rate was better than what we anticipated virginia tech did the study technologically i think the other issue is that where the current coalfired power plants are today a lot of them are in regions that don’t have the geology conducive to sequestration  again you have to have specific geology to absorb it  long pipelines to geologic areas are probably not that practical … i think most new coalfired plants are going to be built in areas where sequestration is a logical approach within a reasonable vicinity vb would that be applicable to the new wise county plant quillen yes the work has been done  actually we know the route for a pipeline to go to actually sequester it … the test well that’s down today has proven out very well that it will absorb now again what you need to make a specific case … is to make sure that the co is going to stay in the formation  and of course it’s put down very deep vb that leads us to the next question  with growing pressure to cut greenhouse gases and legislation being considered that would require the us to get  percent of its energy from renewable sources what sort of effect would that have on the coal industry quillen i served on the governor’s climate change commission and was on the governor’s energy policy commission before that  people can take statistics and massage them to a degree that can prove any story  so the issue that makes this very confusing is certain people make an assumption of much our electricity consumption or generation is going to grow annually  and it has been running at about  percent a little less than  percent  the current projections are that’s going to run — depending on whose study you’re looking at — half a percent to maybe  percent  but assuming that energy consumption still grows then you’ll hear people say “well coal is not going to be harmed”  but if you take a flat case which is what we’ve had the last two years where we haven’t had additional energy generation then if you put a  percent renewable standard out there then that’s probably going to come from coal which would be very detrimental if you looked at it today the only other place it would probably come would be out of natural gas  with the new discoveries in natural gas the current price of natural gas i would think the logical business decision the utility would make is they’re going to take it away from the coal fire  …when we looked at it in the governor’s commission it became very apparent that even though several states around the country have standards none of them are really making it per se  the math gets really funny  nobody is really in my mind making  percent  we looked at in virginia because of our geography we don’t have the wind or the solar seasons to make that a viable opportunity particularly if you exclude offshore wind how we’re going to make  percent in virginia  we really weren’t sure how we were going to do that  and of course i think nuclear needs to be a big part of this country’s energy future  nuclear which doesn’t generate any co doesn’t count towards the  percent there are probably not going to be any more hydro dams built  so we’re limited in where we’re going to get that  percent now there’s some math in there that thinks conservation may get half of that but it’s not going to be as easy as people think … i think everybody’s power bill is going up regardless of what we do … i just don’t see any other way  we know all the numbers between cost of solar — even with subsidies — cost of solar cost of biomass cost of wind  they’re certainly not competitive with coal and natural gas today vb it seems that has always been the ace in the hole for coal — that it is plentiful in america and affordable  business people say that to recruit business you have to have affordable electricity  going forward — and i know alpha is a major supplier to the country’s utilities — do you feel that’s going to help coal stay in the game quillen oh yes  it’s not going to go  i think it’s a magnitude issue … we’ve done a significant number of studies and analyses of the different scenarios even the different legislative acts that have been proposed of what that would do  in none of them does coal go away  that’s just not going to happen in our lifetime  in our rotary club speech we have a very telling chart of every state in the country — of their percentage of electricity generated by coal and their cost per kilowatt  there’s obviously a direct correlation to that  and then we also relate that to economic activity in the last  years when you look at the states that have done well it’s because of low energy  you get an argument sometimes about a rightto workstate but when you really break it down it’s cost  tennessee and kentucky both have done extremely well because their cost of electricity is half of some of the northeast states and california for example  so certainly a direct correlation to economic activity and coal fire generation really i don’t think anybody can argue that the statistics are just too clear  kentucky has got what  percent of the aluminum production in the country now  they’re about  cents a kilowatt  they got the last two major automobile manufacturing plants because of cost  if you want to talk about the impact and i served on the committee with northrop grumman you go down and talk to the shipyard in newport news and ask them what  cent a kilowatt would do to them  it was staggering to me how big an impact that had on them in dollars and cents  it’s a huge factor …we certainly talk to our employees about this  the industry is not going to go away  now you can debate whether there is going to be  percent generation  years from now … i guess the engineer in me is thinking “i don’t know whether it’s going to be carbon capturing sequestration  it could very well be algae” there are so many things that could change the game in this we just don’t know  but we do know we have abundant resources of coal in this country and smart minds will figure out how we continue to use it if we’re ever going to have any energy security  so i have some faith in where this is going to go vb where are your biggest growth markets right now quillen china and india  the math is just staggering  we’ve got  million people in america and you’ve got  billion in china  billion in india india is going to eventually pass china because of the onebaby rule  but we look at energy consumption per capita … you might not totally agree with it but when we look at industrial revolutions around the last  years we certainly saw it in europe coal fired  we saw it in the united states coal fired  we saw it in japan and korea coal fired  we’re now seeing it in the growth areas of china and india it’s coal fired because it’s available and it’s economic  and those guys are not going to cut back to make us happy  i don’t think that’s going to happen the quality of life — when you look at the things they have — whether it’s automobiles per capita electricity per capita washing machines per capita they want their standard of living to go up  when you look at them doing that times their numbers you can make a case which we’ve done that … that there’s not enough natural resources on the globe to handle that  they’re not going to get anywhere near where the united states is any time soon but they’re going to continue to improve their standard of living and rightfully so  it’s kind of interesting to me … i can get a lot of attention in a rotary club or any kind of audience speech when i say “look we don’t have a global warming problem we’ve got a people problem”  and people say “what’s that”  well we’ve got  to  billion people on this earth  if we continue to grow we’re putting more and more demands on this place from a human side … it’s going to be hard  i know we looked at some of the numbers and i guess we’ve got to go back to the energy consumption and co production when william taft was president to get down to the level that was in the kerrylieberman deal an energy bill they cosponsored americans aren’t very good at that  we’re not very conservative … economics will force it … vb what portion of your sales is going to china and india now quillen not a significant amount  we’re the largest exporter out of the united states in coal the largest producer of metallurgical all of the export we’re doing right now is metallurgical coal which goes to the production of steel  our traditional customers primarily because of logistics are europe and south america however we have seen a significant increase in activity going … to korea and japan depending on what australia is doing  today because of demands in the pacific basin you’re seeing us coal going in increasing numbers to particularly china and it’s coming up in india  but percentage wise that’s not big versus our current markets  but growth wise it’s almost all the growth  when you look at the statistics we basically look at the us and europe being flat to marginally increasing in terms of steel production for the next few years but significant growth particularly in china vb what is the biggest challenge in terms of being the chairman of one of america’s largest coal companies today  quillen there’s so much pressure and attention on anybody in the top four or five executive positions in a public company today  what i’ve found certainly when i was the ceo was that i was spending up to half of my time doing things that certainly weren’t bottom line dollar exercises … i’ll use sarbanes oxley as an example  we’re sarbanes oxley compliant i think we spent the first year we had to achieve that we spent over  million external to the company  sarbanes oxley did a couple of things  it brought all of our different operations into the same standards  it made you go through and look at the process but i don’t feel like sarbanes oxley is going to make somebody more honest or less honest  i think people are basically intrinsically they’re honest or they’re not honest  we spend a lot of time from the legislativeregulatory arena doing things that somebody else caused whether it was enron or whether it was a coal accident … and now i think the thing — not only as chairman but also on anybody that’s on the board of a public company —  it’s just not a good–oldboy network anymore  you have significant serious fiduciary responsibility whether it’s risk management whether it’s sustainability whether it’s compensation  i’m also on the board of martin marietta … and i was on that even when i was ceo  and the interesting thing from being a ceo and a chairman is to sit on another public board as just a board member and see it from that perspective  it took some time but it also was a learning experience …  but my role and i take it seriously it is different  kevin is the ceo and it’s his job to run the daily operations  mine is to be involved on the strategic side have the oversight role and to do those types of things whether it’s the audit function or the compensation function  we were one of the first companies to have a safety and health and environment committee of the board  and to challenge management on anything that comes up to our level has to be looked at seriously … when we formed this board what we did we went out and attracted people that were highlevel people in the industries we dealt with  one of our first board members was lynn draper who is the exceo of aep  we went out and got an individual from the railroad  we went out and got a manufacturing person cfo from a manufacturing company and steel … we wanted people that actually had experience in our constituents we’re got a good board   … you’ve got to keep everyone engaged  they have some strong personalities vb what do you do when you’re not working here  quillen i’m very active in a lot of things  i’m on the board of visitors at virginia tech  i’m on the virginia port authority which again is a learning process  i’m on the virginia coal economic development authority which i’ve been on for some years … i’m on the virginia coal and energy commission and the governor’s job commission  so i do a lot of different things that are somewhat related  the way i look at it any of those things i do …  that may have some input into bringing prosperity back here and particularly to coal miners is what i spend my spare time doing  i’ve got  grandchildren so i’ve got a football game to go to tonight a football game to go to tomorrow night  i don’t lack for anything to do i don’t have a whole lot of hobbies i play golf occasionally and certainly like college football  but most of it i’m either doing something with the family or some more appointments … i think all those things are important to bringing something back to southwest virginia because everything i have and a lot of what my kids have came from these guys right here vb thank you we appreciate you taking the time to talk with us quillen i appreciate your interest  our industry has to do more … to get our message out  we have a problem  i know there are too many engineers in this industry but when we have an issue we’ve got to give like a minute technical explanation where somebody says you’re destroying the environment or you’re polluting the stream those are pretty dramatic words we don’t have elevator speeches but we’ve got to do better about getting out and explaining nonemotionally all of these things that we deal with our safety record in the industry is a perfect example we’re producing more coal than we’ve ever produced  the safety record statistically continues to improve almost every year  obviously we had a blip this year in terms of fatalities but last year we had the lowest number of fatalities ever it was  depending on whose numbers you want to count  if you ask the average person out here on the street how many fatalities you thought the coal mining industry had in america in  i guarantee you they wouldn’t say  rick nida manager external communication corporate alpha natural resources last year if you look at incident rates which are the way you look across industries coal mining fell between being a bank teller and being a retail clerk quillen  … take the gulf situation when we have a mining accident … it’s just on and on and on  … but the fatalities they had on that platform haven’t gotten nearly the exposure  in fact the day that upper big branch happened i think a skating rink fell over in europe with like  people killed  that was in the news one day we’ve asked professionals what is it about our industry that we stay in the news on this negative end  they say it’s the shark theory  and we say help me out here “what’s the shark theory”  basically if there’s a shark attack anywhere in the world you read about it because people are fascinated with it and their explanation is our industry has that fascination to people who don’t know anything about it — that they continue to ask why you actually would go under a mountain and start taking something out over the top of your head and why would you work in that environment so it’s just something we have to accept but if it’s going to be that way then we’ve got to be communicative  we have issues  we have to deal with them whether it’s environmental or safety  but we also have a lot of positives and the biggest positive we’ve got is our people vb one question about surface mining would the chances of major fatalities in that be much lower than underground mining quillen well if you go back over some period of time they were lower because underground was more dangerous  but i think because of the improvement in underground they’re not that far apart right now this year the biggest problem we’ve had on surface mining is big machines running over little machines  again something that’s in a pickup truck doesn’t need to get close to a ton hauler  but they continue to do it  so obviously it is safer no question it used to be much bigger than it is now but i think it’s because underground has improved significantly … of course the interesting thing we’re finally getting people to say surface mining instead of strip mining  we did learn that probably wasn’t the right connotation vb do you think all the publicity about strip mining and blowing off the tops of mountains and the visuals that puts in peoples’ minds has something to do with the way people respond quillen it does  we see actors and singers getting involved in this mountain top mining issue  and really i don’t mind at all and certainly appreciate somebody that has a viewpoint that they just don’t want to see a mountain — trees knocked down and explosives go off and take something out we firmly believe and have a lot of physical evidence that we can show people that we can put these mountains back  we’re doing it every day  in fact we have a helicopter tour that we take politicians and nature conservancy a lot of people on and we show them about six mountains out here three of which have been mined and three haven’t and they cannot tell the difference  … to say that we’re destroying communities and destroying streams that’s really not what’s happening we’ve won a national award for building a manmade stream … and we’ve won the national reclamation award  we can do these things  it’s not going to be overnight  but my theory is we can keep the economic activity going in a region can provide a lot of very highpaying jobs and we can do it environmentally right and we’re not destroying anybody mountain top mining — the thing that people don’t understand is —  mountain top mining if it’s a true mountain top mining site where we put it back for example level we have to have a permit that says we’re putting it back to a higher and better standard … their definition to people who oppose it is mountain top mining is anything that has excess spoil that goes in what we call a hollow and their definition of a stream is anything that feeds a stream  there’s actually an ad out there that shows a mine somewhere dumping into a trout stream  i guarantee you that never happens you go to jail if that happens  and if you do it you can’t ever mine again in america  if you forfeit a bond you lose that right to ever mine it again so those things are not going on but that’s the perception when people hear that we’re burying streams … that’s not what’s going on  but they have better sound bytes than we do … technically things have gotten much better than they’ve ever been  what you never hear in the mountain top mining argument is basically the guy that owns that land complaining  that’s missed by all the media … if this is so bad why is the guy letting them do it  they want us to leave it more level than it is because even as we’re putting it back into timber they can harvest it and get so much more productivity off of it  you’re not going to hear somebody that’s letting you mine it say “oh they’re just destroying it” because it goes back more productive but we
