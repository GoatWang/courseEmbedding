pressreleasesfranklyinccomsource avant diagnostics incgaithersburg maryland july   prnewswire two thirds of all breast cancer bc tumors are estrogen receptor positive erer bc patients have mixed responses to endocrine therapyresearch demonstrates mtor pathway activation status prospectively predicts endocrine therapy treatment responseavant diagnostics inc avant otc avdx an oncologyfocused healthcare technology company commercializing the proprietary theralink® phosphoprotein biomarker platform across multiple cancers today highlighted independent published literature that provides critical validation for the clinical utility of the companys proprietary theralink® mtor phosphoprotein assay in segmenting the estrogen receptor positive er breast cancer bc population by mtor activation status the data published in multiple journals by leading independent research groups demonstrates that er bc patients whose tumors had highly activated mtor pathway who were treated with antiendocrine therapy such as tamoxifen® are likely to exhibit treatment resistance whereas patients whose tumors had low levels of mtor pathway activation are likely to respond to treatment taken together the data provides a compelling case for physicians treating er bc patients to seekout mtor pathway activation status prior to initiating er hormone therapythe body of evidence regarding endocrine therapy treatment outcomes for er breast cancer patients based upon mtor pathway activation status as measured by activation of specific mtor kinase substrates is compelling said emanuel petricoin phd codirector of the center for applied proteomics and molecular medicine capmm at george mason university the data provides a strong rationale for physicians to seekout mtor pathway activation status as measured by protein phosphorylation of specific mtor kinase substrates as part of the standard biomarker profiling paradigm in this patient population the mtor pathway activation assay licensed to avant by george mason university is patent protected and provides a significant barrier to entry so that avant can commercialize this technology with the appropriate strategic plan under newlyappointed president  ceo dr philippe goixs leadershipavant has developed an analytically and clinically validated mtorpathway activationfocused assay that measures the activation state of specific mtor protein kinases such as ps and ebp that indicate mtor pathway activation and endocrine resistance in the er bc patient population the companys mtor pathway activation assay is protected by the issued us patent  that describes predicting a response to chemotherapy based upon the assay the company is evaluating strategic options for commercially launching the assaythis data provides further evidence that we as a medical community can push precision medicine to higher levels said brian harvey former director of the division of gastroenterology products at the center for drug evaluation research at the fda testing that optimizes treatment for each individual patient is the ultimate clinical goalmtor prognostic data for tamoxifen response in er breast cancer from five publications karlsson et al breast cancer research  rthe mtor effectors ebp and sk are frequently coexpressed and associated with a poor prognosis and endocrine resistance in breast cancer a retrospective study including patients from the randomized stockholm tamoxifen trials  elin karlsson gizeh péreztenorio risul amin josefine bostner lambert skoog tommy fornander dennis c sgroi bo nordenskjöld annalotta hallbeck and olle stålabstract introduction mtor and its downstream effectors the ebinding protein  ebp and the p ribosomal s kinases sk and sk are frequently upregulated in breast cancer and assumed to be driving forces in tumourigenesis in close connection with estrogen receptor er networks here we investigated these factors as clinical markers in five different cohorts of breast cancer patientsmethods the prognostic significance of ebp sk and sk mrna expression was assessed with realtime pcr in  tumours from the treatment randomized stockholm trials encompassing postmenopausal patients enrolled between  and  three publicly available breast cancer cohorts were used to confirm the results furthermore the predictive values of ebp and pebps protein expression for both prognosis and endocrine treatment benefit were assessed by immunohistochemical analysis of  nodenegative breast cancers from the stockholm trialsresults sk and ebp mrna expression levels showed significant correlation and were associated with a poor outcome in all cohorts investigated ebp protein was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor especially in progesterone receptor pgrexpressing cancers ebp protein expression was also associated with a poor response to endocrine treatment in the erpgr positive group crosstalk to genomic as well as nongenomic erpgr signaling may be involved and the results further support a combination of er and mtor signaling targeted therapiesconclusion this study suggests sk and ebp as important factors for breast tumourigenesis interplaying with hormone receptor signaling we propose sk and ebp as new potential clinical markers for prognosis and endocrine therapy response in breast cancer  beelen et al breast cancer research  rphosphorylated psk predicts tamoxifen resistance in postmenopausal breast cancer patients randomized between adjuvant tamoxifen versus no systemic treatment  karin beelen mark opdam tesa m severson rutger ht koornstra andrew d vincent jelle wesseling jettie j muris els mjj berns jan b vermorken paul j van diest and sabine c linnabstract  introduction activation of the phosphatidylinositolkinase pik andor mitogenactivated protein kinase mapk pathways results in antiestrogen resistance in vitro but a biomarker with clinical validity to predict intrinsic resistance has not been identified in metastatic breast cancer patients with previous exposure to endocrine therapy the addition of a mammalian target of rapamycin mtor inhibitor has been shown to be beneficial whether or not patients on adjuvant endocrine treatment might benefit from these drugs is currently unclear a biomarker that predicts intrinsic resistance could potentially be used as companion diagnostic in this setting we tested the clinical validity of different downstreamactivated proteins in the pik andor mapk pathways to predict intrinsic tamoxifen resistance in postmenopausal primary breast cancer patientsmethods we recollected primary tumor tissue from patients who participated in a randomized trial of adjuvant tamoxifen  years versus observation after constructing a tissue microarray cores from  estrogen receptor a positive were immunostained for paktthr paktser pmtor ppsk and perk cox proportional hazard models for recurrence free interval were used to assess hazard ratios and interactions between these markers and tamoxifen treatment efficacyresults interactions were identified between tamoxifen and paktthr pmtor ppsk and perk applying a conservative level of significance ppsk remained significantly associated with tamoxifen resistance patients with ppsk negative tumors derived significant benefit from tamoxifen hr  p while patients whose tumor did express ppsk did not hr p  p for interaction  in systemically untreated breast cancer patients ppsk was associated with a decreased risk for recurrence conclusions patients whose tumor expresses ppsk as a marker of downstream pik andor mapk pathway activation have a favorable prognosis but do not benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen a potential benefit from inhibitors of the pikaktmtor pathway in these patients needs to be further explored  jordan et al breast cancer research  rimpact of dual mtorc mtor kinase inhibitor azd on acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer in vitro  nicola j jordan carol m dutkowski denise barrow huw j mottram iain r hutcheson robert i nicholson sylvie m guichard and julia mw geeabstract  introduction upregulation of pikaktmtor signaling in endocrineresistant breast cancer bc has identified mtor as an attractive target alongside antihormones to control resistance rad everolimusafinitor® an allosteric mtor inhibitor is proving valuable in this setting however some patients are inherently refractory or relapse during treatment requiring alternative strategies here we evaluate the potential for novel dual mtorc mtor kinase inhibitors exemplified by azd by comparison with rad in er endocrine resistant bc cellsmethods in vitro models of tamoxifen tamr or estrogen deprivation resistance mcfx were treated with rad or azd alone or combined with antihormone fulvestrant endpoints included growth cell proliferation ki viability and migration with pikaktmtor signaling impact monitored by western blotting potential er crosstalk was investigated by immunocytochemistry and rtpcrresults rad was a poor growth inhibitor of mcfderived tamer and mcfx cells ic  µm rapidly inhibiting mtorc but not mtorcakt signaling in contrast azd which rapidly inhibited both mtorc and mtorcakt activity was a highly effective p growth inhibitor of tamr ic nm and mcfx ic  nm and of a further tdderived tamoxifen resistant model tdtamr ic  nm azd significantly p inhibited resistant cell proliferation increased cell death and reduced migration furthermore dual treatment of tamr or mcfx cells with azd plus fulvestrant provided superior control of resistant growth versus either agent alone p cotreating with azd alongside tamoxifen p or estrogen deprivation p also effectively inhibited endocrine responsive mcf cells although azd inhibited estrogen receptor er ser phosphorylation in tamr and mcfx it had no effect on er ser activity or expression of several erregulated genes suggesting the mtor kinase inhibitor impact was largely erindependent the capacity of azd for erindependent activity was further evidenced by growth inhibition ic and  nm of two acquired fulvestrant resistant models lacking er conclusions this is the first report demonstrating dual mtorc mtor kinase inhibitors have potential to control acquired endocrine resistant bc even under conditions where everolimus fails such inhibitors may prove of particular benefit when used alongside antihormonal treatment as secondline therapy in endocrine resistant disease and also potentially alongside antihormones during the earlier endocrine responsive phase to hinder development of resistance  breast cancer res treat  activation of akt mtor and the estrogen receptor as a signature to predict tamoxifen treatment benet josene bostner elin karlsson muneeswaran j pandiyan hanna westman lambert skoog tommy fornander bo nordenskjo olle stalabstract  the frequent alterations of the pikaktmtor growth signaling pathway are proposed mechanisms for resistance to endocrine therapy

in addition nuclear pakts as well as per at s andor s showed interaction with tamoxifen efcacy with borderline statistical signicance a combination score of positive pathway markers including pakt pmtor and per showed signicant association with tamoxifen benet test for interaction p   crosstalk between growth signaling pathways and ersignaling has been proposed to affect tamoxifen response in hormone receptorpositive breast cancer the results support this hypothesis as an overactive pathway was signicantly associated with reduced response to tamoxifen a clinical pretreatment test for crosstalk markers would be a step toward individualized adjuvant endocrine treatment with or without the addition of pikaktmtor pathway inhibitors  beelen et al breast cancer research  rpikca mutations phosphatase and tensin homolog human epidermal growth factor receptor  and insulinlike growth factor  receptor and adjuvant tamoxifen resistance in postmenopausal breast cancer patients  karin beelen mark opdam tesa m severson rutger ht koornstra andrew d vincent jelle wesseling jettie j muris els mjj berns jan b vermorken paul j van diest and sabine c linnabstract  introduction inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositolkinaseprotein kinase bmammalian target of rapamycin pikaktmtor pathway can overcome endocrine resistance in estrogen receptor er apositive breast cancer but companion diagnostics indicating pikaktmtor activation and consequently endocrine resistance are lacking pikca mutations frequently occur in erapositive breast cancer and result in pikaktmtor activation in vitro nevertheless the prognostic and treatmentpredictive value of these mutations in erapositive breast cancer is contradictive we tested the clinical validity of pikca mutations and other canonic pathway drivers to predict intrinsic resistance to adjuvant tamoxifen in addition we tested the association between these drivers and downstream activated proteinsmethods primary tumors from  erapositive postmenopausal patients randomized between adjuvant tamoxifen  to  years versus observation were recollected pikca hotspot mutations in exon  and exon  were assessed with sequenom mass spectrometry immunohistochemistry was performed for human epidermal growth factor receptor  her phosphatase and tensin homolog pten and insulinlike growth factor  receptor igfr we tested the association between these molecular alterations and downstream activated proteins like phosphoprotein kinase b pakt phosphomammalian target of rapamycin pmtor perk and ppsk recurrencefree interval improvement with tamoxifen versus control was assessed according to the presence or absence of canonic pathway drivers by using cox proportional hazard models including a test for interactionresults pikca mutations both exon  and exon  were associated with low tumor grade an enrichment of pikca exon  mutations was observed in progesterone receptor positive tumors pikca exon  mutations were not associated with downstreamactivated proteins no significant interaction between pikca mutations or any of the other canonic pathway drivers and tamoxifentreatment benefit was foundconclusion pikca mutations do not have clinical validity to predict intrinsic resistance to adjuvant tamoxifen and may therefore be unsuitable as companion diagnostic for pikaktmtor inhibitors in era positive
