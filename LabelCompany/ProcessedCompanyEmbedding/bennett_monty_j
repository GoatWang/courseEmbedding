trust chairman and ceo monty bennett likes to go out on a limb by  ed watkins edwatkinsgmailcom edwatkins as ceo and chairman of the board of a public company ashford hospitality trust monty j bennett must be deliberate in what he says in public forums but if you read between the lines you can tell he’s someone who likes to take a chance or two he calls it “going against the grain” and he spoke about it during a panel discussion at the recent th annual new york university international hospitality industry investment conference “in the public markets there are only so many things you can do that go against the grain” he said during a panel titled “ceo optimism reigns” “we have an affiliated management company so that goes a little bit against the grain we like to make loans in addition to investing in hotels that’s a little bit against the grain you do three or four of those things and investors say ‘stop’” bennett showed he’s not reluctant to make an againstthegrain move with ashford’s purchase last month of the room pier house resort and caribbean spa in key west florida for  million a whopping  per room according to the company’s news release announcing the deal the purchase represented a trailing months capitalization rate of  during the nyu investment conference session moderator scott d berman principal of pricewaterhousecoopers’ hospitality and leisure practice questioned ashford’s rationale for paying such a price for an independent hotel in one of the least accessible resort destinations in the united states bennett didn’t miss a beat in defending the deal and in fact believes ashford’s affiliated management company remington hotels will be able to add  to the pier house’s bottom line in its first year of operating the hotel remington manages three other hotels in the market and bennett believes profit enhancement is possible through savings in payroll and insurance and additional revenues generated by charging for parking and adding a resort fee but bennett is a real estate professional at heart and that’s what drew him to the deal he referred to rate of growth laws in florida that govern development in the state and the florida keys in particular he said because of its location more than  miles from the mainland key west is subject to limitations on new infrastructure such as water and electricity “the bottom line is you can’t build in key west” he said “you can’t add more hotel rooms so when you’re calculating what it would cost to replace those rooms at the pier house it’s a non number you can’t replace rooms it’s the highest barrier to entry market in the us because you legally cannot build down there” and while he said his investors typically want ashford to own branded properties he has no intention of adding a flag to the pier house he said the hotel averages  occupancy with an average daily rate of more than  so “it’s hard to get a sense of how much a brand can add how much incremental business a brand can add” bennett and ashford again demonstrated a willingness to try new ideas with the announcement monday that it is spinning off its highest revenueperavailableroom hotels into a new real estate investment trust to be called ashford hospitality prime initially eight top revpar properties owned by ashford hospitality trust will be part of the new reit it will have the option to buy the pier house and plans to acquire upscale upperupscale and luxury hotels in gateway cities that generate revpars of at least  bennett wasn’t through trying to poke holes in conventional hotel industry wisdom later in the panel discussion at the nyu conference he talked about changes he would like to see in the embassy suites brand ashford’s portfolio of  properties includes  embassy suites he said he’s been pushing the brand for  years to eliminate free breakfast except on weekends his rationale during the week embassy attracts mostly corporate travelers who are willing to pay for breakfast or grab something on the way out the door so why give it away for free he would keep free breakfasts on weekends because it’s a valued amenity for leisure guests correction in the original story berman

been closed you are welcome to comment out errors and help us improve it submitted by members on thu    archie bennett jr is a seasoned veteran of the hotel development finance and management business having made his mark in the hotel business with companies based in texas he is now a semiretired multimillionaire residing in ireland archie recently passed the baton to his son monty who now manages the bennettowned and operated companies like many of the entrepreneurs profiled in this book archie has experienced his fair share of ups and downs during his business career as he gained experience however he grew astute at predicting real estate cycles and taking advantage of the economic conditions prevailing at the time his opportunistic style and extraordinary salesmanship have earned him considerable wealth over the years archie got his first break while attending the university of houston during the s his fishing companion the late houston oil and real estate tycoon re bob smith took a liking to archie and helped him start his own business following archie’s graduation from the university mr smith introduced archie to a wealthy investor friend of his named james greer who owned a glass company in houston mr greer provided the collateral for archie’s first loan which financed the development of archie’s first hotel the holiday inn—galveston texas with archie as the operating partner and mr greer as the limited financial partner they created a company called mariner corporation that went on to develop own and manage several hotels around the country the partnership however was abruptly liquidated in  when the partners got into a dispute over how the company should be managed as part of the settlement archie was awarded two of the holiday inns he had developed and he continued to manage them under the mariner name taking full advantage of the hotel real estate boom at that time archie was able to develop and acquire a large portfolio of holiday inn hilton and marriott hotels with the capital provided by a large insurance company and several houston highnetworth individuals by leveraging his business experience and the relationships he established during his partnership with mr greer with large amounts of debt and equity capital readily available archie was able to negotiate several sweetheart deals with his insurance company partner and equity investors who were eager to become part of the exciting and expanding hotel industry one of his early multiplehotel development deals required the insurance company to provide  of project cost  debt and  equity award a  carried interest in each hotel to archie and sign a management contract with mariner for  of total revenue to operate the hotels for the partnership the tax reform act of  however brought new hotel development to a screeching halt and created financial problems for those involved in the building frenzy of the late s and early s including archie in  millions of dollars of hotel loans archie had personally guaranteed fell into default he was forced to liquidate the company and file for personal bankruptcy still only fiftyone at the time archie was not about to concede defeat and immediately founded a new company called remington hotels                                        as part of the fallout from the tax reform act the us federal government created the resolution trust corporation rtc to assume ownership of all failed savings and loans and dispose of their underlying collateral much of this collateral consisted of foreclosed hotels which the rtc offered for sale at deeply discounted prices much lower than their replacement cost archie saw this as an opportunity to acquire the hotels for pennies on the dollar with favorable financing provided by the federal government his plan was to acquire the hotels operate them for a few years and then resell them at a much higher price when the economy improved archie convinced several wealthy investors to provide the equity he needed for these transactions and he was off to the races once again by the early s remington hotels was the largest owner of rtc hotel assets at its peak archie’s company owned a portfolio of  hotels by the late s after the hotel industry had recovered remington sold most of its portfolio at a substantial profit once again archie’s knack for timing paid off handsomely                                       today as noted earlier archie’s son monty is in charge of the business although archie still has a financial stake in the company monty joined remington after graduating from the school of hotel administration at cornell university with a degree in hotel administration and an mba after rotating through various executive positions at remington he became his father’s personal assistant and learned how to make deals read the market and seize opportunities as they arose his first opportunity to increase the family’s wealth came in  following the  disaster and the resulting downturn in the us hotel business ‘‘values fell sharply and we started considering how we were going to position ourselves for the likely future upswing in hotel values’’ the answer was to create a real estate investment trust reit in  monty created ashford hospitality trust to acquire undervalued hotel assets ashford was the only hotel company to go public in  raising approximately  million in a blind equity pool a blind pool differs from the more traditional equity fund in that the manager of the pool—in this case remington—can invest funds without the approval of the equity investors monty further expanded the fund by contributing eight of remington’s solely owned hotel assets to ashford thereby increasing its war chest to  million ashford’s first acquisition was a  million twentyonehotel portfolio owned by fisher partners the gordon getty trust and george soros by september  the trust owned  billion of assets comprising seventyseven hotels and  million in mezzanine loans                    monty’s strategy for the near future is to continue to buy hotels at the right price and sell hotels that have achieved their stabilized value he believes in hospitality it’s important to not only buy right but also to sell right    since  growth in hotel demand has been almost nonexistent which has contributed to very little growth in hotel supply in  however while new supply grew by a meager  growth in hotel room demand was  that’s a huge gap that will drive hotel values upward                               archie taught monty to be flexible and to develop multiple business strategies in order to fully capitalize on changing market conditions applying this strategy to ashford the trust has deliberately diversified across capital structure geography and asset types it has access to both the public market and private investors and lenders it owns hotels in twenty states in both primary and secondary markets ashford is also a mortgage and mezzanine lender                           on the subject of his company’s future growth strategy monty recently commented ‘‘within the next twelve to eighteen months we’ll shift and buy fewer properties and focus on developing and cranking up our firstmortgage and mezzanine lending business that’s how we’re going to continue to grow’’ the fatherandson team’s track record for predicting business cycles has been excellent most of the time will it be correct this time as well only time will tell categories finance  accounting recommend up users have
